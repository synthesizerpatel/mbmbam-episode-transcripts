1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Hello, welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Chaboy.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:00,640
Um, I'm Griffin, I'm Griffin the youngest brother of Travis- okay, Chaboy.

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,040
Thank you.

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,960
I don't understand, can you walk me through this forest that I all of a sudden find myself?

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
Here's the thing, Griffin.

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Okay.

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,560
You know, I'm working on this whole, you know, working on a new me for 30, you know?

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:14,960
Yeah.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
And I decided to reinvent myself as a hip-hop personality.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:19,760
Okay.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,040
You know, I'm not going to say like a hip-hop like music star or anything,

17
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
because I have like zero musical talent,

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280
but I just want to be like that dude who danced with the Umbrella in the Andre 3000 videos.

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,240
And kids love- kids love that motherfucker.

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
They love that Farnsworth bastard.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,400
Now, can you walk me through kind of a- I find myself in kind of a spelling quandary.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,680
Can you walk me through-

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah. Thank you, Justin. It's C-H apostrophe A apostrophe B-O-I.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,400
Okay.

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Chaboy from the context, it's ya boy.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,840
Now, at first blush, you might think it's cha-ah boy,

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,480
but it's really just one fluid motion, like throwing a baseball.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,040
Chaboy.

30
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,440
There might be an umlaut in there too.

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
I haven't decided yet.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
I've got a marketing team working on it.

34
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Umlauts are really big right now.

35
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,240
Kids fucking love umlauts and they love people dancing with umbrellas.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Fucking love people dancing with umlauts.

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
That'd be a great-

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,440
That'd be a great Paula Abdul video.

39
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Just her dancing with an umlaut.

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,040
Yeah. Or a cartoon cat.

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
Hey, happy Franksgiving, y'all.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,520
I-

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Hey, happy Thanksgiving to you, Chaboy.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,600
Griffin, it sounded like you said Franksgiving.

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
It did sound like you said Franksgiving.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,280
Listen, I've been working with my own marketing team-

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Was that intentional?

48
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
I've been working with my own marketing team about how to sex-

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,600
Are you gonna eat a bunch of hot dogs tomorrow?

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,240
How to sex up Thanksgiving.

51
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,640
And I think I've come up with the perfect solution.

52
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,040
Tell me.

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,360
We reinvented it as a hip hop personality called Franksgiving.

54
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,680
Okay, let me throw this out because this is my topical humor joke that I alluded to before

55
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,440
we began the recording.

56
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
Oh good, I've been on Bins and Needles.

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,600
Ahem.

58
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,880
With Colorado legalizing marijuana.

59
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,320
More like Danksgiving.

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,640
Okay.

61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,600
All right.

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,400
I like it.

63
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Thank you.

64
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,200
So-

65
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,920
I like it.

66
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,960
I like it.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,080
With what's going on at TNM and Square, more like Tankgiving.

68
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Is that still-

69
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,680
That is not.

70
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,280
I don't think that's still an issue.

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,880
Now here is my hip hop joke personality that I have.

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,680
None of these are jokes so far, but go on.

73
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,120
It's-

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
You didn't have a follow through for that, did you?

76
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,240
It's-

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,400
It's Shitty Tim.

78
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,720
Oh man.

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,200
Pardon?

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,200
It's a character that I made up called-

81
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay.

82
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,080
His name is Shitty Tim.

83
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
Does he have any distinguishing characteristics at all?

84
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,880
He's named Shitty Tim and he has-

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
Is it ironic at all?

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,880
Like is he in fact really awesome and named Steve?

87
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,080
He has a really-

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
Yeah, I'm not good with this like you guys.

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,320
He has a really big butt.

90
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Is that funny?

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,720
But not where you'd picture it.

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm 32.

93
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,880
Is there an outside chance that he stinks?

94
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,380
Yeah.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,500
What?

96
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,160
Why would he-

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,760
Like shit.

98
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,260
Why would-

99
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,560
I didn't mean-

100
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,280
Let's just answer a question.

101
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
I'll do it in the Shitty Tim.

102
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,060
Okay.

103
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,840
I'll do it in the Shitty Tim voice that I've been making up lately.

104
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,400
About a month ago, I responded to a woman's Craigslist ad looking for a virgin man,

105
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,000
i.e. 18 and older, to have sex with.

106
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
That's done.

107
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Done.

108
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
Check please.

109
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,720
Bye.

110
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm not a virgin, but it's been about three and a half years since the last time I had sex,

111
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
so I responded to the ad anyway.

112
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,880
Anyway, she came over to my house a couple days after that, and we hooked up.

113
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,520
Now, here's my problem.

114
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,560
We've been out about three times after this, and I'm starting to develop real feelings for her.

115
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,720
I know that it won't work if it's built on a lie, but she has a wonderful personality

116
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,600
and could see myself in a long-term relationship with her.

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,920
What do I do?

118
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,560
Oh man.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,040
Okay.

120
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,840
There's a lot.

121
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,600
Some layers.

122
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,400
There's a lot of moving parts in this Rue Goldberg machine.

123
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,320
I'd like to start with the top layer, which is yes.

124
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,200
Yes, you should tell her.

125
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,160
If you want to build a relationship with this woman, you should tell her because you're right.

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Your instincts are right.

127
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes.

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,280
And you may, I mean, it may be irreparable.

129
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
That's a pretty big thing.

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,720
That's kind of the biggest.

131
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,640
But it's better for it to be, if it's irreparable, it's better to get it out now than like nine

132
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,560
months from now, I don't know, some friend telling a story about this wild night in college

133
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,320
or something, and then she finds out, and it's like, well, we've been living a lie for nine

134
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
months as opposed to three days.

135
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,080
Right.

136
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,440
You don't want to end up like this one guy I know and have to pretend to really like

137
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,760
Barbara Streisand movies for three years because that was the way you got the relationship going.

138
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,080
What you also don't want to happen is to get your whole head cut off and buried in her

139
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
fucking yard.

140
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you dating a praying mantis?

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,480
What?

142
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,480
This is a good question because now let's go to a deeper layer.

143
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,040
Okay, which is every sentence in this email is the craziest thing I've ever.

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,400
She wants a virgin man, i.e. 18 years or older.

145
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,240
Yeah, I should fucking definitely hope so.

146
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,680
So she's like Foley Gozer, right?

147
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,440
I mean, she's Gozer, basically, just so we're clear.

148
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,320
She's looking for the key master to her gatekeeper.

149
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,560
Right.

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,160
Let's also talk about the fact that she wanted to fuck a sweet, sweet, innocent porcelain

151
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,880
doll of a fresh faced boy, and you were not a virgin.

152
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,480
You had dipped it before.

153
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,160
But that's what she was saying.

154
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,760
Like, if you met up and immediately had sex, she just wanted to deflower a dude, right?

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,880
These are all good and important and awful questions.

156
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,160
But then to say, okay, listen, question asker, I'm not trying to judge.

157
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,440
But to say that her whole deal was to look for a dude to deflower off the internet,

158
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,600
and now you're developing real feelings for her.

159
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,400
It's like, man, maybe you need to really examine the second half of the sentence I just said.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,040
Because I don't think that she, I mean, that doesn't sound like what she wants.

161
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Yeah, it doesn't sound like she's really looking to settle down.

162
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,560
If so, she'd be on match.com instead of skeevy craigslist.

163
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,960
Yeah, I think she's just going back to make sure you're like super deflowered.

164
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,160
Like, she's trying to make sure she got every last petal off of you.

165
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,920
Like, what about your anal virginity?

166
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,880
I'll take that next.

167
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,240
I want to get all of it.

168
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,760
Ass to mouth.

169
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,720
Here we go.

170
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
What's up with your knee pits?

171
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,280
Haven't seen those yet.

172
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,560
Gonna fuck those.

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,280
Lube them up.

174
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
Put that weird monkey toe in me.

175
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,120
Come on, come on, shitty Tim.

176
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,400
Put that little toe in me.

177
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,360
I want to fuck all your toes one by one.

178
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,600
Stock up on calcium.

179
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,800
This is cramp-inducing.

180
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,200
All of this is thoroughly erotic.

181
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,200
But you need to keep your heart three stacks because this, I don't know about this.

182
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,440
I don't know that she's looking for this.

183
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,040
I bet if he didn't listen to the whole craigslist, he's 18 and older.

184
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,800
I bet it's a little more like 18 to 19 is how the ad read.

185
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,280
I don't want anybody, I don't want a bunch of old meat.

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,880
She wants a fresh plate.

187
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,720
If you can actually come to me the night before your 18th birthday,

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,800
and then we can bring it in in style this second.

189
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,640
Please don't tell any loved ones where you've gone or somewhere where they can track you.

190
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
That would be great.

191
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, this is going to be, basically what we want is a 128 hours setup.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,400
I need to resurrect my fallen lord.

193
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,080
How much blood do you have in you?

194
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,280
Let's be like totally honest that if you responded to a craigslist from someone looking to

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,880
consume an 18 year old virgin, maybe instead of developing feelings,

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,000
you should be busy counting your lucky stars that you have a head attached to your body.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,160
And then all your blood is not staining a motel six right now.

198
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,160
From the 80s where he goes and they go to collect his blood and they're like,

199
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,520
but it's not working.

200
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,720
Are you really a virgin?

201
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
He's like, well, it's been three and a half years.

202
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,600
Musical sting.

203
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,360
I can't believe this fucking panned out for this dude.

204
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,680
I know.

205
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,880
I can't believe that you went on craigslist and craigslist was like,

206
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,040
hey, I want to fuck you, shitty Tim.

207
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,480
And then he was like, okay.

208
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,040
And then he fucked craigslist and now he's alive.

209
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,840
Like none of the, maybe three of those things could happen, but not all.

210
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,560
It's got to balance out until like three years from now,

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
like an asteroid falls on him or something.

212
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,120
Just as like, it's like final destination.

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,600
You know, death missed him and now they'll be hunting him for the rest of his life.

214
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,280
I sold my bed on craigslist.

215
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,200
I was selling it for $200.

216
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
Just when we showed up, she was like, oh, nice, nice.

217
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,080
How about a hundred dollars?

218
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,520
So I kind of got fucked by craigslist in a way.

219
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,400
Did that really happen?

220
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,360
Yeah.

221
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,480
Did she give you a hundo?

222
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,720
She gave me a hard sell for a hundo.

223
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,480
She was just coming out of a divorce.

224
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,840
Things were not doing great.

225
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,440
And she was sitting on my bed and I was extraordinarily uncomfortable.

226
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,160
She's sitting on your bed.

227
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,200
She's like, hey, this, this got a good spring to it.

228
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
What's your virginity sitch right now?

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,840
Where are you at as far as your flower?

230
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,040
Where's the flower at?

231
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
Griffin, do you have a yahoos for us?

232
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,760
I got a few.

233
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,080
Yeah.

234
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,560
How about this one?

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:15,960
It was, uh, it was sent in by Robert Chachere or Chachere or Chachere or Chachere.

236
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,720
It's, it's fun to look at and to say it's asked by Yahoo Answers user, I Corpse Grinder.

237
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,600
Oh God.

238
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,280
Who asks, what happens if you give a horse marijuana?

239
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,280
Some friends of my brothers gave a horse an ounce of marijuana.

240
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,600
And now the horse is just laying on the floor.

241
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,440
Could the marijuana kill the horse?

242
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm seriously concerned.

243
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,360
He hasn't gotten up in a while, but I know he's alive.

244
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,200
Well, one, what happens is you've wasted a bunch of sticky weed.

245
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh no.

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,520
But I'm assuming this question takes place in Colorado.

247
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,240
Oh, okay.

248
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,880
Where it's just like falling out of people's pockets.

249
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
It's just falling out of people's pockets and butts.

250
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Is it an accidental thing?

251
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Because I knew a dog in college that ate a bag of weed.

252
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,680
It's just a chill dog.

253
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,000
Or is this like, they like roll the carrot and some honey and then dipped it in the weed

254
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
and toss it to the horse.

255
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,200
This death, death sounds like funsies.

256
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,920
Okay.

257
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,760
This sounds like, honestly, like when you think of any time that a horse riding disaster

258
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,240
takes place, it's usually because the horse gets so fucking crazy wild.

259
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,120
When that horse bucked Christopher Reeves over that fence and basically, you know,

260
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,760
paralyzed him forever, it was probably because he was like going fucking buck wild

261
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,440
because he had a man riding on him.

262
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:34,760
Right.

263
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,640
Not just any man.

264
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,280
If he had just rolled him a sweet joint.

265
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,400
I think if we can, I think if we can mellow these horses out,

266
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,080
then we could really get something going.

267
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,120
I, I don't, okay.

268
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,400
How was the marijuana administered to the horse?

269
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,040
Peer pressure.

270
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,120
Come on, black beauty.

271
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,320
Just dip in.

272
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,760
Come on, Mr. Ed.

273
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,800
Don't be a pussy.

274
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,240
Don't be a pussy, black beauty.

275
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
With your powerful haunches.

276
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,800
Bring those powerful haunches over here and use them to smoke this herb.

277
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't imagine fucking, they give, they have, they had to design.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,040
They had to create something called horse tranquilizer.

279
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,240
Like it's specially designed because a horse was so powerful

280
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,480
that a normal tranquilizer couldn't take it out.

281
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,200
And you think that like an ounce of weed and the horse is just like,

282
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,720
I'm never getting up again.

283
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,280
I'm done.

284
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,680
Maybe I read this question wrong.

285
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,520
Maybe it's asking about horse marijuana.

286
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,240
Oh.

287
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,440
What happens if you give a horse marijuana?

288
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Oh, now it's okay.

289
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
See, that makes a lot more sense.

290
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,280
What does it, why are we using our,

291
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,840
who are these teens?

292
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,320
Right?

293
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,520
Who are these teens that, do you know where I buy drugs?

294
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,040
Rite Aid.

295
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,480
I have no idea where to get drugs.

296
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,200
I don't know how to get, people, I say this on the show.

297
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,680
You actually just go behind the Rite Aid and there's a guy there.

298
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,800
There probably is a guy.

299
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
There's a place called Wrong Aid.

300
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,840
I don't know where to get, like,

301
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,640
I don't know where to find drugs.

302
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,160
And these kids have such a solid supply of them

303
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,760
that they're giving them to horses.

304
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:21,960
Yeah.

305
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720
It makes me so angry.

306
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,720
I mean, how do you think they do in like Denver?

307
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,040
This is what this, like in Denver, no joke.

308
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,640
I bet everybody has just pockets fattened with that dank fish.

309
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,920
I give it six months before horse weeding is like a professional sport in Denver.

310
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,320
Mm-hmm, it's how high can you get a living horse?

311
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Now that caveat is so vital.

312
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,640
Because anybody can just like feed a horse a bunch of weed.

313
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,880
I want you guys to know I almost said horse stoning,

314
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,320
but then I thought that that might sound like throwing rocks at horses.

315
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
If this show is devoted to anything,

316
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,840
it's the protection and preservation and not killing of horses.

317
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,840
It's been like Jonathan Swift level of like irony up to this point.

318
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,880
You know, we talk about killing horses because we don't want to kill horses.

319
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,440
Yeah, but the New York Times told me that the irony is bad

320
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
and that we should live without it from now on.

321
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,400
So I'm going to say that I think horses are just beautiful and majestic.

322
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,280
Yeah, me too.

323
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,400
Did I use the right word there?

324
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
Did Jonathan Swift write with irony?

325
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,520
No, it's a little satire, but you're almost there.

326
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,000
You know, if I see someone using glue,

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,880
I look at them like they're Kony 2012.

328
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,800
Like I have no patience for it.

329
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
Can we stop melting them?

330
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,240
I look at them like they're Kony 2013,

331
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,640
which is a sequel.

332
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,600
What if you made a horse sniff glue to get high?

333
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,320
Wait a minute.

334
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh my God.

335
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,840
That's terrible, Travis.

336
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,120
Sniff your brother.

337
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,440
That's not going to be a mellow high.

338
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
That is going to be a rough.

339
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,840
That's going to be a rough journey that you're going to go on.

340
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,120
Hey, I just broke up with my boyfriend at 12 years today.

341
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,720
Naturally, I'm pretty devastated.

342
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,280
This isn't me.

343
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,160
It's a question.

344
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,560
Oh, okay.

345
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,040
Naturally, I'm pretty devastated.

346
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,960
It has been over 12 years since I've been dumped.

347
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,880
I have no idea what to do right now,

348
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,120
aside from some really heavy drinking.

349
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,560
All our close friends are mutual,

350
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,920
so I don't have anyone I can feel I can entirely discuss the subject with

351
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
without it turning to idle gossip.

352
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,400
Brothers, can you put this in perspective?

353
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,000
Find me a silver lining because I just cannot find one.

354
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,400
And help me figure out how to feel not so toxic towards my ex-boyfriend.

355
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,080
If the subject matter is too depressing,

356
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,680
I have no problems with you turning this into a hilarious goof

357
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,840
that's from Gutted in Toronto.

358
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,880
Oh, listen, because I've been doing a lot of soul searching

359
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,160
over the last two or three weeks.

360
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,000
And here's the main point.

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,320
The biggest point to take away is that what's the silver lining?

362
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,640
It's that you're still alive with a bright future

363
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,080
and a whole new world in front of you.

364
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,080
Like, I mean, it seems bad in 12 years.

365
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,600
Yeah, like it's a massive scale,

366
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,720
but you still have so much time left in this world.

367
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,800
Like you still have your whole life to live.

368
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,320
Got it in Toronto any day above the grass, baby.

369
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,000
Any day above the grass.

370
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
Quarter mile at a time.

371
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
Quarter mile at a time.

372
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,320
Got to play to the whistle blows.

373
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Here, let me give you a silver lining.

374
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,480
Right now, I, in my life, stress about work.

375
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,080
I stress about the show I'm directing.

376
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,200
I stress about how I, more morally,

377
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,360
I stress about how I'm eating too much,

378
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,400
how I need to exercise more, how I need to get healthier,

379
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,280
how I need to have better relationships with people.

380
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,840
You have that so, that rare, rare gift

381
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,200
that only comes around

382
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,840
when something really terrible happens to you

383
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,040
that you don't have to give a solitary fuck about anything.

384
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,600
Oh yeah.

385
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,200
You can just treat, have you ever always wanted

386
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,120
to have a Pop-Tart with butter on it?

387
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,240
Fucking have it.

388
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,920
You're healing right now.

389
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,520
Take, get a big, get a big bite of that recovery sandwich

390
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,280
and by recovery sandwich, I literally mean a giant sandwich,

391
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,160
like a meatball sub.

392
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,000
The biggest sandwich, whatever the fuck you want.

393
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,640
Can you make a sandwich out of Pop-Tarts and butter?

394
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:07,880
Oh my God, yeah.

395
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,480
If you want like an ice cream sandwich

396
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,360
that's just like bread and ice cream, go to town.

397
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,440
Well, don't do, that sounds fucking awful.

398
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,960
What about a peanut butter Pop-Tart sandwich?

399
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,360
Go on.

400
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,640
Peanut butter between the two Pop-Tarts.

401
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,040
Why don't you just go to fucking Papa John's

402
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,800
and eat a pizza like a normal person?

403
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,040
Okay.

404
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,280
You guys are talking about weird sandwiches first.

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,880
Listen, and don't, and I know that you're worried

406
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,200
about harboring a lot of resentment and bitterness

407
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,640
towards your ex-boyfriend, but let me tell you something.

408
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,600
That's, that's how adults work.

409
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,720
That's completely right.

410
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,560
Listen, when, when a big event happens,

411
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,840
you're going to go one of two ways,

412
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,920
really happy or really upset.

413
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Like children have hope about the future to fuel them.

414
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,320
Adults have bitterness.

415
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,360
Let your hatred toward him be an engine

416
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,080
that helps you to keep moving forward.

417
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,960
You have a renewable resource of, of energy and vigor.

418
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,280
All you have to do is think about how much you hate his guts

419
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,520
and look, oh, you're revitalized.

420
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,560
Thank you, adulthood.

421
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,840
This is way better than kid.

422
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,160
You have nothing to worry about.

423
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,440
Stop beating yourself up.

424
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,400
Stop, stop stressing about needing to feel better

425
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,520
and stop stressing about harboring ill will towards this guy

426
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,200
and focus on the, the important thing right now,

427
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,440
which is taking care of yourself,

428
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,760
making yourself happy in the short term.

429
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,200
You do it enough in the short term

430
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,400
and I promise you the long-term stuff will figure itself out.

431
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,680
Griffin, hit me with a Yahoo.

432
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,240
Put it in me.

433
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,560
Oh, could we stop and just stop?

434
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,920
Put a Yahoo in there.

435
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
How about this Yahoo?

436
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,720
It was, it was sent in by Ira Ray.

437
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,440
Thank you, Ira.

438
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jezebel Terrace who asks,

439
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,320
is it right for a 13-year-old to know how to krump?

440
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,720
If I'm 13, is it okay if I know how to krump?

441
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,280
My mom told me that it's not very Christian-like

442
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,480
or appropriate to do this, but I love to dance.

443
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,920
I also love, love, love dancing to hip-hop

444
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,840
because it lets me get my feelings out.

445
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,280
But my mom says I should stick to sports.

446
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,000
Any advice or comments?

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,800
I need to look up krump dancing to see if that's a thing.

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Travis.

449
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,240
It's like you've never seen a Missy Elliott music video

450
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,560
or that one episode of America's Next Top Model

451
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,840
where they had the ladies krump

452
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,200
and they took pictures of them fucking mid-krump

453
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,320
as their faces were all rubberized in beast mode.

454
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,760
Oh man.

455
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,800
Oh my God, I laughed at that person for saying

456
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,360
that hip-hop dancing is how they get their feelings out.

457
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,600
And the very top line on the krumping entry of Wikipedia

458
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,880
is the youth who started krumping saw the dances away

459
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,040
for them to escape gang life and to quote,

460
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,320
release anger, aggression, and frustration positively

461
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,520
in a non-violent way.

462
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,440
I will say this, every time I've seen someone krump,

463
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
it looks really violent.

464
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,640
It looks like someone has bees on them

465
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,880
and they're trying to kill beetles underneath them.

466
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,080
So they're choosing the bees to kill the beetles

467
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,880
on their body.

468
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,800
Right, they're just trying to kill the beetles

469
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,240
but they're distracted by the bees.

470
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,400
That's what krumping looks like to me.

471
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,920
But I am 32.

472
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,800
Holy shit.

473
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,120
Are you watching some video somewhere?

474
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,800
Are you watching like a sick krumping video

475
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,080
while we're trying to make a podcast?

476
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm looking at the history.

477
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,520
The root word krump came from the lyrics of a song

478
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,080
in the 90s.

479
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,880
It is sometimes spelled K-R-U-M-P with periods between it.

480
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,520
Which is a-

481
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,360
Oh, so is it an acronym?

482
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,040
It says it's a backronym for Kingdom Radically

483
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,720
Uplifted Mighty Praise,

484
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,520
presenting krumping as a faith-based art form.

485
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:58,600
It is, obviously, much like My Brother, My Brother, Me,

486
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,280
it is a faith-based art form.

487
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,440
Krumping was created by two dancers,

488
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,160
Cesar Titeyes Willis and Joe Artis Big Mejo Ratty.

489
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,440
Now Joe Artis has the best name

490
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,080
because it's J-O apostrophe capital A-R-T-I-S.

491
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,680
Now Travis, is that Titeyes or Titeyes?

492
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,560
Great question.

493
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,400
It's Tite space eyes with a Z.

494
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:24,760
Okay.

495
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,880
I don't know how one gets the nickname Titeyes.

496
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,720
Ken, so is this Wikipedia entry telling us that we can use krumping

497
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,880
as a method of praising our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?

498
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,760
I think they're telling you that it's a way to motivate kids

499
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,040
in the school gymnasium.

500
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,480
I think that whatever you're doing,

501
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,720
maybe it's about praising Jesus.

502
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,440
Maybe it's about just being really angry at your dad.

503
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,120
The key thing is to have emotion that you bring to it.

504
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,000
I think it was, I believe it was Robert Foolish with Ph Jones who said,

505
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:05,960
expression is a must in krump because krump is expression.

506
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,080
I don't think I could vent my feelings via krumping in a healthy way.

507
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,040
I think if I ever got into a krump off with somebody,

508
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,680
it would like, it would start out as a very healthy,

509
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,400
you know, just pounding it, pounding it and grinding.

510
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,480
And then like, it would very quickly turn into me like,

511
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,560
good fucking get it, come get it.

512
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,040
And then people would be like, hey, stop, cut that out.

513
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,200
Might I suggest clowning, which is the less aggressive predecessor to krumping

514
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,520
and was created in 1992 by Thomas, Tommy the Clown Johnson in Compton.

515
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,640
That is actually the, it's funny you bring that up.

516
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,760
That is the subject of the episode of America's Next Top Model,

517
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,920
of which I learned everything and that there is to know about krumping and clowning.

518
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,280
You know what sucks about krumping though, if you're really good at it,

519
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,160
like it has less practical applications than like the Foxtrot.

520
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,480
Like you can't bust that shit out at a wedding, you know?

521
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,360
You can use it to dodge bullets.

522
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,520
I'd rather watch that.

523
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,440
You can use it to matrix.

524
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,800
I would rather watch someone swing dance than krump at a wedding.

525
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,360
I have a theory that sometimes when you do a krump,

526
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,400
it's the krump that you'll need to use to save yourself from a hail of bullets.

527
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,640
And every krump move that you krump is specifically designed

528
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,720
to help you avoid those bullets when you eventually are shot at.

529
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,080
So it's like signs.

530
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,280
Well, it's basically, I was thinking Slumdog Millionaire,

531
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,720
but yeah, signs would work too.

532
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,800
I bet like if someone from the past were to like be launch forward in time

533
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,160
and see someone krumping, they'd be like,

534
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,560
that's the mythical dance to defeat the dragon.

535
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,000
Like it always seems like it has some kind of mystical significance to it.

536
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,560
Yeah, I've always seen somebody krumping and said that seems significant.

537
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,600
This means something.

538
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,720
Is krumping inherently solo or can you krump with a partner?

539
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,400
There's so much flailing involved.

540
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,560
I think if you get more than one hot body in there,

541
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
then it's gonna, things are gonna get dirty.

542
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,600
Things are gonna get rough.

543
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,040
I think you gotta have six feet between krumpers.

544
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,680
That's why krumping across America never got off the ground

545
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,200
because they would keep punching each other.

546
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,480
Gotta leave room for the holy krump.

547
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,320
Because Jesus is in there krumping too, you guys.

548
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,160
Do you think when mankind krumps, God looks down on us and says, yes.

549
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,040
This is the pinnacles of civilization.

550
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,320
They found it.

551
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,080
My creation, thank you.

552
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,520
It's all led to this.

553
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,960
God is watching us krump from a distance.

554
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Oh, man.

555
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,200
Everybody stop doing wars.

556
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,880
These guys over here figured it out.

557
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,360
Everyone listen, I'm God.

558
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,800
In case you were wondering why krump is apparently the best dance I've ever heard of,

559
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,080
it is this, the first line of the Wikipedia entry for style.

560
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,200
There are four primary moves in krump.

561
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,080
Jabs, arm swings, chest pops, and stomps.

562
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,320
That sounds like the best dance.

563
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,200
That sounds like something I could get on board with.

564
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,600
You remember the boneless boy dance?

565
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,200
That's more or less krump at this point.

566
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,000
So we hope that you've enjoyed learning about krump

567
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,520
as much as we've enjoyed learning about krump as we record our show.

568
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,640
But believe it or not, we get paid to do this.

569
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,840
This is Money Zone.

570
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,520
Griffin, who's this message to?

571
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,520
This particular message?

572
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,280
This shit right here?

573
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Yeah, it's popping off right now and we've got to deliver it hot.

574
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,920
You mean this message that you're talking about now?

575
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:00,040
Yes, this current message, the one that you're fervently looking up in your email.

576
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,240
Man, did you guys see that latest episode of Saturday Night Live?

577
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,920
This episode was sent in by Annie.

578
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,280
Thank you, Annie, for sending in this special birthday message for Catherine.

579
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,480
Happy birthday, Catherine.

580
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,400
Annie says happy birthday.

581
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,000
And then she says that the Dilbert Scott Adams goof

582
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,400
is Catherine's favorite goof that we or assumedly anybody has ever done.

583
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,440
And so if Justin could work it in somehow, that would be great.

584
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,160
Justin?

585
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,840
Could you lay down some Dilbert goofs?

586
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,840
Can you guys remind me what the Scott Adams goof is?

587
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Dilbert's tight as fuck, though, because he's got a boner.

588
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,680
I think it was that just Scott Adams just hates women so much

589
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,800
and he just doesn't know what to do.

590
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,080
Here we go.

591
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,960
Scott Adams hates women so much, he doesn't know what to do with that hate.

592
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,160
So instead he turns to krumping to get his misogyny out.

593
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,960
Go. Ah, my pen's almost dry, running out of ink.

594
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,320
I can't believe my bitch of a wife forgot to buy more ink at the ink store.

595
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,000
Ah, my pen's drying up.

596
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,560
I hate her.

597
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,280
I can't draw.

598
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,480
Flip the thighs.

599
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,560
Somebody give me- Ah, there we go.

600
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,760
Ah, I gotta get this energy out somehow.

601
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,880
I gotta shake it.

602
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,560
Ah, I got ink all over me.

603
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,680
There's ink all over the room.

604
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,600
Why am I still holding the ink container?

605
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
Ah, I'm gonna eat my pen.

606
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,960
I wanna hold it between my teeth as I practice my chest pops.

607
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,440
That's it.

608
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,800
My chest pops are good enough I'm just doing chest pops the rest of the day.

609
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,520
Hey, you bitch, get in here and watch me.

610
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,960
Watch me crump, you whore.

611
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,120
I gotta get this to my editor.

612
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm tired all day long.

613
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,400
Scott Adams.

614
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,040
Thank you.

615
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,440
Happy birthday, I guess.

616
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,920
We got another message for Deborah.

617
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,000
This one's from Andrea and Mike.

618
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
Travis, what are we talking about?

619
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,200
What's going on for Deborah?

620
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,240
Well, Andrea and Mike want to congratulate Deborah on her new grown-up job as a reporter.

621
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,920
She's a rad friend, a brilliant journalist, and a huge My Brother My Brother Me fan,

622
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,400
and North Battleford's answer to April O'Neil.

623
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,400
They wish that she lived closer so they could celebrate properly,

624
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,880
but the consolation is that they now have a professional to investigate their gruesome

625
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,720
murders and or sex scandals should they occur.

626
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,960
So that is that it's so important to pre-select the investigative reporter

627
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,320
that will become obsessed with hunting you across this great land of ours.

628
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,880
What happens if they if they overturn a gruesome sex scandal?

629
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,280
Oh no.

630
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,560
What if things get real sloppy in North Battleford?

631
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,520
If you'd like to, ugh, ugh.

632
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:40,920
What's wrong?

633
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:45,240
Grossed. I'm fully grossed now, but congratulations to you, Deborah.

634
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:52,440
You've worked hard for this, and we hope that someday you get to tell our story, but just not.

635
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,800
If we sex murder each other.

636
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,560
If we sex murder each other.

637
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,600
If you'd like to have us deliver a special message to somebody you care about,

638
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,320
go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron and we'll get that all sorted out for you.

639
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,760
Jesse Thorne here, proprietor of MaximumFun.org.

640
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,360
Look, we had a great time in the Poconos and everything, but there's no way we are forgetting

641
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:18,600
about our annual trip to Lake Arrowhead here in Southern California.

642
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,480
So unless the world ends first by Mayan prophecy, Max Fun Con West will be held May 31st through

643
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,720
June 2nd, 2013.

644
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,640
Join us for a showcase of elite stand up comedy performers in the world,

645
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,640
join us for a showcase of elite stand up comedy performers in the woods,

646
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,680
plus informative classes and talks from some of the best creative minds in the nation.

647
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,360
If you've been to Max Fun Con before, get ready to reunite with your old friends.

648
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,440
And if you're a first timer, get ready to make a whole ton of new ones.

649
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,280
Registration will open up on Black Friday, November 23rd, the day after Thanksgiving

650
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,360
at MaxFunCon.com.

651
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,840
It's basically the greatest holiday present anyone could ever get.

652
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,760
Act fast, Max Fun Con pretty much always sells out and we don't expect this year to be any different.

653
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:26,840
So Black Friday at MaxFunCon.com.

654
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,400
Hey guys, I currently rent a small house within a bigger suburban neighborhood and I've been

655
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,160
renting for some time.

656
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:40,440
It's a great place, but in front of it is this big pecan tree right over my driveway.

657
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,120
This morning, guys, this is a long question, but please stick with me.

658
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,440
This morning I saw a little bit older Chinese woman walking around down the street.

659
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,880
Turns out she was stealing my nuts from my yard.

660
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,600
When I confronted her about what she was doing, she simply sort of giggled and sort of motioned

661
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,080
the bag towards me.

662
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,280
This went on for a minute or two, me asking what she was doing and us obviously not communicating

663
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,920
that she was bagging my nuts and it was weird.

664
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,840
Brothers, did I do the right thing to confront me?

665
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,720
She obviously wasn't an English-speaking woman, but she was stealing stuff from my yard.

666
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
Would it be different if it was a lemon or apple tree or is it the same level of sin

667
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,120
if it was a bunch of kids that didn't know better and that's from Nutty in Houston.

668
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,880
I'm so confused.

669
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:37,580
So basically, is the fruit from a tree that falls into your yard, is it fair game for

670
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,760
people to just snatch up and get the vitamins?

671
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,560
From what I've always understood is if it grows in your yard and has juice in it, then

672
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:52,000
it is your property.

673
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,600
If there's juice, let it be.

674
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,000
I couldn't make that round, I guess.

675
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,280
But nuts, I think, are pretty much fair game because nuts are pretty much like leaves,

676
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,280
you know?

677
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,880
They're just like a part of the tree and it's weird that we eat them in the first place.

678
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,280
Yeah, because where you draw the line, like some kids coming and throwing acorns at each

679
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,240
other and you're like, hey, those are my acorns.

680
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,760
That said, pecan halves at my local H-E-B are like $9 for a half pound bag, so she is

681
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,800
basically taking money from you.

682
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Yes.

683
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
That's your money.

684
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,760
You probably water that pecan tree from a sapling, so you could have these pecans, so

685
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,600
you can have the protein and unsaturated fats, so you could keep yourself from getting gallstones.

686
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,120
No, it doesn't matter.

687
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,240
But here's my question, you guys.

688
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,320
Why isn't he out there collecting the nuts himself?

689
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
That is a great question.

690
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Well, maybe he's busy.

691
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,080
Well, then he doesn't get to complain about someone else taking the nuts when they're

692
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
sitting on the ground just rotting.

693
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,320
Now she's like scaled your tree and picking them from the tree.

694
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
That's bullshit.

695
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320
Okay.

696
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,040
But if you start washing your car, but then you go inside because Earth Girls Are Easy

697
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,480
is on on TBS, nobody can fucking come steal your car.

698
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,720
It's not different.

699
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,560
Your car isn't scattered around your yard.

700
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,720
And yes, someone would steal your car if it was scattered around your yard.

701
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
In pieces, you mean?

702
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Sure.

703
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,680
Somebody like finds a rear view mirror and just takes it?

704
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,160
I mean, if you want to get specific, yes.

705
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,180
This irks me because I think it does definitely, definitely matter that it's an older Chinese

706
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,480
woman that's doing it because if it was like if it was a bunch of kids, you could just

707
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
shout them out.

708
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,480
You could shout them off your yard.

709
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
Get off my yard.

710
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Those are my pecans.

711
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
You little shits.

712
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:43,500
But you can't do that to somebody who's older than you.

713
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,600
That's true.

714
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,640
And someone who's another nationality for me.

715
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,480
You can't do it to somebody who's more Chinese than you are.

716
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,320
If someone is more Chinese than me or any nationality, more Asian, more Italian, and

717
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,480
older than me, I assume that if I cross them, they will put a curse on me.

718
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Maybe an Italian curse.

719
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Just until you die.

720
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Holy shit.

721
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
Yeah.

722
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I don't want to-

723
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
That's not great.

724
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,020
No, is that not worth like-

725
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,200
Saying out loud on the internet?

726
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
What?

727
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,480
That I'm afraid anyone who's not white is going to put a curse on me?

728
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,160
I don't think that's so wrong.

729
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,160
I think that's a pretty common assumption.

730
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,480
I'm just afraid he's going to sip his army of Mogwai on me and I'll let him get the nuts.

731
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:36,040
I can't help it that I was raised in an era of cinema in which old Chinese men, all they

732
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:43,200
did was sell you kindly things that would turn into monsters, and all the Indian men

733
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,000
were actually Fisher Stevens in brownface.

734
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,400
This was the age.

735
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,560
This was the era of cinema that I can't-

736
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,320
This puzzle box looks like a lot of fun.

737
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,640
Oh, it's a portal to a sex pain dimension?

738
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Thanks.

739
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Thank you.

740
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,680
I wanted to get my flesh ripped with hooks.

741
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,000
This is fun.

742
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,840
I can't help it that I also think that all old people should climb into cocoons and they'll

743
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,760
be rejuvenated.

744
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,520
That's my era.

745
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
That's my baggage.

746
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
That's my load to carry.

747
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,800
I was on a walk with my Jeef the other day and we came across some pecan trees in a park

748
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,680
and there was just pecans laying on the ground and this is the first time I've ever done

749
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
anything like this.

750
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
I don't know why.

751
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,000
Maybe I was trying to impress her, but I just picked one up off the ground and shucked it

752
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,880
and I ate the sweet nuts inside, just off the ground.

753
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,200
What the fuck you'll give him?

754
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,360
How did you identify a pecan from sight?

755
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,840
Because one was already cracked and I could see the wrinkled nut inside and normal nuts

756
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,840
aren't wrinkled.

757
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
You know that's a pecan.

758
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,480
And so I just ate it and it tasted like a pecan and then I knew I was in the clear.

759
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,600
Jesus Christ, Griffin.

760
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,160
I went on a yum voyage.

761
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
I would suggest everybody do it.

762
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,800
Yeah, because you were probably tripping on deadly nightshade or something.

763
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:11,640
Also, there was an old woman who was wondering on picking them up, so I figured it was probably

764
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
safer.

765
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,960
Oh, well, I mean that's fine.

766
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,160
If her old ass constitution can handle what those nuts are going to do when they ravage

767
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,920
her body, I imagine that I probably could too.

768
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,040
Yeah, there's no doubt about that.

769
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:29,880
Hey, can we do a Yahoo that you want to drop on us because I got another question if not.

770
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
Yeah, sure.

771
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,680
This one was sent in by Andrew Kaplan.

772
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,680
Thank you, Andrew.

773
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,140
It's by Yahoo Answers user, The Maverick, who asks, question on old man strength.

774
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,800
Is there a science behind this?

775
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,840
You know, those old guys between the ages of 40 and 50 who look weak, but when you wrestle

776
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,720
them or box them, it feels like you're going against an animal.

777
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,400
They may not be able to bench press or squat a whole lot, but they are still incredibly

778
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:00,560
powerful.

779
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,840
How often is this coming up in this gentleman's life?

780
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:12,680
Why is this such an issue for you that you have to ask Yahoo about, you keep trying to,

781
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,680
is this like a, I don't think that this guy just fights people.

782
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,040
I think he just fights old men.

783
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,520
He's like, I can get this one.

784
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,160
Oh yeah, I got this guy.

785
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,520
Guys, come watch, come watch you do this.

786
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
I'm going to get him.

787
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm going to beat up Mimo.

788
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,800
Mimo is what he calls his, his poppy.

789
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,640
Is he just trying to fight his own poppy?

790
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,200
Aren't we all?

791
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,360
They say that man's greatest struggle in life is to best his own father.

792
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,760
This guy is, is vaulting over that goal.

793
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Right.

794
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:49,340
He's hunting those dangerous game, the most dangerous and most satisfying game.

795
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,680
It's poppy.

796
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,920
They call it the greatest generation because when you beat the shit out of one of them,

797
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,760
you're like, oh fuck, yeah, yeah, this is going down great.

798
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
You beat Hitler and I beat you.

799
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,400
So by association, I just beat the shit out of Hitler.

800
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,720
That level of punch out is just you fighting Jacqueline Lane.

801
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,000
Uh huh.

802
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,760
Just get, who was the one who had the juicer?

803
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,400
I bet I couldn't take, I couldn't have taken that guy.

804
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,360
That was a, no, it was a King Hippo.

805
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,280
It was King Hippo.

806
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,000
It was the juice man.

807
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,480
You know, the juice man, Jay Cordish, horse marijuana.

808
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,320
Jay Cordish is the juice man.

809
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,880
Maybe Jacqueline did a juicer too though.

810
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,020
I can't remember.

811
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,020
I don't understand.

812
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,760
I don't understand how it happened because I'm, I just, I, I'm 25.

813
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,120
I'm six months into 25 now and I, I feel like I'm fucking 88 years old.

814
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,600
Like my body has already started.

815
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,120
It's already peaked and has already started decomposing.

816
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,760
I don't know how these fucking guys do it.

817
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,120
The old men, the old steroids.

818
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
The olders.

819
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
Yeah.

820
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,600
I don't have any energy right now.

821
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,360
How are they getting up and fighting people?

822
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Yeah.

823
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,000
There's a certain kick of energy that comes from like knowing that you're, you've got

824
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,960
nothing left to prove, like, you know, you're on the slow descent to like, what are you

825
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
afraid of?

826
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,160
You're going to break a bone.

827
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,320
You're going to die.

828
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,400
Like they have fear of death.

829
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,940
But they should, but they should because they're more likely to do those things than we are.

830
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,300
If I get punched in the arm, I'm probably not going to break every bone in my body.

831
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,380
You know what I mean?

832
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:30,080
If I live long enough, will I eventually stop being afraid of death?

833
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,080
Is that the secret?

834
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Yeah.

835
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,080
That they've conquered.

836
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,920
Listen, I also think we need to accept that back in the day, the poppy age, you know,

837
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,480
that generation, they were just more hardcore than we are.

838
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,320
Ooh, interesting.

839
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:55,300
So they, they being raised on fighting Hitler and like cabbage rations and stuff like that,

840
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,080
that made them like wicked, just like crazy tough.

841
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,320
They were basically like all captain Americas.

842
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Okay.

843
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
Well, okay.

844
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Okay.

845
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
That makes a lot of sense.

846
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,800
It's not their age so much as the, the ground from which their manhood blossomed.

847
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,800
Oh my God.

848
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
The fertile soil.

849
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,000
If you balance like a 25 year old dude from like 1940 versus a 25 year old dude now, it

850
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,560
would be like a 25 year old dude now fighting a baby.

851
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Oh my God.

852
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah.

853
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,240
It would be like, Hey, have you read the new, uh, Chuck Palahniuk book?

854
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
And then he would die.

855
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Cause he got punched so hard.

856
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
Yeah.

857
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
He had eyelashes.

858
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,040
Yeah.

859
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
You looked at me hard.

860
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,300
I'm going to live journal this.

861
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,800
You just ripped the fields off her lucky strike and just smoked it.

862
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
Wow.

863
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
You're a tough guy.

864
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,240
So imagine how bad it will be in like 50 years from now.

865
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,360
Oh, our kids are going to beat the shit out of us.

866
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Are you kidding me?

867
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,640
You think of the pendulum strings going to go the other way?

868
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Oh my God.

869
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
Yeah.

870
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,440
I think that, I think that like fortitude skipped a human generation or at least an

871
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,920
American generation because like my kids are going to have to fight over, you know, rare

872
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,880
earth elements against every other country in the universe.

873
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,040
And then they are going to be like super tough.

874
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,120
And then I'm going to be like, Hey, do you want some quiche?

875
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,640
And then they're going to fucking curb stomp me.

876
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Yeah.

877
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,840
Hey guys, welcome home for Thanksgiving.

878
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,280
I made you a fist face.

879
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,160
I just finished beating up Osama bin Laden too.

880
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,640
I'm looking forward to the terrorist sequels that we're going to, that genetic cloning

881
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,640
is going to bring us.

882
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
I'm really excited.

883
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Beware!

884
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
It's son of Hitler.

885
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Uh huh.

886
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,640
It's pride of just girls.

887
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,640
It is mega Stalin.

888
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,640
Mega Stalin.

889
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,640
I liked it when you made that joke, Trav.

890
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Thank you, Justin.

891
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:47,640
I liked it when you laughed at the joke that I made.

892
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:54,600
Guys, I'm so thankful for both of you.

893
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Yeah.

894
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,960
And all of our jokes that we got going on right now.

895
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,240
We're all thankful for each other.

896
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:05,360
Most of all, we're thankful for you for joining us yet again for my brother, my brother, me.

897
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,400
Real quick.

898
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,720
Got a ton of great presents for our B day.

899
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:19,560
We got a joke, a joke book sent to us from not great penmanship.

900
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,280
I'm going to say Jason is what that looks like.

901
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
A very kind note.

902
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Are you sure it's not Jarman?

903
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,040
It might be Jarflin.

904
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,960
I got a novel, a dirty job by Christopher Moore and that's for Griffin.

905
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,280
I don't know why Griffin got a present, but probably because he sent us other things.

906
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,920
He sent me a copy of a book called The Windup Girl and said Travis, Jim Butcher's side jobs.

907
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,320
Stories from the Dresden Files.

908
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,760
Good choice.

909
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Excellent choice.

910
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,520
We also got a ghost meter EMF sensor from Alan Black.

911
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:55,520
Holy shit.

912
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,600
Chris is going to be spooktacular.

913
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,600
And Nico Jerema, Nico Jerema sent us a copy of Captain Underpants and the wrath of the

914
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,560
wicked wedgie woman.

915
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,160
So do appreciate that.

916
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,760
And we got so much more.

917
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
I tell you about the wedding we're invited to, right?

918
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Yes.

919
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,260
Spill the beans on that.

920
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,540
That's in Chi-Town, right?

921
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
That's in Chi-Town.

922
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
Let me know the date.

923
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,120
Let me know the venue.

924
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:30,080
I respectfully told them we wouldn't be able to make it, but I did send them a very nice

925
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:35,520
set of drinking glasses and also, I believe, a peeler.

926
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,720
This is the nicest fucking podcast ever.

927
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,520
Basically, everybody loves everybody on the show, but thank you so much for those birthday

928
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
presents from everybody.

929
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,640
I haven't been to the post office in a little while, so if you sent one recently, I'm sorry

930
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,520
that we did not receive it yet.

931
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,920
We're part of the Maximum Fun Network, and they have a ton of shows that you will really

932
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,920
enjoy.

933
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,960
There's Risk, there's Throwing Shade, Just John Hodgman, Jordan and Jesse Go, Bullseye

934
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,820
is one of the best interview shows ever, and you could be listening to it for free right

935
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:16,840
now if you wanted to on MaximumFun.org, so go there and check out all the programming

936
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,800
they've got on offer.

937
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,440
Next time you're about to buy some shit to keep yourself entertained, next time you're

938
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,840
about to buy yourself a trifle, just think, or a rifle, just think about, or a trident.

939
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Thank you, Travis.

940
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,880
Justin, do you want to chime in, or should I just keep going?

941
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,600
No, go for it.

942
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,040
Just think about all the free shit that you can get on MaximumFun.org.

943
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,880
There are thousands of hours of shit for you to listen to.

944
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,640
Thank you to everyone who tweeted about the show, Dchrist0921, UselessClick, Gigi Lindsey,

945
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:57,900
Hallways, Iggy K, DerkInIt, GreenGuardian5, Sam Bersanti, SDezel, everybody who's sharing

946
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:08,440
the show, if you can just tell a friend, Adam J. Ford, Little Socrates, or is that Socrates?

947
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,560
Thank you to you guys, you're what help us to grow the show, so we really, really appreciate

948
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,560
it.

949
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,440
Please tell some friends if you can, if you get a chance, burn our shit onto a CD, give

950
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:24,080
it to a friend, pick your favorite one hour episode, burn it onto a one hour disc, give

951
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,040
it to somebody as the ultimate gift, or give them a jump drive.

952
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,560
That'd be a great present for whatever holiday you celebrate.

953
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,280
Just get a jump drive, feel that bitch.

954
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,120
Did you know that you can get one of two different styles of My Brother, My Brother and Me shirts?

955
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:47,360
They're all at MaxFunStore, and you can just get them, you know?

956
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,560
I also want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

957
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,840
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

958
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,680
I cannot wait for that Fool's Holiday album to drop.

959
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Can't wait.

960
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Can't wait.

961
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,480
It's gonna be so good.

962
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,600
So yeah, thank you so much, everybody.

963
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,160
Can't wait for Candle Nights.

964
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,280
Candle Nights coming up so fast.

965
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,280
Are you guys ready?

966
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,820
Yeah, our always, our always underwhelming holiday episode.

967
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:15,360
Be sure to catch that, don't wanna miss that.

968
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,160
Have you guys trimmed the whatever it is that you trim for Candle Nights?

969
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
The bush?

970
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,200
I guess, I think there's a bush.

971
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,960
No, Travis means stone bush.

972
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,400
Hey, Griff, did you have another question?

973
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,880
One last one to send us off on?

974
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,880
Yeah, I could.

975
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,240
I could do that for you.

976
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,840
This was sent in by Nolan Hitchcock.

977
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,840
Thank you, Nolan.

978
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:45,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks, is it bad to give my six-year-old baby a little

979
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,960
French onion dip?

980
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,640
Oh, Justin McElroy.

981
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,640
I'm Griffin McElroy.

982
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,600
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

983
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,200
That's your dad, square on the lips.
