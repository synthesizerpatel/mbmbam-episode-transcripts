1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:01:16,980
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show from the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

6
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,660
I'm Travis McElroy the Experienced. And I'm sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

7
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,380
Maybe I should just do like Travis the Middlest. Maybe. Anyways, I got bad news guys. I'm so P.O.ed right now

8
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,420
It's our 600th episode big. This is big. This is big, right? The title the title of the email

9
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,300
You sent us with the questions this morning was it's episode 600. Whoops cuz we forgot.

10
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,300
No, I didn't forget this the whoops the whoops comes from this Griffin. I had so much planned

11
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah, I had I was I had like I trained these drones to do a whole thing

12
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,180
I don't think you trained drones. I spent months training the drones.

13
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,900
I like had hired some dancers to do like backup dancing for us for the whole episode. Just I got it

14
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,540
Well, Travis, hey, there's an audio medium so we can say

15
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,300
That they would never do that. No, they were tap dancers

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,140
Here's the problem because I also got us like matching jumpsuits in triplicate each

17
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:26,260
Oh our different moods and then our CFO Jeremy said that we couldn't afford any of that

18
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,700
Fucking cancelled all of it behind our backs

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,380
No, he did it in front of my face. He tore up all the contracts. Okay

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,060
I was gonna say it'd be so embarrassing for like hit it girls and then the backup dancers like didn't

21
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,380
Hit it cuz they weren't there. Well Griffin, they weren't just girls

22
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:49,580
They were men and women and non-binary folks and like I well that's not that that goes expressly against my wishes Travis

23
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,140
I'm sorry, Griffin. This was not just for you. This was for everybody

24
00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,340
I had a Mount Rushmore made out of chocolate that included my face your face Justin's face and orb the horse and

25
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:08,160
And Jeremy melted it why the flamethrower and then he sold the melted chocolate back to Willy Wonka right in front of me

26
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,260
Travis stories get a little for fetched. Yeah, I don't think it's all true all true. I'd so much

27
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,340
Justin do you want to just do like a really half-assed?

28
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,420
like

29
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,140
obligatory send in the clowns I had an idea for another musical number we could bust out for this one and

30
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,540
What's right? That's fun. I like the way you did that Griffin when you're like Justin

31
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,700
Do you want to do something? But before you do I got something? Well, it's just I was thinking about sustainability

32
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,380
You know me. Oh, yeah

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,540
Then we're going green. Yeah, you know

34
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,780
Doing just doing salmon farm. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah salmon farm to table and

35
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,380
from the table podcast

36
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:01,180
Toilet paper and this big one a carbon song our carbon footprint is like

37
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,420
Great, so they're working on my carbon handprints

38
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,340
So I was thinking we could hit him with something like this and then we could change just change the number every like hundred

39
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
I was okay great

40
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
36,000

41
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Minutes

42
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,500
36,000

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,340
jokes about

44
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,420
ghosts or you know, like then we right now wait

45
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,700
hold on I worry Griffin that that implies that we make one joke per minute, which is

46
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:35,300
Just going off this episode so far not not true. Yeah, we're about three and a half minutes in and there has been nary a joke

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,780
It's an average. Yeah average though. Oh, okay. So sometimes we do like ten jokes a minute, right?

48
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,540
Yeah, all about go sometimes we do ten jokes per episode

49
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,020
I'm saying but over 600 it averages out our list. There's probably

50
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,780
Some of our listeners who are like, man

51
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,100
I can't believe they didn't prepare something for this big milestone episode and it's like what have you guys prepared for us?

52
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,180
Oh, why do we always have to throw our own celebration? That's fucked up, right?

53
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,580
It's it's like we do this every almost two years

54
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,860
I don't think that's too much to ask of our listeners to be like to you know

55
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,280
Get a bouncy house or some shit for us, please. I was thinking about it, by the way

56
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,700
600 in 12 years, right? That's pretty and alright

57
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,580
So it's like six weeks away from our actual 12 year anniversary

58
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:33,500
So like that means one we've had a pretty good track record of putting on episodes. We could have taken it way easier

59
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,300
We've had six kids and we did not miss like we missed what like one or two episodes of this

60
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,180
This is what I'm saying in 12 years. We could be up to what like

61
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,460
624 600 so 24 episodes in 12 years

62
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,860
That's if we hit when we get to like April 15th or whenever we started or whatever, right?

63
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,580
That'll be like 600 and like five. This math is not fun to listen. I'm saying we've missed

64
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,500
19 episodes in 12 years

65
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:10,240
That's not bad, but we could have with missed way more maybe right now. We'll just take the next 30 weeks off

66
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,600
That's now we're cooking now. We're

67
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,440
You got my attention back now. We hit 600. Let's fucking coast

68
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,400
Podcasts take a gap year to like go to Spain and find ourselves

69
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, I would love to cruise on down to Barcelona and just like find myself

70
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,880
I would love to take a break from talking every single day a gab

71
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Batico if you will

72
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,640
Yeah, love that right just like oh Justin. He's silent. He's monastic in nature

73
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah, and he and he has a beautiful cacti all around his home and he tends them

74
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:51,300
Peaceful justice Justin saw that Eddie Murphy movie where Eddie Murphy talked too much and someone gave him a tree with leaves on it

75
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:56,540
They represented all the words he had left and Justin said I'm gonna do that but in real life and completely voluntarily

76
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,360
That's like a movie thousand words. He says a thousand words that he dies. Yeah, that's the actual purpose of the movie, man

77
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,600
I would thinking of Pluto Nash, right?

78
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,440
I would accidentally sing. We don't talk about Bruno to myself 200 times and beef it

79
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,780
You only know five words. Oh, you would literally just say like we don't talk

80
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,400
And I'd be like fuck that's six

81
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:46,200
Oh, hey, we don't talk about shouldn't have wasted it on that fuck. Oh, you think I don't

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,620
You think I don't know just the wrap in the middle of hook and can we call it that

83
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,960
I'm pretty sure I speak quickly loose traveler does a wrap in the middle of hook and I think that's

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,720
Shuffle you off the coil. No one's ever

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,440
I bet he did. Yeah, I bet fucking John Papa was like check out this rap

86
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,240
I'm gonna do and everyone's like oh fuck. Oh, no, John, please don't do this

87
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,780
You're gonna ruin karaoke nights forever

88
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,080
Happy 600 boys. I'm proud of you and us. Hey, thank you. I'm really excited

89
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Do you guys ever do people without kids ever ask you guys like so what kind of music do you like?

90
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,960
And all you get thing is like well

91
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,640
I've been listening to the soundtrack of encanto like on repeat for the last six weeks

92
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,400
So that does that count? Is that the music I listen? It's either favorite music. It's it's fucked my my

93
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,320
like music recommendations any any any platform is algorithmically picking like

94
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,120
Music or videos for me to watch is is ruinous. I've even fucked up my like

95
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,080
My my various cues by not switching over to the kid profile. Oh, yeah. Well, see I get it

96
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Hey, do you really really like?

97
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,920
Fucking blippy. Yeah. Yeah fucking blippy

98
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,400
Well, this is a blippy. What if this is the year that what if the next hundred episodes we dedicate to just Bippy?

99
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Bippy beef. Bippy beef

100
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,320
Blippi beefing

101
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Biffing with Blippi happily

102
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,920
Happily, I watch that shit and I'm like am I supposed to not like him and listen Blippi if you're listening

103
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,960
Get it the fuck together fuck together. You're a mess dude, and you shit on your friend that one time

104
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,680
Excuse me

105
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:38,400
Yeah, before he became Blippi he did when what was it the the there was the viral sensation of like

106
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,080
You're very still and then the Harlem Shake. Yeah, Harlem Shake

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:48,160
It says the reveal was him shitting on his friend and then he became Blippi so Child's YouTube

108
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:55,080
This episode is all for us. By the way, it's starting to seem like Child's YouTube sensation Blippi. Uh-huh dumped on his friend

109
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
This is known

110
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:04,720
By me that's even more reason for us to take this dude down a fucking notch. I'm just saying I'm just saying

111
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,400
Do you guys ever watch Children's YouTube and think like I should have gotten into that?

112
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,560
Every day every day every day. Do you know how many people are on there? Like hey, I made slime. Thanks for a million dollars

113
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah, I'm gonna open up these toys to go. Look at this. Oh fuck. I should have done that

114
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,960
well

115
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Instead I'm trying to wrap it up 600 episodes of hard work. Thank you. You're welcome

116
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,560
I would like to sit on my comfortable laurels, please

117
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
time to coast

118
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,080
While I'm thinking about it, congratulations to Connor Aleph for booking Tom Hanks on the show

119
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,600
Podcasting I think huge huge victory finally a celebrity is on a podcast

120
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:53,480
Next if you haven't listened to dead eyes Connor show it is fantastic and we're so proud of him and Connor if you're listening

121
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,040
If you could put in a good word for us with Tom Hanks

122
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,360
If Thomas is casting his net as it were

123
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,500
I'd love to get him on here if you could put in a good word

124
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,800
these are like the guys who like inspired me to do it all and like I

125
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Wouldn't be here without them and like you kind of owe me whatever you want to say Connors up to you heroes of podcasting

126
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:29,040
Hey brothers, I am an adult you can't you can't start sentences that way without sounding like you are two kids in a trench coat

127
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,960
And I would like one adult ticket for an adult, please I would like to see this grown folks movie

128
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,400
Please I am an adult making my way in the world and in conversation with my mother

129
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:46,440
Whenever some significant problem arises to beer from bureaucracy

130
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,240
Such as my apartment building

131
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,100
Council or issues with government services. She has recently gotten into a pattern of telling me to quote go to the media about my issue

132
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,780
Simply not sure how to respond or what to do with his suggestions do news outlets accept random people coming with stories these days

133
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,340
Would any of this be noteworthy? What possible benefit could going to the media have that's from the unwilling correspondent

134
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,100
When you read a good media, you're gonna get your story out there. Yeah, you gotta get your story

135
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,900
Yeah, you gotta let people know what's happening make your voice heard right your voice is your most powerful weapon

136
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,660
Make your voice heard about this to the people in the media

137
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
Me and Justin used to be the media

138
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,620
I regret too. I regret to inform everyone

139
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,700
Yeah, we were you know cronies on the take and I

140
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:45,060
think I would have definitely loved getting an email from somebody saying like my landlord is a real piece of shit and

141
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,940
Then the story would just be like breaking

142
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,660
Landlord is a piece of shit. And then actually that's true of every landlord. So I'm not sure

143
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,660
It would be actually more news if it was like landlord pretty decent actually. Yeah, this landlord is pretty cool

144
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,780
I had a leaky pipe and he came to fix it within 48 hours

145
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:11,380
Love this I couldn't make rent this month because of various hardships and they totally understood and didn't give me a hard time about it

146
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,740
at all my word is the landlord from the

147
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Spiderman movies and I love he's very he's very great

148
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,260
The one bathroom is a problem. But other than that, it's not bad. Not bad

149
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:30,060
I think by the way more you've made me think now Griffin more news outlets

150
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,220
No matter what their focus should be

151
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,100
slash

152
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,740
Local issues. So if it was like video game journalism

153
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,340
slash

154
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Local issues, it'll be wonderful back new Sonic game and also what's the deal with this pothole in front of Tom's house?

155
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,700
Well, we gonna fucking deal with this and it kind of depends on where you're at like here in Huntington

156
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,100
You absolutely could get front page with some yet a few days ago

157
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,360
The front page story was a lovely for February morning at the skate park. Oh, that sounds lovely

158
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,060
Whoa, wait, Huntington's got a skate park

159
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,060
Yes, yeah. Yes, you guys you haven't been out there

160
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,580
I mean, I wouldn't I haven't been there to shred just you gotta shred gotta be shred

161
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,360
You what you're gonna leave it one shredded and then the City Council's gonna be like no one shredding on this

162
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,660
I guess we better pave paradise and put up a parking lot turn into a fucking library or some boring shit

163
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Oh my god, can you imagine?

164
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:38,260
Get out there fucking shred you guys listen, I know what you're saying you you only shred little now, but give it a year

165
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,700
Are you gonna accomplish man? I don't go the dog park either. We got a dog park

166
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,780
I'm good go fucking dog park. You don't need a dog to do that

167
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,140
They that's what they want you to think you can just go and enjoy other people's dogs

168
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Is that a weird vibe the dog park be like just your scopes and pups

169
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,580
As long as you offer to pay the dog owners like an hourly rate for you to look at their dogs, it's fine

170
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,800
There's nothing weird about it extra for touching

171
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,840
That soundbite Travis gonna

172
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,100
That silence is Griffin debating whether or not to hang a lantern on

173
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,440
I don't think that the people who need that soundbite

174
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,880
Needed any extra spice like I think they heard it and they said finally he said it

175
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,320
We're 600 episodes in are there any other wild shit that people have wanted us to say out loud that they can then just like

176
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,800
have that

177
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
for

178
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,840
That would be a good episode

179
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,600
Let me hit you guys with this idea. What if I did an episode that is like we're tired of coming up with it. Yeah

180
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,640
Yeah, we let you we let the listeners write it and just like everybody gets to send in one line

181
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,800
Oh, that's good. And then we'll just read all the lines. I don't know law

182
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,080
I mean, I'm fine with just doing like a shot like mmm juicy right something that you can just like

183
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Snip out there

184
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Then it's turning into sort of earthworm Jim

185
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,800
I like I'm saying like I think that extra for touching is something that people are gonna be able and when I say it

186
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,240
Like that, I'll do it like extra position so that people know what I'm saying, but they can't use the clip

187
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,760
But people that's like very specific and people are like, ooh, okay

188
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,300
I can put that on my you know

189
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,560
Only fans or whatever is a funny like like a joke click

190
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,580
Oh, you know a lot of people have like cool animated GIFs and like soundbite jokes on their only fans page

191
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,800
Yeah, it'll be it'll be like that basically

192
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,240
Well, here's what we'll do Griffin from now on whenever we have something that we're like

193
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,640
That's a great sound bite that people are gonna pull we'll throw some copyrighted music underneath it

194
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh

195
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Like a bird but that underneath it right and then it's like oh, it's there but you can't use it

196
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,280
It's behind glass now. You can't oh fuck. It's so tantalizing you want to use but you can't

197
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,000
Because right behind it is Limp Bizkit's one of those days. Oh, I thought you said that Limp Bizkit wrote

198
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I am like a bird. I only fly away

199
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,160
Well, they did but they didn't perform it. They did that cover that I thought was so good

200
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
I'm like a bird

201
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,880
A little something like this

202
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,900
Any other I forget what we don't go to the media they have it hard enough already start your own media

203
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Do support local news

204
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
Local news is very important. It's wow. Thanks. Wow. Thanks guys

205
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,760
You know what you could do?

206
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
You could take out an ad

207
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,620
Mm-hmm that way you're funneling money into the pockets of local media, but you are getting the word out

208
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,240
Interesting. Oh, hey my my landlord

209
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:12,800
Dylan leaves his stinky sausage casings in the community trash can and I wish he would stop

210
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,360
That's a trash can though. Justin link. It's the

211
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,520
Community trash can Travis. Yeah, but you're not going to a trash can expecting

212
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,360
Okay, I live in a hovel in the world the worst state in America

213
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,600
I don't know how big city people live. I don't know if they have a community trash can

214
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,200
Context clues you can figure out that if the trash can is stinky you can't complain about it. I have two trash cans

215
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:50,880
Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah outside. Yeah big cans. Oh, yeah, I throw all my trash. Yeah with your powerful bags. Yes. One is stinky. I don't like to open it

216
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
Uh-huh, and the other is not stinky. It's a fresh smell. Yeah, so I

217
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:01,000
Preferentially will get as much trash in there. Yeah in in some mr. Good vibes as I care

218
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah cuz cuz hefty stink over there. I don't like to open him cuz he smells

219
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,400
You know anyone who has more than one trash can has a has a like starter and then there's a B-string

220
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:21,640
Absolutely positively, but even the good trash can Justin is a trash can I felt actually really guilty because I took my huge

221
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,200
Trash can filled with wood scraps up there and they're gonna pick it up thinking

222
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,960
It's just a regular day of newspapers and bottles and they're gonna be hoisting about

223
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,600
Three somebody building a bridge up here. Yeah

224
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,160
Juice I think there are probably lots of people at home that know more about your sort of garbage

225
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,940
preferences then like their own

226
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,440
Yeah, and that's a great sign of a great podcast

227
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,860
I think I make less because I've been trying to do more recycling. Oh good. Yeah, that's great. It's good for you

228
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,780
God, you guys are really up on your fucking high horses today, aren't you? No, and I do pre cycling. Whoa

229
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,620
What's that? I go through other people's trash and I take stuff out of it and I use that

230
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,440
the best part about recycling is we have a community recycler you have to take it and

231
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,360
Just I get like a free rein to just look at what other people are recite nice

232
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,520
Does they get a few snap judgments about my community what kind of I mean what do they got going on in there just like

233
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,180
sometimes it's like

234
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:32,460
Wow, you guys eat a lot of little pizzas, huh? Oh, wow. You're really plowing through these things. What what could they?

235
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,240
What do they have? I don't understand what box either like little pizza boxes. Yeah, like little pizza boxes

236
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,440
That's good Griff. You put that together all on your own. Yes

237
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,520
They recycled little pizza boxes, which makes me think that they ate a lot of little pizzas

238
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,780
But who's giving out little pizzas in little box? I assume Griffin doesn't talk about like a frozen pizza

239
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,520
You would buy from the store. Yes a dollar pizza like in college

240
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,920
Okay, my daughter my four-year-old daughter came home yesterday and insisted that she had eaten ten small pizzas

241
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,140
Her grandmother's house that she'd eaten ten small pizzas and she would not back down

242
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,880
No, no matter how many times I kept pushing back. She said no, I eat a ten of the chunky boys

243
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,200
Yeah, I love Cooper so much

244
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,000
I ate a ten of the chunky boys. You did not. She did not eat ten pizzas. Does she mean Bagel Bites?

245
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,100
No, she didn't. I got there before you. No, she didn't. She's talking about the little round, you know

246
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,520
Like party pizzas. That's what that's what I'm looking about party pizzas. Yeah. Yeah. She said she ate ten of them

247
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,160
That's not true. It's impossible. Nah, I said we'll say. She ate dinner very poorly

248
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,640
So maybe maybe I mean more than none for sure, but no way ten, right? No, not ten chunky boys

249
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,280
Our parenting styles are so different because I would I like would believe her, you know what I mean?

250
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,880
Yeah support like go ahead and eat ten pizzas, sweetie. Daddy loves you. Yeah, you'll be president someday

251
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,200
You're gonna need that pizza energy. Uh-huh. You're gonna be so big and strong with that ten pizzas inside of you

252
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Yeah, like Louisa as my

253
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,960
Yeah, I would make it relatable and be like like how Louisa ate ten pizzas and then got super strength and then she'll be like

254
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,540
That's where she got her powers from. That is not what happens in the movie. Can't keep talking about it

255
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,440
Well, we don't talk about Louisa either Jesus Jesus who the fuck can't we talk about?

256
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Can I talk about Camilo, please? No can't talk about Camilo. Does he smell like the person he turns into?

257
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,880
No, you can't. Yes. I mean he would definitely I mean, okay

258
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,240
His physiology would completely adapt to that of the person

259
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,720
He's copied including like sweat glands and like but not like the smells they picked up throughout the day chemically know

260
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
His body knows

261
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Do you know I mean like his body?

262
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,040
The clothes wouldn't smell like this. I don't wanna do this but his clothes

263
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,040
Here's a question why yeah, here's a question no, okay

264
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,380
That's a good question. That's a question. Stop it

265
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you guys want to talk to the wizard on this? Yeah, you always do it second

266
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'm tired of not having the variety in the show. I'm tired of the predictability. Okay, whatever happened to predictability

267
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,640
It's the I even knew that you were gonna do a full house goat joke there. Fuck. Thanks

268
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,120
I've got my lips getting tired while kissing my husband lately. Oh, man. I've noticed that while kissing your husband, too

269
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
But yeah, it's a workout

270
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,600
Your husband's doing some stuff in there. Yeah, it's taxing heavy lifting. It's almost like they cramp up and get numb while we're smooching

271
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,160
Yeah, maybe it's from talking or smiling too much throughout the day. It's full-time podcasters

272
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,160
This is something y'all have experienced if so any suggestions on lip exercises or resting strategies

273
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,200
That's from lazy lips in Atlanta, which I I don't this feels like a sawbones weird medical question episode

274
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,160
But no you've come to the right place. Yeah, I thought well first we can show you the we do about 20 minutes of lip

275
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
Warm-ups before every episode

276
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
I mean this mouth don't quit

277
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,760
Yeah, this one this one does not quit

278
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,280
And I don't know if that's true for everyone apparently not I didn't think I had like a special mouth

279
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,280
But I guess it's like pretty good

280
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,040
Yeah, cuz it doesn't quit like it never gets tired. It's always hungry for more

281
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Yeah

282
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Podcasting oh, okay

283
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,520
By heavy episode

284
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Yeah

285
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
Yeah, I don't I don't know why

286
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,160
What is what's he doing in there?

287
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:40,700
What's he doing in there? What is he doing? What is wrestling? Is he making you do too much work?

288
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,740
There should be an ebb and flow. Oh

289
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,360
There's some people who think like when I do kissing

290
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,840
It has to be bigger than the other part like my mouth has to get over the other part

291
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,480
It's like a dominance thing where it's like I gotta get this mouth over their mouth

292
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,440
Yeah, I'm glad we're talking about this thing. Yeah now in a perfect world when you kiss you you both would firmly

293
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,400
Press your lips together stay still. Yes for an extended amount of time and then disconnect, right?

294
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:13,400
That's the ideal but you're not always gonna get that obviously now, right?

295
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,680
So sometimes it's about their lips go left yours go right, you know what I mean?

296
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,760
And then you kind of do, you know the swirl right as you chase each other around

297
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,080
Well, yeah, the the lips move around the tongue

298
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Yeah, obviously yeah

299
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
And if that's gonna happen, you got to make sure you're moving at the same speed, right?

300
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:40,080
Because sometimes if one swirl is faster than the other you're gonna catch up. Yeah, right and that can cause a lot of issues

301
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
It's a big problem

302
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,400
With our country today

303
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,000
Thank you Griffin. Thank you for saying it. You know, a lot of podcasts are afraid of dealing with the like the tough issues

304
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,720
Yeah, not here right whatever happened to good old-fashioned smooching kids today

305
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,400
I have all these viral smooches that they do on tik-tok. I've seen it. They take their challenges

306
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah, they take their lips and they waggle them back and forth around their knees, right? I hate that

307
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,160
I don't know just I think it's gross and it makes me want to barf when I see that

308
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,120
Absolutely press together count to ten break apart say thank you for the smooch

309
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Yeah, and then go about your day that part's so important

310
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,080
Yeah, a lot of people don't do that anymore. And it's really been the death of civility

311
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,360
Whatever happened whatever happened to this great nation of ours. Thank you Griffin people used to smooch

312
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,300
I'm sorry. I keep equating bad kissing with and I don't mean bad kissing. I'm sure your husband's an excellent kisser

313
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,600
If it goes numb, I don't know Griffin

314
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:47,640
Yeah, knowing now numbness is not what we're looking for. Typically not ideal. Not ideal. Is he putting something on his lips?

315
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Is he smearing some toxins on there Frank?

316
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:57,200
It won't it will let you do the stranger though. Oh, that's what it's like. Who's my husband kissing?

317
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,000
That's your lips or not. I don't think that's how that I don't think that's what it is

318
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,800
Are you are you kissing poison ivy or perhaps?

319
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,720
Like a villain from James Bond. Did you ever think about that? Yes

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,040
Because the cramping up that seems like a you probably you gotta get some more. I don't know iron

321
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,040
vitamins

322
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,960
Maybe just like some more you gotta stay hydrated. Gotta stay hydrated, but the numb is

323
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Troubling the numbs troubling

324
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,780
Is your circulation good? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Are your lips sitting dormant for too long?

325
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,100
I'm just thinking about circulation. Oh, of course. Yeah

326
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,420
So you're suggesting that they're not kissing enough

327
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,100
Which is not not not on this. I would say not in a

328
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,860
You can kiss too much in a short amount of time

329
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:57,500
Right and then be dormant the rest of them you guys spread it out in an even like one kiss every five minutes

330
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,340
for 24 hours

331
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,540
An entire 24 hours. What's it doing? It's really guys

332
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,940
It's really hard for me to give advice on this one without knowing what he's even doing in there

333
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,180
Yeah, what is he doing in there? Cuz that's never been my experience. Are you sure he knows it's kissing?

334
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,780
Like you're kissing but he's like wrestling. He's this is a challenge

335
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,220
He's trying to win and he's like, oh we were kissing. Oh, I'm sorry

336
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,820
I think that our listeners want to hear us talk about a kissing as much as I bet I bet they have had their

337
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
For sure

338
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,540
Yes, that thirst has been slate. Yeah, absolutely

339
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,420
Okay, can we go to the wizard now? Yeah

340
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,460
He's he's looking over me like I heard you say my name and I got myself prepared for it

341
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,100
And then you didn't I made crudity and you know what happened? I prepared my physical form

342
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,300
He turned my wife a new fucking frog and I know that and I think that sucks

343
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,740
How does gonna turn our back how to spoil a chihuahua?

344
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Well, just leave it out in the Sun too long

345
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,420
What happens to a chihuahua in the Sun

346
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,020
Because of their size and lovable nature chihuahuas are both easy and fun to spoil. Well

347
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,180
Chihuahuas love getting lots of attention so their owners and other people

348
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,180
treats clothing and other gifts are some of the most common ways to make your chihuahua look like a

349
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,980
Neighborhood celebrity take your dog out on adventures when you can make them feel even more like a prince or princess

350
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,100
However, yes, keep in mind that some dogs may misinterpret being spoiled. They say like a old-timey

351
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,740
like

352
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
gentlemen

353
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:45,220
In being spoiled and behave badly as a result such as by being aggressive or nipping. Oh that hey

354
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,900
WikiHow yeah

355
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,460
Can we just say it's wild that you're like they might equate being spoiled

356
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,020
With being able to behave badly and get away with it

357
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:04,460
Hey WikiHow those are often synonymous. That is how it is attached usually in the animal brain

358
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,640
So give your chihuahua a big bed to sleep on

359
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:13,380
By the way, the the undercurrent of this article is I wish I was the author of this articles

360
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,180
Chihuahua cuz they are they would set me up with the sweetest fucking life the sweetest life of Zack and Cody like

361
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,100
imaginable

362
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,020
Chihuahuas like their naps and sleep 12 to 14 days on average. So you get big fluffy bed stack some soft blades

363
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,100
But you said 12 to 14 days

364
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,900
12 to 1 on average 12 to 14 hours a day on average. Did I say?

365
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:41,900
Days on average. Yeah. Yeah, that would be I would love that pet. Where's your chihuahua on a pin?

366
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,900
Oh, it's he's asleep for a fortnight

367
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
Tis the season

368
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
He'll be back on the 15th

369
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
And then he's power

370
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,680
When is my birthday? Well, not for three hounds wikings

371
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,320
Give a take give a take three huns wikings

372
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,460
Okay, get a variety. Don't give your dog a big bed. Oh, that's a terrible idea

373
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,420
It's a little dog though. So it's like you're spoiling this. Yeah, but dogs need stuff to cuddle up against. No, not this dog

374
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,420
this guy means this guy doesn't care about affection it cares about being a

375
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,940
Boss, baby

376
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,960
Chihuahuas are also notoriously cold all the time. Not this chihuahua because you spoiled them by keeping your house at

377
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
97 degrees Fahrenheit

378
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:30,080
That's the next dog's favorite temperature. Keep that keep that nest set

379
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,500
Specifically to 97 degrees always get a variety of toys for your dog. Yeah

380
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,780
I mean every spoiled dog has a big basket brimming with colorful toys

381
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Yeah, obviously that sounds like a vocal warm-up that you can do before kissing your husband a big

382
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
basket brimming with colorful toys

383
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,660
Serve food and water and customized dog bowls. I think a chihuahua is definitely going to understand what that means

384
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,060
Pamper them they can see color. They can see color and read

385
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,220
Now I think we can all agree if you grew up when these commercials were on there was a series of commercials in which dogs

386
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:11,140
Were served out of a crystal goblet. Well, that was the fancy feast the fancy feast commercial and like what else would you?

387
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,640
Serve it in right? I mean, absolutely, but I remember being a kid watching them

388
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:21,340
Like that's fucking you know how when we eat a fancy meal we usually do like humans

389
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,420
I mean do you eat it out of a crystalline goblet?

390
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,860
Thank you for clarifying that when you said we I did mean you were talking about humans. Yeah. Thank you

391
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,260
Okay, choose specialized collars and leashes for your dog again. They aren't gonna know that

392
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:41,100
Yeah, I can now literally can't see that. You know that right? That's like behind their seeing like stuff

393
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,840
Yeah stuff they used to see that. Well, I guess most of us use now we wear necklaces though. Don't we? Yeah. Yeah

394
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:55,100
And earrings now, what if you got him like a collar that smelled like bacon? Oh that would now that's gonna go poorly

395
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
into an

396
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,300
absolute spiral of madness

397
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,220
I

398
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,220
Fuck you sell it to right

399
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,760
Hey, you got hey, why are these other dogs biting my neck?

400
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,020
You've turned you are the forbidden meat

401
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,220
You are you the smoky secret?

402
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:22,820
Set up a quiet area for your chihuahua to escape when it's stressed. Hey, that's not spoiling. That's just a good idea. That's

403
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,140
Yeah

404
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,340
Well, I don't know that's like saying like oh your kid is so spoiled sometimes when they're stressed out

405
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,920
You let him just chill out and read a book fucking spoiled, man

406
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,020
I feel like I can if find reasons to get stressed and basically every room of my house

407
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,380
So I'm not sure that I have this and that's also dependent on the extent to which it is spoiling

408
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,580
It's also dependent on the amount of space that you have available to you. Like if somebody walks in they're like

409
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:54,480
I welcome my one-bedroom apartment and they're like wait, I think I had a two-bedroom. It's like well I did I have

410
00:33:54,860 --> 00:34:00,920
The bedroom that I sleep in which is also the kitchen and then over here is the room where my chihuahua

411
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,540
Mr. Smooches goes just fucking chill out me an orange slice. Yeah

412
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
And I really like that you

413
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,080
Clarified that in every room of your house you're stressed out

414
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,940
But like that's because the dog isn't aware of like any kind of geopolitical or like social issues

415
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Yeah, but I mean, it's the house. It's like obviously I can find a reason to be stressed out about that shit

416
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,820
like non non-stop, but um, you know, I I

417
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,660
Like I need an observatory or something. Oh, yeah

418
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,100
Yeah, that would be nice. That would be so dope. Just go there and look at some beautiful stars

419
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,820
I need like an observatory and a conservatory

420
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:46,060
Any other like a lot of worries? Yeah. Yeah anything you got a laboratory. Yes. Thank you

421
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,060
Yeah, you're welcome

422
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:53,460
Do you guys want to know more ways that you can spoil a chihuahua? Yeah

423
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:59,820
You guys remember that movie Beverly Hills? Yeah, obviously. Well, mr. Shivers has been giving me some looks lately

424
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,180
And I feel like I haven't done enough

425
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:07,580
Well, you should buy your chihuahua stylish clothing that fits and I love that they include that last part the fit has to know

426
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:15,000
Yeah, right that actually explains a lot. His cape has been dragging lately. I've noticed that I don't give him chihuahua. Jinko jeans

427
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,760
He won't know what he asked for him by name

428
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,800
No, he did and it's weird that your chihuahua can bark like that

429
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,120
No, I taught him to use the buttons, but to be fair, I gave him a button that says Jinko jeans. Yeah, that's true

430
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,600
Set it. Okay. So now this is about affection. I gave a mistake every time he pushes the button

431
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,320
Set aside time in the day to give your dog lots of attention. That's dope. Yes. Yes, mr. Jenkins

432
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
I swear, I will have that report on your desk by the end of the day

433
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
I just oh fuck I gotta go

434
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,680
That's the snuggle noise you have brought your chihuahua to work with you in this example

435
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,160
Yes, of course

436
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah

437
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,040
Remember to spoil your chihuahua even during busy days

438
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,200
Creating a daily routine helps ensure your dog has plenty of attention no matter what else you have going on

439
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,320
I love that at a funeral. Beep beep beep gotta go. Sorry

440
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,440
No, you wouldn't go to the funeral, right? Someone would be like, hey, can you come to this cool funeral? I'm going to I'm throwing it

441
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,680
It's gonna be awesome. I'd love to have you there and you're like you throw a funeral. Yeah. Yeah

442
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,720
Well, what else are you gonna do Justin just phone it in? Come on, and then you're like, yeah, what time and they're like 2 p.m

443
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,080
Oh

444
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,800
That's it. Can you move it to like 530?

445
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:30,240
So pet your dog give it belly rubs

446
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,360
Yeah, a lot of this stuff is like whatever teach your dog commands for a fun way to learn new tricks

447
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,420
I don't think actually that's spoiling them

448
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah, thanks from maybe officer learning things for me is not like a luxurious like hmm

449
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,260
I've earned this I'm going to you know, figure out how to tie a

450
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:55,660
Ship ship knot. Wow, I couldn't even think of a name of like a sorry. What is it a ship slipknot?

451
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:59,660
I'm gonna learn how to sing slip knots greatest hit monkey fit. Yeah

452
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:04,380
Throw a chihuahua party with cake and presents. This is great

453
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,300
Yeah, celebrate your dog by making a star for the day invite your dog's friends to come over

454
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,940
Even the ones you don't like wrap up some nice presents such as new toys or clothing then get a cake made from safe ingredients

455
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:24,060
Like peanut butter applesauce and pumpkin have a party for your dog's birthday a special occasion or for the sake of spoiling your dog on a random

456
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:28,620
Day, I listen take it from me. This is so fucking important

457
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,660
Yeah, don't make the cake look like the chihuahua

458
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,140
It causes so much psychological damage when mr

459
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,480
Shivers saw the other dogs tearing eating and tearing his form, right?

460
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,140
It was a whole thing. That's me

461
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:53,740
Take your child on a walk once a day that seems like basic sort of shit get a new yeah, that's not really spoil

462
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,260
Oh, no, I don't spoil my dog. I don't take him out

463
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,100
Spoil your dog by giving it food

464
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,860
I

465
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,900
Allow your dog the basic necessities of life

466
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,780
Get a new household pet to keep your dog company. They are not gonna like that. Yeah, big-ass scary dog

467
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,620
Yeah, what are you talking now? You're gonna have to get a smaller like

468
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
Don't do a chinchilla. They're too clever

469
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,300
You're gonna want to get your dog a

470
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
lizard to

471
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:28,980
Destroy well, you know eat not even eat. He won't be nourished by the lizard. He will just destroy it for fun

472
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,020
I was just trying to say like if this was an animated feature and I want to give my chihuahua a buddy

473
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,020
I think it's I

474
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,100
Think it's a I think it's a lizard bring your dog with you when you're on the go in a little backpack

475
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:46,340
They're gonna fucking hate that too. This article has gone off the rails

476
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:53,620
Find new friends for your dog outside of your home. How I can't find human friends for myself outside of the home

477
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:01,560
Well, this is your way in now you find other people with with puppers hey you seem cool do you have a dog no

478
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:10,300
No, fuck our interests really aligned in a lot of ways, but you ain't got no dog and he's the boss around here

479
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,740
I don't know if you could tell that

480
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:17,400
Can you please help me get out from under my door? Like if you could help me escape this dog? Mm-hmm

481
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,960
Let other people play with your dog of Chihuahua is friendly. This is a long article, huh?

482
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,060
Seems that way upgrade to a quality dog food with healthy ingredients again

483
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,180
If you know that that option is out there and you do have the means to do it and you don't do it

484
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,580
I don't know that we're talking about spoiling anymore. It's spoil your dog by

485
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,380
elongating its life

486
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,060
And its legs and it's let's give your dog longer legs this Chihuahua. It's all at once

487
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,220
About four or five feet tall that would be sick

488
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:52,180
Normal Chihuahua body with fucking legs that go all the way to the ground. It's fucking Slender Man shit

489
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,180
This is a Slender Man's dog

490
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,820
Give your dog special treats like peanut butter ice cream. We're really repeating ourselves now

491
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:04,280
This one has stopped being fun bathe and brush your Chihuahua

492
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,040
Bathe and brush your Chihuahua at least once a month

493
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:15,040
Trim your dog's nails at least once every three months. Okay, this one wraps it up with like bare necessities shit. It seems like

494
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,520

Just a quick note here.

579
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,140
The Signature Club sandwich

580
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,900
is replacing the Zaxby's Club sandwich.

581
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,060
This isn't a joke or anything.

582
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,780
It's just like a programming note.

583
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,140
Okay.

584
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,980
If you like the Zaxby's Club,

585
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,420
the Signature Club is replacing that menu item.

586
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,920
Does it say when it's going to be replaced, Justin?

587
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,940
So I can stock up?

588
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,780
Right.

589
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,860
So let me walk you through the chronology.

590
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,340
Well, first off, a bit from Joel Bulger,

591
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,860
the CMO of Zaxby's.

592
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,140
With the launch of our new Signature Club sandwich,

593
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:11,440
we've created our own Club remix.

594
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,540
Hmm.

595
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,380
Hmm.

596
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,940
Signature sandwich, and turned it up a notch.

597
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:17,780
Okay.

598
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,620
That sounds cool.

599
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,580
Knowing our fans, that's F-A-N-Z-O.

600
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,300
No, they didn't say that.

601
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,740
We are giving them something additional to rave about,

602
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,780
and announce a well-kept secret.

603
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:31,940
I killed a man.

604
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:35,460
That doesn't have anything to do with the sandwich,

605
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,060
but it feels good to get it off my chest.

606
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,900
I killed my dad, Jimmy Hoffa.

607
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,180
Anyway, our Signature-

608
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:42,820
You'll never guess, or he's buried.

609
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,860
Enjoy the sandwich.

610
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,980
Our Signature sandwich is officially here to stay

611
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,980
as a permanent menu item.

612
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,740
In October, 2020, the brand sent out its Y'all Ready tweet

613
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,300
and revealed its new Signature sandwich in test markets

614
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:00,460
before rolling it out nationwide in March, 2021.

615
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,940
During the test, Zaxby's new Signature sandwich

616
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,820
exceeded the performance of the existing

617
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,180
hand-breaded filet by 600% live.

618
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,140
Get the fuck out.

619
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,980
Get the fuck out.

620
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:13,860
That's what everybody said to the original.

621
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,260
How bad was your original sandwich doing?

622
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,500
Plus a bit dog shit.

623
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,900
Oh God, they replaced that fucking trash.

624
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:23,760
And there's also a light version.

625
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,300
Oh, fuck.

626
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,020
Yeah, if you want that.

627
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,820
What?

628
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,500
Oh, shit.

629
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,780
And now a quick note from me.

630
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,620
There he is.

631
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,460
Count Donut.

632
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,280
Thanks for coming.

633
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,120
There's my buddy.

634
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,020
Thanks, Count Donut.

635
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,940
I'm so excited to be back here with you boys.

636
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,900
You know, if you ever want to just do the whole show.

637
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,940
I always am on the whole show.

638
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,780
What?

639
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,620
What does that even mean?

640
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,260
I lurk in silence waiting for my mom.

641
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,260
But what about the part where there's only one pair

642
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,940
of footprints in the sand?

643
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:58,060
That is where I'm nodding silently instead of laughing.

644
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,700
Oh, thank you.

645
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,700
I don't get the most of the jokes.

646
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:02,540
That's fair.

647
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,360
I don't either.

648
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,020
And I tell most of them.

649
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,020
But the tone of her voice is give me A, S, E, R.

650
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,860
Oh, I don't know that I'm crazy about that.

651
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,140
It's no, it's not.

652
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,180
It's awesome sanguine meridian response.

653
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,340
It's hearing your blood pumping through

654
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,420
and thinking, oh, daddy hungry.

655
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,340
I love that.

656
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,500
Do you human bodies like Krispy Kreme?

657
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,620
You know that they do.

658
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:31,460
Well, good news.

659
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,260
It's time to ruin those bodies.

660
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,940
Put them straight in the ground with this new one.

661
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,380
Wait, is that what it says on the press release?

662
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,100
Hey, Krispy Kreme got a new one out.

663
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,700
It's time to ruin those bodies

664
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:44,740
and put them straight in the ground with these, Donut.

665
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,740
These coffin nails come directly from Krispy Kreme.

666
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:51,740
Put this in your face and put your face in the ground.

667
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:56,740
This is Krispy Kreme has partnered with Twix

668
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,380
for first ever irresistible, caramelly, cookie-y.

669
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,820
I swear it says this, cookie-y crunchy donut.

670
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,420
I don't want a crunchy donut.

671
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,940
Cookie-y, can you, how does it, how is it spelled?

672
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,620
K-O, sorry, that would be wild.

673
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,980
And also that would be kooky, which is a different word.

674
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,060
Yes, this would be on brand for Krispy Kreme.

675
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,740
C-O-O-K-I-E, what is the dash?

676
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,060
What do you call the dash?

677
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,020
Dash.

678
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:41,140
Dash, I-E, cookie-y.

679
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,580
Oh, they went I-E.

680
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,980
Interesting.

681
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:45,340
Cookie-y.

682
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,420
Okay.

683
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:51,420
Yes, oh, this is the wildest beginning of a press release.

684
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:54,140
Always siding with deliciousness,

685
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,460
Krispy Kreme is partnering with Twix.

686
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:02,020
What is that, who is choosing sides in this battle?

687
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,300
Where is this conflict?

688
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,860
Count Donut, you're not around all the time,

689
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,620
but there are sometimes where a restaurant will come up

690
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,540
and be like, we wanted to do something shitty and bad.

691
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,180
And it's like, oh man, why would you guys announce that?

692
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,020
I guess they say, we'll see.

693
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,820
Krispy Kreme is partnering with Twix

694
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,740
for the first time ever to create three all new

695
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,740
caramel-y, cookie-y, country donuts,

696
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:30,020
including, boys, stuffing an entire Twix cookie bar

697
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,460
inside the delicious Krispy Kreme doughnut.

698
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,260
That's not how I would have done it.

699
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,060
No.

700
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,100
I feel so bad for the teenagers that work at Krispy Kreme.

701
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,300
February 21st for a limited time.

702
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,980
Yes, they make them put their own personal Twix.

703
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,540
I brought this Twix from home.

704
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,380
Put it in there.

705
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,860
That's a great idea, put it in there.

706
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,700
Anything for our-

707
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,740
This is the long term.

708
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,580
Yeah.

709
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,460
So the caramel cookie crunch bar doughnut

710
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,060
filled with a Twix cookie bar.

711
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,100
Fucking, that's a sentence that I-

712
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,740
No, it's just the name of a doughnut.

713
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,980
This is how I will order it.

714
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,580
Hello, Jeremy.

715
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:12,380
I'll have the caramel cookie crunch bar doughnut

716
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,900
filled with the Twix cookie bar.

717
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,380
A bar-shaped doughnut.

718
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,740
I should fucking hope so.

719
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,180
That would be wild, yes.

720
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,540
If it was a ring doughnut with a fucking Twix

721
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:27,900
shoved through it, you'd be sent to prison.

722
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:30,660
The Twix shaper is here.

723
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,740
This is our first non-Euclidean offering.

724
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,780
So it's what it sounds, it does what it says on the tin.

725
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,260
A bar-shaped doughnut filled with chocolate cream

726
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:48,700
and a full-sized Twix bar dipped in chocolate icing

727
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:53,580
drizzled with dotre de leche and chocolate icing

728
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,460
and topped with, you guessed it, even more Twix pieces.

729
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,740
I wouldn't have guessed that in my darkest fantasies.

730
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,900
Then there's the caramel cookie crunch original

731
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,220
filled doughnut topped with Twix cookie bar pieces.

732
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:10,140
A chocolate iced doughnut with salted caramel filling

733
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:15,140
topped with Twix bar pieces and drizzled with dotre de leche.

734
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,460
This all sounds like too much.

735
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,300
I love Twix.

736
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,820
Sounds like a little bit too much.

737
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,260
This all seems like too much.

738
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,380
We are, oh, this is Dave Skinner.

739
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,540
You've guessed this already, but we are always looking

740
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,740
for new ways to provide our fans

741
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,620
an awesome doughnut experience.

742
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,460
And until that comes along,

743
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,980
we want to enter a settling for cookies in doughnuts.

744
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,060
We're just gonna start shoving stuff in, seeing what works.

745
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:42,060
Set us free.

746
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,020
Tell us it's good enough, please, Dad.

747
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,340
I mean, oops, what?

748
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,780
We've partnered with another iconic brand, Twix,

749
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,940
for the first time ever.

750
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,140
They don't know it yet.

751
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,660
We just think that we bought all of the Twix.

752
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,460
That's why we've had to hide them in size so cleverly.

753
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,940
We created mini and fun-sized doughnuts made

754
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:07,780
with Twix bars and then went even further

755
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,180
to create a bar-shaped doughnut

756
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,260
with a full-sized Twix bar in the middle.

757
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,420
Some said we should stop while we were ahead,

758
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,860
but we didn't listen to them.

759
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,580
We were so worried about if we could,

760
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,220
we didn't stop to think about if we should,

761
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,420
and now we're selling it.

762
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,820
Please buy these doughnuts.

763
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,660
You can tweet about them with a hashtag if you wish.

764
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,580
Don't.

765
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,580
This is an option that is available to you.

766
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,540
Don't.

767
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,700
They're available for a limited time,

768
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,260
so get there quickly.

769
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,540
I think these people are just compensating

770
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,620
for the fact that they are not Jolly Pirates.

771
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,460
No, yeah, no baby beats the old man.

772
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,300
Listen.

773
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:43,300
No baby beats the old man,

774
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,340
no Twix cookie beats the old man, neither.

775
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,740
Now, if you end up tweeting about this,

776
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:49,620
which I'm not encouraging you to,

777
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,940
encourage them to do Zagnut next.

778
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,780
It's huge.

779
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,380
Say like, oh, this is great, do Zagnut next.

780
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:01,860
Or like a zero bar, put a zero bar in there.

781
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,940
That was an all-timer count, thank you.

782
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:07,660
Yes, well, it's a pleasure.

783
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,220
You sound really tired, Count, are you okay?

784
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,380
I just haven't drank enough blood.

785
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,180
Oh, wait, you actually kill people?

786
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,660
Yeah, I kill them to eat them.

787
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,860
Are they all bad people?

788
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,420
Aren't we all, though?

789
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,900
Oh, man, that's a good question.

790
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:29,900
One of my favorite Bazooka Joe comics once read,

791
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,820
all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.

792
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,980
That was on a Bazooka Joe, huh?

793
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:38,140
Yes, it's one of my favorite,

794
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,940
I, or it may be your Christian Bible,

795
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,220
I hold them in the same esteem.

796
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,060
Oh, wow.

797
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,900
Either way.

798
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,340
Big things are being said on this episode

799
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,180
that we can't take back.

800
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,620
Hey, Count Dona, I had a thought the other day,

801
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,820
I want to run by you.

802
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,100
This is not the segment.

803
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:51,940
If I get an-

804
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,020
I only talk about donuts here, and then I leave.

805
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:58,260
If I get an IV where the water has been blessed by a priest

806
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:01,140
and then you drink my blood, will it hurt you?

807
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,620
Like, if I got a holy water IV-

808
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,100
It's a simple question, Count Dona.

809
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,980
What don't you understand?

810
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,540
If I got a holy water IV and then you drink my blood,

811
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,420
will it hurt you?

812
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,700
Uh, no.

813
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,540
Oh.

814
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:20,140
You're, because it would be mixed with your blood,

815
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,820
which has been contaminated by original sin.

816
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:27,380
It's really, it's the cumin of blood.

817
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,900
The most delicious is the original sin.

818
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:32,820
That's what we go, wow.

819
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:35,860
Sorry, Count Dona, I actually have extra crispy sin.

820
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,540
So, yeah, that's the good stuff right there.

821
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,540
It does, oh, it's a lot of work to pump through there,

822
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,460
but it's all the sweeter.

823
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,820
You got, you opted for chunky stuff.

824
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,820
Yeah, I can feel it moving all the time and hear it.

825
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,660
Love that.

826
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,500
Yeah, it's a real problem.

827
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,540
I can hear it through drums.

828
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,380
Oh, yeah?

829
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,700
Hey, Count Dona, you're not gonna hurt me, right?

830
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:57,540
Yeah, Count Dona,

831
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,620
this has been your most upsetting appearance today.

832
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,780
Sleep well.

833
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,620
Oh, boy.

834
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,820
Oh, hey, guys, here's the problem.

835
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,260
And Justin, I'm sorry you have to hear this.

836
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,700
I don't think we can kill Count Dona

837
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,940
without killing Justin.

838
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:10,500
Yeah, but-

839
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,060
Who's Count, sorry, who's Count Dona?

840
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:12,900
Oh, you know who he is.

841
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,860
Now, Justin, you know.

842
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,100
You know he's the donut obsessed,

843
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,780
but actual vampire that drinks blood,

844
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:23,580
the vampire that takes over your body to do munch squads

845
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,860
relating specifically to donuts.

846
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,700
And people love him.

847
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,220
They think he's super funny.

848
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:30,100
Yeah, but he was just,

849
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,260
I'm not gonna say overtly threatening, but-

850
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,900
But a little bit.

851
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,460
Inefficently, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

852
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,740
And I'm not saying we have to slay him,

853
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,220
but it's there if we need it.

854
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:46,060
Do we have time for another question?

855
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:47,140
Yeah.

856
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,980
There's a question I wanna include here

857
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:51,900
because we got two questions this week.

858
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,300
And I think this will be simple,

859
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,180
but I think this is an important PSA here.

860
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,540
So I'm gonna read them.

861
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,580
I'm gonna tell you why I included them.

862
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,700
Recently, I used a shuttle service

863
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,620
from airport parking to the main terminal.

864
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:04,860
The only people on the shuttle were me and the driver.

865
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,940
When I boarded, she asked me

866
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,620
if I was flying Spirit Airlines, and I said, no.

867
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,940
She responded with, oh, you look like you fly Spirit.

868
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,820
I've used Spirit once or twice when traveling,

869
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,420
but brothers, this is the wildest comment I've ever heard.

870
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,620
What could this possibly mean?

871
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,220
And that's from Vax in Virginia.

872
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,540
And then this question.

873
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:22,460
I recently moved into an apartment building

874
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,260
where a lot of elderly folks live.

875
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,140
Recently, I was getting on the elevator

876
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,660
just as an older couple was exiting,

877
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:31,860
and they said to me, we warmed it up for you.

878
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,740
What does that mean?

879
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:34,100
And what am I supposed to say to that?

880
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,580
I laughed awkwardly and said, thanks, and got on.

881
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:37,780
That's from Baffledon, BC.

882
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,980
In which way are these two related?

883
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,020
I'm gonna tell you, Griffin.

884
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,900
Okay.

885
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,300
I know that it has been two years

886
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,900
with very little human contact.

887
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,020
Sometimes people just say things.

888
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,420
People just say shit, yeah.

889
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,820
And they don't mean anything.

890
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,780
Sometimes there's just, they see a void in the air,

891
00:59:57,780 --> 00:59:59,500
and they want to fill it with something.

892
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,260
This is like when you buy a movie theater ticket, right?

893
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,620
And they say, enjoy the movie, and you say, you too.

894
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,100
That person that sold you the tickets,

895
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,100
they're like, what do they mean by that?

896
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,300
What do they know that I don't know?

897
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,060
They're like, huh, they just said something.

898
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:14,020
Sometimes people just say things.

899
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,460
And I go through these questions every week, folks.

900
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,500
And 90% of them are like, listen,

901
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,500
that person just opened their mouth,

902
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,380
and some just dumb shit came out.

903
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:25,100
They weren't thinking about it,

904
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,100
but now it's in your head for weeks.

905
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:29,860
You have to process it.

906
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,060
Sometimes people just, when their older couple said,

907
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:34,660
we warmed it up for you, they didn't mean shit by that.

908
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,500
No.

909
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,540
Well, unless.

910
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,380
Unless.

911
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,140
It farted a bunch?

912
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,460
Ripping real dozers.

913
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,300
Thank you, Travis.

914
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,140
Thank you.

915
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,660
Hey, thanks, Travis.

916
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,780
You paused a long time, Griffin.

917
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,980
I know, because it was gonna be so fucking funny

918
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,820
when I said-

919
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,660
Oh, wait, can you say it again?

920
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,540
No, you're interrupting me now while I'm explaining it.

921
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,980
So just listen to me.

922
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:56,820
Okay, what were you gonna say?

923
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,620
It was gonna be really funny if I waited a long time,

924
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,740
and then I was like, we're ripping big dozers.

925
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,340
Like, that's what I do on this show.

926
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:05,060
It's like, I go quiet for a little while.

927
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,900
It's like a tactical thing.

928
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,180
And the longer I go quiet, people are like,

929
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,300
what twisted shit is this fucking sicko about to say?

930
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,180
And then, but I can't now,

931
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,380
when you're talking and saying like,

932
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,060
he's about to say some stuff about farts.

933
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,020
Well, no, go ahead and say it.

934
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,860
No, it's too late.

935
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,580
You really took the wind out of my sails.

936
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,140
Literally.

937
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,580
No, not literally.

938
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:26,820
Not literally, he doesn't have a sail.

939
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,980
No, because it's farts are the wind.

940
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,420
I love that Travis had to say,

941
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,700
sometimes people just say words.

942
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,540
Yeah.

943
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,380
Like, that's like-

944
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:36,500
If there's one lesson you're gonna take away from me,

945
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,340
is that sometimes people just are awkward in silence

946
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,860
and have to say fucking something,

947
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,580
because there's too long of a pause and a break,

948
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:44,060
and they're like, oh no, oh no, oh no,

949
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,020
I gotta say something.

950
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:46,780
We warmed it up for you.

951
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:47,620
Thank God.

952
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,460
Oh, I almost had to think about my own thoughts

953
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,300
for a second.

954
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:54,020
Anyway, I hope that helps.

955
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:55,500
Some people just say things sometimes.

956
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,420
Sometimes we want to say shit.

957
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,900
There's nothing we can do about that.

958
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:01,300
And you can just let it go.

959
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,340
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

960
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:06,300
We hope you have enjoyed yourself,

961
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,860
been edified, educated, entertained, all the three.

962
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:10,700
All the-

963
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,540
The big ones.

964
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,460
The ones that we aim for.

965
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,660
What else is going on, Trav?

966
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:16,980
You're usually so promotional.

967
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,660
Well, I want to tell you,

968
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:22,660

Anyways, go check it out.

973

01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,860

975
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,700

Go check it out.

983
01:02:58,660 --> 01:02:59,820

Can you try again?

985
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,500
Yeah.

986
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,180
Season one was called the year's funniest animated comedy.

987
01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:09,060
And it's available on Hulu at bit.ly slash Dicktown.

988
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:12,820
It's only 111 minutes long, the whole season,

992
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:22,380
finally on the verge of fame, local TV style,

993
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,500
and maybe even a steady bank account.

994
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,820
Episodes premiere at 10 p.m. on FXX

995

A lot of people try and get ahold of venues

1015

You do a final bit every week.

1062
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,500
Did you forget?

Travis, am I wrong?

1066
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,340
No, I believe that this has been the case

1067
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:58,620
or it's been different.

1068
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,060
You've been workshopping different bits to close with.

1069
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,420
Oh, okay.

1070
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:04,820
Well, okay.

01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:16,740
I'm gonna say Seth Rogen.

1079
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:18,820
Yeah, Seth Rogen, that's good.

1080
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:19,660
He's a fellow podcast-

1081
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,500

1082
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,340

Say something about McLovin.

1086
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,420
I wanna hear him say McLovin.

01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:38,820
Come on, McLovin, pass me that fat fucking bong.

1088

It's better with you, cause it's true.
