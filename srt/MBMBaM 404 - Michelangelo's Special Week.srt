1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother my brother made advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,120
your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy. I am your sweet

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,400
baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary girlfriend McElroy. Speaking of babies, yes,

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,360
they done did the thing they had another there's another royal baby who I saw a lot of uh news

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,040
outlets just simply referring to as second boy which I thought was really funny boy you're the

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,400
second boy second boy can be third boy yeah yes you can be the third boy you can be best boy key

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,480
grip three boy me who me three boy I love this new baby I can't wait for him to reign over all us

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,800
yes I can't wait to follow this baby's every command die in his beautiful army I like second

13
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:43,120
boy I question their decision to have invoiced by will arnett it's a little much who even wins in

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,880
the fight between the boss baby and the king baby right amazing yeah because I think boss baby would

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,960
make you know goo goo gaga hand me my briefcase but king baby's like die in my army kick boy boss

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,480
baby I also think that the crossover when they added the minions to work for a second boy that

17
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,200
was what are they even little yellow babies I don't even know they look like tic tacs what's

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,600
going on there what's up I do love that they call the future king baby they named him Ralph I think

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,240
hysterical and the way prince the prince of him the bad prince yeah lowered his sunglasses

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,880
when he said it is like the baby oh he'll be king ralph and then he liked and then the

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,320
banners dropped which I thought was pretty cool it's so good when I was getting my haircut

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,960
the person cutting my hair talked to me completely unironically I thought you were just gonna stop

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,920
there no completely ironically at length about the new baby second boy and it seems like that

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,800
should be against the law because it was a lot of like you could tell like comments like you could

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,480
tell that they really love each other and I think it's really nice the baby is being raised in such

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:06,800
a loving environment and I mean a lot of different things that I had a lot of comments that I had to

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,080
ingest about the baby king and it seems like unfair cut in that position right I can't I'm

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,960
captive I'm a hair so sorry Justin I'm sorry I just want to clarify please king baby because

29
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,800
baby king sounds like the king of babies might be I think that might be how it works baby is a

30
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Kate Beaton book that I don't want to I don't want to step on Kate's trademark

31
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
what have you all brought for the king baby I thought maybe we could take a moment here

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,960
present him with our it's our new segment hold on what's your tribute all right oh sweet baby

33
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,640
happy birthday welcome to earth you're gonna make such a special impact I brought you something

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,440
that you don't have over here across the pond a fishy ships but I'm so sorry for that king

35
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,160
baby but anyway here is my tribute for you please do not dragoon me into your crusade

36
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,080
but I did bring you all my old tech decks and you are gonna love these maybe maybe daddy can show

37
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,640
you because of harry harry harry you remember harry you remember griffin harry's the uncle

38
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,480
who's the daddy that's william bill king bill king bill you remember doing the flips because harry is

39
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,960
the prunkle prince uncle now oh you're right okay let me take it again okay uh bill you remember

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,320
oh you swallowed him you swallowed all the tech no oh his guts are skateboarding around doing vert

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:44,400
ramps off the big intestine oh shoot guys I'm so sorry I shit it up real bad travis what's your

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:54,720
tribute um my tribute is myself I have been um working out um I so that I can defend uh king

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:04,080
baby what a sweet boy oh happy birthday you know justin he's here what did your what's your tribute

44
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,120
can you do the can you do the jingling I can't remember what's your tribute mine's mustard and

45
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,440
yeah because if the baby may be young for mustard now but if we start the baby on mustard at 12

46
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
months uh maybe it's actually six months we can start with mustard because it's not solid food

47
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,880
if we start the baby with mustard at six months then by the time he has reached fluency with

48
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:38,240
adulthood you know what I mean then he'll be the one that loves mustard and I might

49
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,320
have a shot at telling these fucking people apart when I am being told about their various

50
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,680
exploits and so the mustard it can all be in reference for me at least I'll have one fucking

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,880
king touchstone where I can say is that the mom of the one who loves mustard is that the one who

52
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:03,280
loves mustard's cousin is that the son of the one who loves mustard at least I'll have something

53
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,960
that can help me decode that explains the t-shirt when they presented royal baby to the crowds the

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,040
t-shirt that said I'll be your anchor point or king baby is your constant that's what my constant

55
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,640
royal family could that apparently people over here are just gaga for even though we we threw

56
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:27,280
off their shackles of their rule they are now ruling our social media and what have you through

57
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,200
these extremely important babies that everyone is just just gaga over if you'll pardon the

58
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,320
did you not hear me earlier when I said I say I uh thank you I'm reinforcing your bet oh thank you

59
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,400
thank you so much oh king baby oh what if dastardly first baby then decides that they

60
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,000
also like mustard just in your whole plans got no one else can have mustard okay period the end

61
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,760
good luck enforcing that Sydney brought something out to me that I the only thing I think is

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,640
interesting about the royal family besides the one who loves mustard the new baby who probably

63
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:12,240
does have a name um prince mustard prince mustard did you realize that every time they crank out

64
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,400
another one it kicks harry down another notch in the lineage boy that's got to be a mixed bag of

65
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,520
emotions huh you know I thought about that's cool so I'm six now huh okay cool so it's just the one

66
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:36,480
baby boy and then the baby girl and then this other baby and then great y'all too nice I'm not

67
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,400
the duke of uh north North Shenshire anymore cool that's the babies now great can't wait to see how

68
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,720
they run it so I guess I'll just hand over the paperwork great here's my scepter baby enjoy

69
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,560
enjoy that scepter uh excuse me erry could you scoot down please could you scoot down but there's

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:05,120
no more there's no more bench uh-huh we'll just pull up a folding chair for you harry at the end

71
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:13,200
there harry thank you make some room for me to put this fucking uh car seat that I pulled out

72
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm just gonna sit here at our very fancy uh uh secession table I think that maybe like there's

73
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:27,040
but there's benefits to it too I maybe like every time there's a new royal baby prince harry like

74
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,520
things like oh I'm one step closer to being able to get that face tattoo I've always wanted you

75
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,480
know like oh yeah no chance yeah it's no chance oh yeah yeah oh finally oh I'm so close to just

76
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,600
being able to retire you know what I mean because like right being a prince for life isn't bad but

77
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,480
if it's like oh no you're the you know you're gonna get the call man you're on call that's a

78
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,120
lot of pressure to be ready to king at any point you know just take over it at any point it's it's

79
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,600
terrifying too much and that's it okay shoo 10 minutes we did it everybody got 10 minutes out

80
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
of the royal family not get it twisted that is gonna end up being a tight five and a half by the

81
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,920
time okay well we have recorded for 10 minutes and honestly that's all I can do uh that's as far

82
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,360
as I can that the whole episode that's that's basically the entire no we got all all kinds of

83
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:26,800
fun stuff I live on the third and top story of a walk up with one other neighbor sharing the

84
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,000
landing outside my door I do not know these neighbors well but I've seen them passing

85
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
sometimes they will put a bag of trash outside their door to be taken down later this does not

86
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,200
bother me because I know they have young children it would be difficult for them to run the trash

87
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,240
down every time it's full thank you occasionally when I'm taking my own trash down or taking my

88
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,840
dog out I think oh I should just grab that and run it down for them then I stop and think no don't

89
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:57,760
do that they will go crazy trying to figure out what happened to their trash is that too weird

90
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,200
or just something a nice neighbor would do what should I do that's from Waste Bag Weirdo in

91
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,520
Washington first of all they're not the stupids so they're not gonna think somebody's stolen their

92
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,280
trash and you need to perish that thought nobody on earth would ever be upset at their trash going

93
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,640
away and in fact if you did that to my house I would name my next child after you it was gonna

94
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,680
be Prince Mustard but I will name them Waste Bag Weirdo in Washington if you did this for me to

95
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,800
never touch that trash again this is such a bad thing because you put out your trash and you set

96
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,480
it down but not in the can and it's like oh I got a date with you later don't I stinky bag

97
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,800
I think maybe maybe you take the trash bag and you leave a quarter

98
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,400
and you start to develop like a whole mythos about like the trash trash fairy yeah I think that

99
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,600
yeah a fairy can lift a tooth the tooth is quite small I don't think they're gonna have the you

100
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,320
know the guns to lift up a full bag full of probably diapers which are the heaviest the

101
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,080
heaviest substance on earth is diapers trash gremlin trash gremlin could be fun but then

102
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,640
it couldn't be a quarter it'd have to be like a little buggy worm or something yeah a little

103
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,960
grubbing I think you're creating behavior with this that it that will be damaging to this person

104
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:26,160
in the long run uh because if if one time I put my trash outside my front door and it disappeared

105
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,600
I would never ever ever carry my trash down again never you've taught me that some that somehow

106
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,520
it's getting down there so I would not go through the extra work of taking it all the way down for

107
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,240
the rest of my life your mind is so good at filling in gaps especially when those gaps involve

108
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,080
touching the trash ever again or doing any work ever I would just assume that like the police

109
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,880
have started doing this for us like oh yeah the police have a new service so they'll come into our

110
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,440
walk up and then go up to the third floor and they'll just grab the trash out of there thanks

111
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
I sure am glad we elected that new mayor yeah really taking care of the church I will say

112
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
that the problem here is if you do this consistently to Justin's point if you do this

113
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,360
like four times in a row right and then on the fifth time you don't and they open the door and

114
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,920
the trash is still there they're gonna be like oh no is neighbor person mad at us I am incapable of

115
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,600
not just taking the trash to the can and putting it in there because 100% of the time a trash bag

116
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,840
is gonna have chicken juice in it and I don't care if you're a vegan and it doesn't have chicken

117
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,840
juice in it I don't care if it's just if it's just lawn clippings that you did from your apartment

118
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,560
where you have inside grass and you put that in a bag and you put it out on the floor outside

119
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,920
you're gonna have a big chicken juice puddle it is just the default state of trash they gonna

120
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,960
they're gonna find the bones and there will be raccoons that are gonna pull bones out of it even

121
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:56,240
if there's not bones they'll find a bone in there there's a bone in there somewhere and they're

122
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,040
gonna find it raccoons I was just gonna say that I've been running a long-term scam on my trash

123
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,720
guys where that I bring my adorable children out to thank them every time they come get the trash

124
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,840
and that is one because it's just a nice thing to do it's probably kind of a thankless job all the

125
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,280
time so I like to go out there and say thank you and you know leave a nice tip around the holidays

126
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,120
you know I like to take care of them so I can throw progressively weirder things away not just

127
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,920
weirder but bigger like every time I don't like like I'll send Charlie out there and we'll kind

128
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,360
of like wave because I'm afraid to go out by myself because I hate watching their reactions to

129
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,120
see what they think about the things that I've tried to throw away because I'll try to throw away

130
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,240
a lot of things that I probably should take somewhere where grown-ups will handle it for me

131
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,640
and when they do a double take at it when they do a double take there's only so many times you can

132
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:55,840
say I know right before you just have to stop doing it my Christmas tree is the one that I feel

133
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,360
juice just yeah because it's like there's certainly a place those are supposed to go

134
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,440
but I don't know where or how so I just put that out there it's lucky that it comes right after

135
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,840
that good old Christmas tip yeah because hopefully that's still fresh in their minds when they think

136
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,040
I'll just throw this dead ass tree in my truck do you do you wrap it up like Laura Palmer you just

137
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:26,640
like leave it out there wrapped in plastic okay uh how about a yahoo there's bang go ahead in the

138
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:38,560
percolator uh it's from merit palm it's from yahoo answers user uh they're anonymous so I'm

139
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:51,040

140
00:14:51,040 --> 00:15:05,120
sorry where is this from when is this from oh that's a good question a week ago a week ago

141
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,680

142
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,920
escape hatch because it'll be good forever um so we never talk about the you know the

143
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,000
the bull and the bear that we like to wrestle with sometimes that we call the stock market

144
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,040
because it can be so exciting and you put your money in and then you see what happens maybe good

145
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:39,680
nothing ever goes wrong sometime it goes wrong uh pets.com went bad um oh shit did not work out

146
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,400
pets.com did i be honest i haven't checked in a while i put a lot of money into pets.com

147
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,000
all right well check actually do see oh you know what it just bumped back up

148
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,440
you just made a million dollars and that's every day you did put in a billion dollars though

149
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:01,120
that's every day that's every day on this market that we call stock because it's so exciting and so

150
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,680
this person either has many dollars invested in yahoo and doesn't know how to read the little

151
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,600
ticker uh which i don't blame them for it's like i don't know what the symbol is for yahoo um if

152
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,120
it's any indication of like what their service is actually like it's just farts it says like farts

153
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,360
negative a million percent no money left but knowing what we know about this service is yahoo

154
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:32,480
a good stock well it okay here's the thing if you think about it isn't everything a stock market

155
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,080
you know because you're like you're choosing to invest in friendship or you're choosing to invest

156
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,640
in like fandom or you're choosing so maybe we should look at this as like if am i is as yahoo

157
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:55,040
answers a good thing for me to invest my time and brainwaves into which is no but then again

158
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,520
we we invested in it 404 episodes ago real hard and it's paid off it's paid off big dividends for

159
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,080
us but i do love the idea of a friend stock market because you just be like how's terry doing like

160
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,280
actually that one thought it was a blue chip way in the red on that one farted right in my car and

161
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:20,000
so it took a big downturn the terry stock sell sell sell get rid of terry sell terry anybody

162
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,560
looking to pick up some terry i got i got terry for dimes on the dollar come on i used to think

163
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,280
hey do you want to hang out today todd oh i can't actually chuck bought up all my terry stock

164
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,800
stock i'll tell you about my terry stock i gotta i gotta go and uh divest but i heard he got uh

165
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,640
recently some butt surgery so this one's looking real good uh a lot of upswings in the future

166
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,240
you know how you always see the people running around all higgledy-piggledy on the the floor of

167
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,680
the stock market whenever people are talking about it that's like the image that you see like

168
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,880
everybody going buck wild out there with all like papers in hand and they're yelling about stuff

169
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:08,320
until a an upsettingly recent point i thought that when they sold a stock they had to find

170
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,120
someone to sell it to i thought that they had to find someone who would be like yo buy that

171
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,760
i thought that's why they were running around so wild because they were trying to find somebody

172
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,360
who would buy the best i got i got like 100 chiquita shares anybody like bananas i've got

173
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,160
kids i like bananas i got you good price do i'm doing trades if anybody's got one of the

174
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,880
walt disney world commemorative pins from the like 87 debut i got a pikachu anybody need a

175
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,040
pikachu for chiquita i got 100 chiquitas 100 chiquitas for like a bulbasaur maybe i don't

176
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,160
know how this works got a cadabra i'm looking for 10 shares of google this dude's gonna evolve when

177
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,120
i trade him so that's that's a that's a money earner right there justin if it makes you feel

178
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,480
any better i'm 34 i still don't 100 know what this could be fun so they run around the stock market

179
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,240
floor and they got the pieces of paper that i guess have either the stocks on it or an

180
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,480
amount of money that they have and it's just a way of sort of really thin pieces of paper

181
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,160
because i think they can't afford like thick paper yeah yeah they're famously uh unwealthy

182
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,920
so let's go around and just sort of describe how we think stock market works uh and justin maybe

183
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:33,360
you can start with it i well i feel like i described how i i did think that that it went

184
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,040
yeah um uh you roll up you show up you you get out of your fancy car and you walk inside you

185
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:46,320
have a few slips of paper that i guess say like you know uh yo play yo play basketball and eggs

186
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,600
these are my three stocks i want to get in the stock market yeah i call this is how i understand

187
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:59,440
i call somebody who knows somebody that lives in new york and that and they will go there to buy

188
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,360
the yahoo for me yeah and they'll say like justin wants to buy yahoo who's got yahoo who's who's

189
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,440
hitting who's got yahoo to sell and maybe nobody wants to sell theirs and that's how stock prices

190
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:19,440
go up because everybody wants to have some yahoo uh-huh and then and then oh no things have taken

191
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:27,600
a downward no one wants yahoo no one wants yahoo and then it's very easy to find it because

192
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,720
everybody's they're just dropping it on the ground like it's a racetrack i thought legitimately that

193
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,360
the papers in their hand were the shares i thought that that was like when people talk about shares

194
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,880
in movies they open up old boxes and they're like what this is a hundred shares of telephones or

195
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,800
whatever right i will say how i always thought it worked okay travis please um because you see them

196
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:54,320
and they're like yelling kind of up into the air like i'll take whatever i always assume there's

197
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,520
like one person who's like writing all that down who's like slow down slow down what did you say

198
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,320
how much did you okay i'll see if that is a bit wait what did you hold on who who said it first

199
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:14,000
everybody get in line or something what if i go to stock market and i have a slip of paper and i say

200
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,880
y'all is a hot one i'm looking for a lot of money like 500 like 500 dollars and you can get

201
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,040
all my shares in apples and then they see the slip of paper and it says apple in big letters

202
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:35,040
they're like yeah sure here's 500 and then i say thanks and i take all the bills away from them

203
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,680
and then they look at it and it does say apple in big letters but then there's a small s at the end

204
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:48,160
of it because i've just sold them shares in apples the fruit and then now i'm 500 richer and nobody

205
00:21:48,160 --> 00:22:01,840
eats fucking apples anymore is that legal yes yes i gotta go then uh here is another uh question

206
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,160
for one of our beloved readers so my girlfriend goes to college and she is very into geology and

207
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:16,560
rocks at her school her geology teacher tried to get her set up on a date with his nephew who was

208
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:23,840
a geologist she said no thank you i have a boyfriend to which he responded is your boyfriend a geologist

209
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:30,480
didn't think so brothers do i need to fear these rock experts stealing my girlfriend

210
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,400
must i become a rock expert to keep my four-year relationship intact that's from demolished in

211
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,760
detroit yeah yeah yeah you're gonna have to get super into rocks yeah learn about rocks and we

212
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:53,360
can help you with that limestone i get bag it big gray geodes heavy small brown concrete

213
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:05,440
concrete volcano rock some of the hardest rock there is salt is a bunch of delicious rocks

214
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,400
tasty rocks melt in your mouth rock candy candy is not well rock candy yes thank you also those

215
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,040
pebbles that kind of look it's candy that looks like fruity pebbles the rock the rock is another

216
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:28,640
one rock and roll yeah the music blue dream maui wowie magnets how do they work different

217
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:38,000
strains i think this helps i did yes here's the thing no one actually knows anything about rocks

218
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,720
how would you even look into a rock so you can say anything is inside of a rock and no one knows

219
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,520
that is such a good point travis thank you yeah so like i'm so fucking glad you said that dude

220
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,480
because it was fucking good so like you could like take your girlfriend out on a date to like

221
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,360
a canyon or whatever and point and be like see that that's full of dead fish or whatever and

222
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,680
like who the fuck knows you can't see through rocks no one's got to find out what's in that

223
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,160
rock so you can say whatever i think you gotta show up to the school and i think you gotta pick

224
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:13,040
up the biggest rock they have and i think you need to take a big bite out of it and then you

225
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,880
chew it up talk about how big and strong your hands are you chew it up and you swallow it and

226
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,960
you look at it and be like this is the stuff you guys are into okay and then you shred on the

227
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,920
guitar and then you leave and then go immediately to the hospital oh time is of the essence right

228
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:36,880
away um that that fraggle rock flavor is such a power booth and they're gonna love it so good

229
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,800
though it always looks so good i get really excited when i'm like down when i'm kayaking

230
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,520
when i'm hitting the yak and i find a rock that has like a fossil in it but do you think when

231
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,560
a geologist finds out they're like fuck this rock is ruined yeah so let's go let's walk through that

232
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,520
step by step if you don't mind travis um just parse it we're learning a lot this time while

233
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,520
you're hitting the yak uh-huh and you see a rock big enough i guess to stick out of the water and

234
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:14,080
there's half a tyrannosaur just sort of poking out of it um you see that often well you know

235
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,000
it's more like you you you pull your boat over you pull your yak over to the side and you skip

236
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,520
rocks for a couple hours and maybe one in like a thousand has got like a leaf imprint on it

237
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,480
or a little dinosaur or a little dinosaur yeah and then you think well i should hold on to this

238
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,440
and then you don't yeah i mean what if you pull out a diamond you're like i was looking for

239
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,000
limestone and you throw that away because you're such a fucking idiot or one time i was eating

240
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,600
some oysters and i found a pearl and i don't know what i did with that i lost that shit that's a

241
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:57,200
good story am i a good geologist one easy way to make it seem like you know more about rocks than

242
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:04,000
you do if you're wanting to to maybe not put the time in is try to more frequently point out when

243
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,040
something isn't a rock oh you're walking down the street you see um a fire hydrant or grass

244
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:24,960
yeah maybe a big rock oh no okay don't do it to rocks don't do it to rocks no wait is the

245
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,200
statue a rock good question travis statue of liberty big green rock yes or no who knows

246
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,000
now that one's metal i do know that one but what about like you know that david statue that's made

247
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,040
a rock is that a rock oh all right they gotta come up with a better name for that david statue

248
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:51,680
by the way i know right what about that 70s show you know what i mean just name it something even

249
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:58,000
if it's like david presented by pens oil or something yeah it's like just give me some

250
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,400
kind of name for it what about what about dave's real proud of his dick dave's wiener

251
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:14,640
peep peep dave's ween don't cover up dave's ween fucking peep it peep this way keep your fig leaf

252
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,840
which is not a rock in case you're curious what if you had a dog made of rocks is that a rock or

253
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,560
is it a dog oh god that's a good question i'm just saying geology's hard i respect you geologists

254
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,760
we're finally getting into some smart stuff which i've obviously been wanting for a long time

255
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,840
it's so nice to give us some science on this one y'all let's get into this when when michelangelo

256
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,600
was carving the statue of david uh-huh probably took a long time right right like probably several

257
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,880
weeks most of that's been on the ween well that's the question okay okay he finishes arm torso head

258
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,200
hair face legs did he save the ween for last i'm not saying he was like grossed out by it but did

259
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,880
he know like his friend leonardo was talking to him like what's what do you got going on tomorrow

260
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,920
did he have even the thought of like well tomorrow's tomorrow's the weener day like he had

261
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,440
to have some sort of was it in his google calendar like or did he just do it and it you know

262
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,760
perish the thought not a second thought about it or he had to at least for a second be like this is

263
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,640
the thing that people are gonna be arguing about for a while i really gotta nail this dingus i'm

264
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,000
gonna bring one actual fact into this discussion and then we can go from there i know david

265
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,440
david according to google according to a quick google took two years working constantly

266
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,480
jesus get better jackhammer dude hey dude you're working really hard on this just to make it out

267
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,400
of cheese did you lick did you lick it and erode it with your spit what's your deal michelangelo

268
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,800
realistically it took two years to make was there a weener month

269
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:02,240
one i'm saying how long do you think he spent on the was there a whole month where he's they're

270
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,560
like come to dinner and like i can't i have to keep working i wish i could i wish i could but

271
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:14,000
i want to make this penis look very good tell you what you come over you stare at this penis

272
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,760
if you think it looks done then i'll come to dinner but otherwise let me go back to the lab

273
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:28,400
and let me keep getting this penis with a tiny chisel and the bush and the and the bush too like

274
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,400
he had to how do you the rest of it i get i want this torso to look fucking cut and it is ripped

275
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:40,160
awesome nips perfect everything's great weiner i think he just did it he probably look at his own

276
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,160
wiener just be like all right that's a wiener but the bush he had to have a moment and again

277
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,680
i'm not stigmatizing i'm not saying he was like oh gross a bush but he had to make a judgment call

278
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,200
at some point like he had his chisel this was probably an entire this was a week he had a week

279
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
where he just kept moving his chisel up and down the pubis like where does it where do we begin

280
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:08,000
i've done some quick math yeah the david statue is 17 feet tall so 17 feet what that's much larger

281
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,840
than i how much of that though is the fucking pedestal it's standing on yeah well but it's

282
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:20,320
17 feet tall divided by 24 months means that every month he crafted 0.7 so like about three

283
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,880
quarters of a foot right so nine inches so yes i could say that just statistically speaking there

284
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,080
was a wiener month okay so how was your september michael angelo it was it was intense do you think

285
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,880
he had a moment after he finished the belly button and i assume that this is the way statues work

286
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,600
where you just sort of start at the top and work your way down uh-huh do you think he had a moment

287
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,440
after he finished the belly button where he thought i should just put shorts on this motherfucking guy

288
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,280
i should just give this guy so much easier if i just get some fucking shorts on the do you

289
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,800
do you think he ever had a moment when he was working on the penis and it got very challenging

290
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:06,240
and irritating after like a couple weeks in where he's like i'm just gonna knock this fucking thing

291
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,960
knock this fucking thing off and draw some shorts on this guy i'm just i can't do this right now i'm

292
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:16,400
just gonna put some fucking shorts on it or maybe just like got shorts it's just like how do i get

293
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,880
these shorts i'm just gonna buy shorts and put them on this way that's why it took two years

294
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,680
because it only took him a year to carve it but the original version had shorts and everybody came

295
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,720
in going i don't know about the shorts and he was like chisel those off another another possibility

296
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,960
is that he knew the statue you wanted to make didn't want to like waste a lot of time on it

297
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,720
so he tried to find a big rock that already had a dick on it oh so like when you whittle and you're

298
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,480
like oh this is the perfect shape of like a bear and a log or whatever yeah this one is he looked

299
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,680
for this was probably one of the years him wandering around probably like greece or something

300
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,640
looking for the perfect the perfect rock right dimensions uh easy density to carve into

301
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,160
a fully formed dick just kind of hanging off the side and now we're now that's what i call a statue

302
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,720
and it's good that the it wasn't like it probably wasn't way out on the inside or else david the

303
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,840
final product would be like a dude like leaning backward arching his back with his wiener stuck

304
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,320
way out there like come at me which may be a better statue i i would like i would like someone

305
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,680
to now carve a companion statue of goliath just kind of like hey do you need a second um i'm ready

306
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,240
to fight you but if you wouldn't like put on shorts or whatever i don't i don't know if you're dressed

307
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:49,680
for battle my man um on this same uh website uh there's a uh uh there's a fact that the david

308
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,320
currently you can see he sits under a skylight that was designed just for him in the 19th century by

309
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,880
amelio de febree i bet his friends never stopped hearing about that fucking window yeah i mean huh

310
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,280
so like well it's sort of a collaboration between me and michelangelo if you think about it because

311
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,080
like lighting is so huge in any form of art so it's like kind of our step we know amelio we know

312
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,480
yeah it's kind of like it's kind of like you know he took it to the one yard line right and i kind

313
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,480
of ran it ran it through with my great window so it's kind of like it was my touchdown you know

314
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,040
if you think about it michelangelo and amelio's david is one or maybe if you want to go alphabetical

315
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,640
amelio and michelangelo's day they're still looking for a name for this fucking thing

316
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,400
they should call it amelio and michelangelo's david or amelio's amelio's david featuring

317
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,240
michelangelo and pitbull because that dude is just on everything listen they don't tell everybody

318
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:59,040
this but did you guys know that he just found the penis i don't know if that denigrates us

319
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,280
so really it's amelio and god's michael and rv david with michelangelo with special guests

320
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,320
and introducing and introducing michael

321

then i sell it once it's made more money because i did a good job talking about it is that okay

399
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,720
is that a legal thing to do griffin that's not yahoo answers question that's just a scam you want

401
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,960
call that insider trading but you don't work at yahoo so is that outsider trading i don't know

402
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,200
what any of that means okay is that what they got martha stewart on that's what i got martha on

403
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:20,960
that was actually cocaine wait what lots and lots of cocaine um this is yahoo that was sent to us by

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,400
stacy trombone which is fantastic it's from yahoo answers user question mark this website's fucking

405
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,760
falling down around my ears asks what are some things you would tell your younger equestrian self

406
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,680
here's my own list one just because the ponies you grew up riding were difficult it doesn't make

407
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,480
you a horse trainer wow set your goals small stop thinking of the ability to jump in big shows when

408
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:54,880
you only jump small courses at home yeah man wake up patricia don't waste money on bling think

409
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,040
matchy matchy gear and spend your money on lessons i like that one a lot i like that one a lot no one

410
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,520
cares how much you know shiny metal you and your horse are wearing and matching if you you know if

411
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,840
it you know poops during a run you got to train that shit out of them pay attention when the

412
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,400
horse acts up instead of immediately considering it to be training issues what's the problem i'm

413
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,720
listening plan ahead whenever everything is going well be very cautious something not only can go

414
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,440
wrong but will go wrong yes number six is a good life lesson number six you don't need a foal seven

415
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:37,040
you don't need a wild horse just eight don't invest in that timeshare eight take the harsh

416
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,160
advice other people give you and learn from it rather than crying about it patricia no matter

417
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,960
how good you are at riding people will always be better than you and that's okay ten don't fall for

418
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,920
the cheap prices horses sell for you will end up spending so much more time money and tears than

419
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,800
you would if you had just bought a regular horse wait i want to hear some hundred dollars can we

420
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,960
chill down on the tears we all have ones we want to focus on here because i want to focus on the

421
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,160
idea that there will always be someone better at writing than you statistically that is not true

422
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,680
there has to be someone in the world who is the best horse rider uh it's why not you um yeah it's

423
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,640
me so i can go ahead and say like i've got another you know few decades to kick it on this world so

424
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,320
don't even fucking try it um so you don't need a foal you don't need a wild horse don't buy a cheap

425
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:33,200
horse because the rate the quote regular horse is going to cost you a bigger upfront investment

426
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,320
but you're gonna cry way less because if you get a cheap horse you're gonna have to spend so much

427
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,920
money fixing it up you know what i mean it's gonna be in the shop more than it's not yeah

428
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,720
just get a new horse don't buy used um but as soon as you walk that whole you that new horse off the

429
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,720
barn it's gonna lose a lot of value especially if you walk it off off a barn it's gonna lose

430
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,200
a considerable amount of value and so are you i want to go back and say that i actually think well i

431
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,320
think sea biscuit was a used horse and look at sea biscuit yeah but okay yeah sea biscuit one

432
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:15,920
but that movie specifically how much fucking time money and tears did tophor have to and that may

433
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,240
have been tophor was it tophor no it was not tophor grace no it was what's in it no i think

434
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,280
it was spider man on that one so spider man could have gotten i think it could have been spider man

435
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,160
right and he could have gotten a regular more wire tophor mcguire could have gotten a regular horse

436
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,320
and then won the race way faster and not had to worry about how many tears he was gonna have to

437
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:44,640
produce but would you and would you rather have one expensive horse or 10 cheap horses that's a

438
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:54,320
good point did you know when that when tophor was filming the movie tophor tophor was filming the

439
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,880
movie did you know that he that he thought was about him he was very surprised when the movie

440
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,120
came out and it was called sea biscuit because he thought it was about a movie about a guy who was

441
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:10,640
so good at riding horses that they made a movie about him you don't think he was actually very

442
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,800
s very surprised that they would make a movie about a horse you don't think when he showed

443
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,520
up and the horse's trailer was bigger than his that he didn't like figure that out well i mean

444
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,160
that one you gotta chalk up to just physics oh that's right yeah yeah the horse has got to have

445
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,440
enough room to run around so what things would you tell your younger equestrian self i think i'd

446
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,560
start out just saying like don't just try as hard as you can to make your fingers look less like baby

447
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:46,240
carrots yeah that's pretty good um i would say like hey that horse is three people in a suit

448
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:53,120
i've been hurt too many times yeah i'd rather know that ahead of time and go in eyes open

449
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,960
rather than find out after five years

450
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,520
i mean i got one if you're this if you're this froze up i'm frozen i don't have any i'm sorry

451
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,280
well justin we all haven't all been perfect equestrian since birth like you yeah um i was

452
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,120
just to go back i just don't learn i just keep doing it the same way when i started you know

453
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,160
i would go back and i would say listen i know fast and furious movies are really hot right now but

454
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,760
don't put nos in the horse it just doesn't work like that you think you knew where to put it and

455
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,960
i think in your defense you put it in the best if you are going to install a nos a nitrous booster

456
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,680
system in the horse i think you probably did it about as good as you possibly could but it's just

457
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:43,120
a sort of fundamentally flawed idea i okay i do have some one piece of advice don't don't get

458
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,640
frustrated with your horse and try to put him on your back so you can show how it's done and loudly

459
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,760
announce like let me show you how it's done and then call over friends and family to say i'm

460
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,880
going to show this horse how it's done and then let the horse get on your back um it's not it's

461
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:04,560
not going to pan out the way that you would would like it to go um i would also say to young equestria

462
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:12,160
me like yes a talking horse seems like a good investment but after a while like you and the

463
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:17,440
horse will grow apart and you will find his stories no longer interest you and you've heard

464
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,960
the same stories over and over again but legally you are still required to take care of that horse

465
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,560
yeah it's not even worth it just get a regular whispering horse that you can ignore whenever

466
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,480
you need to listen young griffin it's so important that you don't actually choreograph a dressage

467
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,320
routine to kid rocks um i'm gonna be a cowboy baby because the judges are gonna find it pretty

468
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:48,000
distasteful and in the future you're gonna find kid rock sort of politics also pretty distasteful

469
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:56,880
so that's just a heads up uh also sell your yahoo stock depending on how far along ago i was i guess

470
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,440
it's like what a decade so we said 10 years whatever however long it was sell your yahoo

471
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,520
stock younger justin and this also applies to both equestrianism and stocks buy apples

472
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:20,080
i like that joke hey thank you hey yeah can i ask you guys a question yeah is apple still also

473
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:28,160
called macintosh no hold on was the company called macintosh and then they just named that

474
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,200
would be like if mcdonald's was just like we're called burgers now we're called french fries come

475
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,480
to us for or was the computer called the macintosh hold on the computer was called the macintosh

476
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:45,120
because of the apple thing i would assume i do i i think you would assume it's called the that

477
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,520
because you think that there was somebody when they were like we're gonna call the company apple

478
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:54,480
there were people were like that's gonna get fucking confusing what do you guys sell apples

479
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,560
do you think that when they came out there and steve was like our company's name is apple

480
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,200
do you think there were some apple companies that were like ah fuck that's shit

481
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,080
wait i wish fuck i wish we thought of that can you imagine we would just just why do we call

482
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:19,600
ourselves sweet crunch that is not a good company name and you know i'm really glad that they did

483
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,400
all that focus testing or else their like original desktop computer would have been called the apple

484
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,840
granny smith and i just don't think that would have sold as well as the macintosh this is the

485
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,720
this is the apple this is the apple sweet crunch it's the most powerful computer known to man

486
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:43,360
apple red delicious i could do a fuji i think that would be a good line the fuji the apple

487
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,240
pink lady all right how many apples is travis no name how many other apples you know don't google

488
00:50:48,240 --> 00:51:00,320
i'll know if you google i'll hear it nobody google i'm just and you want to know about

489
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:09,040
apples the sweet edible fruit produced by the malice pumila well i know this is my brain from

490
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:16,080
school we grew 84.6 million tons of apples in 2014 so when you say we you mean like the planet

491
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:23,840
it no me okay a lot of work planting 84.6 million tons worth of apple trees now you're trying to

492
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:30,480
sell them i got so many apples y'all i would like to be the first to apologize for this dumber than

493
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,600
usual episode my brother my brother okay yes even for us this is a pretty dumb one yeah sure

494
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,720
uh how about we do one more question because we had a long piss break in there and uh okay

495
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,960
and we'll make this one real smart oh no i figured out why these are dumbest episode

496
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,640
why because this episode 404 so it's not working it's an error code so my girlfriend goes to

497
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,760
call it at least that was funny so my girlfriend goes to college and she is very did this one

498
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:08,800
travis what what do you mean travis i he distracted with the 404 thing and then i

499
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,920
forward the link to the question i have a i real quick this one's sent in by merit palmer

500
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,040
thank you merit it's an anonymous yahoo answers user so i'll call him dougie asks

501
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:26,720
has the human body evolved for fist fighting a lot of people sent this one in is the human

502
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:33,120
body designed by evolution for fist fighting let me think let me pose

503
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:42,720
uh yeah well that's pretty your body has some smooth action i've never done a fist fight so i

504
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:50,080
can't really be a voice of authority about this um but my gut said my gut says yes i think we

505
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,680
probably either we had different priorities throughout the ages one was just sort of hiding

506
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,280
and survival and then using rudimentary tools and then we kind of peaked and then it was like

507
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,040
like i don't know fist fighting it would be pretty cool to be very good at and so our

508
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:09,440
fists got bigger arm got stronger bodies got better at taking the fist punches um i don't

509
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,640
know my i'm a beautiful machine of fury and violence well that's when i look at my body

510
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,360
i'm looking at my body for the first time just thinking i'm a beautiful machine of fury and

511
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:24,560
violence i didn't know it until this moment i'm thinking about how every every piece of my body

512
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:30,400
is designed to be better at fist fighting yeah so break it down bite bite for bite for me well i

513
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:38,080
have the beard which protects my jaw yeah it's like natural armor um my glasses which of course

514
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,200
grow out of my face that protect my eyes well your eyes got bad and that was evolution's way

515
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:48,240
of saying you need some sort of covering on here for people with you know sharper knuckles yeah and

516
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,000
then i turned 22 and started packing on the lbs to protect my guts yeah you know what i mean so i

517
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,040
got a little extra padding there so if someone tries to punch you in the guts they're like oh

518
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:01,040
i can't even get through it and i remember that travis on your 22nd birthday we got in a fist

519
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,040
fight and i beat the snot out of you dude yeah and you said i'm making the decision today to

520
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:14,560
you know add some add some some padding and i did and he did also my fists are three feet wide

521
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,920
travis just got the ever long hands he's got ever long hands in this one i've got ed for long hands

522
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,840
and so they let me punch better and punch like six people at a time it's tough to know this

523
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,640
personally right because that's not how evolution works you don't you don't use a leaf stone on

524
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,880
yourself and then turn into venus or it's like you can't see that but um i have a son now and

525
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,040
when i look at his beautiful fists all i can think is wow we're really moving in that direction huh

526
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,360
we're really moving in sort of a fist fight and i don't want my son to ever get in a fist fight

527
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:56,960
but i know that his body because of evolution how it works is gonna be just crazy and wild in the

528
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:04,880
in the ring or the you know wherever it is he has to fight with his fists do you think glass joe from

529
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:11,040
punch out was like the last evolutionary link we had to that line of humanity like he was the last

530
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,280
one and you just punched him out because we evolved past it obviously i haven't seen anybody

531
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,200
with his particular malady you're right yeah it's kind of like the evolution of man of like seeing

532
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,920
the monkey turn into the person which is like science is still out on that one it's a fun it's

533
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,640
a fun theory but uh still waiting to hear back on that one but you can sort of follow the same

534
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:39,040
trajectory going from glass joe to king hippo you see king hippo and you're like perfect specimen

535
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:47,040
king hippo punching of punching his body his body can do nothing else he leaves the ring after

536
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,000
punching so good because his body's been perfectly tuned for that purpose and he walks out of the

537
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,440
ring and like tries to open a door and can't because his body just so he punches it right

538
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,800
open and of course that works and you know punches spaghetti into his mouth you know i've never seen

539
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,360
the wrestler but this is what i assume the wrestler is like yeah it's mickey roark v king hippo from

540
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,120
uh punch out and it's just like mickey roark wrestling food into his face to where we're

541
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,960
starting a new podcast about us guessing what's in the wrestler it's called we'll get it right next

542
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:27,280
year and it's about us guessing about that it's called i'll get it right next year too the sequel

543
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,960
to the podcast that paid us to advertise them i'm gonna google real king hippo because i need to know

544
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:40,560
if king hippo but real king hippo versus prince mustern is the thing about king hippo what

545
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:47,120
evolution told us is like your instinct would be the perfect puncher would have

546
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:54,240
few places to punch but what king hippo does it's his he says there's many places to punch

547
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,080
so that he can take more of them you know what i mean if you think about like you have more body

548
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:05,280
mass so it's like there's more space for you to store punches yeah probably probably king hippo

549
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,880
is god played god played a joke on him well one problem juiced and that is his huge weak point

550
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,600
designated by an x-shaped bandage that he has over his belly button and i guess that's because his

551
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,600
body got so crazy that and so perfect for fighting and so crazy that he needed something to hold

552
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:27,680
his you know punching guts in and that is this bandage and it got hippo did you not even think

553
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,440
about making it like flesh colored at least or just not an x shape yeah you could have made it

554
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,760
any shape power in that shit like 45 degrees you got a plus sign if he just hiked his pants up

555
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,320
nobody would have any fucking clue what to do with him just pull your pants up king hippo

556
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:51,040
pull your pants up king hippo and then no one will know oh um i will say thank you wikipedia

557
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:56,720
for clarifying that king hippo is a fictional boxer from nintendo's punch out thank you for

558
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:04,000
clarifying that wikipedia um that folks that's this is the ideal male body come on uh thanks

559
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,720
