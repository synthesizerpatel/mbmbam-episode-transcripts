1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,840
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to what I can only assume is the beginning

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,600
of the downturn of My Brother, My Friend.

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,440
I'm so glad you could be here for the apex of our program.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,480
After which, listen, I've seen a lot of Behind the Music.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,480
This is the good part.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,040
This is what they showed just before and shortly after.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,560
As we're walking off stage Charles would be like, you know what I've always wanted to

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
try?

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Math.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,120
We realized when we were just backstage that we hadn't done one of these in six months

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,760
and so like my body, like my nervous system didn't know how to react to this many people

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,920
all essentially yelling at me very loud.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,560
And so like my fight or flight response actually kicked in.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,440
I tapped my chest and that wasn't like, oh thank you, I'm so honored.

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
It was like, my heart is like fucking racing right now.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,880
With a small tonal shift we would have had to leave.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
I know.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,880
There's like a weird part of my brain that's like, you need to get the fuck out of here.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,520
First off, can I get a little more monitor?

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,280
I don't know what that means but I like to say it every time.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the Marchanera.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,440
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:48,720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, media luminary, Griffin MC McElroy.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,680
With Chilean miners emerging from a six-month-long slumber, we have returned.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
And that's going to do it for us.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,480
We want to say thank you to John Roderick.

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,160
This little Mariah Carey headset thing that they're wearing, they actually send you this

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,680
when you get 30 under 30.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
So you can do your TED talk.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Imagine this.

32
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,720
So here's the really special thing about tonight's show that I'm so excited about that you won't

33
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,000
be, but we really were, because it had never occurred to us.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Watch this.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,280
You ready?

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
We can stand up.

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
Nowhere to hide.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,760
I could do the whole show from back here.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Where's Travis, they wonder.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,720
So we can just kind of, if energy's flagging, we could just sort of like get up on stage

41
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,840
like Def Comedy Jam and just like get some, we won't do that much, we'll immediately forget

42
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
we could do it.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,400
And as long as we're like taking people behind the curtain, like we all have just like children's

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:06,240
bladders and so this technology may actually allow us to run to the zone and still participate

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,680
in our communal comedy.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
Leave the bathroom door open, I'll hear the japes.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,520
Oh man, I really am a little, I'm a little freaked out right now.

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,360
We've also had a lot of sugar today.

49
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Yeah.

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,280
We have had both Voodoo Donuts and Blue Star Donuts.

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,560
And you said I couldn't do local references.

52
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
I did it.

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,320
I mean, you did successfully name two donut places.

54
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,840
Thank you.

55
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,120
Now I'm doing the slow carb thing, so on the Saturdays I get to just like eat like a garbage

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,120
person.

57
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,400
And this is my first one, so I was so excited.

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Like I was literally woke up first thing this morning just like we need to walk to get donuts

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,440
and Travis and I walked 20 minutes in the rain to go get donuts.

60
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,500
It's worth it too.

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,880
Should we start doing the thing we do on the podcast, My Brother, My Brother and Me?

62
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,720
We have so much time without the opener, I just want to spend a minute with them.

63
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
Yeah.

64
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,640
We don't have an opener, so we were hoping, if it's okay with you all, extra long, extra

65
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
weird.

66
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Is that?

67
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Okay.

68
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay, now let's, hold on, the other thing is, we say weird a lot.

69
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,480
I'm not trying to curry local favor.

70
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,200
I know that would be like the whack, like I don't, when we do a show at Boston, I'm

71
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,100
like not like this show's going to have extra beans like that, like is Portland known for

72
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,440
being weird and remaining, so yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,440
Interesting.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,560
It's like the old slogan, keep Boston beans.

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,640
On this show, we take your questions and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,440
We are going to do questions from the audience, probably a lot of them since we have a lot

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
of time to kill.

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
We'll do a good amount.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,880
I don't want to over promise, I'd rather under promise and over.

80
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,760
But we do have the one rule, does everyone know what the audience question rule is?

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Audience.

82
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Okay.

83
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
That's right.

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
No, no danger of that.

85
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,200
Some, some, some like weird podcast angel just got its wings.

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Okay.

87
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,400
All right, here we go.

88
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Questions and podcast.

89
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,200
We can't go six months without doing these again.

90
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,320
I literally, it's like learning to walk again.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Please be patient with us.

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,880
We'll cut out the bad parts and only you will experience them.

93
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
If I'm worth, so here's the thing.

94
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,880
No.

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Justin.

96
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:39,440
If I'm working as a cashier, wait, why did I stand up?

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
If I'm working.

98
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,600
Justin and Travis are now standing and I'm getting very nervous sitting down.

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
If I'm working.

100
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,320
Oh, we should mention, we've still got to post this, we can't do a lot of visual humor

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
like this.

102
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.

103
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
They don't have to know this is just for them.

104
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Okay.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,360
If you, if they laugh and you don't know why, get your feet off the couch.

106
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,800
That's vegan leather.

107
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
It really is.

108
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
That's not a Portland knock.

109
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
How do I get out of this bit?

110
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,240
You know, okay.

111
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,440
So here's the first question.

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,760
If I'm working as a cashier and someone hands me their credit card and the card has a cool

113
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,440
picture of their family or their dog or something on it, is it cool if I just take a sec to

114
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,240
scope it out in front of them?

115
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,280
Is it more rude to completely ignore it after they've gone through all the trouble of getting

116
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,480
a custom card like that?

117
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,520
If I look, should I react and give them a thumbs up or something?

118
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,040
Maybe I could say something like, nice family and dog.

119
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,440
That's from not stealing your credit card information, just checking out that cool family

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,560
and dog in Portland.

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Are you here?

122
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
You're here?

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Didn't make it.

124
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Oh, no.

125
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Really?

126
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,160
Is there a way to say the two words, nice family, without it sounding like a threat?

127
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Yeah.

128
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Yeah.

129
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,160
Like you're in fucking cage fear.

130
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Yeah.

131
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
That's fine.

132
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,640
That only ends with, it'd be a shame if something happened to them.

133
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,280
I didn't know that you could get, this first thing that I want to address is I didn't know

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,920
you could get custom cards printed, because if so, you know I'm going to get a hologram

135
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,600
by a Charizard or Blastoise on there.

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,680
And then that's good, because you go to Chipotle or whatever and you can purchase your goods.

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,880
But also, if you're losing the big game.

138
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,640
Wouldn't it be way cooler with Pikachu though?

139
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,480
Because everybody loves Pikachu, right?

140
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Love the Pokemon.

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
He's probably the best one.

142
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Wouldn't you say?

143
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Griffin, don't you agree that Pikachu is among-

144
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,800
You're about to make me pop off on this stage right now.

145
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,960
I'm just curious what you think about Pikachu.

146
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
He's fine.

147
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,240
He's fine.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,320
He's good for what he is.

149
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,200
He's probably the best.

150
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Probably no Pokemon competing in a fight.

151
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
All right.

152
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Fine.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Okay.

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,160
He evolves into Raichu.

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,960
He has a better form.

156
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,880
He has an older brother who's better.

157
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:12,840
Thank you for acknowledging that older brothers are better.

158
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,440
They do if they have better stats and better attacks.

159
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,780
You know, I hadn't really thought about it before, but if you do get a custom picture

160
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,880
of your family and or cool dog on your credit card, what you are basically saying is, I'd

161
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,520
like to bring discussions of how my family looks into transactions.

162
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,640
I would like the person I'm transacting with to get a good look at my family and dog.

163
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,880
This is a good point, Justin.

164
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,640
Who are these human beings who are trying to extend transactions with cashiers?

165
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,640
I need a talking voice.

166
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,160
Because it's none of these three.

167
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Maybe it's somebody-

168
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,240
Put some fucking fun trivia on it and give us something to discuss.

169
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,560
Maybe it's somebody who makes a lot of really unwise, irresponsible purchases, so they're

170
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,880
like, a fucking speedboat, yeah.

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,680
Rex would hate a speedboat.

172
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Rex would hate a speedboat.

173
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,080
He's afraid of the dang things.

174
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Unless it's just a picture of your daughter in a captain's cap flipping you off.

175
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
She would actually.

176
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,640
She thinks, Molly knows how to party.

177
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
I should get this boat for her.

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I should get the speedboat.

179
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,360
Do you think if you go to the trouble of getting a custom card made, you want people to-

180
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Yeah, absolutely.

181
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
Like if you hand it to them, they're like, what?

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
They'll be like, uh, it's you, baby.

183
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
What do you think of my family?

184
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,800
Now listen, if you do, here's the thing though.

185
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,640
If you look at the card, you have to say something.

186
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,880
Like you can't just pass it out.

187
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,920
You can't look and just, okay, a family, interesting.

188
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,240
Side note, why do people want to make it so easy to steal their ID?

189
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,840
Yeah, I was just thinking that.

190
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,400
What you've created here is like a little coupon to your identity.

191
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Right.

192
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,040
Here's my number to all my money.

193
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,640
Here's what all my family looks like.

194
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,680
You can see we're standing in front of our home.

195
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
That's our address.

196
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
And this is how small the dog is guarding that home.

197
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Yeah, right.

198
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,120
Everybody's wearing a t-shirt that has a design that explains their greatest fear on it.

199
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Right.

200
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,720
And right below that, their social security number.

201
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,600
So you can just steal my whole family's identity if you want.

202
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Enjoy.

203
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
Enjoy my family's identity.

204
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
Do you guys want to know who?

205
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
It's up to them.

206
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,720
What happens if you lose that credit card?

207
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,260
I'm just looking forward to that call of like, could I get a new family, please?

208
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,320
This one was sent in by Zoe Kinski.

209
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Right in high Zoe Kinski.

210
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,920
It is right in high.

211
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,640
I need to sit down and really write all these.

212
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I feel so bad.

213
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,880
But there's like, we've come up with so many honorifics at this point.

214
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
Thank you, Zoe.

215
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,880
It's Yahoo Answers user.

216
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,400
The website is bad.

217
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,120
We'll refresh it.

218
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Oh, God.

219
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Why did I refresh it?

220
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Last time this happened, I lost the website.

221
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Oh, shit.

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,680
Okay, everybody turn off the Wi-Fi.

223
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
Okay, I can't.

224
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
It's just a funny name.

225
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Justin, go.

226
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Uh, duh.

227
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Asks.

228
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,320
I had a funny second half, but you'll never hear it.

229
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:11,880
If David Blaine and Chris Angel got into a fight, how horny would I get?

230
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,200
How would the fight play out?

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,080
Who cares who wins?

232
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I care very much.

233
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,800
No matter who wins, we lose.

234
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,480
How does the question, how would it play out, not factor in who wins?

235
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Yeah.

236
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,920
I just want to know if illusions would be used, or if they would just go for straight

237
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
punching.

238
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,280
If they would go for just straight punching and hair pulling, tell me your opinions.

239
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
Hold on.

240
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,480
Justin is fantasizing about a fight between two magicians, in which they just punch each

241
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
other.

242
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,480
Yeah, you just want to see them kick their asses.

243
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
It would be like-

244
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Kasparov versus Deep Blue.

245
00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,200
If these two got into a fucking punch fight-

246
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,760
Is this basically the plot of Incredible Burt Wonderstone?

247
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,760
Because I haven't seen it.

248
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Travis, please break this down.

249
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
It is.

250
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Largely the plot of-

251
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,760
Oh, shit.

252
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,720
It is, actually, a little bit, literally.

253
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Have you watched it, too?

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Jacuzzi.

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,520
We'll talk after the show.

256
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Scandalize.

257
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,400
I didn't realize you were a Wonderhead.

258
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,960
Illusions are hard.

259
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,480
It's hard in this day and age.

260
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:35,840
We have magic computers, et cetera, et cetera, in our hands, science, magic, indistinguishable.

261
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,880
You know, the gold quote.

262
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,880
Illusions are hard.

263
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,680
By Gerald R. Tolkien, these little phones, man.

264
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,680
Did you say Gerald Tolkien?

265
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,680
By Gerald Tolkien.

266
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,720
Gerald Tolkien said-

267
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,920
These phones, man, it's like magic.

268
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Crazy.

269
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,920
When I did Gandalf, I was like, phones, man.

270
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
What?

271
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,920
No, that's not what I'm trying to get at.

272
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,360
What I'm trying to get at is, illusions are really hard to do.

273
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,040
I think the challenge is increased exponentially if someone is fighting you to make them less

274
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
impressive.

275
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Just stop punching me for one second.

276
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
What's this?

277
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,760
Oh, no.

278
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,280
I'm literally thinking about David Blaine running a loop over a woman, and Chris Angel's

279
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,720
like, she's not floating.

280
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
It's a hook.

281
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,120
Or you can't see it.

282
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,640
Or Chris Angel just runs in and just fucking slaps the rope away.

283
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Right.

284
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,480
He's like, I'm going to bite this quarter and, hey, come on, stop.

285
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Come on.

286
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,640
I'm going to put this cigarette through my hand, stop, no.

287
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,680
If David Blaine paid someone to suck all the oxygen out of the room, he would have a definite

288
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
increased advantage.

289
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,160
I mean, it's just science.

290
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,200
He trained himself to hold his breath for eight minutes underwater.

291
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I see.

292
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:02,200
If the oxygen's out of the room, Chris Angel's blacked out on the floor, which isn't a room

293
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
at all.

294
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,680
It was actually the outdoors, mind freak.

295
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Whoa, shit.

296
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,680
See, that's the trick.

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,680
That's the trick.

298
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,680
It's like, I've created a prison of ice that neither of us will be able to own.

299
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,480
Are we outside of the prison of ice?

300
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Boom.

301
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,640
Oh, I lavaliered my lavalier off.

302
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,000
Really got to clip this bad boy on.

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah.

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really pinch it around.

305
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, dear.

306
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think David Copperfield should show up and shoot him with a shotgun.

307
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's up?

308
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm very old, and I'm out the game.

309
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Pop.

310
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Dead.

311
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
I made an airplane disappear.

312
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Why can't I make YouTube?

313
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,920
Pop, pop, pop.

314
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,400
Just because, hold on, just because David Copperfield's not doing specials anymore doesn't mean he

315
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
doesn't still do magic.

316
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,880
I don't think he's out of the game.

317
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,320
Yeah, we're doing him a disservice by suggesting he would murder people with guns and not with

318
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,320
his magic.

319
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,100
He can fly, okay?

320
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,400
Let's cut him a little bit of slack.

321
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,640
No one knows how he did that still.

322
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah.

323
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,160
He palmed, that one time when he got mugged, he did magic, he palmed his own watch.

324
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
You heard that?

325
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
Somebody said, yeah, so.

326
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
He got mugged.

327
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
That's a story for three of you.

328
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,840
He got mugged, and while he was getting mugged, he palmed his own watch so they wouldn't steal

329
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
it.

330
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,480
So the person with him still got mugged.

331
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,840
The person with him got mugged, but he was like, what, David Copperfield helps those

332
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
who help themselves.

333
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Boy, I bet that was awkward.

334
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Like, geez, Dave, thanks, bud.

335
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,840
I have my grandma's ring.

336
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,120
You couldn't have palmed that one too, huh?

337
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Don't get greedy, Madeline.

338
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,040
David's like, Madeline, how did you make out?

339
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
I kept my watch because of my trickery.

340
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,640
Hey, and I kept your watch, but it's mine now.

341
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,080
Hey, Madeline, Madeline, what time is it?

342
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,880
Time for you to learn how to do magic, I guess.

343
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,840
I bet that David Copperfield immediately called his parents and was like, you said this would

344
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,840
never come in handy.

345
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,680
Okay, how about another question?

346
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
Yes, please.

347
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
Hi, brothers.

348
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
Hi.

349
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Hi.

350
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Hey.

351
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,640
I've been having an issue, whoop, I've been having an issue ever since my boyfriend and

352
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,640
I started cohabitating.

353
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,360
He scares the shit out of me.

354
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Bad start?

355
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,920
Not on purpose.

356
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,280
Just when he comes home or walks into the room after taking a shower, he's tried saying

357
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:21,200
hey as a warning or being a bit noisier, unlocking the door, but I'm often cooking or listening

358
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,240
to a podcast, oh, thank you, and usually jump from fear.

359
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
Help me, brothers.

360
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,680
What can he do to make his entrances less frightening?

361
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,560
That's from Scared in Seattle.

362
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,080
Okay, hold on, Scared in Seattle, you're here.

363
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Okay.

364
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Yeah.

365
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Hi.

366
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,360
Does your boyfriend have like an old-timey organ that he plays like a spooky stinger

367
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
at like, baaam?

368
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,360
Yeah.

369
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
Hello.

370
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
Are you dating Slenderman?

371
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Harvey Slenderman.

372
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Nice to meet you.

373
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I'm an accountant.

374
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,920
I struggle with this a lot because I spend a lot of time editing podcasts, and so I've

375
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,360
always got the old cans on, and I have YouTube bozos just like, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop,

376
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,880
fart, boner, fart, boner, boner, just bark into my ears, and then when Rachel wants

377
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,600
to get my attention, there's no good way to do it that doesn't spook me terribly.

378
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Could you tie a bell around your boyfriend?

379
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:20,280
It's a little dehumanizing, but I mean, I'd rather you not get scared.

380
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,200
To be fair, your boyfriend's jangling his keys and saying, hey, he's gone half the way.

381
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
He's gone, yeah.

382
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,320
Maybe you meet him halfway, you get like a Bluetooth speaker, and you don't wear headphones.

383
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,920
You could try learning Taekwondo, and then you'd be anticipating an attack.

384
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,960
At every moment, you'd be praying that someone tries to make a move on you because you're

385
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
a weapon.

386
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,320
I've got an idea that I've been developing for four seconds now, and it's for an app,

387
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,960
and the app is called JRMY, Jermy, and it's for Jeremy, the boy, I'm assuming.

388
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
What's his name?

389
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Matt.

390
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,240
Matt's already four letters, so that's no good.

391
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Yeah.

392
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,480
There's probably an app called Matt, so let's stick with Jeremy for right now.

393
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,560
Jermy, it's called Jermy, and you use it, and you're going to, this is not, Matt, not

394
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,000
good for him, but I'll have to be tagged somehow.

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
RFID.

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,120
RFID, maybe he carries an Amiibo with him all the time.

397
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,600
He always has an Amiibo on him, and when he comes in the door, your Jermy app is always

398
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,040
running, and it's like, Jeremy's home, and it lets you know because it knows that he's

399
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
close because of the tag.

400
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Push notification.

401
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Push notification.

402
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,560
You're listening to the podcast, and it's like, fart boner, hi, McElroy's, listen to

403
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,920
all our shows, we're sellouts, and then you get like, Jeremy's home, and you know to be

404
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
ready.

405
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,160
Maybe one butt in, one butt out.

406
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
Or what if, okay, I'm going to take that, let me throw this out.

407
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,560
What if it just constantly let you know when Jeremy wasn't home?

408
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,880
And if it stopped notifying you, that means he is home.

409
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
Yeah.

410
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,800
So you're listening to our family of incredible products, but there's also a fourth-

411
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Jeremy's not home.

412
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Jeremy's not home.

413
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Jeremy's not home.

414
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Jeremy's not home.

415
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Jeremy's not home.

416
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Jeremy's not home.

417
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Jeremy's not home.

418
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Jeremy defends systems.

419
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Voltron.

420
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,520
Also, you should get Voltron to protect you, because then you'd never be-

421
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,320
What fear needs someone with Voltron at their side?

422
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,720
He's made of five lions.

423
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
What if he had a body man?

424
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Think about it.

425
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
If he had his own, like, you know, like, Dule Hill was for President Bartlett, you could

426
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,280
have somebody who like, enters the room before, and is like, Jeremy's going to do it.

427
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,000
They're still going to be scared.

428
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's not Jeremy himself.

429
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,040
What if instead it was a hype man that you heard coming a mile away, Jeremy!

430
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Jeremy!

431
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,040
Oh shit, Jeremy's here!

432
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,880
Just ringing a cowbell, like, who's in the house?

433
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Jeremy!

434
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,760
No, I mean, literally, he's in the house.

435
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll be back in the morning.

436
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
You guys stay in the same room, please.

437
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,800
What if you hung Christmas lights all over, like, in Stranger Things, and then when Jeremy

438
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,680
gets home, he just flicks them up and down, and that's it?

439
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,160
That's the most practical one, I think.

440
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
That's practical.

441
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,480
And also, it's festive and nice.

442
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,320
You stepped around Christmas, and it's like, stop it, Jeremy!

443
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,320
You're disrupting the spirit.

444
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Yahoo?

445
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Another Yahoo?

446
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,320
This one was sending...

447
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,320
All right.

448
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,680
I mean, it's a bad company.

449
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,680
You don't have to cheer for Yahoo.

450
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
They provide a good...

451
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Oh, yeah, okay.

452
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,560
You have a haunted doll down there in the front row, and it's freaking me out.

453
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,800
Not because it's a haunted doll.

454
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,680
I keep thinking it's a baby, that you're just like, look at these three goofins.

455
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Someday, darling.

456
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,960
I just keep seeing it out of the corner of my eye, and it's freaking me out.

457
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah.

458
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,080
You can even lower it out of eyesight, if you want to see it.

459
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
It's your seat.

460
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
You can do whatever you want with it.

461
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
But...

462
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Griffin, are you ready?

463
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
Yeah.

464
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,080
I just lost...

465
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
It's nice.

466
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
I lost the website, unfortunately.

467
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Yahoo.com?

468
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,400
Yeah, no, it's almost like it's a really fucking bad website that I'm gonna dance on its fucking

469
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,240
grave when Yahoo's gone.

470
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,960
When Yahoo's gone, I will do a dance on its grave.

471
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,520
Do you need some filler?

472
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,200
No, I'll just read another one, but that one's just got eaten.

473
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Which one was it?

474
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Can you get it back?

475
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
It's gone.

476
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
That's what I'm saying.

477
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
Which one was it?

478
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
I'll try to remember it.

479
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
No, forget it.

480
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
How about this one instead?

481
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Okay.

482
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,600
It was sent in by Rachel Rosen.

483
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
You here, Rachel?

484
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,560
Thank you, Rachel.

485
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,200
It's from Yahoo Answers user.

486
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
It's probably not gonna load.

487
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:36,040
Oh, Rinaldo, it loaded something.

488
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,720
Fucking toilet website.

489
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,320
I'm gonna get that other tab back.

490
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:58,920
Rinaldo asks, what would happen if I pinched a police officer for not wearing green today?

491
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't have that instinct where I look at a police officer and think, I wonder how much

492
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,800
stuff I could get away with doing to and on them.

493
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah.

494
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,280
What would they let me get away with?

495
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,000
I mean, the answer is you're a white man, so pretty much whatever you want, but...

496
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But...

497
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Whoa.

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Commentary.

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Whoa.

500
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Oh, shit, there he goes.

501
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Damn, he's getting fired up.

502
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
He's getting political.

503
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,920
Didn't think that one was worth a laugh, but...

504
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
He's going back to his seats.

505
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,840
But wouldn't you feel bad if you pinched that cop and he turned around and he had a green

506
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
lapel pin on?

507
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Oh, boy, oh, I did my parts.

508
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Oh, no, it's not.

509
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,840
Oh, nothing to see.

510
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
Nothing to pinch here.

511
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
Nothing to pinch here.

512
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Oh, lighty, lighty, light.

513
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,840
My granddad made me this lapel.

514
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
No, no, no, no, no.

515
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
It's cool.

516
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
We're Irish.

517
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
It's fine.

518
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
It's cool.

519
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
It's fine.

520
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
It's fine.

521
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
It's fine.

522
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Oh, Delilah.

523
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
Oh, Delilah?

524
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,840
You pinched me.

525
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
You pinched me, Denny Boy.

526
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
We're Irish.

527
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
You can tell by our accents.

528
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,840
Yeah.

529
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Our very good accents.

530
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Griffin, you didn't do one.

531
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
Do one.

532
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,840
Yeah.

533
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
No, I'm good.

534
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
I need you to do one.

535
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
We all need to be in this.

536
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Yeah.

537
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Tora, lora, lora.

538
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
You pinched me good.

539
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
I deserve that one, didn't I, Lighty?

540
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
How about that?

541
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Tora, lora, lora.

542
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Have you ever wanted to change your fate?

543
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:25,840
That was brave and Scottish.

544
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,840
Yeah.

545
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,840
It's a quote from the movie, Brave, Pixar's best movie.

546
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Come at me.

547
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
It was just okay.

548
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
Her family turns into bears.

549
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Like, what the fuck, guys?

550
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Like, you had a good movie, and then it's like, my family's bears.

551
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Like, what?

552
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
And Griffin, everyone's super worried about mom.

553
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,840
The children are bears.

554
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,840
The kids are bears and, like, having fun.

555
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,840
They could, like, kill a guy, and it's like, oh, my brothers, they killed a guy.

556
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Mama mia.

557
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,840
Mama mia.

558
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,840
He's actually got away from you.

559
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm going to pinch a cop.

560
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,840
I am.

561
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,840
Next cop I see not wearing green, I don't care what day of the week it is, I want to

562
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
pinch him.

563
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,840
Is it illegal?

564
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,840
Who's the bigger Christian?

565
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,840
Is it illegal to pinch a cop?

566
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Somebody say yes.

567
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Well, this is a comedy show.

568
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,840
We don't need answers.

569
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Thanks, Matt.

570
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,840
Thanks, Matt Locke.

571
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,840
We'll do the law up here.

572
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,840
I mean, is it legal to pinch anybody?

573
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,840
I didn't wear green yesterday at all, and I traveled.

574
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
I was on an airplane, and I saw lots of people wearing lots of green, and I thought, am I

575
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
going to get pinched?

576
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,840
And I thought, no, I'm a 29-year-old man.

577
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,840
Like, nobody's going to walk up to me and be like, boop.

578
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,840
Gotcha.

579
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,840
Looks like we didn't see that special color on you, boop.

580
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,840
The mood I'm in while I'm traveling, I would leap in the air and spin kick them.

581
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
Like, I have no basis.

582
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,840
Yeah, I'm always, like, on high alert.

583
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Yeah, high alert.

584
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
I'm ready for anything.

585
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Want another question?

586
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Yeah, don't pinch it.

587
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Just, like, don't pinch a cop, I guess.

588
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Don't pinch anybody?

589
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,840
Don't pinch anybody.

590
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I guess the one teachable moment we have from this is probably don't pinch a cop.

591
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Or you'll get pinched.

592
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Oh.

593
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,840
No, no, no, no, no.

594
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,840
That got an applause rate.

595
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,840
That got, like, a bad Gulf Drive applause.

596
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
I'll take it.

597
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,840
How proud do you think I am that I won't accept that?

598
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,840
He wanged that one, but it's Jack Nicklaus, so.

599
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Did I say the right one?

600
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I don't know.

601
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,840
I get Jack Nicklaus and Nichols.

602
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Somebody said no.

603
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,840
Is it Nichols or Nichols?

604
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Nicholstein.

605
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,840
No, not that one.

606
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,840
This June, I'm headed...

607
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,840
That's weird.

608
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Oh, Jesus.

609
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Hold on, let me try again.

610
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
This is my stuff.

611
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,840
This June, I'm headed...

612
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Do you need me to defrag it?

613
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,840
Yeah, if you can try to read, just start with the third.

614
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Let me run the diagnostics on it.

615
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,840
Third question.

616
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,840
This June, I'm headed...

617
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Keep going.

618
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,840
Just keep going.

619
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,840
This June, I'm headed...

620
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,840
I want a munch squad.

621
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,840
I want two munch squads.

622
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,840
Welcome to Munch Squad, the show of the show.

623
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm really excited.

624
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,840
This is a very new take on Munch Squad.

625
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Not new, precisely, but I owe this one to Matt.

626
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,840
Matt's an Australian who saw the thing that we're about to talk about,

627
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,840
which is the chicken parmi from Jenny's, and it's a pie.

628
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
From whose?

629
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,840
It's Jenny's chicken parmi.

630
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Who's Jenny's?

631
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I'm going to show...

632
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:50,840
You all won't be able to see this very well, but this is the chicken...

633
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
For those of you at home, it looks like it's screaming.

634
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Yeah, it looks like a screaming pie.

635
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,840
It looks like if you cut a chicken pot pie in half, and the pie yelled at being cut in half.

636
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
How could you?

637
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
No!

638
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Well, he's Australian, so he'd be like,

639
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,840
Gore Blimey, how could you?

640
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,840
La-dee-da-dee-da.

641
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
La-dee-da-dee-da-ay.

642
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
To-ra-la-la-la.

643
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
It's cool, we're Australian.

644
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Jeez, jeez, jeez.

645
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
So, listen.

646
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Listen!

647
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
You can get this one at Jester's.

648
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
And the thing...

649
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
What is it?

650
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Is it Jenny's or Jester's?

651
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
It's Jenny's pie at Jester's.

652
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,840
It's Jenny's...

653
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Just shut up.

654
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Let me do my podcast.

655
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,840
My great award-winning podcast, Munch Squad, within your podcast.

656
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,840
We've rented out this small space for you.

657
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
This small retail space in the corner of the store.

658
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,840
All right, you're gonna make me stand up.

659
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,840
So, okay.

660
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,840
So, Matt's an Australian, and Matt saw this pie, and he was like,

661
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
that's a Munch Squad right there.

662
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
But there was no press release,

663
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,840
so Matt emailed the franchisee manager and said,

664
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Hi, I need a press release about your chicken parm.

665
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
So, wait.

666
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,840
This is our first bespoke Munch Squad.

667
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,840
This is the, like, PR blast of this press release.

668
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
This is the first sort of...

669
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm announcing the chicken parm.

670
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,840
So, here's the reason it's called Jenny's, okay?

671
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,840
This is a statewide Jester's pie competition,

672
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,840
and Jen Bogg was the creator of it, okay?

673
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,840
And Jen Bogg from Waikiki has won a statewide Jester's pie competition

674
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,840
with her yummy chicken parm-y pie.

675
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,840
The soup pie star.

676
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
Stop it.

677
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,840
That's not...

678
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
That doesn't sound like the thing you want.

679
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
If it was a soup designing competition, I could meet you halfway,

680
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,840
but no, it's soup pie star competition called on members of the public

681
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,840
to create a new and unique pie-flavored...

682
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,840
fucking mission accomplished, I guess,

683
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,840
to be sold in Jester's stores across WA...

684
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,840
I'm assuming that's Western Australia, is that a state?

685
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Yeah.

686
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
No, it's...

687
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Hey, context clues. Come on, y'all.

688
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Come on, y'all.

689
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
I said Australia, all right?

690
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,840
They're really going to like this one in the other country, aren't they?

691
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,840
In that one specific Northwestern state?

692
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
Australia, we're exporting our pies to Washington.

693
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
As a joke.

694
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Yeah, it's a bad pie, mate.

695
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
We made it as a joke for Washington.

696
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
Ms. Bogg won out of almost 2,000 entries

697
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
with about 400 votes for her parm-y pie recipe.

698
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
That's not very many.

699
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
It's not impressing you.

700
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,840
Sorry, sorry.

701
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,840
I don't want to be mean, but was that on Internet?

702
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
Because there's a lot of folks.

703
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,840
Considering there were 2,000 entrants,

704
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
you have to assume most of you were voting for their own pies,

705
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
and 400 people were like, no, that's actually better than mine.

706
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,840
What are the other pies in that case?

707
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Dust and mothballs.

708
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
Yeah.

709
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
And old soup in a pie.

710
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
So here's the quote.

711
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Here's the quote from Jenny.

712
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,840
I know you're wondering, how did you come up with this pie?

713
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
She says, I love chicken parmies.

714
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,840
And I love pies.

715
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
All right.

716
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
What better way to bring my two loves together

717
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
than by combining them?

718
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Nope.

719
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
I love my kid, and I love bourbon.

720
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I also love to cook.

721
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
But I'm pretty accident-prone in the kitchen.

722
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
I thought you were saying you love your kid,

723
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
and you love bourbon, and you love to cook.

724
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
No.

725
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
The quote is, I also love to cook.

726
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
But I'm pretty accident-prone in the kitchen.

727
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,840
This is an accident, so good job.

728
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
Good job describing.

729
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,840
And I thought I would leave the cooking to gestures

730
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,840
and just sit back and enjoy the new flavor.

731
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
So she doesn't want to make her own line of chicken parmies

732
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
that she could sell.

733
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Right.

734
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,840
This is made, what's in it?

735
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Crumbled chicken breast.

736
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
That's a bad start.

737
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,840
That's not among the things I want chicken to do.

738
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,840
It's not supposed to do that.

739
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
They probably mean, that's probably Australian for,

740
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,840
it has a crust, right?

741
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,840
Breaded, maybe?

742
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Somebody's saying yes.

743
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Why do you know what Australian's called?

744
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Anyway, it's made with crumbed chicken breast,

745
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,840
mashed potato.

746
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,840
Shh, let's just sneak it in.

747
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
They won't notice.

748
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,840
And Napoletana sauce and tasty cheese,

749
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
which is better than the alternative.

750
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,840
I agree.

751
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,840
This is made with good flavors and enjoyable taste.

752
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
This Australian pub favorite was made available

753
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,840
in all gesture stores.

754
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Book your plane tickets now.

755
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,840
From Tuesday, March 7th.

756
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,840
I have a very, very important question.

757
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,840
Wait, I'm almost done.

758
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm almost done.

759
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Ms. Bog even gets a piece of the pie profits.

760
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,840
She will get 50 C, that could be literally

761
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,840
any amount of money,

762
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,840
for every chicken parmi pie sold.

763
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
That's the, let's just take,

764
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,840
They sell for 100,000 C's.

765
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
Here's one more look,

766
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,840
because I know you want it, yeah.

767
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
This is a real question.

768
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:27,840
There's french fries hiding behind it.

769
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
They're embarrassed to be there.

770
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Oh no, get us out.

771
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,840
Is Waikiki in Australia?

772
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,840
I'm hearing mixed answers.

773
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,840
How many people thought it was in Hawaii like I did?

774
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,840
And how many people think it's in Australia?

775
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
Okay.

776
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
We have our answer.

777
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,840
They're not Wikipedia, they paid to be here.

778
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
Like we can't Google our audience.

779
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:59,840
I found that Yahoo, I rescued it from the depths.

780
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,840
What the fuck?

781
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,840
Okay, I literally had it,

782
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
and then literally a second later,

783
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm not fucking kidding, a second later,

784
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
I said here it comes and it refreshed.

785
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Sorry, this content is not available right now.

786
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
I didn't touch anything.

787
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
It's shy.

788
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,840
This is our first shy Yahoo answer.

789
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Someday you'll start screen capping them.

790
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Un-fucking-believable.

791
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,840
I have no other stalls.

792
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,840
That was my one big stall, was that one.

793
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
All right, but I'm going to jump into whatever happens next

794
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
in the middle of it and be like,

795
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it.

796
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
Okay, that's fine.

797
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Let's add a little suspense.

798
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Hold on, let me, let's screenshot some.

799
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,840
No, I'll figure it out.

800
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
This June, I'm headed to Japan for 10 days.

801
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
It's a question.

802
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
It's a question.

803
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Also, he's allowed to if he wants.

804
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
Yeah.

805
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Fuck you.

806
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Why did you respond to my like, no, how dare you.

807
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,840
This June, I'm headed to Japan for 10 days, not me.

808
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,840
I'm a question asker and two of the four people going with me

809
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
have decided not to go.

810
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,840
Cool friends.

811
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,840
After I already purchased the plane tickets.

812
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
Super cool friends, holy shit.

813
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
That's got to be cheap, right?

814
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,840
The flight tickets to Japan, 20 bucks, 30 bucks.

815
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
The tickets are non-refundable,

816
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
but I think if I really put in some effort,

817
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
I might be able to get some back.

818
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
I'm starting to think the extra space

819
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,840
on the international flight is more valuable.

820
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
Please advise, it's from Chase Robinson of,

821
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,840
is this Portland or some other place, I guess.

822
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
God, that's good.

823
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,840
Chase, are you here?

824
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
Wow, you took a while, Chase.

825
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,840
Now, Chase, are you really here or are you an imposter?

826
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Okay, so it's not really Chase.

827
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,840
You all just can't handle silence, huh?

828
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Is that what it is?

829
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
It's okay, it's fine.

830
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
If Chase isn't here, our feelings aren't hurt,

831
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,840
but I will ask one more time and just please complete silence.

832
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
Chase, are you here?

833
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,840
All right.

834
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I think maybe we've gone a little too hard.

835
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Is a Chase here?

836
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,840
Mike, can you just shout out a number

837
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,840
of how much the tickets cost?

838
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,840
That is not where the voice came from.

839
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Ticket prices fluctuate.

840
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Chase.

841
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
450, what the fuck?

842
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
That is not true.

843
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
You are not Chase.

844
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
That's a good deal though, Chase.

845
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
450 is like, there's a tugboat I found

846
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
that is going to go to Japan.

847
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,840
Some weird old lady is letting me dress up like her dog

848
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,840
and she's going to crate me for 450.

849
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,840
They let me just sleep in the overhead compartment to get there.

850
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,840
I'm mailing myself like in a fucking flat Stanley novel.

851
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm flat Stanley-ing myself.

852
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:06,840
I'm getting nurmalled to Tokyo.

853
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Mike, I went to Japan for my honeymoon in 2013.

854
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
It was $1,300.

855
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,840
That's a lot of money to put up your legs, kind of.

856
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,840
Yeah, he's saying if you bought the extra ticket.

857
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
If you bought the extra ticket and just ate it

858
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,840
so you could have a seat for your backpack to chill on.

859
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,840
At that point, you could just fly first class.

860
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
I know you've already bought the tickets.

861
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Yeah, you can't trade two bad ones for one good one.

862
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
Okay, but can you?

863
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,840
Could you find an eccentric millionaire sitting in first class

864
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
to be like, you ever know what it's like?

865
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,840
One cheek on one seat, one cheek on the other.

866
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,840
You look like a person who appreciates exotic experiences.

867
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,840
In one fucking screen, you can have Miss Peregrine's Home

868
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
for Peculiar Children.

869
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:59,840
In the other one, you can have Don't Breathe, just like Christmas.

870
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,840
You get the fucking quiche and you get the fruit plate for breakfast.

871
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,840
You'll lose your mind.

872
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:11,840
When I was flying here from Dulles.

873
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
Guys, he knows where he lives.

874
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
Kind of a one way thing.

875
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,840
When I was flying here from Dulles, it's in Virginia.

876
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
It's near DC.

877
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,840
I was flying here and there was another gentleman

878
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,840
of large carriage in the row with me.

879
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
He had the window and I had the aisle.

880
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,840
The whole time, when we first sat down, there was nobody in the middle.

881
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
We were both just staring at that fucking thing,

882
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,840
staring at the door, willing no one else to come in.

883
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,840
You could tell we were thinking it, that we didn't acknowledge it.

884
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,840
Then they made the boarding things like,

885
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,840
we're about to start pulling out or whatever we say here.

886
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
I don't really listen.

887
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
What was it?

888
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Yeah, whatever.

889
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,840
We're about to fly through the sky like a bird or a dragon.

890
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
What the fuck?

891
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
I'm a pilot.

892
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
I've been doing this for 20 years.

893
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
I still think it's fucking crazy.

894
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
We're like dragons up here.

895
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
How's this magic work?

896
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
This is Dylan.

897
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,840
He's going to stand in front of you and hold a mask

898
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
and show you how to put on a seat belt.

899
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,840
You're going to play Zelda on your Switch and pretend to pay attention.

900
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,840
All right.

901
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Oops.

902
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Uh-oh.

903
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Justin broke.

904
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Me and this other gentleman were in the row.

905
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
When they made that announcement,

906
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,840
he wordlessly reached over and just extended the pound.

907
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
It's so fucking choice.

908
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,840
We did not talk the rest of the flight.

909
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
But as soon as that door shut,

910
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,840
we're like bags on the seat, coats on the seat,

911
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
pull the thing down, put our drinks on it.

912
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,840
We're just like kings of this row.

913
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,840
That's nice.

914
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
That's like you're at a really...

915
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
He's the best friend I ever had.

916
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
It's like you're at a classy bar.

917
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
Read it before it goes away.

918
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,840
Okay, I got it because I paired to my fucking phone.

919
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Wait, wait, wait.

920
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,840
Can we answer that person?

921
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,840
I forget what the question was.

922
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm too excited about this.

923
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
I want to answer Chase real quick.

924
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
Oh, that's a lot of money.

925
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
That's like so much money probably.

926
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
It's like so much money, Chase.

927
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
So try to get some of your money back

928
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,840
because it's the worst investment you can make

929
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
because the moment you touch down,

930
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
you'd be like, oh, fuck me.

931
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I could have had $600.

932
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,840
And I don't know how standby works,

933
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,840
but that feels like something where they give your ticket away

934
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
because there's just like an empty seat

935
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,840
and they'd be like, oh, yeah, here you go.

936
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,840
It's like, oh, my $1,300 is just gone.

937
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
Hey, what is the deal with standby?

938
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Yeah, what's the deal?

939
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Hey, what's going on?

940
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,840
There it is.

941
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
There he goes.

942
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:44,840
There he goes.

943
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,840
My dreams have come true.

944
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,840
In case you're listening,

945
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
my brother was just dancing around

946
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:55,840
in the fashion of Gerald Seinfeld doing some of his classic material.

947
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
No, but really, are those people just showing up

948
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,840
and hoping they can get on a plane?

949
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,840
Fingers crossed.

950
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Got on my back, back two weeks off work.

951
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Here we go.

952
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,840
Rolling dice, baby.

953
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Rolling bones, mama.

954
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,840
Okay.

955
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,840
Hit me.

956
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,840
Get your money back.

957
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,840
This one was sent in by, I think, John Thomas Mason,

958
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,840
but that name disappeared about 35 minutes ago,

959
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,840
so I'm kind of boring from the rain.

960
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
I think that's who it was.

961
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
Thank you, John.

962
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,840
It's Yahoo Answers user sexyjanitor asks.

963
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,840
D-J-I-N-N?

964
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,840
What?

965
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
Sexy gin like a genie?

966
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,840
Janitor, pay attention.

967
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Because I got excited.

968
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
I was about to make a whole run on sexyjanitor stuff,

969
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
and you've been over there like,

970
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,840
that's not genie stuff.

971
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I've been over here just working that punch.

972
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,840
You're like, oh.

973
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:52,840
And you're like, that's not a...

974
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,840
This fucking hot-ass janitor asks.

975
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,840
This fucking bonerific custodian.

976
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,840
Why are you so mad at me?

977
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Accidentally watched a legal movie.

978
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,840
I walked in on my brother watching a movie.

979
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I had not seen this movie.

980
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,840
It was Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiarity.

981
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I watched it over someone's shoulder

982
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,840
sitting across from me on the plane, and...

983
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,840
I bet it made as much sense doing that as watching it.

984
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,840
I watched it on a plane.

985
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,840
There's a lot of spooky imagery,

986
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,840
and a lot of like, that made kids kind of weird.

987
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,840
And I was like, I saw that, and I was like, whoa.

988
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,840
I walked in on my brother watching Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiarity.

989
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Is it kids or children?

990
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
Who knows?

991
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I had not seen this movie, so I watched it too.

992
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,840
He told me later, he downloaded it, in all caps,

993
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,840
off of a website.

994
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,840
Our fucking audience was just like, revolted.

995
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I did not know they told such a hard line against cyber piracy.

996
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,840
No, God.

997
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Why?

998
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:18,840
But I wouldn't rob a bank.

999
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,840
You know, you laugh,

1000
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,840
but put up a television show that isn't available internationally,

1001
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,840
you'll start to take a pretty hard line against piracy too.

1002
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
Don't you dare!

1003
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
It's fun!

1004
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Do it to Billy Zane!

1005
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Do it to Tom Hanks!

1006
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Not to me!

1007
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Steel claiming the cube!

1008
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,840
It's hard to find!

1009
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
Not to me!

1010
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
You do a lot of bits on your podcast

1011
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,840
about how shoplifting is not only cool,

1012
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,840
but basically not a big deal at all,

1013
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,840
and you sort of accumulate this persona

1014
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,840
where people think they can come to you

1015
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
and just be like,

1016
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,840
hey, I stole all your shit!

1017
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,840
And you're like, okay.

1018
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,840
All right, I see where we went wrong.

1019
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
That's fine.

1020
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,840
I guess they do have repercussions sometimes.

1021
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I'm sorry.

1022
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,840
My name is Derek Best Buy and Checkmate.

1023
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I stole your thing.

1024
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
I downloaded a movie off a website.

1025
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
This is illegal.

1026
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
How do I hide this from the police

1027
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,840
so we do not have to go to jail?

1028
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,840
So one more question.

1029
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
All right, it makes total sense.

1030
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
I'm sorry.

1031
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,840
I just got to ask one more thing.

1032
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,840
How does Zootopia end?

1033
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,840
What particular movie snacks did you enjoy

1034
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,840
when you saw Zootopia?

1035
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Butter Crunch.

1036
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Do you mean popcorn?

1037
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Yeah.

1038
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Checkmate.

1039
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Boo Boo Cheese.

1040
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
What is it?

1041
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,840
It's Juju Beans, but I said it funny.

1042
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,840
That sounded like a racist thing,

1043
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
and I know it wasn't,

1044
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,840
but it sounded racist to someone.

1045
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
Minu Gents.

1046
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
God damn it.

1047
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,840
Whoa, is there a fucking movie candy

1048
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,840
that doesn't sound racist when you say it backwards?

1049
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Senior Mints.

1050
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Snowcaps are good.

1051
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Snowcaps are safe.

1052
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Thank you.

1053
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,840
One time this reminds me of a different crime

1054
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
that I committed.

1055
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I ran a red light in L.A.,

1056
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,840
and there was red light cameras,

1057
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
and there were like four of them in all of L.A.,

1058
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,840
and it's really fucked up

1059
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,840
because it's not actually the police.

1060
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,840
It's like a whole separate agency,

1061
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,840
and it costs like $800 for the ticket.

1062
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Oh, shit.

1063
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,840
And the thing is, you can just not pay it.

1064
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
This is true.

1065
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,840
They won't follow up on it unless...

1066
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Unless...

1067
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,840
You get arrested for something else.

1068
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
And if you get arrested for something else,

1069
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
they'll be like, oh, cool, so you shoplifted.

1070
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,840
And also, I see here, you ran a red light,

1071
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,840
and at that point, you have to pay like $1,600.

1072
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,840
So you're kind of rolling the bones on like,

1073
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,840
I just hope I never get arrested for anything ever.

1074
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,840
I heard that you don't have to pay those fees

1075
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,840
because you have the right to face your accuser in court,

1076
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
so if you challenge it, then they can't...

1077
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
They have to cut the red light off and bring it.

1078
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Yeah.

1079
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
Like fucking...

1080
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,840
There is no joke, like a laundry list,

1081
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,840
a hundred item long of things you can do to get out of it,

1082
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
and one is to just say, wasn't me.

1083
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
Yeah.

1084
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,840
And they're like, gah!

1085
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,840
They bring the light in like fucking, what is it, Spark 343?

1086
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,840
It's just like, you talk to it?

1087
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
Halo?

1088
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
Halo, yeah!

1089
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
It's the one...

1090
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
Woo!

1091
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,840
Bungie's classic shooter.

1092
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,840
All fucking amped now, thinking about all my good times.

1093
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,840
Shooting guys with Master Chief, my best friend.

1094
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Fuck yeah, dude.

1095
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
What's your favorite?

1096
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
Halo 4 for me.

1097
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
Fuck yeah, dude.

1098
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
Jetpacks?

1099
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
Let's get into it.

1100
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,840
I'm an assault rifle man.

1101
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
Yeah, dude.

1102
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I turn on my Xbox with my friends

1103
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,840
and I just go at it with Master Chief.

1104
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,840
And I see the floods show up and I'm like, too scary.

1105
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,840
I didn't know there was a scary alien game.

1106
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
What?

1107
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,840
What?

1108
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,840
I tried to play Call of Duty, but it was like,

1109
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,840
where's Master Chief?

1110
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Turn off, throw disk back into GameStop.

1111
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,840
I don't want it.

1112
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
What did you want?

1113
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,840
I want Halo 4 and 5.

1114
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,840
My good buddy, Master Chief.

1115
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
What about a Halo 3?

1116
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Halo 3 was all right.

1117
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Just kidding.

1118
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,840
It kicked ass.

1119
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
What about that part of Halo 2

1120
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,840
where you played as the Arbiter?

1121
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
That was actually in Halo 2.

1122
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,840
Did you even play the fucking Halo games?

1123
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
I thought you were 100%.

1124
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
What about that part of Halo 2

1125
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
where you were the Arbiter?

1126
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,840
I'm going to go.

1127
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Travis.

1128
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
Uh-huh.

1129
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
Travis.

1130
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
What's your Halo?

1131
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Master Chief kicks ass.

1132
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
Yeah, dude.

1133
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
Fucking green armor.

1134
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,840
He can carry two guns at a time.

1135
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
Are you some kind of wuss?

1136
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,840
I just play Dragon Age.

1137
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,840
That's not real gamers.

1138
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,840
Master Chief only...

1139
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,840
No, Master Chief's the only good game.

1140
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,840
Shortly after.

1141
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Master Chief's my favorite game of all time.

1142
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,840
I like Master Chief Jr.

1143
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
Hey.

1144
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,840
I was just...

1145
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
Hold on.

1146
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
Let it land.

1147
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
Master Chief Jr.

1148
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,840
I was like Master Chief Jr.

1149
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
It's a thinker, folks.

1150
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
Yeah.

1151
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
You'll get it.

1152
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
Drive home.

1153
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
Don't check your brains at the door.

1154
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,840
We got a lot of slow burns here.

1155
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:46,840
I was just possessed by the zeal of working in the video games industry for a decade.

1156
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,840
Folks, the Max Fun Drive is over,

1157
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,840
and you're enjoying our Portland live show.

1158
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
I hope you're enjoying it.

1159
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,840
I look back on it favorably,

1160
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,840
because that was before me and Henry both just got sick

1161
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,840
and will just always kind of have a cold, I guess,

1162
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,840
until he leaves for college or whatever.

1163
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,840
So it's nice to look back and be like, ah, health.

1164
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,840
Ah, the vitality.

1165
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
The spring of youth.

1166
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
Vitality. How nice.

1167
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,840
Before we get to our ads this week,

1168
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,840
I do want to say thank you to everybody who donated in the Max Fun Drive.

1169
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,840
I cannot believe that so many people stepped up and supported the show.

1170
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,840
It just means the world to me.

1171
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,840
And if you are a donor, just in case you missed it,

1172
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,840
we put up part two of the Adventure Zone bonus,

1173
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,840
featuring special guest Lin Manuel Miranda.

1174
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,840
And I'm very proud of it, and I want to tell everybody about it.

1175
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
It fucking rules.

1176
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
It was great.

1177
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Yeah, we broke 24,000 donors, which is like, what did we do last year?

1178
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,840
I think we did like 9,800 last year.

1179
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
How the fuck?

1180
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:46,840
Hey, y'all, what the fuck, though?

1181
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
You're amazing.

1182
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Griffin, how have you celebrated post-Max Fun Drive?

1183
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
Ah, dude, I'm glad you asked.

1184
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,840
I laid perfectly still on a couch

1185
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,840
and watched almost two whole seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

1186
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
Nice, nice.

1187
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:04,840
I'm taking a two-week Twitter hiatus and watching a lot of Psy videos.

1188
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840
Psy?

1189
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
Yeah.

1190
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
Oh, the musician?

1191
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Yeah, I've watched like Gangnam Style, and I got it from my daddy,

1192
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
just like on repeat.

1193
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,840
It just makes me really happy.

1194
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
I know it's not like the best music.

1195
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
You got the Psy videos from our dad?

1196
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,840
Our dad sent you Psy videos?

1197
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,840
No, it's the name of the song.

1198
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
I got it from my daddy.

1199
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
It's not important.

1200
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:26,840
This is not your main this week.

1201
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
No.

1202
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
Should we talk about our advertisements?

1203
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,840
Please do.

1204
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,840
I've got to load it up first because here they are.

1205
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,840
First advertisement is from a product, a service that is near and dear to my heart.

1206
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,840
That is Blue Apron.

1207
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,840
We've been using Blue Apron for a long time now,

1208
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,840
and what they do is for less than $10 per person per meal,

1209
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,840
they send you seasonal recipes along with pre-portioned ingredients

1210
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
to make delicious home-cooked meals.

1211
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,840
Talking about stuff like spinach and fresh mozzarella.

1212
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Nice. Nailed it.

1213
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
Got it in one.

1214
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,840
Pizza with olives, bell peppers, and ricotta salata.

1215
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,840
All right. Didn't quite get that one.

1216
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Henry's favorite show is Curious George,

1217
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,840
and we accidentally watched nine seasons of it over the course of like two and a half weeks.

1218
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,840
And there's a guy on it named Chef Piscetti,

1219
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,840
and I don't know how this show isn't like under fire

1220
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,840
because it's sort of a hateful caricature, Chef Piscetti.

1221
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,840
Now Griffin, you say that it's his favorite show.

1222
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,840
That fool is four months old.

1223
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,840
What do you mean it's his favorite show?

1224
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,840
He's not like demanding it.

1225
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,840
He doesn't wake up and he's like Curious George now.

1226
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,840
He gets these like fever waves,

1227
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,840
and he gets really upset and like cries a lot very, very hard,

1228
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,840
and the only thing that will make this boy like chill out and stop crying

1229
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,840
and making himself sicker is plopping down in front of Chef Piscetti

1230
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,840
to get some of his good just caricature of a person wisdom.

1231
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,840
And so yes, Travis, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

1232
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Curious George saved my life.

1233
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,840
Saved my life in the war.

1234
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,840
Sweet and sour salmon with bok choy, carrot, and ginger fried rice,

1235
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:05,840
parmesan crusted chicken with creamy fettuccine and roasted broccoli.

1236
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,840
And so you're going to get all those really, really tasty.

1237
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Rachel and I love Blue Apron and we cook all the time using these tasty boxes.

1238
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,840
And you can check out this week's menu and get your first three meals for free

1239
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,840
with free shipping by going to blueapron.com slash my brother.

1240
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,840
You're going to really enjoy it.

1241
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
I guarantee it.

1242
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,840
It's blueapron.com slash my brother.

1243
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:27,840
I want to talk this week about Lyft.

1244
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,840
So Lyft, you know, the ride sharing app.

1245
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
Lyft is my favorite.

1246
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,840
I don't know it.

1247
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
They dipped on it.

1248
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,840
This is no judgment on Lyft, but they bounced on me.

1249
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,840
And so now it's like, baby, come back.

1250
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,840
To be fair, Griffin, we do travel a lot.

1251
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,840
So I'm sure you'll get an opportunity to Lyft once again.

1252
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,840
Someday I'll Lyft again.

1253
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,840
I use it not only for traveling.

1254
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,840
When Teresa and I lived in LA, it was just so much more convenient to like call a Lyft

1255
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,840
and not have to worry about parking or traffic or anything like that, you know,

1256
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,840
especially if you know you're going someplace where you're going to be imbibing alcohol.

1257
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,840
Taking a Lyft there and back is so much more responsible and I would say cooler.

1258
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,840
And, you know, it's an interesting combination because you do Lyft

1259
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,840
and you both get kind of the luxurious feeling of having a driver,

1260
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,840
but you also like are making a new friend.

1261
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:22,840
When I went to San Francisco for Sketchfest and I had a Lyft driver

1262
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,840
and I asked him if we could like go completely out of the way

1263
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,840
to stop at the Golden Gate Bridge before he took me to the airport.

1264
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,840
And he not only was like happy to oblige,

1265
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,840
he like talked to me about San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge

1266
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,840
and his experience of living there for I think about an hour and 15 minutes of travel.

1267
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,840
And it was just incredible and he was a really cool dude.

1268
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,840
And, you know, Lyft is affordable and it's…

1269
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
And he's the only driver.

1270
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,840
If you get a Lyft, it's going to be this guy.

1271
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,840
In San Francisco, I think he's the only adopter.

1272
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,840
No, it's a really great option and nothing against taxis.

1273
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,840
I've had a lot of great experiences in taxis too,

1274
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:06,840
but I have often found Lyft to be way more affordable.

1275
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,840
And I'm just a big fan and I'm not just saying that because they're a sponsor.

1276
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,840
I use Lyft all the time.

1277
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:17,840
And right now Lyft is offering our listeners a special deal for new users.

1278

Use the promo code BROTHER.

00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Get it.

1288
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,840
I have a couple of Jumbotron spots here.

1289
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,840
This one's for Chris with a K, a.k.a. Kromsler, a.k.a. Acid Burn.

1290
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:53,840
And it's from L, like the letter, a.k.a. Pinskidan, a.k.a. Lady Nikon.

1291
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Do you think that these are like their graffiti tags?

1292
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,840
Yes.

1293
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Also, they are, oh yeah, I mean the last ones are.

1294
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,840
The other ones are my bim bam sweet refs.

1295
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
They are?

1296
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
Wait, hold on.

1297
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,840
They are?

1298
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
Yeah.

1299
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,840
I don't know this.

1300
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,840
Justin was trying to come up with a name for a human being

1301
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,840
and he said Kromsler and Pinskidan because he's a mutant.

1302
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

1303
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Why isn't Justin…

1304
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,840
Oh, Justin went taekwondo.

1305
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,840
Thanks for fulfilling my ridiculous pre-knowing you tweet

1306
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:25,840
of only accepting a proposal if it came at a live my bim bam show.

1307
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,840
We've gotten pretty hitched by the time that you hear this.

1308
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,840
If so, we've probably gotten hitched.

1309
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,840
Yeah, we've gotten pretty hitched.

1310
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,840
Listen, we've watched Hitch.

1311
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,840
We hitched up some horses.

1312
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,840
We are so hitched.

1313
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,840
We've probably gotten hitched by the time you hear this.

1314
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:42,840
If so, it was the best day of my life.

1315
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Thank you for being attentive, affectionate, playful, six foot one,

1316
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,840
and of course atheist.

1317
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,840
Happy anniversary and birthday sugar booger.

1318
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
Hack the planet.

1319
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Nice.

1320
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:56,840
Yeah, that's congratulations on your wedding maybe.

1321
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,840
If it has happened, I'm sure it was wonderful.

1322
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,840
If not, then happy tidings.

1323
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,840
Happy tidings and goodwill to all.

1324
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,840
This next message is for…

1325
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,840
It might be Anastasia, but I'm going to go with Anastasia.

1326
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
Perfect.

1327
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
Because I like that better.

1328
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,840
And it could be Joey, but I'm going to go with Joey.

1329
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Joey.

1330
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,840
By now, we are happily married.

1331
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
What the fuck?

1332
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Wait, what's going on?

1333
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
What?

1334
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
Hold on.

1335
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
These are different people?

1336
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Yeah.

1337
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
Probably.

1338
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,840
Oh, it's just spring, you know?

1339
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
It's wedding season.

1340
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Everybody's getting hitched.

1341
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
Watching Hitch.

1342
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
I guess so.

1343
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
Oh, isn't that ironic?

1344
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
That joke's so nice.

1345
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
I had to tell it twice.

1346
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,840
Well, here's the thing, if you think about it, his name is Hitch,

1347
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,840
but he also helps people find relationships.

1348
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,840
So he's like hitching people up, which is not…

1349
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
Oh.

1350
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
I don't think people have used that gerund in that way.

1351
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,840
Like we're hitching people up when you introduce people to each other.

1352
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,840
Oh, yeah.

1353
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:54,840
But if you think about it, it works on two different levels,

1354
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
because it's both his name…

1355
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,840
His name is also the verb that means to attach to people in love.

1356
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
Exactly.

1357
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,840
So just think about it.

1358
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:06,840
We're stalling right now because the rest of this podcast is actually an hour of silence,

1359
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,840
and we don't want anybody to get to that part.

1360
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,840
By now, we are happily married, and what better way to celebrate

1361
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,840
than to announce it on our favorite podcast.

1362
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,840
You make me a better man, and I am lucky to have you.

1363
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,840
I can't wait to travel the world with you and spend the rest of our lives together.

1364
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,840
If you're still unsure if the brothers are talking about you,

1365
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,840
our dog's rap name is Lisa Lefty or Lopez.

1366
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:29,840
Somebody just lost their minds.

1367
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
They're like, but…

1368
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
Yeah.

1369
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
My dog.

1370
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
It's me.

1371
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,840
I'm the Anastasia that they mentioned.

1372
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,840
That's me.

1373
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,840
Congratulations on your wedding again, maybe.

1374
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,840
Maybe?

1375
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,840
Probably, right?

1376
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,840
Yeah.

1377
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Sure.

1378
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,840
And just on your love.

1379
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,840
Hey, congratulations on being hitched.

1380
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
Yeah.

1381
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
Oh, man.

1382
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
Will Smith.

1383
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
Like the movie.

1384
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
I want to thank…

1385
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,840
I don't know if we did it in the podcast, but John Roderick and the Long Winters

1386
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,840
for your use of our theme song instead of Parchoff putting the album…

1387
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,840
putting the album to bed.

1388
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
Exactly.

1389
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:09,840
And I want to thank all of our Max Fun listeners and all…

1390
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
Yes, thank you.

1391
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,840
And everybody who works at Max Fun.

1392
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,840
And go check out all the other amazing Max Fun shows.

1393
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,840
I will say that the…

1394
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,840
Flophouse is already one of my favorites, but every year, at least for the last two,

1395
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,840
they've had John Hodgman on for a special episode.

1396
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,840
And they did in 1941.

1397
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,840
And it was just an absolute treat.

1398
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,840
Highly recommend.

1399
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,840
Go check it out.

1400
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,840
And thank you to everybody who came to this Portland show.

1401
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,840
It was a buck wild audience.

1402
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,840
We hadn't done a live show in like six months.

1403
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,840
And so it was a really great thing to come back to.

1404
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
So thank you so much.

1405
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Now enjoy the rest.

1406
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
Let's get back to it.

1407
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
Yeah.

00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,840
Hey, I have an announcement to make.

1420
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,840
When my roommate orgasms, he yells at the top of his lungs.

1421
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
Continue.

1422
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,840
Okay.

1423
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
Just keep going.

1424
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:48,840
When my roommate orgasms, he yells at the top of his lungs.

1425
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,840
It's very loud.

1426
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
No, yeah.

1427
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,840
And can happen at any time of the night.

1428
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,840
Good for your fucking roommate, I guess.

1429
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,840
And, Griffin, I can't hear you very well.

1430
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
You gotta sit up.

1431
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
And watch your head.

1432
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
Watch your head.

1433
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
Careful.

1434
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
Oh, thanks.

1435
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
Okay.

1436
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
Oh, sweet.

1437
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
Yeah.

1438
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
You say aww.

1439
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,840
I'm not gonna sit up here with a fucking bloodied brother.

1440
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,840
It's like I care about him very much.

1441
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,840
I don't think he'd not black out while we're performing.

1442
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
Okay.

1443
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,840
I gotta start this at the beginning because there's a really good…

1444
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,840
He yells at the top of his lungs.

1445
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
It's very loud.

1446
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,840
And can happen at any time of night and day during weekends.

1447
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,840
It's a little afternoon delight.

1448
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:37,840
He does not care if anyone else is home and does nothing to mask the sound.

1449
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,840
I find his yelling a mix of hilarious, absurd, and inconsiderate.

1450
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
Very sexy.

1451
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,840
Very erotic.

1452
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,840
Very sexy.

1453
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
Very erotic.

1454
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,840
I like to get back at him with something of a similar tone.

1455
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,840
Hopefully, they mean metaphorically, not literally.

1456
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,840
Oh, I'm right here.

1457
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
I'm right here.

1458
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
I'm right here.

1459
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
You are right here.

1460
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:03,840
Since my baby orgasmed, I want to get him back with something of a similar tone before

1461
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,840
we part ways when our lease ends in a few months.

1462
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,840
What should I do?

1463
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:13,840
That's from Tone Down the Bone Down in Boulder.

1464
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
Okay.

1465
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,840
First off, are you here?

1466
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
That would be weird.

1467
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,840
Yes, I am.

1468
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,840
Is your roomie?

1469
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
Okay.

1470
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
Okay.

1471
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
No, wait.

1472
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Stop, stop, stop.

1473
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:26,840
This is the most important question possibly of all time.

1474
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
Yes.

1475
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
Is your roommate here?

1476
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,840
No.

1477
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Yes.

1478
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,840
All right.

1479
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
Okay.

1480
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
No, wait.

1481
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
I need you.

1482
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
You're told for answering this question.

1483
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
Please come down to this microphone.

1484
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
Yeah.

1485
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
Come on down.

1486
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:47,840
You did not include in the email, what does he yell?

1487
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,840
I have another question, by the way, that I need you to address after you address Travis's

1488
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
question.

1489
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:55,840
Is he going to yell solo or?

1490
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,840
Because that would be buck wild.

1491
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:04,840
He's like, you did it again, Dylan.

1492
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,840
Another great search.

1493
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,840
Oh, wait.

1494
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,840
We just got another email and it's from somebody here in Portland.

1495
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,840
It's like, I got this dude I bone and he shouts a lot.

1496
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
Okay.

1497
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
So what's up?

1498
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,840
It's just a wordless yell.

1499
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
Okay.

1500
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
How?

1501
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
I got a yell.

1502
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
He does a barbaric yell.

1503
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:26,840
I know this is wack, but like, can you break us off a piece?

1504
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,840
I'm going to stop.

1505
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:34,840
We're all going to be very professional about this.

1506
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
This is a scientific setting.

1507
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,840
We just need to know if you can break us off a piece.

1508
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
Okay.

1509
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
It's just like this.

1510
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
No.

1511
01:01:41,840 --> 01:02:02,160
Okay, so if I read this correctly, when your roommate makes love, he sounds like Randy

1512
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:04,840
Quaid flying into the spaceship in an opinions bill.

1513
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,840
That's what you're telling me.

1514
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,840
And you have to live with that.

1515
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
So how'd your date go?

1516
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:14,840
Well, good for the first, about 98.5%.

1517
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
Yeah.

1518
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Right at the end there though.

1519
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,840
It had a weird finish when he turned into Shao Kahn from Mortal Kombat.

1520
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
But like-

1521
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,840
Have you addressed this before?

1522
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
No.

1523
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
What's your name?

1524
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,840
Well, actually, maybe you don't want to say your name on the podcast.

1525
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
No, it's cool.

1526
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
My name's Allie.

1527
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
Hi, Allie.

1528
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
Allie.

1529
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
And what's your roommate's full name?

1530
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I want to say two things, Allie.

1531
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,840
First off, I want to thank you so much for coming up to the mic.

1532
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,840
Secondly, I will ask you to take your seat now because we're about to say some things

1533
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,840
that might be weird to say to your face.

1534
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,840
Thank you very much.

1535
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
Thanks, Allie.

1536
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,840
Everybody, a big hand for him.

1537
01:02:55,840 --> 01:03:01,840
There is a very real possibility that if you address this with your roommate, they have

1538
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,840
no idea they're actually doing it out loud.

1539
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,840
Yeah.

1540
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,840
You can lose yourself in that orgasm if they will.

1541
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,840
What's the deal with orgasm?

1542
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
When that-

1543
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
Please tell me.

1544
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
There's very-

1545
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,840
Please, God, someone tell me.

1546
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:24,840
There's very little I hate more than talking about sex stuff with my brothers.

1547
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:28,840
And I don't know why we always choose to do it in front of a crowd of a thousand people.

1548
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,840
But this is when we do it.

1549
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:35,840
I was not expecting this question to take such a Count of Monte Cristo revenge tale

1550
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
twist at the end.

1551
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
It's weird.

1552
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
It's sort of like, how could I bring it up in a polite way?

1553
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
No.

1554
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,840
Allie was like, how could I get back at this motherfucker and nail him to the fucking wall?

1555
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:50,840
You're going to need to start some kind of tally mark count because I just think that

1556
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:58,840
would be a really good look if he comes out and you're just turning back from like-

1557
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:01,840
I scored another one, Dylan.

1558
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,840
Here's what I think.

1559
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,840
And hang with me because it's going to get worse before it gets better.

1560
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:14,840
Get out the app on your phone or iPad called GarageBand and you say, it's going to get

1561
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,840
worse before it gets better.

1562
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:20,840
You can't come with me halfway through the fucking swamp of sadness.

1563
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,840
You're going to come with me and we're going to get through it together.

1564
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,840
He did warn you ahead of time.

1565
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
Nobody ran for the door.

1566
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:30,840
There's a thing on there where you can record a sample that you can then inject into a keyboard

1567
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,840
and then play.

1568
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:39,840
So you record it and then you lay down a fucking sick hook, you record it and it's like, ow.

1569
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,840
And then you send that to DJ Khaled.

1570
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
Then you send it to Rishikesh here.

1571
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,840
You send it to DJ Khaled and he puts it in this fucking next summer jam.

1572
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,840
And then this roommate is listening.

1573
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,840
So you're suggesting kind of like a-

1574
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:59,000
you'll have to do their base on your

1575
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,820
own and probably that unless things are

1576
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,600
going bad in there my can I can I

1577
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,880
Did I count her over?

1578
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:08,680
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum.

1579
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,760
Eh...

1580
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,160
AHH!

1581
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,720
Laughing

1582
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,140
Laugh

1583
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:17,100
Cheering

1584
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,340
I'M GONNA KNIGHT!

1585
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:26,620
AHHHH!

1586
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:29,220
Show me that smile again...

1587
01:05:29,220 --> 01:05:32,040
I'M GONNA KNIGHT!

1588
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:34,040
No, wrong! Wrong read!

1589
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,040
Nut Squad can't become anything.

1590
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:50,540
We had a segment on our show called Nut Squad for a long time, and it was our extreme restraints advertisement.

1591
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:54,540
That era has sadly come to an end.

1592
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,040
Which one of these did I open? This one?

1593
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,040
They both look pretty full of water, so go nuts.

1594
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:07,040
No, I'm just saying you can have either one. You can have either one.

1595
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,040
No, I opened the other one. I had a little drink of poo when I was choking.

1596
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,040
How are you all doing?

1597
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:21,040
I can't make out anybody individually. Just one at a time, just say how you're doing at the same time.

1598
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:27,040
There's a better way of doing this. I think we maybe want to do some audience questions.

1599
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:30,040
Time for audience questions. Can we get the house lights up?

1600
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,040
House lights will take some questions to the audience.

1601
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:41,040
Rachel, there's a microphone right behind you. There's microphones there. There's microphones up there.

1602
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,040
We'll try to get to as many people as you can.

1603
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,040
Folks, Rachel Rosen.

1604
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,040
Rachel Rosen, everybody.

1605
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:53,040
If we could just get the house lights just a little bit more.

1606
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,040
Wait, I don't think it just stays in the sand. There we go.

1607
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,040
Is it on? Hold on, wait.

1608
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,040
Is there a button on it? Oh, it's on now. All right, shit.

1609
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:05,040
All right, well, they told me it would come out.

1610
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:09,040
Hey, guys. Andy lied to you.

1611
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:13,040
Portland has a really cool surprise for you, and they asked me to tell you about it,

1612
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,040
but first we have to go to the Money Zone.

1613
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,040
Okay.

1614
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,040
They're rushing the stage.

1615
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,040
They're rushing the stage. This is our last transmission.

1616
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:39,040
Listen, if you lose us after this, the McElroy brothers, we're so sorry that we let you astray.

1617
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,040
What's up?

1618
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,040
Hey, guys.

1619
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:42,040
Hey, what happened?

1620
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:47,040
All right, so you brothers have built an amazing community

1621
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,040
that takes inspiration from your caring and generosity,

1622
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:55,040
and in the spirit of that generosity, Portland Mbim Bambinos has spent the last few weeks

1623
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:01,040
raising funds and items for Portland Homeless Family Solutions, a local nonprofit agency.

1624
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,040
Generous Mbim Bambinos.

1625
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,040
God, that's hard to say.

1626
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:11,040
Yeah, no kidding. Sorry.

1627
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,040
They've raised $869.

1628
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,040
That's awesome.

1629
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,040
Nice.

1630
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,040
For this good cause through donations and selling raffle tickets.

1631
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,040
We have an amazing raffle pack.

1632
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,040
We were hoping that you guys could draw a winning name.

1633
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,040
Yes, of course.

1634
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:32,040
Winner, meet—now's the time to get your tickets out and look at them.

1635
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,040
I know some of you guys bought a lot of tickets.

1636
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,040
Meet by the raffle table after the show.

1637
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,040
Don't rush the stage or anything crazy like that.

1638
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,040
All right, the winning ticket is $273,000.

1639
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,040
It's probably—just read the numbers.

1640
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:50,040
Two, seven, three, two, nine, eight.

1641
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,040
Yes!

1642
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,040
A silent hand goes up in our audio podcast.

1643
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,040
After the show.

1644
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,040
We'll get you after the show. They'll hook you up.

1645
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
Here are some of the amazing things in that basket.

1646
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,040
There's a Portland walking tour.

1647
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:11,040
There is $100 worth of services from Bessie Day Salon and Pretty Sweet Sugaring.

1648
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,040
There's a haunted doll, you guys.

1649
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,040
Yeah!

1650
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,040
As made famous by this episode.

1651
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,040
And now take it back.

1652
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:21,040
That's close enough. Thank you.

1653
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:24,040
There's a ticket to the annual Portland Queer Comedy Festival.

1654
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,040
There's a gift basket from New Seasons Market.

1655
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:30,040
And there is an official Trolls movie poster.

1656
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,040
Fuck yeah!

1657
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:37,040
Signed by all your favorite trolls.

1658
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:40,040
There is something else going on tonight, too.

1659
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,040
Inspired by Travis's I Am Holding Your Hand campaign,

1660
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,040
there are boxes in the lobby for anyone who wants to give a letter, take a letter.

1661
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,040
People writing letters of support, positivity, or just fucking goofs

1662
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:56,040
to a random bambino and get one in return.

1663
01:09:56,040 --> 01:10:01,040
So if you've written a letter to a bambino—I'm saying that word too many times tonight—

1664
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:05,040
then grab one on your way out and, you know, kind of make a love connection.

1665
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,040
It's super great.

1666
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,040
And my bim-bam-binos have also written you brothers letters of love and thanks.

1667
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,040
Oh my god.

1668
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,040
Thank you.

1669
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,040
I don't know how much we appreciate you.

1670
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:17,040
You're so sweet. Thank you.

1671
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:23,040
All of this great stuff was organized by the Sweet Baby Sisters,

1672
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,040
Alice, Jenna, Carrie, Tori, and Emily.

1673
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:31,040
I recognize her game.

1674
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,040
And a big, great job to Andy the producer for bringing you guys here.

1675
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,040
And happy birthday to Andy!

1676
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:41,040
Happy birthday, Andy!

1677
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,040
This is so great. Thank you all so much.

1678
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:44,040
Yeah. It was inspired by you brothers.

1679
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,040
You make the world a nicer place.

1680
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,040
Aww.

1681
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,040
Thank you.

1682
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,040
Cheers.

1683
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:53,040
Get up here.

1684
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,040
Put you on the line.

1685
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,040
The rest of the podcast is hugging.

1686
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:58,040
Those hugs are for us, too.

1687
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,040
That's us, too. We're in those, too.

1688
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,040
Those hugs are for us.

1689
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:01,040
Yeah.

1690
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,040
Yeah. Jesus.

1691
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:03,040
Nice.

1692
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,040
Now, Griff, go one more again.

1693
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,040
This one's for me.

1694
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,040
Because I'm already seated and it's like a whole thing.

1695
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,040
You have a story.

1696
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,040
Oh, god.

1697
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,040
I still want it.

1698
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:12,040
Thank you, creepy doll.

1699
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,040
Thank you, Rachel.

1700
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,040
Thank you.

1701
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,040
Thank you.

1702
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,040
I just want to say, these ladies did everything.

1703
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,040
And then just fucking contacted me and they were like,

1704
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,040
you're the name. Will you get up on stage?

1705
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,040
You're the heat.

1706
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:29,040
I got like a fucking sweet ride on their hard work.

1707
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,040
Well, thank you all.

1708
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1709
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:35,040
And there's a giant check.

1710
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,040
Can I just hold on to it?

1711
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,040
Yeah.

1712
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,040
I've always wanted one of these bad boys.

1713
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,040
I'll just hang on to it.

1714
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,040
I'm not going to keep it.

1715
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,040
Do I mail this?

1716
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,040
Endorse the back of it.

1717
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:51,040
It's going to take a fuck ton of stamps.

1718
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,040
I think we have a stamps.com membership coming up.

1719
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,040
Can you hold on to this until we get that cool sponsorship thing?

1720
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,040
Yeah, these ladies can super hang on to it.

1721
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,040
Thank you very much.

1722
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,040
Thank you all.

1723
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:02,040
Let's give a big hand for them.

1724
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:05,040
They're amazing.

1725
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,040
Thank you all.

1726
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,040
I still have an actual question for you guys.

1727
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,040
I sent it in, but you didn't read it.

1728
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,040
Hit me.

1729
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,040
Oh, come on.

1730
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:16,040
I did my best.

1731
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,040
No, like an actual, like an audio.

1732
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:19,040
Oh, really?

1733
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,040
Yeah.

1734
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,040
I need advice.

1735
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,040
Hit it.

1736
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,040
Okay.

1737
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:25,040
So I have a lot of dick pics in my phone.

1738
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,040
I'm going to do you a favor then.

1739
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,040
No, you can't fucking stop now.

1740
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,040
No, no, no.

1741
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,040
That's a teaser of what's to come if you want to head back down so you don't have to

1742
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,040
stand up here in front of people the whole time.

1743
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,040
Yeah, that's right.

1744
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,040
Careful, careful, Rachel.

1745
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,040
Something happens to you.

1746
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,040
The show is over.

1747
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,040
Charlie after.

1748
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:45,040
And thus ended my brother, my brother and me when Rachel Rosen tragically tumbled off

1749
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,040
the stage.

1750
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,040
All right.

1751
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,040
Okay.

1752
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,040
Here it comes.

1753
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,040
Here it comes.

1754
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,040
I have a lot of dick pics in my phone.

1755
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:56,040
Just over a year and a half ago, I was doing a lot of online dating.

1756
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,040
I think any lady who's done online dating has a lot of dick pics.

1757
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,040
What?

1758
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,040
What?

1759
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:09,040
I saved them in order to send back to gentlemen who sent them to me.

1760
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,040
Wait, wait, wait.

1761
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,040
Same or different gentleman?

1762
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,040
Here's what Doug's working with.

1763
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,040
Basically.

1764
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,040
Okay.

1765
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,040
That's a fun service you provide.

1766
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:19,040
Uh huh.

1767
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,040
That's sort of like the write a letter dick.

1768
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:23,040
Yeah.

1769
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Have the worst possible version of that.

1770
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,040
Have a penis, give a penis, need a penis, take a penis.

1771
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:37,040
But also just like a lot of them are really funny.

1772
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:41,040
Like what dudes consider to be maybe sexy or artistic or attractive.

1773
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,040
It's the googly eyes that get it every time.

1774
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,040
No, no, there's a black and white one that never fails to make me giggle.

1775
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:50,040
Very artsy.

1776
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:57,040
The thing is that I'm now about a year and a half into an amazing, serious, loving, and happy relationship.

1777
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:04,040
And I wonder, do I need to delete my dick pics?

1778
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,040
No.

1779
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,040
Okay.

1780
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,040
You worked so hard for them.

1781
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:17,040
Do you have enough that you could make them very small and do like a pointillism picture?

1782
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,040
It makes Darth Vader's face.

1783
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,040
I do not have that many.

1784
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,040
Okay.

1785
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,040
All right, everybody.

1786
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:26,040
We're all going to work together tonight.

1787
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,040
Do you guys want to see any of them?

1788
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:35,040
No.

1789
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:40,040
All right, Griffin is currently going to Rachel and checking out the dick pics on her phone.

1790
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:42,040
I don't doubt you.

1791
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,040
I know.

1792
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:47,040
There's one dude who sent me like six within the space of two minutes.

1793
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,040
She's passing a wide net.

1794
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,040
I know.

1795
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,040
They're not on my camera roll.

1796
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:53,040
They're in my text.

1797
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,040
Hold up.

1798
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,040
You got to save this on your camera roll.

1799
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,040
They're definitely in here.

1800
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,040
Make them permanent.

1801
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,040
Or to Instagram.

1802
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:59,040
This dude.

1803
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,040
All right.

1804
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,040
Hold on.

1805
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,040
Here we go.

1806
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,040
Here we go.

1807
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,040
We got a bite.

1808
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,040
That's my favorite one.

1809
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,040
All right.

1810
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,040
He's got one.

1811
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,040
Travis is going over to look at the dicks.

1812
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:09,040
It's so fucking funny.

1813
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,040
He's got one.

1814
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,040
He's kind of just laid it out on an end table like it was sleeping.

1815
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,040
Yes.

1816
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,040
Yes.

1817
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,040
Like an afterthought.

1818
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,040
Like an afterthought.

1819
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,040
He might be like, what?

1820
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,040
Oh.

1821
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,040
Wait.

1822
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,040
Wait.

1823
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,040
That's a lot.

1824
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,040
Yeah.

1825
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,040
All right.

1826
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,040
That's a lot.

1827
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,040
Okay.

1828
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:35,840
I know.

1829
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
Let me ask you this.

1830
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
Please.

1831
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,840
And I've actually just answered this question, like, is there anything about your Pokédex.

1832
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
Wait.

1833
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,600
Griffin, if I may.

1834
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,000
Pokédicks.

1835
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,640
That brings you like some level of joy or novelty.

1836
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:55,640
And I think the answer is yes.

1837
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
Right?

1838
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,640
Yes.

1839
01:15:57,640 --> 01:15:58,640
You are asking about it in front of a room full of strangers.

1840
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,640
And here is my boyfriend.

1841
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:00,640
So he doesn't mind.

1842
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,640
And you're cool.

1843
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:02,640
You're cool.

1844
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,640
Yeah.

1845
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:04,640
I don't like it.

1846
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,640
Huge hog.

1847
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:06,640
For sure.

1848
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:07,640
Listen.

1849
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,280
The thing is, Rachel, from this point on, when people see you, they're going to ask

1850
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,280
you, can I see some of the dicks on your front?

1851
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:14,280
Totally fine.

1852
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,280
Specifically the one.

1853
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,280
I'll show any of y'all.

1854
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,280
Have you heard the story of the...

1855
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Grandma Mom, show me the scrapbook again.

1856
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:29,920
Well, child, I was doing online dating for a brief time, and well, you know.

1857
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:35,400
Have you heard the story of the chicken that worked very hard before the winter and everybody

1858
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:36,400
else...

1859
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,400
I thought it was a grasshopper.

1860
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,400
It was definitely a grasshopper.

1861
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:39,400
Grasshopper.

1862
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,400
Or maybe an ant.

1863
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,400
No, it's like a chick.

1864
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,400
It's an ant.

1865
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:43,400
It's a grasshopper and an ant.

1866
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,400
Like who will help me get the wheat?

1867
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:45,400
Who will help me save the bitch?

1868
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,400
Anyway, here's what I'm saying.

1869
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,400
The winter gon' come.

1870
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,400
I love you.

1871
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,400
You're cool.

1872
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,400
The winter gon' come.

1873
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,400
No, you're fine.

1874
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:52,400
You're fine.

1875
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,400
You're fine.

1876
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,400
You're cool.

1877
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,400
You may just go out of town.

1878
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,400
The winter may be you going out of town.

1879
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,400
That's what I'm saying.

1880
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
But Rachel, the winter gon' come.

1881
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,120
Is that what they're talking to you about in Game of Thrones?

1882
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,120
The winter gon' come.

1883
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,120
Winter is coming.

1884
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,120
Dick pic winter is coming, Rachel.

1885
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,120
You need to hoard your stores.

1886
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,120
Hoard those dick pic reserves.

1887
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,120
I actually...

1888
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,120
You know what, Justin?

1889
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:15,360
I'm going to say you're being a little too stringent.

1890
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,560
Maybe open some kind of Etsy shop where you sell the pictures to people.

1891
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,560
I think that's a federal crime.

1892
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:21,560
Friend?

1893
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:22,560
They were all of age, Justin.

1894
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,560
All right.

1895
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,560
That was never a question.

1896
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,560
But I'm glad that it's...

1897
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:26,560
All right.

1898
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,560
I think we've helped.

1899
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,560
Yeah.

1900
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,560
I think we've helped.

1901
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,560
Rachel, thank you so much.

1902
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:31,560
Thank you.

1903
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:32,560
Okay.

1904
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,560
Let's see.

1905
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,560
Nobody's at this mic.

1906
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:35,560
So let's look...

1907
01:17:35,560 --> 01:17:36,560
No.

1908
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:37,560
I mean, there's a mic right there.

1909
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,560
You just line up at the mic.

1910
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,560
If you want to ask a question, just get in line.

1911
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:46,560
That is not the case.

1912
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Go back to your seat.

1913
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:52,560
He spoke out of turn.

1914
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,560
That was wrong.

1915
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,560
I was wrong.

1916
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
Justin made a bad call there because he's had a little too much of that.

1917
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,440
People have done that in prior years.

1918
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,440
It's been six months.

1919
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,440
No.

1920
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,440
I hate that idea.

1921
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
Let's...

1922
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,440
Yeah.

1923
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:04,440
We met you at lunch today.

1924
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Yeah.

1925
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,440
Yeah.

1926
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:11,440
Reyes, Max Reyes?

1927
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,440
Yeah.

1928
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,440
Whoa.

1929
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:14,440
You...

1930
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:15,440
Wait.

1931
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
I put him on blast.

1932
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,440
I hope your question is not embarrassing at all.

1933
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:18,440
No.

1934
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,440
So I killed a guy.

1935
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,440
Okay.

1936
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:21,440
Max, what's up?

1937
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:22,440
Max, what's the deal?

1938
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,440
Okay.

1939
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,440
So I work at a Chipotle back in California where I live.

1940
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,440
I'm a cashier and...

1941
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:30,240
Can we tell the story real quick, Max, before you get started?

1942
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,240
Yeah.

1943
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:35,240
We were eating at a Thai restaurant and Max and Amy just walked past the window and they're

1944
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:36,240
like, hey, there they are.

1945
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:43,840
Well, actually, I did saw two human beings do this and I was like, what happened?

1946
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,840
We happened.

1947
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,840
That's the answer.

1948
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,840
So we brought them in.

1949
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,840
Max is from California and he said...

1950
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:48,840
And he said he's from California.

1951
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,840
I was like, well, it's certainly coming to the show, right?

1952
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,840
He's like, no, we didn't get tickets.

1953
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:59,120
I was like, well, then you should still come to the show, but it was like absolutely the

1954
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,780
most random, like literally walking past the window.

1955
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:06,000
So if you want to know how to get tickets to a show, it's a secret, you got to visualize

1956
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
it hard enough.

1957
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Yeah.

1958
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Yeah.

1959
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
It's like a weird geocache.

1960
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Yeah.

1961
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's like a weird geocache.

1962
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Find Thai places near arcades.

1963
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Yeah.

1964
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
That's the secret.

1965
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
All right, Max.

1966
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
We're going to Chipotle.

1967
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
You're looking for new burrito recipes.

1968
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
You've come to the right place.

1969
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Try meat and cheese.

1970
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Next question.

1971
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Maybe some sort of sauce.

1972
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
A cheese pizza.

1973
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:35,880
Cheese pizza, Max.

1974
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,880
A cheese pizza burrito.

1975
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,880
You know what that sounds like?

1976
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,880
TM.

1977
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,880
TM.

1978
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
TM.

1979
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,880
TM.

1980
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:45,880
TM.

1981
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,880
TM.

1982
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,880
I want a munch.

1983
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:48,880
Yeah.

1984
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:49,880
Okay, it's fine.

1985
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:50,880
Jesus, with the fucking machine has become like...

1986
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,880
Max, what's your question about Chipotle?

1987
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:52,880
All right.

1988
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
I want to get to yours first.

1989
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,880
Okay.

1990
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:55,880
Well, my day...

1991
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:56,880
How do you maximize topics?

1992
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:57,880
No.

1993
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:58,880
Max.

1994
01:19:58,880 --> 01:19:59,880
Sorry.

1995
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,880
All right.

1996
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,880
Okay.

1997
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,880
So my day starts mostly the same.

1998
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,120
I go in, clock in, put on my apron and then...

1999
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,120
Slot of the cows.

2000
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:08,080
Slot of the cows, yeah.

2001
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,760
And then we enter this thing called peak period where I have to stay completely still in my

2002
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,520
cashier position for the next hour and I cannot move.

2003
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,880
Not even to type stuff into the machine?

2004
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,880
No, no, no, no.

2005
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,880
I stay in front of the machine.

2006
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:21,880
Statuesque.

2007
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,880
Statuesque.

2008
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:23,880
To scare away the...

2009
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Welcome to Chipotle.

2010
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,880
This is our living art, Max.

2011
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,520
We get a lot of crows in this Chipotle.

2012
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,520
We have Max here to scare them off.

2013
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:31,520
This is our scare, Max.

2014
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:32,520
You just...

2015
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,520
Okay.

2016
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:41,240
So whenever I get exact change in complete bills, no coins, I don't just rip a big fat

2017
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,160
wet one, but several in a row.

2018
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,160
Wait.

2019
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,880
This has happened four times and there is no explanation for it.

2020
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,840
Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max, Max,

2021
01:20:51,840 --> 01:21:01,520
Max, Max, are you telling me when you get exact change, you fart four times in a row?

2022
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:02,520
Yes.

2023
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:03,600
I shit you not.

2024
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,600
Max.

2025
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,140
Oh, let's, let's hope so.

2026
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,140
Sit down.

2027
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Sit down, Max.

2028
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:09,140
You sit down, Max.

2029
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,140
Sit down, Max.

2030
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,140
You're done.

2031
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,140
You've been bad.

2032
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:13,140
Max, you are like the solar eclipse.

2033
01:21:13,140 --> 01:21:15,800
I cannot look directly at you, Max.

2034
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,200
How could you do this to us on our special day, Max?

2035
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,200
We brought you in.

2036
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Also, I'm proud of you.

2037
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:26,180
I'm also proud of your control.

2038
01:21:26,180 --> 01:21:29,680
You're like Le Petit Mane with your ability to control your flatulence.

2039
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,680
I'm very impressed.

2040
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:31,680
Who?

2041
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,680
Le Petit Mane, the fartest.

2042
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:39,080
You can listen to last year's Max Fun Drive bonus of Schmanners to hear all about the

2043
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:40,080
fartest.

2044
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,080
Max.

2045
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,080
Max.

2046
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,080
Max.

2047
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:44,080
You're not.

2048
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,080
No.

2049
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:46,080
You're not good, Max.

2050
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,080
Because.

2051
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,080
You're not good.

2052
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:50,840
Max, I have terrible news.

2053
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,840
You have been hypnotized.

2054
01:21:53,840 --> 01:22:01,200
No, not like this, baby.

2055
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,200
Not like this.

2056
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,200
No.

2057
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:10,040
Max, does this literal stage setup look familiar to you?

2058
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,440
Maybe you were lying on a couch like this and a person said, exact change is pretty

2059
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,440
cool, huh?

2060
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:18,800
You're going to fart a quartet of times.

2061
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,360
That's the weirdest version of the Cold Stone Creamery Tip song I've ever heard.

2062
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:28,520
All right, we promised we were going to do a bunch of these.

2063
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,080
Let's do left section this time.

2064
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,960
No, let's do balcony.

2065
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:32,960
Let's do balcony.

2066
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:33,960
Let's do very back.

2067
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:34,960
Very back balcony.

2068
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:35,960
Wait, wait, wait.

2069
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:36,960
White t-shirt.

2070
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:37,960
White t-shirt right here.

2071
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:38,960
Jumping up.

2072
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:39,960
Yes, yes, yes.

2073
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,960
Okay.

2074
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,960
Yes.

2075
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:42,960
I can see.

2076
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:43,960
We can see up there super good, but.

2077
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:44,960
Hi.

2078
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,960
Hi.

2079
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:46,960
Can we lower our arches for a second just so we can see?

2080
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:47,960
Yes.

2081
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:48,960
Yes.

2082
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,960
Thank you.

2083
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:50,960
Okay.

2084
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:51,960
Yeah.

2085
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:52,960
It says Munch Squad.

2086
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:53,960
Nice.

2087
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,960
Oh, cool.

2088
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:55,960
I had one of that.

2089
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:56,960
You know, I almost wore it and I thought that's a bit much.

2090
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:00,880
It said you wore your Hakuna Matata t-shirt.

2091
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:01,880
And you know what?

2092
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,880
It looks great.

2093
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,880
It looks really good.

2094
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:04,880
What's your name?

2095
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:05,880
It's actually Swahili.

2096
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:06,880
My name is Aiden.

2097
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,880
Aiden, hi.

2098
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:08,880
Hi.

2099
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,880
Hello.

2100
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:16,960
So for the last 12 years or so, I thought, hey, I'm going to be a doctor.

2101
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,280
And so I knew that's what I was going to do for With My Life.

2102
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,280
I promise this isn't a bummer.

2103
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,280
It's not a bummer.

2104
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,280
Oh, fuck.

2105
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,280
You know how close you're on though.

2106
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,280
You're on that razor wire.

2107
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,280
It's not.

2108
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,280
I don't need to ask if I'm good because I'm very good.

2109
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
Good.

2110
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,280
Oh.

2111
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,280
That's all I care about.

2112
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:32,280
Damn.

2113
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,280
So I had this life plan.

2114
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:34,280
I was going to be a doctor.

2115
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:42,360
And about, so I've gone to school for that and well, not the med school part, but planned

2116
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,360
for this.

2117
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,360
Okay.

2118
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,360
Anyway.

2119
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,360
Yeah.

2120
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:47,880
And I was like, you know what?

2121
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,840
This isn't for me.

2122
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,480
And so I gave up on that sort of whole life plan.

2123
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,480
It's great.

2124
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:55,480
No, it's great.

2125
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:56,480
It's not a bummer.

2126
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:57,760
This is the best decision I've ever made.

2127
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:03,120
But my question is, I haven't really told anybody about this.

2128
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:05,120
Okay.

2129
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:12,040
How do I break this news to my friends and my family?

2130
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,040
Let me help.

2131
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,040
Here's the good news.

2132
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:15,040
Yeah.

2133
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:20,680
If someone's going to be in a medical emergency and they're going to look at you expectantly

2134
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:25,720
and you're going to have to look back at them and say, actually, you got to wait for someone

2135
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:26,720
to shout.

2136
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:27,720
Is there a doctor in the house?

2137
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:28,720
And you go, no.

2138
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:29,720
No.

2139
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:30,720
And I'm glad you asked, actually.

2140
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,120
It's a funny story, actually.

2141
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,400
So how do I tell people about this in the best way possible?

2142
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,400
You're going to have to get a Ph.D. in something.

2143
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,980
That's the plan.

2144
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:43,980
That's the new plan.

2145
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:44,980
Oh, really?

2146
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:45,980
That's the new plan.

2147
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:46,980
Yeah.

2148
01:24:46,980 --> 01:24:47,980
What about honorary?

2149
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:48,980
You can get an honorary Ph.D.

2150
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:49,980
Billy Joel has one.

2151
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:53,600
Billy Joel has one, for fuck's sake.

2152
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:59,560
If you get fucking shot, Billy Joel can get that bullet out of you because of his honorary

2153
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,560
doctorate.

2154
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:01,560
In letters.

2155
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,760
And also, he's seen some shit.

2156
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:07,760
And when he was in Saigon writing that song.

2157
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,640
Scenes from an Italian restaurant is a song about a lot of shootings that happen in Italian

2158
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:12,640
restaurants.

2159
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,240
I don't think so.

2160
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,320
A near would be my advice.

2161
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,120
And I don't know if this is good advice because I've been hitting the Hennessy, okay?

2162
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:27,760
But I think you should probably, I would say, before you talk to anybody about it, I would

2163
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,560
probably formulate a plan as to what you want to do.

2164
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:32,560
Like figure that out for yourself.

2165
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,560
It sounds like you've got it.

2166
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:34,560
Yeah, you're good.

2167
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:35,560
What?

2168
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,560
It's a plan.

2169
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,560
It's just telling people, hey, surprise.

2170
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,600
Okay, as long as you have another plan, I think that that's what you lead with.

2171
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:46,120
Not like I'm not going to be a doctor, but I am going to be, I don't know, you didn't

2172
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:48,120
tell us that, but like whatever that is.

2173
01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:49,120
A magician.

2174
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,120
A magician.

2175
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,120
Yeah, a juggler.

2176
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,120
A juggler.

2177
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,120
No, no, no.

2178
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:54,120
Watch it.

2179
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,120
Come on.

2180
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,160
Someone escort this person out.

2181
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:58,560
Oh, I know.

2182
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,840
The next time you're talking to someone about it, begin explaining the multiverse theory.

2183
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:14,880
And say that in one universe, I am a doctor, and then leave.

2184
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:16,520
I am on the edge of my seat.

2185
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:17,520
You really are.

2186
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,520
I can't wait to see.

2187
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:24,280
I don't have that many people in my, this might sound cruel, I don't have that many

2188
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:33,120
people in my life where if they're like, I've changed careers, I'd be like, oh, man.

2189
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,800
I'm kind of busy just being me.

2190
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:38,840
You haven't stayed close with your high school guidance counselor?

2191
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,680
I guess not.

2192
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:43,680
So I think you're good.

2193
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:44,680
I think you're just good.

2194
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,680
Just do it.

2195
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:46,680
Yeah.

2196
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:47,680
I guess if nothing else, I've just announced it on a podcast.

2197
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,680
Yeah, there it is.

2198
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:49,680
Thank you.

2199
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,680
Did we help at all?

2200
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:51,680
Thank you.

2201
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:52,680
Did that help?

2202
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,680
Yeah, that's great.

2203
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,680
Okay, cool.

2204
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,680
All right.

2205
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,680
I'm going to do left side this time.

2206
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:01,840
I'm seeing, by the way, I'm seeing a lot of people go in the bathroom and kind of say

2207
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,160
that must be nice because I would love to go to the bathroom.

2208
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,120
I see a pink shirt about Midway.

2209
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:08,120
Yes, yes, yes.

2210
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,120
No, no.

2211
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:10,120
Pink shirt.

2212
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
No.

2213
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,120
No.

2214
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:13,120
Sir, no.

2215
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,120
Sir.

2216
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,120
Sir.

2217
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:16,120
Sir.

2218
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,120
That is a salmon colored tee with gray arms.

2219
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,360
It's not even close.

2220
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,320
But I did like how you just went for it and body checked this person.

2221
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,680
I guess it's salmon.

2222
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,160
Listen, your next salmon shirt.

2223
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,160
Don't let us forget.

2224
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,160
Okay.

2225
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:29,160
Hi.

2226
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,160
I'm Courtney from Vancouver.

2227
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,160
Hi, Courtney.

2228
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,160
Oh, hey.

2229
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:36,360
Courtney from Vancouver, if you don't know, am I right, Courtney?

2230
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,360
Yes.

2231
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:42,240
Courtney from Vancouver is the person who sent the letter that inspired the fourth episode

2232
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:47,800
of My Brother, My Brother and Me, the CISO television show about teens.

2233
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,800
Oh.

2234
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:58,480
Since you have journeyed to our great land, have you been able to indulge in the episode?

2235
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,480
Yes.

2236
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,600
Yes, my mom put it on and she was really confused.

2237
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,040
She lives in Mount Vernon, Washington.

2238
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,040
Okay.

2239
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,040
I was about to put your mom in prison.

2240
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:11,040
No, no, no.

2241
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,040
She's American.

2242
01:28:12,040 --> 01:28:17,280
I want to thank you for your advice because I'm actually now a really popular teacher.

2243
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Excellent.

2244
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,280
You just dabbed a lot.

2245
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:20,280
Yeah.

2246
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,280
Hey, everybody.

2247
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,280
Actually, one more time, just because I don't think everybody had their phones out.

2248
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,280
Wait, hold on.

2249
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,280
Hold on.

2250
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,360
If you get the phones out in case you want to tweet that Courtney from Vancouver-

2251
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,000
Actually, if everybody in the audience could actually... If we could get the hell signs

2252
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,180
up and everybody could just dab.

2253
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,320
I want to get Justin and Griffin doing it too.

2254
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,180
And by the way, I don't want to be- This looks fucking ghoulish.

2255
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,200
I hate this.

2256
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:46,200
You look like a fucking H.R.

2257
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,760
Giger painting and I hate it.

2258
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:48,760
All right.

2259
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,700
Put the ocean of arms down.

2260
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:57,880
My students asked me to organize prom but I don't know how to do that.

2261
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,580
Lots of free condoms next question

2262
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,520
No, same question

2263
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:09,360
Continuation of the question we have not gotten it yet. I just need some advice of how to make a really cool

2264
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:14,520
Prom, but super like safe because I don't want to get fired post-apocalypse

2265
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:21,720
Mad Max he's a very hot right now two years ago first love and wasteland

2266
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:28,400
It's an apocalypse thing. We're fucking like we're gonna sit here. We're gonna come up with some bad ideas for teens

2267
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:31,000
Like we're gonna set up here and be like how cool to be live

2268
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,680
master chief theme

2269
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:40,860
When really all I wanted was just a very dark big room

2270
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:49,160
Dark enough that people couldn't see whether I danced bad or didn't dance which were my two options

2271
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,760
I

2272
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:57,020
Neither of which are good in the light times. I I have a theme how about this Courtney?

2273
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:59,640
It's called what the school name

2274
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:05,440
Royal Canadian College Royal Canadian College 2017 prom. No one is allowed to dance

2275
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:08,480
Now what hear me out?

2276
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:11,920
There will be a group of students who are like, oh, thank fuck. Oh

2277
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:17,560
Thank God, I don't have to dance and even if I wanted to there's I can't so there's no pressure

2278
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:21,960
Hey, and there's gonna be one bad boy. Who's like, oh, really?

2279
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:28,480
And then he's gonna have the time of his life people who join in with him are going to be loving it and the kids

2280
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:32,980
Who don't want to dance will have a perfect excuse not to it's against the rules and then the kids who are like

2281
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:35,480
Let's just say it cool

2282
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,120
We'll go ahead and dance anyway, despite your rules and then the preacher that runs the town is gonna get rid

2283
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:47,040
It's hot dog I really like what doesn't is done what you see is made footloose origins

Okay, Andy, what's up?

2299
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,640
All right, so my girlfriend lives in apartment complex, okay

2300
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:33,720
Okay, and normally apartment complexes covered parking reserved not covered parking or buddy can have some

2301
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:39,980
Sure her complex just decided we're just gonna mark up a bunch of the spots

2302
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:43,500
So like 75% of the place is like no you can't park

2303
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:45,860
so I

2304
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:48,140
Got a little drunk one night

2305
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:56,100
Had some of the drinks nice some of the part some of the parking needed to happen and wait, hold on wait, so

2306
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,440
No, no, no, no, no

2307
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:07,480
Some parking needed to happen from who by who did it? She was parking the car. Okay. Okay

2308
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:12,640
You were I was inebriated and I saw the office decided to put some cones out to reserve

2309
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:20,080
Themselves a spot. Okay when every other spot was taken. Uh-huh in my drunken state. Would you do Mad Max?

2310
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:29,200
A little bit a little bit. I I decided to throw those cones on the roof of the office. Fuck. Yes

2311
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:33,600
If your question is how rad am I the answer is very

2312
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:43,380
So I the cones are still up there and this is like this happened on inauguration night

2313
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:49,280
I was ready to fight. Yeah

2314
01:33:58,120 --> 01:34:00,120
So the cones are still up there

2315
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:09,440
So should I the cones or something should I tell the office that they're up

2316
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,440
No

2317
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:16,720
Should I cut my losses and move out? No, wait, hold on

2318
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,040
Andy at this point

2319
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:30,160
We're two months out. Yeah, what fucking CSI are you afraid they're gonna do now?

2320
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:35,400
Hey, hey, you know where those cones go

2321
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,860
Oh, they're on the roof. Let's fingerprint them

2322
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,720
What are you fucking?

2323
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:48,080
Reconstruct the security camera that just catches me like that. They're just now checking Andy

2324
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:55,400
You think they just have saved two months. They're gonna start their slow on everything else

2325
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:02,360
How much do you think they care about cones that two months have passed that they haven't bothered to get them down

2326
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:08,360
But full-on investigations gonna happen when they do as soon as they find that ladder they misplaced

2327
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,920
But they do care enough to find the responsible party and put them to justice

2328
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,480
alternate theory alternate theory the roof is

2329
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:24,320
Very dangerous and they were planning on putting some cones up there anyway

2330
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:31,960
The groundskeeper comes out one morning. It's like oh time to get them what a

2331
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:37,040
Fucking cobblers assistant elf has come and done my job for me

2332
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:43,000
It does raise the question of like if I'm an administrator at that university. I do have to ask like hey

2333
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:46,120
Who do we call about cones on roofs?

2334
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:51,160
Hey a fire department, I think not you

2335
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,680
Hi, can I tell you I'll tell you exactly how that scene I go

2336
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,200
Hi, it's fine. It's time. I finally came clean. I see your cones on the roof

2337
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,840
Okay

2338
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:04,480
That's all by fine

2339
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,680
There's like 300 people who live here, and I don't know who you are

2340
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,880
Yeah, they're like well that wasn't cool. You did it was inauguration day, and I'd like ah dude

2341
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,880
We all threw some cones on

2342
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:15,880
Oh

2343
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,920
One more about one more balcony

2344
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:27,160
Person standing up well. There's like four. Yes. There's a person standing up very high. Yes

2345
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,720
This person is moving yes

2346
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:32,920
Be careful though

2347
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,240
Yes, here we go hi, what's your name?

2348
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:39,280

2349
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:43,920
Fine who me yes me you yes, hi. Hey, so you're next

2350
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,800
Hi, my name is Alex

2351
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:48,840
Hi

2352
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:53,440
So I have a really androgynous voice, okay, okay?

2353
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,520
The other day when I was on the phone with a cable salesman

2354
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:05,120
They were asking about the sports package that I bought and then they were like does your husband also listen to sports

2355
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:07,120
And

2356
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,760
I told them that I was single

2357
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:14,680
Nice

2358
01:37:16,300 --> 01:37:21,280
Nice am I good yeah, I think you're pretty fucking good

2359
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:29,600
I actually want to call you out on this for a second

2360
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:36,520
I don't think you want to ask a question so much as you just wanted to brag about an awesome. It was a good conversation

2361
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,280
Yeah, the only the only

2362
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,200
Better thing you could have told him is no. I don't like sports

2363
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:53,880
Yeah, I also think if if you're asking what could I have done to have a better interaction with my cable provider

2364
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:59,200
Yeah, you tell us. I think you fucking crush it honestly

2365
01:37:59,200 --> 01:38:06,040
I have had this conversation with my internet cable provider like my internet isn't working. Yeah. Yeah, no we're bad at this

2366
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:12,720
What are you gonna do we're bad for a bad company make a bad product

2367
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:22,520
I normally ask if we helped but like you're good you helped us. Yeah, you crushed it Alex everybody KT. All right

2368
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,840
Yeah, Casey Casey Casey come down this microphone case you ran to the back of the auditorium

2369
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,200
How could you do this to me? I have to be so bad. Come on. Casey's next. I'm raising your hands

2370
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:41,160
I understand I get embarrassed really easy. So I had to go

2371
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:48,360
Really quick I have to perform in front of people and I also have a tiny little bladder

2372
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:53,860
So I thought you guys would be perfect for answering this question really quick. Here's a here's a weird catch-22 though the

2373
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:56,520
The and take your time. I'm not rushing you

2374
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:01,360
But the longer this question goes the longer we have before we can end the show and I can go empty my now

2375
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:05,360
wild

2376
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,240
It's a professional question

2377
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:25,840
So I have to kind of perform my craft in front of a lot of different tourists and stuff like that

2378
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:33,440
And I have to share the public bathrooms with all the customers that come in and I have on two occasions like

2379
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:37,880
Walked in and had the bathroom doors wide open while someone was using the restroom

2380
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:42,300
I survived this because I thought of the legend of corn cob boys. So thank you. Oh, yes

2381
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:49,920
Well, I often find strength in corn cob boy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's great. Thank you guys. You've saved my life multiple times

2382
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:57,240
So how do I deal with the extreme like anxiety? I already have in addition to going out and like performing in front of people

2383
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:02,640
That I may have potential so I understand your question is you have walked into people using the restroom

2384
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:06,480
Yeah, and I like I'm cool about it where I'll like shut the door for him and stuff like that

2385
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:12,040
But I have to go back out and like face them and be like have to do my job and like then you say no

2386
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:14,040
I've seen you

2387
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,040
Do my thing

2388
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:25,400
You should be less uncomfortable now, okay, you picture them in their underpants let me suggest one step further

2389
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:30,080
All right didn't work so great for me last time, but thank you

2390
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:38,080
There is literally nothing you can do if you walk in on someone in the bathroom leave, okay

2391
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:44,440
Just quit the look the look the look you give them and they give you has to communicate this isn't happening

2392
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,320
It's the closest you can get this is nothing. This is nothing

2393
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:47,560
Yeah

2394
01:40:47,560 --> 01:40:53,580
There was like an additional element of like schadenfreude because the person that I caught like, you know with the pants down totally

2395
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,720
Didn't notice and I like saved their life by shutting the door for him

2396
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:02,560
The door closed. Yeah, I was like they maybe they had a plan and I can't

2397
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,560
Yeah, Casey. I feel like you're intentionally not telling us what you do, but I bet it's really cool

2398
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:12,880
I roast I roast coffee for a living pretty okay. Here's the thing. Here's what I love about this

2399
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:16,120
Yeah, this person got caught in the bathroom and then was like

2400
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:19,640
Yes, please one coffee

2401
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:27,960
They could have left you work there. Yeah, they know the deal they could just go so if they don't you're good

2402
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:32,560
If they're like, I know what happened, but I do with my Vinci latte, please

2403
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:38,320
They're trading that off. I walked in. I walked in on my barber in the bathroom before my haircut once

2404
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:50,860
Not exactly like that in that like I know now our interactions up to that point during my

2405
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:54,400
30 monthly minutes that I shared with this person

2406
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,120
weren't like

2407
01:41:56,120 --> 01:42:01,080
Smooth sailing to begin with as much of a sort of like grasping for conversational straws swinging from

2408
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:04,120
Conversational vine to vine and being like, oh no, this one's rotten

2409
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:11,640
And now in addition to that fucking pitfall style there's crocodiles down in that river

2410
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,800
And those crocodiles

2411
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,280
Look like pee, I guess. I don't know the metaphor kind of fell apart. Yeah

2412
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:25,400
Does that help? I guess just letting you know it can be so much worse. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it

2413
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:31,840
I wanted maybe to share my okay that person in the back that I accidentally called on. Yes. Yes. You did the right

2414
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,880
Two hands in the air and you're jumping and you're running down and okay

2415
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,280
I think this may be the last one though because I might die

2416
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:45,560
Yeah, this is the last one. What's up? Hi, so I have a co-worker. What's your at Liz?

2417
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:54,560
Hi, I have a good I have a co-worker who is a serious know-it-all and really likes to correct people even when he's wrong

2418
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,460
So it's a then it's just a man

2419
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,000
And the man she questions does he have an active Twitter account

2420
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:16,640
Oh, wait a minute, I'm a man sorry Liz

2421
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,460
What so this reached kind of a zenith when I

2422
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:31,240
Prefaced a joke that I was telling to someone else with this is a really dumb joke

2423
01:43:31,240 --> 01:43:33,800
that doesn't make any sense and then I told the joke and

2424
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,680
About five minutes went by and then he goes that joke doesn't make any sense. And here's why

2425
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,160
So my question is where do you hide the body

2426
01:43:56,300 --> 01:44:00,500
My question is other than just trolling him by refusing to correct anything

2427
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:07,540
Uh, how how do I do that's not gonna get the job done. That's just gonna make him think like I'm King knowledge. I

2428
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:12,100
Would Liz I would start trying to get as much shit wrong as possible

2429
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:19,220
I would I would with as many as you can and let me actually tag on to that do that and then fill an empty

2430
01:44:19,220 --> 01:44:34,900
Soda can with pennies and tape over the top and when he says like well actually just because eventually

2431
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:37,940
You won't have to shake it. You'll just have to hold it and you'll go

2432
01:44:40,580 --> 01:44:43,260
Liz have you ever read the cast of a Montalada?

2433
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:56,540
I'm a winemaker. So that's actually really

2434
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:06,420
