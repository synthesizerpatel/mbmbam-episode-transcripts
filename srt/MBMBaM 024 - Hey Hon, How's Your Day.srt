1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds are gone

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On Tosh.0, that's right, it's your favorite Hollywood celebrities, my brother, my brother, and me.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You may know us from Comedy Central's hit, Tosh.0, where we were.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Would you say featured?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I would say we cameoed. I got a call.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I would say spotlighted, at least.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I got a call on my mobile from my boy Tosh.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, just didn't happen.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's what I call him. My boy Tosh.0 called up, he was like, hey, listen, I was just in the editing bay,

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
somebody was wearing one of your shirts on one of my funny segments on my funny internet show,

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and I just wanted to get your permission to put it on the air.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And I said, Tosh, you and I go way back, I'll allow it.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So, Tosh, if you're listening, I hope I didn't just cramp your style.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No. Now, we actually do a big thanks to Gregory Posey,

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
who had the forethought to, before he ate a disgusting 100% cacao bar,

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
to put on his My Brother, My Brother, and Me t-shirts.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, he is leading in terms of My Brother, My Brother, and Me fandom, I think it's fair to say.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You should follow him on Twitter, he is Mr. Dr. Muffin, which is also a very good name.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
First stomp, Tosh.0, next stomp, Law and Order.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'd like to get on Tosh.1.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you're going to commit a terrible crime that is going to result in notoriety,

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
just strap on him a Bim Bam t-shirt underneath your Kevlar vest.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, don't actually wear the Kevlar vest, because you'll distract from the branding.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But just, you know, if you're going to do something big... There's nothing I want to see more than a guy

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
charging and screaming about something, and law enforcement tries to bring him down,

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
and the bullets rip through his My Brother, My Brother, and Me t-shirt, but hit Kevlar,

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
and he's like, rawr, you can't bring me down!

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And it gives the false impression that our shirts are bulletproof.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
When asked, the suspect replied, I guess it's time to pack my bags and move away.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Back to you, Jim.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't actually do any of the things we just said.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't do any of the things we said, but that's a pretty common rule here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's an advice show for the modern era.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We don't suggest you do anything we tell you to.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Even if our advice is good, occasionally we have to legally sort of cover ourselves that way.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I feel like we've danced around this enough.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think it's time to get a spoon and really dig into the advice portion of the show.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So, let's hear from AtSholi17.

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
She's on the Twitter service.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She says, Hi guys.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hi, Sholi.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm a 22-year-old gal and I need a clever original costume to wear to my friend's Halloween party.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Any suggestions?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If I had one, I would probably use it myself.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I probably wouldn't give it out.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm so terrible at coming up with Halloween costumes.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The best thing is always, I think, to do a group of people doing something.

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, then you've got solidarity.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What about a sexy dragon?

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know why a sexy dragon, but sexy things are pretty popular with girls.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everybody likes a dragon, right?

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sexy werewolf?

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
See, that's the thing.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She needs it to be clever and original.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think the dragon portion of that is okay.

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What about a frumpy dragon?

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What about a confident, unattractive dragon?

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
How about a sexy, frumpy person?

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah, like your hair is disheveled in a sexy way and you're wearing a stupid plaid dress, but it's too short.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was like, whoa.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're frumpy, but also very attractive.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't think we can help you on this because I think that your Halloween costume is a true sign of creativity.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Creativity comes from inside.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
For instance, my favorite Halloween costume is one that Travis told me about.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It was at a party, I believe, in Oklahoma where someone came to the Halloween party wearing just a pair of jeans.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When asked what he was, he said premature ejaculation because he just came in his pants.

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That is the best Halloween costume ever because it's a joke, it's clever, and it transforms you.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's transformative.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The best thing we can do, Shirley, is tell you what to avoid.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Here's a costume I can't stand.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A production costume where you get there and everybody's like, oh my God, what an elaborate costume.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Within minutes, you are sweating and you just...

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Chunks are falling off.

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Chunks of it are falling off because she paper mache-ed it to your body.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Half hour in, you just look like a nightmare.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All the sexy dragons and sexy frumpy people are scooping up all the dudes.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think what you should do is you should go as a group, find a group of people, and do sexy Supreme Court justices.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's good.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's a good one.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So do mine.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am more.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She plays softball, you know.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What do you guys think is going to be the hot one this year?

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Two years ago, it was the Joker.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Everyone was the Joker, right?

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Last year, it was Balloon Boy, right?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Everybody was Balloon Boy.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I miss that trend.

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I got to get Balloon Boy.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I was creeped out by sexy Balloon Boy, though.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The best costume is the one that would have been culturally relevant three years ago.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let me hit you with one.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Judge Lance Ito.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No, stay with me.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What major cultural events happened this year that are going to be Halloween-ified?

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think we're smart enough to figure this out.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because I think this isn't just shooting the shit anymore.

107
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This could be a practical business venture.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You can keep track of what is happening.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You will wear a Jersey Shore costume.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's probably what it will be, right?

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It will be Jersey Shore.

112
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, Lady Gaga.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Lady Gaga.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But Lady Gaga, how do you do that?

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She is a costume.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You put some hula hoops around your waist.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hula hoops made out of meat and human hair.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Might I suggest going as three sexy podcast hosting brothers?

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Do my bim bam, but just use two mannequin heads.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's what I want.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's basically the setup we have going on right now.

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That is basically, yeah.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I am a puppet.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I am Travis's puppet, and Griffin is my puppet that I am Travis.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's very confusing.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I am currently in a situation I do not know how to handle.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am falling for a married woman.

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, sorry.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, the sinner is me, and I've embraced that already, but all signs point to her having

130
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
feelings for me too.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She's mentioned how our marriage has been on the rocks several times because of him.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What should I do?

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's lag from Gmail.

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, that's a simple question.

135
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't do an effing thing.

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Not a thing.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here's a good way to deal with this situation.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You got to get out of it.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You got to run far, run fast because I guarantee you.

140
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I guarantee you.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That is the worst way to begin a relationship, the number one worst way, and lag.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know how to say this, but Dr. Phil says that if she will cheat on him to be with

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
you, she will cheat on you to be with the cute pizza guy.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's just science.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a test, and I call it the how did you meet mommy test, which is one day if you have

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
kids, they'll look up at you and say, how did you meet mommy?

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And your answer is, well, she was married to this other guy, and I totally made them

148
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
divorce.

149
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's time for you to learn about it.

150
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's time for you to learn about adultery.

151
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah.

152
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mommy wanted a taste of, you know how when you eat Froot Loops every morning, some mornings

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you wake up, and you want some Captain Crunch.

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Daddy was Captain Crunch for mommy, and I crunchetized her so hard.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She put my figurative Crunch Berries in her mouth, and she bit down.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And then it turned into Oops All Berries.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah, and then you were born.

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Nine months later, you were born.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Nine months later.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was a miracle, really, a miracle.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's why we named you Rasp.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So what you need to do is do nothing, I said.

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah, like don't do it.

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't do it.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That fucking sucks, man.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It sucks, lag.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That sucks, dude.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's a sucky thing to do.

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's just sucky, right?

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's the worst thing you can do.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Something you can actualize.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The world is trying to whittle me down, but I'm still a pretty romantic guy, but I don't

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
think there's any situation where I can be like, oh man, I'm so crazy for that person.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm gonna break up their marriage.

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That goes against God's law.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Goes against state law, depending on what state you live in.

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sure there are some states where adultery is illegal, right?

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Like Utah.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Ah, see, I knew you were gonna go there.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So you want him to be a brother-husband.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh no, brother-husband.

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,080
Lag, you're better than that.

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
You're not a brother-husband.

188
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,740
Lag, let me give you a two, here's the thing.

189
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,200
A lot of people won't tell you about jerking off.

190
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,440
Jerking off is good, and it's healthy, it's natural, it's beautiful, it's human, right?

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Of course.

192
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,720
But it also can, for the span of 15 to 20 minutes afterwards, give you superpowers.

193
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
What do you mean, Justin?

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,880
Well, first off, you can be supernaturally caring to your special someone.

195
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,200
For 15 to 20 minutes, all you care about is them.

196
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
You do not, you can be free of your sexual urges.

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,600
It can also help you to weather the storms of temptation.

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
Here's what you do, Lag.

199
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,040
You jerk it, pick up a phone, tell her you're done.

200
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
That's it.

201
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,080
Tell her it can't happen, because Lag, that is the only time you will have the strength

202
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,240
to do it, because if you can't do it then, then you are not in lust.

203
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,600
You have genuine feelings for her.

204
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,780
What you need to do is try to do that, and then you can tell it's not your wiener making

205
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,720
the decisions for you.

206
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
You need to master your bastion.

207
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
What?

208
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
And overcome it.

209
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
What?

210
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Yes.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
Did, did, did Michael Jackson die, did Michael Jackson die this year?

212
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Or was that last year?

213
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
Last year.

214
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Son of a bitch.

215
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,400
I'm still thinking of Halloween costumes, and I thought that dead Michael Jackson might

216
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
be one, but.

217
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,040
Ditto, you got a, you got a yahoo answer for us?

218
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I sure do.

219
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
This one was sent in to us by Bug42.

220
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,280
I wanted to actually save it for later in the show, but it's, it's like a beautiful

221
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,440
present that, and I know it's inside of it already, and I want to share it with the world,

222
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,760
so it's not like a present at all.

223
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,880
But it was sent in by Bug42, thank you Bug42.

224
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,540
It's a question by Kevin K. O. Arsenalista.

225
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,720
That's his moniker on the internet.

226
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:05,240
He asks, can your baby get pregnant if you have sex while pregnant?

227
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:16,240
Like, the baby is a girl, and you have sex, and the sperm goos to her while in the womb.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm imagining like a Russian doll situation, like, the answer is obviously yes.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,040
Like when you cut open a shark, and there's a baby in the shark, and then there's a shark

230
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,040
baby inside.

231
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,480
Person inside of person inside of person inside of person, uh, ad infinitum.

232
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
That's when it gets tricky.

233
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,520
It's the fifth baby in there that gets a problem, like, you know, you get your, your significant

234
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,560
other pregnant, and then you get that baby pregnant, and then you get that baby pregnant,

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,640
then you get that baby pregnant, but then you're getting down to that tiny little baby

236
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
in the middle.

237
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,960
You go to your wife and you say, why does my baby's baby baby look nothing like me?

238
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,960
And she's like, hold on, I have to get a chart out, because I cannot honestly answer you.

239
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,240
There is, there are too many layers of abstraction here.

240
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,440
Can we also address, like, his, his concept is, of course, delightful.

241
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,080
Can we address his use of goos as a verb?

242
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,240
I think he misspelled goes, but I mean, I guess it works either way.

243
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Yeah, it does.

244
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Right?

245
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,960
Like in this specific case, it just goes into the baby.

246
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,880
Well, when it gets, when it gets tricky is, yeah, if it's a girl baby, she gets pregnant.

247
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,200
But if it's a guy baby, once you break that chain, once you break that chain, you can't,

248
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,600
you can't make any more humans.

249
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,240
What you what you should do, what you do is try and time out all the pregnancy so that

250
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,600
the due dates fall within like the same time so that you could get like a, like a chain

251
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:52,000
of of births like a like a charm bracelet thing going on like a charm bracelet of human

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
beings.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I am.

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,720
I don't think that babies can get pregnant to answer your question.

255
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,920
No, you have to be at least seven.

256
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,400
That's when I think that's when you become fertile.

257
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,760
This is from Terry.

258
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,880
Terry asks, I have an OK job at the moment, but a job I have wanted for a long time has

259
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
come up.

260
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,680
And in order to apply for this new job, I may need to get myself in some serious trouble

261
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,160
at my current job.

262
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,680
Do you think it's worth risking?

263
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,720
Terry, do you mean that like you're going to have to get into some shenanigans or like

264
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,400
in order to get fired, you've got to get such monkey shines that you can get removed from

265
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
this current job?

266
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Like, what's the.

267
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,760
Well, I've got a really good, but the only way to get in is to break into my current

268
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,760
job.

269
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Right.

270
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I've got this great goof.

271
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
You guys want to hear my goof?

272
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Yeah.

273
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Let me hear the goof.

274
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,840
Here's what you do while you're at work, while you're working, you're at your desk, right?

275
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,440
And you're, you know, doing whatever it is that you do, OK?

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,920
You stand up, OK, and you go in your boss's office and you say, I don't want to work here

277
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
anymore.

278
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Wait a minute.

279
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I love it.

280
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Wait a minute.

281
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Wait a minute.

282
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,920
Wait a minute.

283
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,320
I think what he said, he doesn't have a guarantee.

284
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,120
So like, I think then why does he want to get in trouble at his job if he doesn't have

285
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
a guarantee?

286
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,240
How bad are you at secrets that your job needs, your job one needs to find out that you're

287
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,480
applying for job two?

288
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,240
Like, are you just so terrified that you're going to pay boss?

289
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,400
I need to leave early today.

290
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
I'm dying.

291
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,680
I mean, I, my grandfather is applying for it.

292
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,680
Damn it.

293
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,280
I got hit by a baby.

294
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:44,000
OK, I've reread the question now, and I think what's going on is that the company he wants

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,280
to work at is a competitor to the company he's currently working at.

296
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,840
So they want him to, like, steal company secrets.

297
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,400
Oh shit, espionage.

298
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,040
I think there's some corporate espionage going on.

299
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I've been waiting for-

300
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
We don't want none of that shit.

301
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,600
24 episodes to get an espionage question.

302
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,200
And just to tell you that we're having enough of it.

303
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,480
We will, we will allow babies to get pregnant by other babies' intercourse before we allow

304
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
espionage to be discussed on this program.

305
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,200
If there's one thing that really drives me off the wall, it's spies.

306
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,280
Spies?

307
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
We did have-

308
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,280
Ooh, spies.

309
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,400
We had a question about marital espionage earlier.

310
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Does that count?

311
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
Is that, is that-

312
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
No.

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Yes.

314
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah.

315
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
That totally works.

316
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Yeah.

317
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Subterfuge, I'm OK with.

318
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
It's corporate espionage.

319
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,660
Haven't corporations been through enough?

320
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,360
Look at the economy.

321
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,400
Haven't these corporate, these poor businesses been through enough that you're going to subject

322
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,360
them to espionage, Terry?

323
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,780
A2, Terry?

324
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,560
After all the paychecks they've given you?

325
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,120
After that nice cake that Carla from Accounting got you for your birthday?

326
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Gross, Terry.

327
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Gross.

328
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
Robocop.

329
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Robocop?

330
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,680
I know there hasn't been a Robocop movie in a long, long time, but I think the Robocop

331
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,240
students have a comeback where you just show up dressed as Robocop and people will be like,

332
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,080
oh shit, I've never seen anybody in a Robocop outfit.

333
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Form Spring Axe.

334
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:13,000
Dear Mabim Bam, what do you think is the best way to ease relationship insecurities?

335
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,760
I'm in a long-term relationship and give it my all, but I feel like I'm not good enough

336
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,640
for my successful boyfriend and I don't want to bother him with my petty issues.

337
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Ooh.

338
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
This is an intruder.

339
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,920
So you're dealing with your own insecurities, not his.

340
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Right.

341
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,000
She is insecure in the relationship because she thinks the boyfriend is too good for her.

342
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,680
You can't let that kind of thing seep into your head.

343
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,160
You gotta, you gotta overcome that because that is sort of a self-defeating, self-defeating

344
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
thing.

345
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,160
And I guess that's what you're trying to do and you're turning to us for it.

346
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,800
Let me, let me give you some, an upside here.

347
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,460
And while it might not seem like it, I think you're in a win-win situation where I think

348
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,600
a good way to get over it is to express these insecurities with your boyfriend and say,

349
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880
I want to talk about these.

350
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,600
I know these are issues.

351
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,200
And if he doesn't want to listen, hey, your insecurities are totally justified.

352
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,400
And then you get to deal with that.

353
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,200
You realize like halfway through your answer that it wasn't an answer really.

354
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
Right.

355
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,840
I realized like, oh, this isn't as positive as I thought it was going to be.

356
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,080
Just, you know, find something on the side.

357
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,160
Just get a little side dude going, get a little side dude action because he will give you

358
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,640
all of the, the attention and all of the, you know, positive reinforcement that you

359
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
need.

360
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
You need a side dude.

361
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
And it's not cheating.

362
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
It's not cheating.

363
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
If you do it for those reasons.

364
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,000
Listen, if Mr. Success, you want to knock him down a few pegs, that's how you do it.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,400
Let him, that'll be your secret.

366
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,280
That's your success that you keep from him.

367
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,160
Did we just discover the reason why people cheat on their significant others?

368
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
It's gotta be one of them.

369
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,400
The other one is if the person is immensely physically attractive.

370
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Just super, super.

371
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
So hot.

372
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
So hot.

373
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
So hot.

374
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Yes.

375
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,480
I don't care about my insecurities anymore.

376
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,720
You are bringing me such pleasure because of your physical attractiveness and your sexual

377
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
prowess that this is worth it.

378
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,440
I hate to, I hate to keep interrupting, but, um, Paul Bart mall cop, did that come out

379
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,400
this year or was that last year?

380
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,360
I believe that was Paul Blart was, I'm not kidding.

381
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,240
I think Paul Blart mall cop would be a pretty, I might actually, how about Paul Blart Robocop?

382
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,120
Whoa, did you not watch the movie Travis?

383
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,560
Around the halfway point during the, the, the ascending action of that movie is he gets

384
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,520
cut in half by one of those gates that they use to lock down stores.

385
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,920
So they have to give him robot legs.

386
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,220
So from the, actually it was a segue.

387
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,440
His bottom half became a segue and his top half was Kevin Smith.

388
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,080
And it was so fucking funny.

389
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,480
It was a, it was a rough, rough surgery and they had to get a hat, a torso donation from

390
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Kevin Smith and, uh, Kevin James is dead.

391
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:17,400
So like the segues underneath his long coat and, uh, Paul Blart mall rat, thank you monster.

392
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,320
What?

393
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,600
It seems like with all of the people I know in a relationship, the guy is usually four

394
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,960
to 10 years older than their GF and any girls I meet who are relatively close to my age

395
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,720
seem to be interested in older guys, 22, not particularly interested in dating 18 year

396
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
olds.

397
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,480
One of the youngest within my group of college friends by a few years, wait, really?

398
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
Okay.

399
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,560
And most people think I'm 18 or 19.

400
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,900
My question, who are these dummies are going to college?

401
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,680
My question is, should I keep trying to meet girls my age knowing they probably won't want

402
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,640
to talk with me or jump on the bandwagon and be that guy who's always hitting on 18 year

403
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
old girls?

404
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
Nate, that's great.

405
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,720
Well, stop, hold it.

406
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,280
Stop hanging out with old Mr. Jankins, the groundskeeper.

407
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,400
But he's clearly laid out the only two options he has.

408
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,600
All joking aside, like be lonely, uh, because everyone else, all of your peers are grooving

409
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:19,360
on the 28 to 34 year olds, uh, or, or, you know, be with an 18 year old because what

410
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,080
was great, what was great is when you were 18 years old, you couldn't date an 18 year

411
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,480
old because they were all dating 22 year olds.

412
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,160
It's a circle of life.

413
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,920
It's a wheel of boning.

414
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,820
I could try to be really uppity right now, but man, I pretty much only dated freshmen

415
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
in college.

416
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,780
So that's my advice.

417
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,780
It's awesome.

418
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,640
Uh, you know, Nate, you are, you have got to get over the age thing.

419
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,000
You the, I swear to God, I'm a 59 years old and by the time you get to be my age, you

420
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,120
will never think about how old somebody is.

421
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,080
Like, okay, you're 22, you're hitting on 18 year old, gross, yucky, whatever.

422
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,240
You're 70 and you're married to a 66 year old.

423
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
Like really?

424
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
That's, that's nothing.

425
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
That's, it's, it's infinitesimal.

426
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,440
How about this, you're three, you're three and a half and you're hitting on sperm.

427
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Whoa.

428
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,600
And that's, that's, that's the worst is it's a pregnant sperm.

429
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,960
So you got the stigma too from your parents.

430
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,840
You're dead and she's 88 and you're still dating.

431
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah.

432
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,920
Um, why, why don't you, I'm going to date someone your own age.

433
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,560
I guess it's not, it's not, what kind of strict rules does your campus have?

434
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm so uncool now, apparently I do not know the things that are going on.

435
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,760
I think when you're fresh out of college, when you're fresh out of college or you're

436
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,500
near in the end of college, you don't want to date people in college anymore.

437
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,120
You want to date people who have already, you know, made it because that's who you want

438
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
to be.

439
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,680
When you date the kind of person that you want to be.

440
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,000
I would only want to date people in college so I could drink in their naivete like a sweet

441
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
elixir.

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,320
Oh God, they're so optimistic about the future and what it holds.

443
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,680
They're so happy not being in high school anymore.

444
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,640
That's me drinking in their positivity.

445
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Yum.

446
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
Yum.

447
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
It's, it's delicious.

448
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,040
It tastes like sunshine, like liquid sunshine.

449
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,720
How about a Yahoo answers question?

450
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Yes.

451
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Do it.

452
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
This one was sent in by Cal.

453
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,800
The question is, oh man, it's so great.

454
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I didn't read his name before.

455
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,720
It's from A1 Magician.

456
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,880
A1 Magician asks, appropriate to his name, in performing street magic, what is the best

457
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,040
way to open a conversation and starting a performance?

458
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,720
I really want to do some street magic to some bystanders.

459
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,640
He wants to do magic to people.

460
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:53,800
I'm glad he's established already that magic is in fact something you do to people.

461
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:59,040
I want to do some street magic to some bystanders, customers in a restaurant and et cetera, but

462
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,240
I could not seem to find the right words to open or engage in a conversation leading to

463
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,720
me performing magic.

464
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,000
I got, okay, here's, here's a few helpful suggestions from your friends at My Brother

465
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
and My Brother and Me.

466
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,120
Hey, do you guys want to see some magic?

467
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Okay, that's-

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,720
Hey, who here likes magic?

469
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,720
That's a good one.

470
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,720
That's a pretty good one.

471
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,080
Are you, uh, are you stupid enough to be taken in by simple illusions?

472
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,200
Hey, you look gullible, check this shit out.

473
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,000
Hey, let me see your iPhone for a second.

474
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Can I borrow a quarter?

475
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,480
Hey, I've been on-

476
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
I need to get on a bus.

477
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
I've been on my own for too long.

478
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,480
Here's what comes, here's what comes of that.

479
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,720
I don't think there is a good way to open a conversation for street magic.

480
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,080
The thing is street, that's why street magic is so intriguing, right?

481
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,560
Because theater magic, people have paid to come to see you.

482
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,520
They are doing viewership to your magic as opposed to the opposite.

483
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,920
You're doing your magic to them.

484
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,720
I am personally terrified of the idea that I could just be walking around in my day-to-day

485
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,240
and someone could just magic me like out of nowhere with no permission.

486
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
Hey, excuse me.

487
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Can I stop you for a moment?

488
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
I want to do some magic.

489
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
No, I would like, I would prefer you not.

490
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
I am going to the mall.

491
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,480
No, just let me, just, just give me a moment to do some magic to you.

492
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
You're going to love it.

493
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,520
When I'm walking, when I'm walking down the busy bustling streets of Chicago, there are

494
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,680
two things that I'm on Vigilant Watch for.

495
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:26,940
And by Vigilant Watch, I mean, I keep them in my periphery, but I don't like look directly

496
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,800
at them because I don't want to engage them and is the homeless.

497
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,040
And of course, street magicians are people who I assume to be street magicians.

498
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,520
If there was a homeless person that came up to do street magic to me, I would, I would,

499
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I would explode.

500
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I would not know.

501
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,560
What if one bum rushed you and said, Hey, I bet you thought I was going to do some street

502
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
magic.

503
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,020
Well, you, you may already be psychic.

504
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,760
I should watch you do a trick and then street magic just like that.

505
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,480
Travis, you did some street magic, right?

506
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,840
You were, I remember you were into street magic and you had conversations about getting

507
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
into street magic.

508
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Did I make that up?

509
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,120
I dabbled, I dabbled in Prestidigitation.

510
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
What is it?

511
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,480
What if, what if you didn't start it?

512
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,760
Maybe you had them ask you to do magic.

513
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,620
So, so let me hit you with this.

514
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,280
You stumble out of a theater and you have like a magician's costume on, but you're,

515
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,200
the elbows are kind of ratty and you're crying and just fall down the streets and sob.

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,280
And when someone asks you what's wrong, they say, they say my magic wasn't good enough.

517
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,080
They said, no one would want to want to see my old stupid tricks.

518
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:35,280
And then you get them to be like, uh, I'm sure that's not true.

519
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,140
And you'd be like, Oh fuck, it's on.

520
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,160
Let's get some magic, open your mouth.

521
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm putting wonder in it.

522
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,120
Maybe not that so much.

523
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Open your mouth.

524
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm trying to put some wonder in you.

525
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,640
Oh God.

526
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,160
I did just come up with a really great street magic routine where you are the, the bum who's

527
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,080
like asking for money, but everything you asked for is, is part of the trick.

528
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,560
You're like, can I borrow a quarter?

529
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,720
And like, I don't have a quarter.

530
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,980
And like, Oh, then what's that behind your ear?

531
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,480
I think you're legitimately developing street magician routines now.

532
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,640
If there's ever been a sure sign that it's time to move on, I think this is it.

533
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,080
I can't, this is from Chris, uh, via Gmail says I can't seem to get my wife's attention.

534
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
We both work.

535
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,680
That's what I hear when someone uses an exclamation point.

536
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,560
We both work fast paced jobs, long hours and long commutes.

537
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,640
We're either going full speed or pass out from exhaustion.

538
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,680
We tend to buzz right by each other on most days.

539
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,120
My question is, how can I get her to slow down and start hanging out more?

540
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,160
I'd like to do something special.

541
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,240
So I figured I'd solicit some expert advice from you guys.

542
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,640
As a side note, Molly, my wife is a loyal listener, so she should be listening right

543
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,640
now.

544
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,520
Assuming you get to my question, maybe a plea directly to her would do the trick.

545
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,080
The NBNB AM wedding proposal was a home run.

546
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,880
Can you spray a little magic for us, Chris, Chris, magic to you, Chris, say, Hey, Molly,

547
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,160
can I do some magic to you?

548
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,400
And she'll be so intrigued.

549
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,960
I think that you've got her for at least 30 minutes.

550
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
What day is it today?

551
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
It's, it's Monday, right?

552
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,400
That's the day that the shows go up.

553
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah.

554
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,720
But you guys need to arrange a date night on this coming Thursday, 8 p.m.

555
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,360
You'll go out, you'll get a bite to eat at your favorite dining spot.

556
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:29,840
And then at 10 p.m., go see a film, go see the social network and sit in the back and

557
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,680
neck, just neck the whole time.

558
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Don't even watch the movie.

559
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Just neck.

560
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Real noisy.

561
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Well, then go see a bad movie then.

562
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
It's supposed to be terrible.

563
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,800
Go see Paul Bokmulkop, the show at the Dollar Theater.

564
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,520
You know, this is, this is tough because when, I mean, I'm married to a doctor, so she's,

565
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
she's kind of busy.

566
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,520
Always bragging.

567
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
Always bragging.

568
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,440
Always bragging about that.

569
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,920
I think you should, I don't see that she's not going to resent you asking her to slow

570
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,440
down and spend their time with you.

571
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,880
Like, do you know who does that?

572
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Babies.

573
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
Like, literal babies.

574
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,520
And especially pregnant babies.

575
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,040
God, you want to hear a complainer.

576
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,160
Can't, can't speak, but you know she's bitching at you.

577
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
God, pregnant babies.

578
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:20,800
The thing to do, my suggestion at least, would, hey, maybe get a little more comfortable with

579
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
you time.

580
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,680
Oh, Chris time, eh?

581
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Don't mind if I do.

582
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Let me open up a can of Chris time where I drink the beverages I want to drink and watch

583
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,200
what I want to watch on TV.

584
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,360
But that's, I think set up a bear trap.

585
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,880
See, bear traps are cruel and unusual, but some sort of, um, uh, snare.

586
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
Some sort of snare.

587
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Oh, a snare.

588
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
That hurt.

589
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
You know what I've always wanted?

590
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
One where you bend the tree over way far and then you leave it on the ground.

591
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,160
But that will kill, that will kill her, which.

592
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,720
Wait, no, no, it won't.

593
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,400
It'll just grab her up by her foot.

594
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,240
And I was like, not one of the ones that flings her across the yard.

595
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
Right.

596
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,520
That's the one that I was thinking of.

597
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,720
How about, um, a tiger pit?

598
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,680
This tiger pit, a tiger pit might be hard to pull off in your house.

599
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,040
Don't put the spikes.

600
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,480
Don't put the spikes in there though.

601
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,960
This is a family friendly mistake, but if you have a rug, a large conspicuous rug in

602
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,880
your house, just put a tiger pit down there.

603
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,200
Maybe you could clear like 30 minutes in your own schedule to think about the fact that

604
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,080
your wife makes time for us, but not you.

605
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,360
Well, that could be something you do in your spare time.

606
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,680
Maybe she, maybe she like listens to us on the commute.

607
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,200
Um, but, but this idea is worth looking into if she, if she does listen to us on a commute,

608
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
maybe you should do your own podcast.

609
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,600
Uh, but the podcast isn't you giving advice to people who desperately need it as much

610
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,640
as it is, um, you just talking about your wife, talking about how much you love your

611
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,960
wife, all the things that you do, uh, in the day that your wife doesn't know about, but

612
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,160
you know, should know about, um, and we can call it molly talk, molly talk.

613
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:12,760
If you need some tips, poor Chris, Chris, Chris riffs, Chris riffs, ludicrous.

614
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,400
I I've got nothing.

615
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,120
Saddest podcast ever.

616
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,080
Kind of a sad, kind of a bummer.

617
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,640
Hey hun, how's your day?

618
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,800
Um, I like, Hey hun, how's your day?

619
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,760
Can we change the name of our podcast to Hey hun, how's your day?

620
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,920
Uh, I am a girl living with a guy who I have been friends with for a while.

621
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,200
My other friends and I have always had a sneaking suspicion that he might be gay and I think

622
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,080
if he came out, he would be much happier.

623
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,560
Is there an easy way to have this talk?

624
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Thanks.

625
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Mom's pregnant.

626
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Are you sure?

627
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Are you sure he's 100% sure?

628
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,140
That's so important.

629
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,360
Is it possible you just really want him to be gay?

630
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,880
Hey, yeah.

631
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,120
Do you just want a gay friend?

632
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,000
I get it, but I, I think it would be easier for us to advise if we knew some more about

633
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
the dude.

634
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,680
Cause there is a lot of things that can be perceived to, to be, um, gay traits, uh, that,

635
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:17,280
that aren't aren't simply aren't, um, maybe he enjoys top chef, but Justin, you enjoy

636
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,280
top chef.

637
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,080
Um, are you, are you like, does he wear men's fashion scarves?

638
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,260
Oh, scarves.

639
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
That could go either way.

640
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,260
I see.

641
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
I wear scarves.

642
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,260
Hell.

643
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Maybe he goes either way.

644
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
It's hard to say.

645
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,920
And that, that would be a whole different discussion.

646
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:37,640
I think if he wanted, if you wanted to talk about it, like I think he would probably discuss

647
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
it with you.

648
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,720
He would probably be more comfortable living with you if all the cards were on the table.

649
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,440
Um, which you can take one of two ways.

650
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,960
Either a, he doesn't want to talk about it or b, he's not gay.

651
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
I really don't know how you don't know this already.

652
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,920
Like how, cause if you don't know he's gay at this point, you've been living with him,

653
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:03,360
then he is not, at least not out of the closet gay.

654
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,860
Like wouldn't you think?

655
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,840
I think, I think coming out of the closet is such a big deal because this is, you can't

656
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,480
approach it like this.

657
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,440
I think it's such a big deal because nobody can do it but you.

658
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
And let me throw something out.

659
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,860
Like nobody can be like, Hey, it's cool.

660
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,000
It's time to come on out.

661
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Come on out here.

662
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
We have candy.

663
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,480
Um, I'm going to throw out.

664
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,080
It's none of your business.

665
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:28,520
Um, well, I'm going to put a little bit nicer, a little bit nicer, since you're a listener

666
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,480
to our mind your own goddamn selfish bitch.

667
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,560
Why is it so important to you?

668
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,120
I think is, is another way of looking at it.

669
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,680
You like your relationship with him, right?

670
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,280
You don't want to put any undue stress on it, right?

671
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,520
Just let it go.

672
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,240
Maybe he's secret gay.

673
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
Maybe he's not.

674
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,480
Maybe it's that, maybe it's that, that mystery that keeps your relationship going.

675
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,840
Who knows?

676
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,360
Maybe he's been acting gay so he can secret look at you, look at you in the shower and

677
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,720
you never suspect it.

678
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,080
Oh, whoa, whoa.

679
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,400
Blew your mind.

680
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,400
Just let him be.

681
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,400
Let it be him.

682
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:07,840
Like a beautiful, beautiful butterfly that may or may not be gay.

683
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Also come on to him.

684
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Yeah.

685
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
Oh yeah.

686
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Sure fire.

687
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,880
Show him your boobs and then say, Hey, let's see that boner.

688
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,840
I want to see it, I want to see it, I want to see it, boner check, boner check, boner

689
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,840
test.

690
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Quick.

691
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,840
Quick.

692
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,840
You failed.

693
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,840
You failed gay.

694
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,840
You don't want this gay.

695
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,840
You don't want this body.

696
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,840
This banging.

697
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,560
You must be gay if you don't like this.

698
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Me.

699
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
I have.

700
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,600
Why don't you go fuck a guy?

701
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,600
You don't want this body.

702
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Gay.

703
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Gay.

704
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
Gay.

705
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:43,520
There is literally no thing that you can do in this situation that is not going to

706
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
be terrible.

707
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
Hey.

708
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Sit on your hands.

709
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
Go to bed.

710
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
Either you.

711
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
You want these jugs or you want dudes.

712
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
The dudes on your face.

713
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
Make up your mind.

714
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Do you want to kiss a man on the face or are you going to kiss these jugs right on him?

715
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:04,160
Say jugs as much as possible because there's nothing sexier than that.

716
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
Nothing sexier than that.

717
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,040
I would suggest calling his mom.

718
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,880
Hey, do you know your son's gay?

719
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Judge from her reaction.

720
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,880
No.

721
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,880
All right.

722
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,120
In all seriousness, don't stir up this.

723
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Don't be high.

724
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,120
Don't do anything.

725
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Hook him out when he's ready.

726
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,920
Find some ways to say, like, right now, you know, there's a lot of issues that pertain

727
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,080
to the gay and lesbian community right now in the news.

728
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,340
Maybe find some way to express your support of the homosexual lifestyle so he feels comfortable

729
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,000
talking to you about it.

730
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,240
But otherwise, don't force it because it's not going to be good for your life.

731
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,360
If you really want him to be comfortable talking about it and if he is to come out to you,

732
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,960
then you need to drop it.

733
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,800
You need to not worry about it.

734
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,400
If he is out of the closet, he will tell you when he's ready.

735
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,200
And if he's not, it is not your place to convince him to come out of the closet.

736
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,800
Maybe maybe you are gay, too, and you want him to be gay so you can be in love together.

737
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:11,600
And if so, I would submit, you do not understand how these things work.

738
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,160
It does not work like you would think it did when you were four years old.

739
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,320
Trust me on this.

740
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,480
I want to hear Griffin's final question, but first a few quick housekeeping things.

741
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,080
Our website is my brother, my brother and me, it's mbmbam.com.

742
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,200
You can find out how to ask us questions on there.

743
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,160
We love all of your questions.

744
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,280
What we also love is when people on Twitter, you can follow us on Twitter, at mbmbam.

745
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,920
We also love to see people asking questions or saying quotes and using the mbmbam hashtag,

746
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,840
just putting the quotes out there, try to get people interested in the show.

747
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,360
We have t-shirts available.

748
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,960
We are going to try to get some new gear out, some new new merch soon.

749
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,840
Yeah, now is now is the time to start sounding off on whether or not you guys want more shirts

750
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,520
if you didn't get any.

751
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,300
I guess there's still some available, but if we did do more shirts, what would you like

752
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,300
to see?

753
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:26,140
We've gotten a bunch of people requesting some more Russo's artwork, which is all exceptional

754
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,400
and I would love to put on my body every day of the week.

755
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,880
That's the end game really for this podcast, is to create at least seven different shirts

756
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,440
featuring Justin Russo's artwork.

757
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,440
What you might have seen on Tosh.0.

758
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,640
What you may have seen on Tosh.0.

759
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,600
Just let us know on the Twitter what you guys would like to see or in the Facebook group,

760
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,320
which we have also.

761
00:37:48,320 --> 00:38:00,800
Thanks to obviously to Mr. Dr. Muffin, thanks to people getting the word out, L-E-M-M-E-L-L-I-M-E-M

762
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,480
says he is going to get an M-B-M-B-A-M tattoo.

763
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,480
So if that happens-

764
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,480
Oh, don't do that.

765
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
No, do that.

766
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Please, please, please, please don't do that.

767
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,480
What?

768
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Definitely do that.

769
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Do that.

770
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
I promise.

771
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
That's a two out of three vote.

772
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Two to one.

773
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
We are going to get that tattoo.

774
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
We are going to get bored.

775
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,440
We are going to get bored with doing this in three weeks and it will never happen again.

776
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,960
People will be like, what's that random string of letters on your forearm mean?

777
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,960
And why is it so big?

778
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,520
Why is it so, so big?

779
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
Everyone can see it.

780
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Now let me counterpoint with this.

781
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,280
Get it, pussy.

782
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,880
Thanks to Grifty176.

783
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:38,640
He wore his M-B-M-B-A-M t-shirt to the Spam Museum, which is magical.

784
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,040
And thank you to everybody who follows us and tells other people to listen.

785
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,800
Get a friend to listen this week.

786
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,800
Make him a CD.

787
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
That's your homework.

788
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
That's your homework.

789
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,880
Get one friend to listen.

790
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,440
And the same with the past couple of weeks, if you have an M-B-M-B-A-M listening party,

791
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,360
let us know and we'll record an intro for your first meeting so you can welcome everyone.

792
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,540
So just let us know what it's going to be, your email, that kind of thing.

793
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,160
Your first meeting gets a message, your 10th meeting gets a message, your 20th meeting

794
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
and so on.

795
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
And so on.

796
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,440
And your 100th meeting, you get a special podcast full length.

797
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
Yeah.

798
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Yeah.

799
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,440
Yeah, you do.

800
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I think you can promise that.

801
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Oh my god.

802
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
If you throw 100 parties.

803
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,440
That'll be like 30 years in the future.

804
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Sure.

805
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,960
Yeah, like 150 years in the future.

806
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:31,520
But mad shout outs to John Nugent and Jeff Mondlach.

807
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,960
Still the only, now the only official M-B-M-B-A-M fan clubs, we might have another one at the,

808
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,680
I believe it's the Pierhead in Galway, Ireland.

809
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,320
Galway, Ireland.

810
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,320
Can you believe that?

811
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
I can't.

812
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,520
That's like a world away.

813
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,520
I refuse to believe that.

814
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,800
That's so crazy to me.

815
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,200
But thanks to James Scott for spreading the word there.

816
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,200
And so that's the show.

817
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,520
Subscribe on iTunes, review some iTunes.

818
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,040
Thank you so much for listening.

819
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Yeah.

820
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
And you can follow us on Twitter.

821
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,440
It's just our names, Justin, Travis, Griffin, McElroy.

822
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,680
So Griffin, hit me.

823
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,040
This one was sent in by Cal.

824
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:23,600
It's a question that is by Yahoo Answers user Raven Face, who needs to know, absolutely

825
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,120
has to know, can a man knock out a gorilla using only hand-to-hand combat?

826
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,600
How am I supposed to break to this?

827
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm Justin McElroy.

828
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

829
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
I'm Griffin McElroy.

830
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,240
If this has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

831
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
You will never know me.

832
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

833
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

834
00:40:44,240 --> 00:41:08,880
If this has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

835
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
I'm Griffin McElroy.

836
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
This has been my brother, my brother, me, kiss your dad square on the lips.

837
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
You will never know me.

838
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
I'm Justin McElroy.

839
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm Griffin McElroy.
