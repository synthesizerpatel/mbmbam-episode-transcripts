1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,700
Starting next month to my friends and I will be moving into a new house together

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,100
Each of us will have our own bedroom, but there's an extra medium-sized room downstairs

10
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,340
No one will be using the room has no egress window

11
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,100
So we don't want to make it into a bedroom got some code issues there dig it

12
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,920
But we're at a loss for what we should do with it

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,060
I was hoping the brothers could come give us ideas about what we could do with this extra space any thoughts

14
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,060
That's from many problem in Minneapolis

15
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
P.s. For what it's worth. We're all guys

16
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,580
hot guys

17
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,220
Sincerely Chad Braden blaze a

18
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,860
Blizz three and blaze three hot bros Blizz blaze and blunts

19
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:58,580
Just kidding two losses the goofy one. Yeah, the goofy, but it's still super fucking kind of gorgeous. Great work blunts

20
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,220
Blunts he's Austrian guys. I didn't know I

21
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:11,980
I didn't know egress windows were a thing because when the first apartment we lived in in the 13th story

22
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,020
Which is great just for starters just in terms of fiery luck

23
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,060
We made Eric sleep in that one room that didn't have any windows in it. I

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,460
Think once you're on the 13th floor Griffin, you don't have to worry about egress windows

25
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,860
Yeah, I don't think that's gonna do you much good at that point. So how about this?

26
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,260
lock the door to said room after filling it with like like

27
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,620
Child's bedroom furniture that you've covered in dust and cobwebs

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,860
You're just leaving a little surprise for the next person that tries to remodel this place every time your friends come up

29
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,020
We go. Oh, I want a tour of your house. Yeah. This is the kitchen. Here's the living room our bedrooms upstairs

30
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,460
What's in that room? We don't go in we don't go in that go in there not since the boat accident

31
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,260
Can you to make this the longest and best con Travis? You just took that idea to ten?

32
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm about to take it just a little bit farther to 11

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,540
Can you wallpaper over the door to that room?

34
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,500
Cuz then nobody's gonna then nobody's gonna find it for 40 goddamn years and it's gonna have a level of authenticity

35
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,460
At that point that I think is just in the center of the room copy of Jumanji. Oh

36
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,180
The movie

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,820
That's great, that's real great that's too funny

38
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,140
That can be where you smoke all your pot

39
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,620
That's always important

40
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,820
Drug room just drug group. This is our drug room

41
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
The laziest panic room

42
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,180
Just go in there

43
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,820
Close the door you do. This is tricky because I've worked from home for a long time

44
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,260
And in a couple of places including like the house that I I now own with my wife

45
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,660
one of the bedrooms is where I sleep and the other one is where I work because it's my office and it's like I

46
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,700
Get two rooms. That doesn't really seem fair

47
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,540
It doesn't really seem like an equitable

48
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,220
Situation you could trade off and say like Monday Wednesday Friday

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,940
The room can be whatever guy a once but then Tuesday Thursday Saturday

50
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,380
It's whatever guy be once and then Sunday

51
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,940
You share it free-for-all party room if you guys had an extra room in the houses you live in now

52
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,280
What would you do with it yoga studio? Did you say yogurt studio because then maybe

53
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,540
Yeah, it's where I paint yogurt

54
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,620
I

55
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,980
think

56
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,980
Gosh, I don't know. We just did like a big purge of all our our stuff

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,620
We had one extra room and that that was for the kids

58
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,500
So I guess I don't have any extra rooms anymore. Now. I don't know what I would do with it. Maybe like

59
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,980
just a

60
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
more storage

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,720
Man, I'd really shot the cannon in doors with that one. Here's what I would do

62
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,180
Okay

63
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,660
I'd put a bunch of newspaper clippings and pictures of people around town on the wall

64
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,300
All right, and then with thumbtacks and pieces of stress

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,420
All of them absolutely with like with some people's faces

66
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:18,480
Yeah, that's like what does it all mean where the money go? What what happened with the case, you know, just all over it

67
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,560
That's just there for people to walk into and go what what is and like I I've almost got it

68
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,780
I've almost got it. It's it's it's right there on the tip of my tongue

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,040
I've almost solved it and then usher them out of the room. So basically Travis you want an all-purpose goof room

70
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,760
Yeah, I want like a room of requirement that every time you open the door. It's a different punchline to a joke. Sure

71
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,880
Okay, and a team of people that changes it out betwixt the goofs. Okay, and they live there

72
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,200
Can we just please have a bedroom here, please? You call us in here. No, you can't this is our all-purpose goof room

73
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,620
We will sleep on the inflatable mattress in the dining room

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,600
Cuz that's I mean we gotta have our goofs

75
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Oh

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
We're human

77
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,080
not goof

78
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,180
Human humans good. I have to goof humans got a goof always be goofing. That's us

79
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:20,880
I work on a history ship. No ghosts. Sorry not to be fair. Doesn't it does a historic ship not a

80
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,680
History ship we're going back to 1512

81
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,720
What's up in 1512? Nothing. It sucks hop on the boat

82
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Here comes the time doc

83
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,460
Shit we missed the time to pay your fees to disembark. We missed the time doc now. It's 1314

84
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
It gets worse as you go back

85
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,120
Now we're gonna charge you all a premium for the smallpox vaccine

86
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,400
That's how they get you on history timeship how they extort you on the history ship. I work on a historic ship

87
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,840
No ghosts. Sorry prove that and also that you can see and that have made them their presence. No

88
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,600
Yeah, I mean, let's let's qualify a little bit. They're all

89
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,580
I also live in one of the staterooms that used to be officers quarters

90
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,940
The deal is that I live here for free as long as I agree to be the after-hours

91
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,080
Security guard the problem is I have a hard time kicking people off who snuck on late at night

92
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,580
I'm not a naturally intimidating person

93
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:29,040
I'm a young early 20s woman usually very cheerful sort of plump and I like nearly everyone I meet

94
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,640
What are some things I can do to scare trespassers?

95
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,560
So they'll get lost without putting up a fight and that's from scarcely scary sailor your last sentence

96
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,400
Your last sentence is answered by your first one. Yes

97
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,800
You have a thousand times. Yes, you have to pretend a ghost you gotta ghost them. You have to ghost them

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes, all you have to do walk up in like, oh like a old-timey dress and say like have you seen my child?

99
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,920
God Travis you just put a chill up my spine. Yeah, right a ghostly GMVM chillers. Who have you seen my husband?

100
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
The lifeboats

101
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Tropic chillers, I'm

102
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:21,880
I'm cold. I ate some bad shrimp at the buffet. Oh, no, I've had the norovirus for three days

103
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,120
I don't have any fluid in my body or my bowels

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
I

105
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
booped everywhere

106
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,880
The porter lost my trunk. That's not ectoplasm. It's my crushing diarrhea

107
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
Again, oh no, I've gotta go bye

108
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
I

109
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,840
What if you

110
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,240
What if you are too good is my worry and they stab you because they don't know how ghosts work and they bust you

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,200
No, and they know they call the Ghostbusters. Here's my question. Okay, you're a very convincing ghost

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah, all right, the Ghostbusters show up to bust you. Mm-hmm. You tell them. Oh, sorry

113
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I understand confusion

114
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,520
I'm a human pretending to be a ghost. Yeah ghost catfishing. I'm ghost fishing

115
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
They say haha ghost

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Oldest trick in the book. You don't think slime are trying that shit. We've tried this one

117
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,960
We've seen this one many many times before you are a ghost busting makes me feel good add it up

118
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,640
and and those proton beams those uh

119
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,100
Those don't just like make you twirl around and when and sparks shoot off of you

120
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,900
Those will lathe you in half, okay

121
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,340
So we can all agree that there is a circumstance in which the Ghostbusters have accidentally murdered people almost

122
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,740
certainly almost break into the bus busting HQ late at night and and

123
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:58,180
Winston's jumpy. He's like, whoa, who's that? And then he opens his bedroom door blast. Oops. Oops. Sorry

124
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,500
I know why would you jump on just Winston who is my favorite ghost? Yeah. Yeah, Justin. You want to explain that?

125
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,380
Well, why I just I thought he might be near the front door

126
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,780
Makes I don't know what cuz he was the last Ghostbusters. So he

127
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,340
Is bad. Yeah, she is bad

128
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,460
Everybody else wants to be on the second floor above them so they can use the pole, you know

129
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:25,020
And they know immediately when they fucked up to right because you kill you kill the woman and then she's just there again

130
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:27,400
But in a different form now

131
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,140
You do need to bust that because she she has been murdered in a horrible manner

132
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,900
And then it just goes down in the books as a pre-emptive busting. Yeah

133
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,580
That's a good point Travis. It's a causal busting

134
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Not premeditated not premeditated

135
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,580
accidental causal busting

136
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,540
So we hope you you know what? You don't need to scare people off. Just be cool. Listen, honest to God

137
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,540
I've never snuck into anything ever

138
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:02,000
But I can imagine that if I snuck onto something and somebody with a flashlight period were to say hey get off

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,220
I'd be like, oh, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You guys cursing a lot is good too. That one's on me

140
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,400
I'm not supposed to be here and I recognize that I am a dork. Yeah, it seems weird that people wouldn't just like

141
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,180
Leave I don't know. I would be so frightened. I hear anyone who tries to argue like no, I'm I'm supposed to be here

142
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm on the list

143
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,580
I'm on the historic boat list if you could take a look eyes. Just think you throw a good throaty curse at them and

144
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,500
They're gone. So what's more scary if somebody shines a flashlight on you in a place?

145
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,620
You're not supposed to be he's like hey get out of here. Like hey get the fuck out of here. You're gone

146
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,340
You've been out. You're done. I'll eat your fucking eyeballs. Oh, they hired a Frankenstein. Yeah

147
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,600
Yeah, no noise that scary could come but they captured they took the history shit back in time to win Frankenstein was

148
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
And they captured him 1991

149
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,200
When Frankenstein had that hit song I'm too sexy for my shirt, right?

150
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,200
That's how you know, that's how you know your child in the 90s. You remember when Frankenstein was alive

151
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,280
It's one reason to know if you were a child in the 90s Frankenstein killed your sister. I

152
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I will say that

153
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,160
Kicking it at Cheesecake Factory on Sunday morning

154
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,680
The day of the morning of my brother's wedding, which was kind of a weird experience for me

155
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,040
I was the most dressed up anyone's ever been inside a Cheesecake Factory ever

156
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,480
Felt a little bit out of place a little bit fish out of water

157
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,080
Was that before after I made you drive back to my house to get my special Travis made us get his special wedding night underwear

158
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,400
And I had to look at them. I had to get them. I had to get them from the underwear spot

159
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,840
Where he kept all of the things and I had to get it and I touched them to yeah

160
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,640
They acknowledge that they I had to I had to okay. Here's the order. I learned about them

161
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,460
I said that's terrible. Then I learned that I would have to retrieve touch. No feel believe hold grasp

162
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
acknowledge

163
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
become

164
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,920
Embrace absorb and now you guys are doing that at home. They were silky as fuck

165
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,880
No, they were silky and they were black and they were black just a little bit sheer just a little bit sheer

166
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,080
So I just felt just like I'm a little bit dead now. I acknowledged that they existed

167
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:27,720
I had to touch my balls women thought about Travis thought about Travis's balls how they would feel inside of them

168
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:34,500
I had to acknowledge the moment where Travis decided to get special wedding underwear then go to a store

169
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,900
Possibly with his bride-to-be had to think had to learn a lot about

170
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,740
Impulse by it was a lot more of an impulse by where I looked and I said, you know

171
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,340
That's gonna feel real good to learn a lot about Teresa that I didn't know and the things that she prefers there

172
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,380
around there

173
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:58,540
Terrific best wedding ever here. Let me rewrite all of my best man speech because I have new fucking subjects

174
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,940
I need to address

175
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,140
I'm gonna wait. I'm gonna go pop up music behind the behind the music for a minute. Don't say pop-up

176
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,140
Pop up video behind the music. I bought the wedding underpants not for a sexy bent

177
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,500
But because I knew the silky smooth material would prevent any chafing day of which I didn't want to deal with as I'm walking down

178
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
the aisle

179
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,780
The decision to buy special sexy wedding underwear may have been an impulse by

180
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:33,260
The the decision to send your brother to go get your special wedding

181
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,300
And it was malicious

182
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,980
It was a combination of because I knew that if I didn't I would think about it all day because that's the way my brain

183
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,180
Works like how well my rather I think about it all day and then to all life

184
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,460
It was funny to me to make Griffin. Yeah, it sure was I guess

185
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,340
Your kids in here man, you said whoever you want to go get your special wedding underwear

186
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:03,100
But now it's it's kind of nice because for the times like when we get sick or one of us is ill and we move

187
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,500
The TV into the bedroom. It really does become an anchor

188
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,980
No

189
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,380
Yeah

190
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,940
Keeps you in bed or brings you to bed early and you don't really do a lot of shit at least in the living room

191
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,220
You do more stuff like I can work on the computer while the TV is on or I feel like at least I'm sitting up

192
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:25,060
Or walking with a terrifying. Well, I mean what if the darkness creeps up on you while you're in your bedroom?

193
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,420
And you're trying to get dressed. Like what do you do then? I

194
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,220
Sing a little song to myself about how lucky I am to be alive

195
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,620
God I'm not dead because the world would be empty without me. Okay

196
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:47,420
Usually kind of then devolves from there into how awesome about how great you are. Yeah, sure sure boy

197
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,740
I think we're all pretty lucky Travis is still kicking. I just assume everyone sings a song like that. Thank you

198
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
God for Travis

199
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,500
Where would I be with the Sun in the sky and the stars at night who guides me home on the chop?

200
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,800
He sees thank Jesus for Travis Travis is Jesus and they just kind of

201
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:16,200
Thank you Travis for Travis is all-seeing power. Thank you Travis for Travis

202
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,520
People don't write enough hymns about themselves

203
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,680
But up to the first stands of him

204
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:33,040
341 thank Travis for Travis and Travis is Travis our hearts are all Travis and brains are Travis to

205
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,560
Third stanza. I need some thank Travis for Travis propaganda posters

206
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,520
You know Travis I I feel like there's been this narrative

207
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,900
Among some of our listenership that you don't get the respect that you deserve on this show

208
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,600
So like I'm all about like I don't know canonizing you

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,120
I also I also want to point out one of the reasons that happens is I don't really need it

210
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,720
I take care of that on my own. Yeah, the other thing is like that it is a little bit of that on Travis goes quite

211
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,000
A long way. That's a visit Travis McElroy calm

212
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
McElroy needs

213
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,880
In a moment of weakness and lacking insight from the brothers wise I agreed to let my nephew move into my basement

214
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:25,040
He's in a band. He pays no rent eats all our food leaves messes and generally acts like a 14 year old

215
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,280
How can I get him to pack up his bags and move away? That's from Carl the grumpy old man in Lincoln, Nebraska

216
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Is he 14 years old?

217
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,600
That's a really good question. I don't understand how all this lines up

218
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,760
Okay, there's a if he's 32

219
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,280
Yeah, there's a much different question than if he's like 19, you know

220
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,960
It's so rare that you get to do something nice for somebody like this

221
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,920
You you could I could connive a few ways for you to get rid of them, you know, like

222
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,960
I mean, there's fake ghosts fake haunting races. That's easy

223
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,000
Light them gas light home

224
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,080
That's just every day remove one article of something from their room and put it like in storage or move it to an apartment

225
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,880
There's gonna be a really long-term plan, but like just one sock, you know on Monday and then like a

226
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
CD on Tuesday and just slowly move them out of the house

227
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,400
Can you start an even louder band on the top floor?

228
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,960
Do you know I mean like he thinks if he's rocking all day and night on

229
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,560
his his strat

230
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:38,480
Then maybe you buy an even bigger Marshall stack point that towards the ground and just start like laying down some like kidney stone

231
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,600
Rattling bass riffs. Oh, I love this and if whatever their band is called you call your band that but bigger, right?

232
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,720
So if his band is perfect death, it's like we're perfect dirt death. Er, er

233
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,300
More perfect death and then you get incredibly popular you buy him his own house

234
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,480
Behind your house. Oh, no, I have to entourage this shit. Why would you want it?

235
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,240
If you went to all the trouble of buying him another house

236
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,800
You don't get him the money to buy another plot of land so you can only build him a small doll house in your butt

237
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
She still love him. You don't want to be you love him

238
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,720
You don't want to be too far away, but you will have you will have a witch cast a spell on him to make him

239
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
Little enough to live in a dollhouse

240
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,720
This is this is called the candor is what is that we have you put him in a bottle city that you keep in your den

241
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,400
Why have you not told him to stop being a dipshit?

242
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,960
Yeah, life has to tell you that you know the guy who owns your house gets to tell you that I'm pretty sure

243
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,360
Like our dad always told us when we were being idiots

244
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,600
You're his dad now because you own his hat you in the house, right?

245
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,360
Like any sitcom in which like a non direct family member or friend moves in

246
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,460
You you now are responsible for them like a parent. That's what the Matthews did for Cory. I'm sorry, Sean

247
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,900
Cory was their son or like in in

248
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,240
Step by step. I believe it was Cody and then flash you got

249
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,840
Like your child fresh Prince of Bel-Air him. There you go. You've got you're the uncle Phil to his fresh Prince of Bel-Air

250
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,240
How to uncle fill him with your love, but you kind of want to have a girl sound says to me like you want to DJ

251
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Jazzy Jeff

252
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,720
That's what you okay, this is the conversation you sit down say you need to make a decision right now

253
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
Are you gonna be my fresh Prince of Bel-Air? Are you going to be my DJ Jazzy Jeff?

254
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,680
I'm I can if he doesn't get the reference out. He goes he's obviously a Jeff. This is what I'm saying

255
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
It is

256
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,440
Will Smith the I think fresh will was his name just will in the show. Yes. Yeah some bullshit

257
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,080
He couldn't it was well, it was Williams William any um, that was his name

258
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,360
William any um

259
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,400
Represented a pretty tremendous that you go back and watch that show pretty tremendous amount of character growth. Mm-hmm

260
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:00,920
Oh throughout the run of fresh Prince DJ Jazzy Jeff was was almost belligerently stagnant

261
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,800
Well, did we figure he was thrown on his head several times, right?

262
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,760
So, I mean I there definitely is a physiological element to it. I'm just saying that DJ

263
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,120
Just jazz is Jeff

264
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,920
dishes by the end

265
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,200
And the series finale like we're going to go to college now and he was like

266
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,840
I just want to party all night long and then he puts on line where she's all night long because he's like fucking stuck

267
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,320
You know, I mean, right? Yes now he has no opportunity for he has nothing

268
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,880
Also, did he ever DJ on that show fucking once ever and ever?

269
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,920
I don't think so. I believe he did

270
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,840
There is a an episode in which will rent out the house for a music video and I believe

271
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,640
DJ Jazzy Jeff sneaks in and he's doing a little mixing on the old one and twos. That's fun. That's a fun

272
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,560
That's a fun episode how frustrating must it be to be a genuine like actual musical artist

273
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,240
But for a generation of white people you are that guy that got thrown out of the house

274
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,920
like no, I have like a whole career before this you got

275
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,320
And before we get right in I just remembered that I believe it was not will that rented out the house

276
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,840
He was trying to stop it from happening. In fact Carlton rented out the house. That seems not like Carlton

277
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,360
Now was that was that the same episode? Was that the same episode where Carlton bought a gun?

278
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:28,840
Yeah, that was a real good one that was Carlton's like Breaking Bad the entire series in one episode for him the best episode

279
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,760
I think is the one where will has to convince Carlton that racism exists. Did you guys?

280
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:42,400
He was driving slowly and he got pulled over and he thought it's because he was driving so slowly and well, so there's like no

281
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,160
Racism exists and it blows Carlton's mind because he's never experienced it before in his life

282
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,920
No, that's like a that's not like a fun. That's not like a laugh a minute episode. It goes like really hard

283
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,280
It's actually pretty they go fucking hard on that show. We give that show

284
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,360
I'm just saying that we goof we goof about that show because it's called Fresh Prince of Bel Air and there's a character on it

285
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,720
Called DJ Jazzy Jeff. They tackle some fucking heady heady subjects

286
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:19,160
There's an amazing episode in which will goes off about like his dad leave it. Oh, yeah, they'll rock you to your very core. I

287
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
Have a problem with speaking up. I

288
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,720
Frequently have to repeat myself and people often tell me that I talk too quietly

289
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,620
When I increase the volume, it feels like I'm yelling or that my voice takes on an unpleasant or harsh tone

290
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,640
What can I do to make sure that I'm being heard without feeling as though I'm shouting in people's faces. That's from whispering in Wisconsin

291
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,400
I know that problem. No, you don't know. No, no. No, here's the thing

292
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,640
surprising to most

293
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,440
while I am very loud and verbose when like telling a story or a joke or entertaining people are ordering food at a

294
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,840
Restaurant or but here's the thing half the time

295
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,080
I mumble out my order or half the time is I want to ask somebody a question. I don't like

296
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:07,120
Annunciate I say a really quiet and kind of humbly and it's either one of those two is I'm either super loud or like really

297
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,600
Awkward and quiet and mumbly and Teresa calls me on this all the time and it's like there is no middle ground for me

298
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,560
Yeah, you never sound normal. Yeah, no never not really. I'm surprised you you have found a

299
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:27,520
Fair amount of success. I would say in this audio only medium while I have my phone turned down to 1%

300
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,000
Yeah, and even now like even that when you said percent you're popping your plosives you're shouting

301
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,280
You don't even know that you're shouting right now, but the people listening like is he mad at me?

302
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,480
I think this is not a fun podcast as an experience for me

303
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Travis is basically three quarters of the way to an SNL character, right? Correct. I

304
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,240
Mean, it looks like Chris Catan. That's not fair Travis. I'm sorry. I said that no

305
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,660
You got a whole beer going on. He can't grow a beard. Yeah, take back a tan not since the fire

306
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,480
Just talk a little louder. You guys don't need us for these. No, here's the thing. No, here's the thing

307
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:08,000
I think there's an I can infer a problem here and I think the problem is not that they're jumping from like

308
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,560
Quiet to loud. It's that when he speaks at a normal volume or she speaks at a normal volume. They feel loud

309
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,200
which I think that that point is more of a self-confidence about either your speaking voice because you feel like it's harsh and

310
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,040
Unpleasant or you feel like you're yelling and being boisterous

311
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:33,040
I think that it comes from an inherent fear of voicing your opinions and saying what you need

312
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,520
Let me help you out here. Your problem is that you're you're yelling from your your head

313
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,620
You need it. Where's your power? A lot of people ask me that Justin. Where's my power in my vagina? Okay

314
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,880
It's it's down deep in your diaphragm. That's where you got to push the sound from right now

315
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,720
You can't see it, but I've got

316
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,920
several leather restraints wrapped around my stomach to help me

317
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:00,680
Remember to always be pushing air out of my diaphragm. I literally have no room to exhale

318
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm waiting until after the show to exhale right wait to exhale. I'm waiting to exhale, right?

319
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:12,960
Oh, they're also there for sex stuff. There are sex stuff related adjacent their sex adjacent. I would say yeah sex adjacent

320
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,880
It's amazing. Those two things don't have to be mutually exclusive

321
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,240
It can both be good for your support and for your sex stuff

322
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,760
This helps me talk good in public and also the chafing does things

323
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
vis-a-vis boners

324
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,720
You know sex stuff that is a good point though

325
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,600
Cuz you learn in theater the ability to like support and not yell

326
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,080
Well, you're gonna react and you can be confident without like yelling to the back of the theater

327
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,440
So I think that's it. Just support yourself with air feel confident what you say

328
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,600
Let me uh, let me let me perform a quick demonstration

329
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Terrific. I can't wait for this

330
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,080
This is me speaking with my normal voice

331
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,240
But you can hear all of this sound is coming from my mouth and my neck

332
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,440
Your neck meat that makes the sound my neck meat is filtering the sound waves out through what?

333
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,380
Scientists call this the shout hole your your moist

334
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:16,640
Your moist cords are slapping together like two fish just throwing together at a fish market

335
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,880
So this is just my normal. This is all with without any other support. Yeah

336
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,680
Justin I'm in the back of the theater. I'm in the back of the theater and I'm hearing every word of that

337
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,440
Diaphragm have an accent. It's just from the sound being pushed out

338
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,660
Oh, that's painful, yeah

339
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,920
It hurts act that's why they pay them so much

340
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,920

367
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,680
That one that one slipped through my dragnet usually, you know

368
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:36,960
If there's a piece of merch coming down the pipe that I'm like, that's this isn't fancy elegant like adult way like adult kit

369
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,000
Um, then I will you know, I have veto power but this one I was you know

370
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,640
I was playing a lot of Final Fantasy 14

371
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,560
I was busy and I didn't even see it and then I looked on our website and said work of fart right there

372
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,760
And I went to I went to Travis and I went to Sarah our merch designer and I was like, hey

373
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,080
What what's up and they were like, it's it's really funny and then I looked at it and you know what they were right

374
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,440
And so then I learned a little something about myself and guess what work of fart the pin it

375
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,600
sales for that benefit one tree planted which is dedicated to making it easier for

376

Individuals and businesses to give back to the environment create a healthier climate protect biodiversity and help reforestation efforts around the world

377
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,560
And I'm sure they're stoked that

378
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,560
Travis's ongoing fart joke is helping to put trees in the world

379
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,480

389

That's it. Enjoy the rest of them the bros better. We'll be back with a new episode next week until then

390
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,900
Arrivederci

391
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,740
From the internationally acclaimed creators of who shot you comes the movie podcast

392
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Maximum film starring producer and film festival programmer Drea Clark as a woman bound by passion

393
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,860
I saw this eight months ago on the festival circuit and I loved it film critic Alonzo de Rolde as a man

394
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,500
Corrupted by greed why watch one home or Christmas movie when I can watch seven and comedian if you waddyway as a man

395
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,380
Protecting a love that society simply won't accept

396
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:01,540
I think Pacific Rim is a perfect movie and if you can't accept that I want you out of my life from the makers of

397
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,460
The movie podcast who shot you comes maximum film. That's right

398
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,660
We changed the name of our show to maximum film, but don't worry

399
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,660
We're still a movie review show that isn't just a bunch of straight white dudes

400
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:18,500
So tune into maximum film at maximum fun org or wherever you get your podcasts

401
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
You

402
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,260
How about a yahoo hit me so I'm standing by drew Davenport, thank you drew

403
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,620
Test by yahoo answers user DS who asks best battle ever

404
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,900
Takes place in the same area that Goku fought Vegeta the first time

405
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,580
So not not their final battle. We're talking about the first

406
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:48,740
Right way the first one the premier Goku V Vegeta where we're not the first time Goku fought fajita

407
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,740
Okay, got it. Go ahead

408
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:56,980
so this is in the religion and spirituality section, so we're talking about Jeremiah the

409
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,300
The prophet the weeping prophet, you know him

410
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,980
You might know him from Kings

411
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,100
50 foot robot Jeremiah with laser eyes and the mobility of eight ten

412
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,860
Ability to fly but only for three minutes before a charge up of five minutes low-class shields and five rockets

413
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,420
machine gun 200 bullets a mag one minute reload time and unlimited mags

414
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,860
versus uh-huh

415
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:26,620
75 foot Alan Rickman with tentacles for arms and beefy legs mobility of

416
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,260
Five out of ten and mid-class shields machine gun fire from suckers and tentacles

417
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,860
Reload and mag size the same as above unlimited mags and mouth laser equivalent to three eye lasers

418
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,460
Added bonus that he can jump two hundred feet higher than Jeremiah can fly

419
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,080
But can also smash the ground with the power of three missiles, but can only do it twice or his shields will break

420
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:55,180
Jesus such a good question. It's a really tough one. You got Jeremiah in one corner author of first and second Kings

421
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,980
Wait, is it possible that by Jeremiah they mean Jeremy Irons? No, they mean Jeremiah

422
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,340
creator of that joint hit lamentations

423
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,620
Because I would love to see a battle between giant Jeremy Irons. No, no Alan Rickman

424
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,700
I don't get the connection between Jeremiah and Alan Rickman. This person needed to put this question somewhere

425
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,060
Religion and spirituality I imagine is a pretty good place for like getting answers on your Yahoo mysteries

426
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,060
So he had to get some Bible shit in there somewhere. We got Jeremiah. Do you need the stats again 50 feet Jeremiah?

427
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,220
He's eight out of ten speed. That's pretty fast

428
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:37,020
He can fly but only for three minutes to charge up for five. So it's not like an unlimited thing Alan Rickman can't fly

429
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,380
He does have tentacle machine-gun arms. He can't jump super high though

430
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,820
And when he pounds the ground it has the strength of three missiles can't do that more than twice

431
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:49,180
So or his shields will break though. Can they call him thing? I know about Jeremiah. Mm-hmm

432
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:55,220
It's that he was a bullfrog don't know. Come on, and he was a good friend of Justin start talking

433
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,440
I think that the can they call it can they call in?

434
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,260
Reinforcements can Jeremiah call in another biblical prophet can Jeremiah call in like

435
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,360
Matthew or mark or Luke and Alan Rickman can call it. I don't know like

436
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Jason Isaac Janine Garofalo. Hello, Jason Isaac's join me

437
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,760
Take one of my tentacle arms dislodge it from my body and use it to defend yourself

438
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:23,600
So your problem with this question is that there's not enough specificity and the powers that have been allotted to Jeremiah the biblical

439
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,920
Prophet and Alan Rickman who was right?

440
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,200
I'm saying they are they still human or is this like a mecha like Voltron? I think we might be looking at an Ultraman scenario

441
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,860
so robotic cyber Alan Rickman, I think in this situation Jeremiah is

442
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,420
Is Ultraman and I think Alan Rickman might be the the kaiju

443
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,160
Gotcha. I'm gonna have to go Alan Rickman every time

444
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,280
He it does work. He has a significant height advantage

445
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,400
He's slower and that's I think the only thing that Jeremiah has going from that extra three points of speed

446
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,560
It's gonna fucking count on the battle, but he can he can jump and hit the ground with the power of three missiles

447
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,560
That's true. But Jeremiah has five rockets. So you throw you throw Alan Rickman in the air?

448
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,560
You're basically like skeet shooting at that point

449
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:19,360
Yeah, and you think you think Alan Rickman's about to win but then Jeremiah finds the locket that Alan Rickman bought for his secretary in

450
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,320
His coat pocket and he gets so pissed. He gets fucking

451
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,120
Angry, and then he turns around it turns the whole battle around and Jeremiah brings him down

452
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:34,600
Then Jeremiah reaches behind between his shoulder blades and pulls the gun that he had duct-taped there and shoots Alan Rickman

453
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,880
Well, he didn't do that out the window. Oh, he did do that. No. Yeah, you're right

454
00:37:38,880 --> 00:38:08,520
Um, no, that was in Lamentations that was in Lamentations 5-6. Yippee-ki-yay. Holy father. Got one a yahoo answer. Yeah, I'm into that. This yahoo answer was sent in by Alan Black. Thank you Alan Black. A very prolific contributor. So that's about yahoo answer's user SlickNinja360 who asks? Should be good. Should be pretty good. Would it?

455
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,240
Be illegal to go into the middle of a forest and build a maze forcing people to traverse it upon entry.

456
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,320
I guess yeah, I guess that's pretty good. Upon entry the entrance would close it would have spikes on the walls tops

457
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,760
To keep them from escaping.

458
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,120
I was also thinking of having booby traps and things like that

459
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,640
Once they find the exit they could leave.

460
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:47,320
I don't know about illegal, but logistically it seems like an issue. Yeah, you're gonna have to have some fucking. Is it a motorized gate or like a magical that grows over when they walk through? It's gonna be a fucking pan's labyrinth magic moss.

461
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:59,080
I will say if we can't fix gun laws, but we have been thorough enough to figure out our forest maze laws. I might be very disappointed in our nation.

462
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:06,320
If you if if you own the land, and this is troubling because I'm agreeing with the top yahoo response to this

463
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,520
But if you own the land you can build a maze wherever the fuck you want. I don't know that you can corral people into it.

464
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,200
That's where you run into. You can leave a trail of peppermints. There's no guarantee.

465
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,920
This is the beautiful thing about it. If you force people to do it highly illegal. Yeah, if you offer people the opportunity to do it, highly profitable.

466
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,000
Yeah, I can't like I just bought a house and I feel like I have total agency over it.

467
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,200
I do not think I can invite friends in and then lock the door and then swallow the key and say I will let you out as soon as you solve my puzzle of flesh.

468
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:44,440
And then I would show them my flesh puzzle. Here's the funny thing about luring.

469
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:58,280
Is the flesh puzzle your genitals? That's my balls. I would bet that 80 to 90 percent of the people in this room if you stumbled upon what you were guaranteed to be a solvable forest maze.

470
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,800
That would lock you in and you would you would fucking die if you couldn't solve it.

471
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,680
If? That's a big if Griffin. How many of you would say? All right. Yeah, I'll tackle this bitch.

472
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:12,760
This is everything I've ever trained for. Everybody raise your hand. If you stumbled upon a pan's labyrinth.

473
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,480
This is serious. You would not. OK, there's a lot of people raising their hands.

474
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,480
You would risk your life. All those years of playing Professor Layton games are finally going to pay off.

475
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,640
You're going to solve this shit. What what would lure you into? OK, what would lure me into a forest maze?

476
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,880
The seeing the opening of a fucking forest maze. Right. You got it. What if it's risk your life, though?

477
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,520
I don't want you know what? The fourth verse of Tim McGraw's Live Like You Were Dying directly references.

478
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:52,760
I went into every forest maze I saw. I think. I heard a pan flute beckoning me in.

479
00:40:52,760 --> 00:41:01,800
But there was gold doubloons at the end. Spite traps weren't scaring me away.

480
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:08,040
Have you ever heard that song? Have you ever heard the song? I'm not great with melodies.

481
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,840
That's actually I was singing the harmony. I thought someone would join in.

482
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:19,800
Dear brothers, ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever. Oh, so sorry.

483
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,320
This is a problem. All right. Ice truck ice cream trucks never pass where I live, ever.

484
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,400
Today, I heard one outside and I booked it out the door. He was driving away from me, but I finally caught up with him.

485
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:40,200
Well done. Good work. When those things don't drive especially fast, but still kudos to you, I suppose.

486
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,120
Faster than human land speed. I guess. You earned your dilly bar. When I bought my ice. How old am I?

487
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,520
When I bought my ice cream, the ice cream guy just gave me this incredulous face and seemed to be annoyed

488
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,640
that a 20-ish year old would be so excited. You know your age, right? I'm guessing.

489
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,720
Yeah, but I was left on a doorstep. It's good storytelling. He's not like forcing omnipotence

490
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,600
and omniscience onto the ice cream truck driver. Would be so excited about an ice cream truck.

491
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,600
Am I too old to be excited about ice cream trucks or was the ice cream guy just a downer?

492
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,960
And that's from vexed in Ventura question for you audience. Vexed in Ventura, are you here?

493
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:27,400
Hey, welcome. If you're an ice cream driver and it's 2014 and you're in LA, how good is business

494
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:34,280
that you can fucking get judgy on people? I don't know. It feels like you should go,

495
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,600
do you want anything else? Yeah, please. Also, can you think of anything else cold that I could sell

496
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:46,440
because I'm dying here. Let's do a quick poll of the audience. This is interesting. In the last,

497
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,680
let's say three months, has anybody seen an ice cream truck that was stationary and selling its

498
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,560
product to anybody? Just a quick show of hands, stationary. Okay, more than I thought. Better

499
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,120
question. I'll be the first to admit that I fucked up with my judgment. I haven't seen a stationary

500
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,760
ice cream every time it's just like slowly crawling at five miles an hour. It's like anybody.

501
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,040
And I'm not talking, by the way, I want to clarify, I'm not talking about a food truck.

502
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,040
No, no, no. You know what I'm talking about. Ice cream. I'm not talking about our keys and all

503
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:21,720
like, it's got avocados in it. And that's what you sound like food truck drivers, I guess.

504
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,680
I don't know what the ice cream truck environment is like here, but I know what it's like in

505
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:33,640
Cincinnati. When you see said ice cream trucks, is the paint peeling and the pictures faded and

506
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,920
it looks like they just killed- And sometimes they've got like Pikachu on it and it's like,

507
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,120
hey guys, um, let me just like call Nintendo real quick. Yeah, you didn't like go through

508
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,120
the right fucking channels to get fucking Pikachu to sell your iced wares.

509
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:00,920
I would, I would feel uncomfortable and only because I would be so worried that I would come

510
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,800
up from vector A and sort of like in my periphery out of nowhere would be a kid on vector B and we

511
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,440
would arrive at the same time. And you would force the issue like- I was here first. You know,

512
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,480
I was here first, right? Hold on. We got, sorry gents, we got one push pop left. Looks like you're

513
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:22,120
gonna have to wrestle for it. Sweet. You're really little and I'm really big. You just want to give

514
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,320
it to me? I would grab their head and just push it below the window so the guy couldn't see them

515
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:34,120
until I was done purchasing my novelties. Have you guys noticed that the only people on fucking

516
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,040
earth that call them novelties at the grocery store? They used to confuse the hell out of me

517
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,200
when I was a kid. What's a novel- just say ice cream shit. We all know what you're talking about.

518
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:49,320
You don't have to get fucking fancy, Kroger. So you guys want a yahoo? Absolutely. So yahoo was,

519
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:56,360
um, so yahoo was sent in by a man named Drew Davenport, a legend one might say. Thank you,

520
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:04,520
Drew. It's by yahoo answer's user Pineapple Lifesaver who asks, why do so many people buy

521
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,320
Lunchables? You could put your own together for a lot cheaper. Just put some meat, cheese,

522
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:20,040
and crackers in a Gladware container. Uh, well fucking thanks, Einstein. Update, it's not cheaper

523
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,040
though for the tiny handful of food that you get even at one dollar. They're using the cheapest

524
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,160
quality of ingredients. Buying some cheap turkey, American singles, and Ritz Saltines will give you

525
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,000
the same amount of 10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. Holy shit, that can't possibly be right.

526
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,360
All right, first off, blasphemy. They're saying 10 or more Lunchables for half the cost. We're

527
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,760
talking about 20 fucking homemade Lunchables per Lunchable proper. That's a lot of margin.

528
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:53,000
Has anyone ever bought a Lunchable thinking, I am, I'm a thrifty consumer. This is-

529
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,720
Yeah, you're not, you are neither a thrifty, you're not fiscally smart. You are not making

530
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:05,400
a good nutritional decision. You are basically just saying, I, I'm a piece of shit.

531
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,600
Well, that's one of two things. Either you're saying like, I'm a piece of shit, or you're

532
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:13,400
saying like, you know what, I'm going to little kid treat myself. Hey, eight year old Travis who

533
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,040
only wanted Lunchables all the time, but his mom packed him like actual sandwiches and apples and

534
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,720
stuff because she cared for him. But at the time he would look around the other kids who ate

535
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,800
Lunchables and think what fun lives are they leaving? If only I was more of a Lunchables

536
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,680
type kid, but I wasn't. So maybe 25 year old Travis buys eight year old Travis a Lunchable

537
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,360
and sends it back to him through his tummy.

538
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,400
We've got to go back.

539
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,200
Can an adult not just enjoy a motherfucking Lunchable though without those auspices?

540
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,040
You guys are throwing a lot of shade at Lunchables right now. I knew we,

541
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,120
I knew we love horses on this podcast, but I did not know we love high horses quite so much.

542
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,960
But are Lunchables not the same? Like I put them in the same category as, uh, the Hot Pocket.

543
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,360
The Toaster Strudel.

544
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,920
Yeah, that's a fucked up Venn diagram you just weaved.

545
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,480
A Hot Pocket's a lot of work. You gotta push the buttons and, and a lot of fiddling.

546
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,000
A Lunchable, you have to construct your own. They don't just hand you a package.

547
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,760
That's customizable. Kids love that.

548
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,280
Let's, um, we're getting away from the fucking heart of the matter. Um, and I want to get us

549
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,040
back to it. And now, okay, if you want to fucking time travel, I'm eight years old.

550
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:31,080
I roll up to school. I bust out a Gladware DIY. It's a, it's a Lunchaboo.

551
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,440
You've written Lunchable on it, but you spelled it differently to avoid copyright.

552
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,560
Griffin, what the fuck is that?

553
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,880
It's, it's a, it's a Munchable.

554
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,760
It's a what?

555
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:44,200
A Munchable? Dad, my dad made it for me and he said it's just as good. And what do you-

556
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,000
Stop it! I'm literally gonna cry. I'm literally gonna get too sad.

557
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,200
What are you all eating?

558
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,560
Uh, we're eating Lunchables that, uh, they're brand name Lunchables that our

559
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,040
rich parents got us at the store. What was yours called?

560
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,920
Munchables?

561
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,960
What's in it?

562
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,360
Um, looks like some, looks like I got some oyster crackers and a nice note.

563
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,120
It seems, what seems to be a hair.

564
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,480
Uh, it looks like a hair.

565
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,840
I'm, this is one of my, this is one of my new dad Jerry's hairs.

566
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:14,840
It seems the container smells like salami because it used to have salami in it.

567
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,360
That's how we got it. We can't afford to buy Gladware either.

568
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,520
We're just reusing the old containers.

569
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,560
Can you, is this a, can I rock Munchables in the modern workplace?

570
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:29,000
If I roll up and I have a fucking Gladware container and I've written Munchables on there

571
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,200
in a Sharpie and maybe some of the letters are backwards, uh, just to like really drive it home

572
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,840
and, uh, I'm just like Jerry from accounting walks in and he's like, what are you eating there?

573
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:47,000
I say, oh, Munchables. Uh, and I, yeah, I prefer a fucking snack cracker tower.

574
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,960
And I eat it from top down like a T-Rex. Uh, am I okay?

575
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,520
Am I good?

576
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,760
I think, I think, I think if you, if I got to watch you do that,

577
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,360
just like a huge stack of crackers and cheese and meat, and then just deep

578
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:03,560
throw it, just put your head at the top of it until it's all gone.

579
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:07,640
Munchables, what these are Munchables. Yeah, I'll make you some. I'll bring some in tomorrow.

580
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,640
The weird thing is, it's like a, the sadness is greater than the sum of its parts.

581
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:15,240
Cause if you just brought in like a container with crackers,

582
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,440
a separate container with cheese slices, a separate container.

583
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,680
But that's not weird to me, but you put it all in the same container and transport it that way.

584
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,000
And it's like a hundred percent sadder.

585
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,560
Of course context is important in this situation.

586
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:36,120
If I eat crackers and then in another room, I eat some lunch meat, it's not going to be a thing.

587
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:42,200
But if I try to give it my own DIY fucking Pinterest branding, then we have a situation all right.

588
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,760
This is an interesting question for you about Lunchables.

589
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,960
If you go to a party, let's say where there are crackers and cheese and little pieces of meat,

590
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,680
I don't think there's a number of those things that you would eat at which point you would say,

591
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,880
well, I've had lunch now. Did you have lunch? Yes, I did.

592
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,400
I grazed here and now I've had lunch.

593
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,440
You guys are limiting your scope to the fucking snack cracker Lunchable box set.

594
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:20,440
There was a lot more variety in there for our dirty North American Bento boxes,

595
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
essentially is what we're talking about.

596
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:28,200
I don't know if you guys ever sampled the pizza, which was pizza but cold.

597
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:36,680
I have very clear memories of watching an adjacent rich kid eat the pizza Lunchable

598
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:41,640
and being physically repulsed at the idea of eating all of it cold.

599
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,680
And they would call it pizza and it turned my stomach even more.

600
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:51,480
Let me take you down the Oubliette to even further just peer into the past.

601
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,000
Just peer into the darkness with me and we'll talk about the definition of the word soft taco

602
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:07,720
because Lunchables also had that that game wasn't especially on point because you had a round thing.

603
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,360
It was the pizza crust.

604
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,120
It was the fucking pizza crust.

605
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,080
And then they had a cold, essentially giant ketchup packet.

606
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:23,560
But instead of ketchup, it was ground meat question mark.

607
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,720
I don't know how you would meet was a meat was in quotation marks.

608
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,160
It was also an acronym.

609
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,280
It was as bad news bears.

610
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,520
I don't know how you would recreate that for the Munchables brand,

611
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,360
but I think that there is a lot of opportunity in there.

612
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,120
We could probably get some vegan free option vegan free gluten free.

613
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:46,600
No vegan vegan I think all lunchables are inherently vegan free.

614
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,520
Anyway, this person has a great point.

615
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,640
I'm going to take this to Shark Tank.

616
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:49,960
Thank you.

617
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,760
Griffin hit me.

618
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,720
This final Yahoo answer was sent in by me.

619
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,040
Think about it.

620
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,080
Drew Davenport.

621
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:02,840
Yeah, it's in the arts and humanities section.

622
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,280
It's asked by Moniz who asked who was John Candy?

623
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:06,840
What did he do?

624
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,800
Why is he important?

625
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,200
My name is Justin McElroy.

626
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:10,840
I'm Travis.

627
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,880
I'm good for McElroy.

628
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,480
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

629
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:42,120
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

630
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:53,480
It's better with you.
