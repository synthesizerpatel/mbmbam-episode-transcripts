1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,440
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother-mean-advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,560
I'm your baby brother, Griffin. Griffin, you sound so powerful.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,720
I have standing energy. Yes! My desk has transformed into its most

9
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,040
healthful manifestation, and now I have standing energy.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,120
I too am standing. We all are standing for this one.

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,600
I've got full-blown Peter Pan arms. I'm doing JoJo poses with my patio door

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,040
curtain open so the street can see me, and also I've never watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,040
My lungs are filling with oxygen. My diaphragm feels in line.

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,000
Is that something? Fuck yeah, it's something, Travis.

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,320
It's standing energy. Whoa.

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
I feel like my entire life, I've just been whispering.

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,960
Yes. Do you hear this voice?

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,520
This is my true voice. Whoa!

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,440
I've been speaking with a hidden voice until this moment.

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,240
This is my true voice. It's Justin's standing voice.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
It's my true voice. It's so musically delicious.

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,480
Soon you boys will get your true voices too. I'm looking forward to my-

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,360
Your true voice. My true voice has come in.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,080
Yeah, so maybe someday I'll get lucky and find my true voice.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,240
Oh no. Finally, distinguishable voices.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Your true calling was to set us apart. Oh, my bones feel so much straighter.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,920
It's turning into an Adam Sandler thing.

28
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,160
This is Griffin's new character, Prospector going through a washing machine.

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
Who maybe is possessed by Adam Sandler.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Sorry, I had to sit down. That was-

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,920
You watered yourself out, huh? Okay, well Griffin is the first to fall.

32
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Can I sit back down because I hate this.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Yeah, actually, eagle-eared listeners will know that I'm still fucking standing up.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
I cannot hide this power. I cannot hide this just raw.

35
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
I can't turn away.

36
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,160
I just want to sit down more than anything right now.

37
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,440
When I used to be a professional actor, my go-to acting choice,

38
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,960
quote unquote, was to have my character want to sit down all the time.

39
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,280
Loving that, loving that. But I used to love that. Now I hate it. I'm a stander.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,760
Excuse me, breaking news. This monitor tilts up.

41
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm going to try sitting down and see if I can tell a difference between you guys and myself.

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
All right, you do that. I'm going to keep my legs stiff and straight like

43
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
two big massive boners.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,880
Oh, I'm sitting down. This is nice.

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,160
Oh, no.

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,280
Oh, no. You have nothing in the tank. I'm going to start the program now.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,840
And there's nothing you can do to stop me. You're all getting-

48
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,600
You're so confident.

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,520
My brother, my brother and me in its true form. We're finally giving you at two-thirds power.

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,840
Okay, should I stand back up?

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
Stand back up, Travis. Don't be afraid of your destiny.

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,400
Stand back up!

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,120
There he is.

54
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,240
There he is. Here we go. Time for the program. The real program to begin.

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,080
My standing energy has also influenced my mind to tell me that we've gotten

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
everything we're going to get out of this bit.

57
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,160
We- Well, I feel like we should call this one episode one.

58
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,680
This is the true beginning of my brother, my brother and me, The Standing Podcast.

59
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,160
Speaking of which, I hope this is someone's first episode they've ever listened to.

60
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,560
Yeah. The standing show you tried to get me to listen to? I don't get it.

61
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
They just talked for 15 minutes about whether they were standing up or sitting down,

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,560
and this is good?

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Is that every episode? Do they talk about sitting that much, too?

64
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
They've done this for like 460-some episodes?

65
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
You know what's wild is it feels like we've been talking about standing for 15 minutes.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
It's been less than four. I think there's a sort of time dilation

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,520
from standing because you're further away from the planet or something.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Yeah, it does track.

69
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
It's impossible. This show is going to feel like it goes forever,

70
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,640
but I'm not giving up. I want true facts. I want to know when you boys sit down

71
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,600
and if you can hang for an entire episode with full standing power.

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,840
What if we did a laying down show?

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,400
We'll do that next time.

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
It's the Casper one. We did that already.

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
That Casper one. Right, right, right. Okay.

76
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,240
This past Christmas, I bought my parents a DVD of Joe versus the Volcano.

77
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,800
Nice.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Keeps on giving that one.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, yeah. That's so good.

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,760
That's a repeat watcher.

81
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,120
It is. Me and my friends watch it every Thanksgiving.

82
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
No, that's Paul Barp.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,240
That's Paul Barp.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
It's your brother. It's not your friends.

85
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,400
That too, yes.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,480
It was the movie they saw on their first date.

87
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,320
Oh, that's sweet. Oh, my God.

88
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,360
There are people who listen to the show whose parents' first date was to Joe versus the Volcano.

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,920
That is impossible. That's impossible.

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,080
There's people on this podcast who went on a first date to Mortal Kombat Annihilation,

91
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,760
so I'm not going to sit here and listen to your nitpicking.

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,560
I just mean the time. I'm not even saying, like, the content of the film.

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
I'm just saying, like, wow.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,680
Listen, hand to God, I tell you that Joe versus the Volcano came out in the 90s.

95
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,960
I don't think that's true, but it doesn't feel not true.

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
I feel like Justin just sat down.

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,080
No, with all the fussing and fighting, the standing,

98
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,440
my microphone was trying to fall off my desk, but it does not get a break.

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
I don't get a break. The mic doesn't get a break.

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,960
Let's go.

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,560
I wound up buying them a few other things and didn't give them the DVD

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,160
and decided to save it for their anniversary, even more special.

103
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm now realizing that I've never given them an anniversary gift as long as I've been alive.

104
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
So now I'm not sure if this is an awkward idea,

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,800
especially since I don't know if this year is a big milestone for their marriage or not.

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,760
And there's no way of finding out.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,840
Yeah, I'm considering just waiting until Christmas again to give it to them,

108
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,360
especially since the DVD is already wrapped in Christmas wrapping paper from this past December.

109
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
How do I give my parents this Tom Hanks DVD naturally?

110
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,000
That's offensive about parents present in Pennsylvania.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,600
Are you worried at all that when you give it to them,

112
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,880
your parents are like, wait a minute, this is the wrapping paper from last Christmas.

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,960
Victoria and I have talked about it and we've settled on a natural Tom Hanks DVD.

114
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,440
We don't want to give the Tom Hanks DVD in a hospital.

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,960
How impersonal is that?

116
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,200
This is a Tom Hanks DVD.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,520
It should be a celebration, an at home celebration in a Jacuzzi.

118
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Just goosh it out onto this splash pad.

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,120
With just our closest friends and family around, perhaps a Tom Hanks doula.

120
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
Perhaps Tom Hanks himself as the doula.

121
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
We will accept Colin in his absence.

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,440
Yes, of course.

123
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,160
Which anniversary year, there's like, I think I just did paper.

124
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
Which anniversary year is polycarbonate plastic?

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Is it 60?

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Well, I think if I'm, let me look it up real quick.

127
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Click, click, click, click, click, click, keyboard sounds.

128
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah, okay, it says right here, 32 years is the DVD year,

129
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,840
but it does specify only the DVD of volunteers.

130
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
What year, Travis, as long as you're on your computer,

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
what year did Joe versus the volcano come out?

132
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,480
Click, click, click, click.

133
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Well, no, I want to run a little bit of math here.

134
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,480
Google says the 90s probably.

135
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
All right, Google.

136
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,120
Boy, they sure are shitting the bed on that search engine.

137
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Yeah, it's their fault for sure, for sure.

138
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,040
It's hard to type when you're standing up, not at a standing desk.

139
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,160
But the hard thing is that I'm not,

140
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
I feel like as someone who insists on standing,

141
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
I'm also someone who should be bad at Google.

142
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,400
This movie came out in 1990, okay?

143
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,880
Boom, boom goes the dynamite.

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,840
Boom, nothing.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
1990, Joe versus the volcano came out.

146
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,080
So these parents have been married for,

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,960
I mean, it could be they just passed 25.

148
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,280
Assuming they walked out of the theater

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,560
and immediately got married on the fucking street,

150
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
right there, God and everyone.

151
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Listen, Joe versus the volcano, it's a very romantic movie.

152
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,600
Yes, I'm doing the math now and realizing

153
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
that you are giving them four years of dating.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
Is that how long you think people should be together, Justin,

155
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,880
before they pop it?

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,520
It's a wild choice, I know,

157
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,120
but it's also the 30th anniversary is so far away

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
if they did get married during the release window.

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
In the initial box office,

160
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,520
let's play the box office game for Joe versus the volcano.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,960
The week, no, just kidding.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So I would say comfortably,

163
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,480
let's say somewhere between 28 and 23 years.

164
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,040
Something like that, it doesn't matter.

165
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
It doesn't matter, Justin?

166
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,360
It doesn't matter?

167
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
Our question answers, parents, marriage, does it matter?

168
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,760
No, it's all important because this union

169
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,000
is the reason you're on the fucking planet.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
Without Joe versus the volcano, you are carbon, okay?

171
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
You're right, yes.

172
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,840
You're unassigned carbon without the hilarious work

173
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
of Tom Hanks and-

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,160
And John Patrick Shanley and Meg Ryan.

175
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
The whole family, now Travis is on Google,

176
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
now he's Googling things.

177
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,040
Without this film, you're fucking carbon.

178
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,800
You should be handing it to everyone you meet.

179
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,000
You should wear a t-shirt in the film every single day.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,720
Every Joe versus the volcano is a reason for celebration.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
You've waited this one too long,

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,240
give them the DVD, then go get the Blu-ray,

183
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
because without this, you'd be fucking dust.

184
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,400
You should give them the Blu-ray every day for a year.

185
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:24,720
Yeah.

186
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,760
Just to say like, hey,

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
maybe they'll make a Joe versus the volcano too

188
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,360
and your parents will get, I don't know, second married.

189
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
That's what they need to rededicate their vows.

190
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
Now hold on, Travis.

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,400
If you're suggesting the more Joe versus the volcano

192
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,400
you give them, the more in love they will become,

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,240
I think there's a point where you can reach

194
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,560
a dangerous amount of Joe versus the volcano.

195
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,280
Absolutely.

196
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,880
An eruption point, if you will.

197
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,160
An eruption point, and I'm worried that it's like three.

198
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,520
So don't test this.

199
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:53,920
It is not worth it.

200
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,800
Hey, just a pitch Hollywood, if you're listening,

201
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Joe versus the volcano versus Predator.

202
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,840
That's extremely powerful.

203
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

204
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Thank you.

205
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,720
No matter what happens, we lose.

206
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,760
Who wins?

207
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,040
We lose, except Joe.

208
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
If he wins, we're probably okay.

209
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
We're probably fine if Joe wins.

210
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,640
Well.

211
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,440
Well?

212
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
I mean, maybe at that point hubris will overtake Joe.

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah.

214
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
If there's a human man who can kill the Predator

215
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
and a volcano, I'm not sure I want to be

216
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,520
walking the same orb as them.

217
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,320
Yeah, that's terrible.

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,040
That's too much.

219
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,120
No one man should have all that power.

220
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,760
This is true.

221
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,640
Can I read a Yahoo?

222
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Yes.

223
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,000
Here's a Yahoo sent in by Graham Roebuck.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,400
Thanks, Graham.

225
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,440
It's Yahoo answers user Giuseppe, who asks,

226
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,360
if you had a kangaroo pouch, what would you mainly put in it?

227
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
Tiny kangaroo.

228
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Next.

229
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,400
You don't have that.

230
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:45,680
You don't have that.

231
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,360
I don't have a tiny kangaroo?

232
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
You telling jokes.

233
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,560
I want real shit, Travis.

234
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,440
I'm a stander now.

235
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,720
I won't stand for lies.

236
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,320
Dang.

237
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,080
Guys, can we back up for a second?

238
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,480
Do you need to talk about Joe versus volcano more?

239
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,040
Is there more?

240
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,160
Yeah, just for a second.

241
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,680
Can we just talk about John Patrick Shanley's Twitter account?

242
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
Because it's so fucking fresh.

243
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,800
This guy is bringing it every single day

244
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,440
and I don't want to make mention of him

245
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,240
and not recognize the fact that he's fucking bringing the heat

246
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,360
every single tweet.

247
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,400
Bringing the heat with every tweet.

248
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,880
John Patrick Shanley, director of Joe versus the Volcano.

249
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,920
You ready for this?

250
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Sure.

251
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,800
Every one of us is a hideout for so many strange characters.

252
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,640
Some never speak.

253
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,360
Some appear once a sudden flash in the eye

254
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,960
and withdraw again like a sea monster returning to the depths.

255
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,160
The face we show to the world is often merely a convenient pose

256
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
hiding a multitude.

257
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,720
Meanwhile, Justin McElroy is like,

258
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,920
new Mario looks good.

259
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,080
Nothing.

260
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,920
John Patrick Shanley bringing it.

261
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
Have you ever been blamed for the rain?

262
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,920
You have, my friend.

263
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
Sooner or later, each of us is blamed for something beyond our control.

264
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,720
But remember this.

265
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
It's a beautiful thing to be blamed for the rain.

266
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,280
And who knows?

267
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,520
Maybe somehow it's true.

268
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
Hey, hey, John, John.

269
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,720
It's wicked not though.

270
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,200
Hey, John, you're bringing the fucking heat, John.

271
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,320
The heat is hot, John.

272
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,000
But I'm not gonna let you just sort of barf out some pseudoscience garbage.

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,520
I did not make it rain.

274
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,720
The only time I make it rain is when I do it funny with a bunch of money.

275
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,320
That is true.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,560
Dang.

277
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,400
John's tweeting out a bunch of great pictures all the time.

278
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,320
He's got some fucking fresh shirts.

279
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,560
Yes.

280
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Get on to this Twitter account.

281
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,040
Demons.

282
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm reading this sight unseen because I just know it's gonna be fresh.

283
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,080
Ready?

284
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,800
Demons.

285
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000
They tell you things and suggest that you keep them secret.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,560
Never do.

287
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,120
A secret kept with a demon is a dark marriage and will end badly.

288
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,920
If a demon asks for your discretion, break faith as quickly as you can.

289
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,480
To trust a demon is to distrust humanity.

290
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,960
Thank you, John.

291
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,720
Is JPS being literal?

292
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Are you still like really, really into this guidance, my bud?

293
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,320
This is so fucking fresh.

294
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,240
A secret kept with a demon is a marriage based off of Joe versus the Vulcan.

295
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:12,800
Yes.

296
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, okay, okay.

297
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,560
I think of radio.

298
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,520
It finds music in the apparently empty air.

299
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,800
Some people are like that too, picking up what is invisible.

300
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,600
Do you listen for what is not quite said?

301
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,320
Or do you pretend that the surface of life is its substance?

302
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,800
Speak to me of what you wordlessly discern.

303
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,480
Super loud bong noise.

304
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:38,960
Thank you.

305
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,320
And then it says here, huge bong rip.

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,720
Okay.

307
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
In all caps.

308
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay, I want to stop, but like-

309
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,320
Thank you, John.

310
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,760
Get on to this account.

311
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,160
Yeah, sure.

312
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,120
Uh, so-

313
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,040
Get a follow going real quick.

314
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,080
If you had a kangaroo pouch, what would you mainly put in it?

315
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,000
Justin, Travis told a joke.

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,920
Can you fucking believe it on standing day?

317
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay, the number one thing I would put in it is tokens and tickets at Billy Bob's Wonderland.

318
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,000
Because you walk around, you have a huge mountain of tokens because it only makes sense to buy them

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,720
in bulk.

320
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
You don't nickel and dime yourself $5 here, $10 here.

321
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,640
You spend $20 and then you get a lot more bonus tokens, right?

322
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,400
You get that and you fill that in one pocket and then you start getting these wads of tickets.

323
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,240
If you're like me and you're putting in the money and the time and the hard hours-

324
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,840
And the skill.

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,880
The skill, thank you, Travis, because it's not gambling.

326
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,080
It's a talent.

327
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,520
And you start getting these piles of tickets and where do you put them on?

328
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,960
Also, by the way, your kid wants you to hold their Slurpee.

329
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
What, do I have three hands?

330
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,400
No, but you got a belly pouch.

331
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,120
I got a pouch.

332
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,920
I do have a belly.

333
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,280
Put that in Papa's pouch.

334
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,840
Put those tickets in Papa's pouch.

335
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,920
I, you know, those times made me jealous when they used to.

336
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't think they do this anymore, but casinos used to give out big plastic cups

337
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,280
that you could put all your quarters and stuff in.

338
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,560
They should have those at Billy Bob's and similar arcades for me to collect all my fat wads of

339
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,920
tickets or alternately slice a big slice in my skin in my belly region that I can peel away from.

340
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,840
I want to leave the muscle there because there's tons of it, am I right?

341
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,520
But just peel the skin away and tuck the tokens into my belly.

342
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:32,000
Hey, Trav, your kangaroo pouch is leaking and also it stinks.

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,080
So how long has it, have you done, did you go see a professional about this?

344
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,000
No, I did this myself at home.

345
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,360
Okay, well, it is wet.

346
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,520
It's always wet and it is-

347
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,800
I've ruined these tickets.

348
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,200
Yeah, they are irredeemable.

349
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,360
There's other ruined things that are more like tendons and stuff and it did-

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah, there's sepsis.

351
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,840
Yeah, Griffin, there's sepsis.

352
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,600
This smells miserable too, man.

353
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
This is, I'm trying to eat a pizza pie.

354
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,040
Listen, I'm not proud of what I've done, but it's too late to go back.

355
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,520
Evolution is hard, Griffin, and a man becoming kangaroo,

356
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,520
listen, they said it couldn't be done and in fact, it shouldn't be done.

357
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:17,200
God makes kangaroo, kangaroo makes man, man turns self into kangaroo, kangaroo kills kangaroo,

358
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:24,320
God kills kangaroo, kangaroo, kangaroo inherit the earth.

359
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,600
Yep, there it is.

360
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,800
There it is.

361
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,080
That's exactly what happens.

362
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,000
I think I'd do jelly beans.

363
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,480
How many, how many, hey Griffin, don't make, don't make up a bunch of garbage.

364
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,360
How many jelly beans would you have in there?

365
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,960
How many jelly beans?

366
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,920
How many jelly beans can fit in your pouch?

367
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,680
This is the new hit single.

368
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,560
This is the new hit single from Lizzo.

369
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,680
You know what, guys?

370
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Technically, I have a pouch for jelly beans already.

371
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
It just does one of the dang things.

372
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,840
Are you talking about your urethra?

373
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
No, my belly button.

374
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,520
You mean your belly button, but I want to give back to Justin today.

375
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
What I like to do is put a bunch of jelly beans up there,

376
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,840
but hold in my pee a long time and shoot them all out.

377
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, listen, I got to do something with the butter popcorn ones

378
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
because I'm not fucking eating them.

379
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,520
Honey, I got to get home.

380
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
I'm about to blast this dang jelly bean clean through the windshield

381
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,320
with my ropey flow of urine.

382
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,360
I'm going to fucking knock that can of coke off that fence for old Ronald Reagan.

383
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,160
Got it.

384
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,880
I want to go by your ex-boyfriend's house and show them I got a toasted

385
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,800
marshmallow in there because I'm fucking loco.

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
That's just weird.

387
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,800
I don't care to waste the best jelly belly that there is

388
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
with plugging up my urethra.

389
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,360
I don't care.

390
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,280
That's how I do it.

391
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,240
Oh, I want to sit down so bad.

392
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,520
I know, I know.

393
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
This show is going so good though.

394
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:57,600
Starting.

395
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,480
It's hard to tell.

396
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,640
It's not hard to tell.

397
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
I feel the power of this show.

398
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Okay?

399
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
Don't be like that.

400
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
Okay, it's only been like 20 minutes.

401
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
I know that is one thing that I will say.

402
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,080
There is definitely some time dilation curry.

403
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm saying yes, yeah.

404
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
I don't know that it's like that for the listener.

405
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,000
No, they're loving.

406
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,680
They're like loving it because the power of our standing energy

407
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,520
is being siphoned into the show and enhancing their sitting.

408
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:25,840
Right.

409
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,880
Listener, if you and Solidarity have tried to stand for the entirety of this program so far,

410
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,160
please don't be a hero.

411
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,640
It sucks, yeah.

412
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
21, 22 minutes.

413
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,840
It's all too much for 15, however much Griffin has cut out.

414
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,280
It's all too much for any one person to be standing.

415
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
I think I'm gonna have to do some like freestyle yoga over here.

416
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's the weird, that's what will fuck you up though.

417
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,280
Think about this though.

418
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,120
There will be moments in that time that we have been standing that Griffin will cut out.

419
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,960
That will have done nothing for us.

420
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Yeah.

421
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,240
Like, you know what I mean?

422
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,280
We just stood for nothing.

423
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,400
Yeah, I'm gonna have to do some real soul searching about the pudding jelly beans and

424
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,520
your ding-a-long.

425
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,160
If you cut that, cut that, then what will our next book be titled?

426
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,280
I have another question here.

427
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,600
Starting last year, I work a seasonal job in the fall.

428
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
Wow, this is a lot of time dilations.

429
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,200
Yeah, we're in the wormhole right now.

430
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,040
We can't fucking do this math.

431
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,760
Hi, it's me, Chris Nolan, and my dad in the future went back.

432
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,960
Starting last year, I work a seasonal job in the fall.

433
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,960
I work in the kitchen area where we serve plain, sugared, and glazed donuts.

434
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,040
One day, while working, a fellow employee interrupted me while I was telling a customer

435
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,040
that we did not serve powdered donuts, saying that it was like a secret menu item.

436
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,440
She went in the back and came back with two powdered donuts.

437
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,160
I had never seen an employee do that before.

438
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,320
I never saw anyone do it again.

439
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,040
Brothers, what do I do if a customer asks me for a powdered donut?

440
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,280
Do I go into the back and attempt to make a powdered donut?

441
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,760
And that's for do not donut.

442
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,160
Hey, y'all, this is Griffin, former TCBY employee.

443
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,160
If you go to a register and ask for something at like a specialty food store like this,

444
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
and you say, I want a powdered donut, daddy.

445
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,280
And they say, I'll get you a powdered donut.

446
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
And then they walk into the back room and produce something that's not on the menu.

447
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,480
Do not eat that donut, because I'm not saying that they have befouled it,

448
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
but I'm just saying they didn't not befoul it.

449
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,400
The odds of befoulement are rather high.

450
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,360
Why would they have a secret menu item at their three donut restaurant?

451
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,680
Unless they have many, many donut options and you just kind of have to guess,

452
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,480
and it's like a fun mystery every time you go inside.

453
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,480
Because it means they have the powdered sugar, and they have plain donuts.

454
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,960
Which means at some point, the discussion was had of,

455
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,920
do you want to increase our stock options by, I don't know,

456
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,720
either 33.3% or 25%, Travis isn't sure how that works out.

457
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,720
No, I'd rather just leave it for a select few with refined palates.

458
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,680
Welcome to Dunkin' Donuts, it's the name of it.

459
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,400
We just put a question mark at the end of our franchise.

460
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,200
Powdered donuts are-

461
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
You've got to come to our donut shop and see if you can stump us with donuts.

462
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
See if we can make, the answer is probably no.

463
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,480
Here's the thing y'all, powdered donuts are the fucking pits.

464
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,320
If you're a parent, my daughter is obsessed with these things, the baby one.

465
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,360
Obsessed with these things, these fucking little powdered donuts.

466
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,080
It's hell, they just start touching it to everything.

467
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,120
Their clothes are ruined, the couch is ruined, their mouth is ruined.

468
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,040
It's a hell dessert, and it shouldn't be on sale to anybody.

469
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,360
And I'm sorry, I don't even think you should be eating that.

470
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,080
What's that all over your hands? Are you a grown up?

471
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,000
You're not, not with a powdered donut, you're not.

472
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
You're not, not with a powdered donut, you're not.

473
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,480
Not only that, but I believe that powdered donuts are the closest I've ever come to being poisoned.

474
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,600
Because when you take a bite of them, just like particulate, goes flying into your throat.

475
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,480
And no, like, it is, it's like a trick.

476
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,080
Nobody's like, nobody's like, I'll be happy to sign the big merger.

477
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,920
Let me finish this super sloppy powdered donut.

478
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,600
Simply not done.

479
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,440
Oh boy, this fucking standing energy is giving me some sass.

480
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Because I want to just be like, ask your coworker how they did that.

481
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,040
Just ask, I don't know why you're asking us, go ask.

482
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,320
If they have sugar and a food processor or a blender or something.

483
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,440
Just chomp it right up, yeah.

484
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,800
It just chomps it right up, right?

485
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,080
They do like a special thing, a treat, they'll do a special treat.

486
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,400
But why? It's not on the menu.

487
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:52,800
What's the benefit of doing the extra work to make an off menu item for some rando customer?

488
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,080
Because you're going the extra fucking mile.

489
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,840
For those donut tips.

490
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,880
Have you ever seen the movie Big Daddy?

491
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,200
Yes.

492
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,160
You do ask him, you do ask him every episode, Justin.

493
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,200
I'm going to have this conversation again, Justin.

494
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
There's a scene where they go into McDonald's, right?

495
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,360
And they've stopped selling breakfast, but his child really wants breakfast.

496
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,720
Not his child, a child.

497
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
As Griffin also points out every episode,

498
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,120
he's not technically his big daddy through most of the film.

499
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
No, no, Justin, no technically about it.

500
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,440
He's not related, has no legal claim over this child.

501
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
I think at the end he adopts him, right?

502
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:43,920
No, no.

503
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,520
It's been a while since I've seen the movie.

504
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
He does not.

505
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,440
He goes to John Stewart and lives with John Stewart.

506
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,000
I haven't seen it, but in the trailer for the movie Big Daddy,

507
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,600
he wants to get in McDonald's and the people at McDonald's say, no, it's too late.

508
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,240
No, you kidnapped this child, I'm calling the police.

509
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,320
They won't make it for him.

510
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,800
And what I'm saying is if they had said, all right, no problem, just this once,

511
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,600
a McMuffin for the boy, if they had done that,

512
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,800
this would be Adam Sandler's number one McDonald's spot.

513
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
You would have a customer for life, though.

514
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
That's how you move up in the ladder.

515
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,520
No, no, no, this is what they don't tell you.

516
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
Because if you make that McMuffin once for Adam Sandler,

517
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
you'll always have to make that McMuffin for Adam Sandler.

518
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
We gotta just-

519
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,880
Are you talking about McMuffin creep?

520
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,560
Because he comes in then, he came in at 10.03 the first time and he rolls in at 10.17.

521
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,000
But you made the McMuffin for the boy before, why?

522
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Pretty soon the whole company at McDonald's has to change their policy to offer breakfast all day

523
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,840
because Adam Sandler won't stop coming in at 12.56 asking for a fucking egg McMuffin.

524
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Boy, I love you, boys.

525
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,560
I really love you, boys.

526
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,240
But are you both under the impression that every Adam Sandler movie

527
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,920
is secretly filmed without him knowing it

528
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,960
and takes place in the real world, unscripted?

529
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
And so when he went to this McDonald's,

530
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:14,000
if the scene, which is to say reality, had gone a different way,

531
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,760
then this would be famous actor-comedian Adam Sandler's new favorite McDonald's.

532
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,260
Yes.

533
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm saying, I'm taking that as a microcosm for treating your customers right.

534
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
No, but I am saying that this is a weird kind of punked hidden camera scenario

535
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,360
where they just keep filming movies around Adam Sandler.

536
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,680
Sweet Justin, the alternative is that there would be a scene in Big Daddy where he's like,

537
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,520
oh, it's 10.03, can I please give him a McMuffin?

538
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,040
No, please, it's for the kid.

539
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,920
Yeah, okay.

540
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,880
And they eat the breakfast and Adam Sandler walks out the door like,

541
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,120
this is my new favorite McDonald's.

542
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Yeah, that's a very good point.

543
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,360
But if Travis is right, then explain, don't mess with the Zoan, you know what I mean?

544
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,240
Listen, that was a dark time for Adam Sandler.

545
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,440
That wasn't Adam Sandler, that was Zoan.

546
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,560
No, that was Adam Sandler.

547
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,560
Okay, but like, why, if you didn't know he was in a movie.

548
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,680
Why would he be Zoan?

549
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,880
It was Halloween!

550
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,280
He didn't know he was in a movie, why was he Zoan?

551
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,320
For Halloween?

552
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:12,820
Yeah.

553
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,960
Ah, shit, there's multiple Adam Sandlers like in The Prestige.

554
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,320
That's it.

555
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,000
Have you ever seen Jet Li's The One?

556
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
Cause I did a long time ago and it's like that.

557
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,360
The Prestige.

558
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,040
That bit felt like it was 40 minutes long.

559
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,920
It feels like I should be like, that's the end of the podcast.

560
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Thank you for enjoying it.

561
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,120
But no, it is time for us to briefly head into the Money Zone.

562
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:50,880
So let's head over there and see what's cooking.

563
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,320
Oh, look at what's cooking.

564
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm gonna go get a soda, I'll be right back.

565
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,520
Oh, this is so appropriate.

566
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
It's a, what a good transition talking about what's cooking

567
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,360
because our first sponsor is Stitch Fix.

568
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,560
I gotta go get a soda, stop talking.

569
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,040
Well, Jet Li, there's no time to stop talking cause we need to talk about Stitch Fix.

570
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,840
If you're cooking up some clothes for dinner-

571
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,240
Are you stirring up a big pot of clothes?

572
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,920
Are you pan frying some jorts and you, so now you need more clothes because you've cooked-

573
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,840
Sauteing some socks, perhaps?

574
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,280
That's a mistake.

575
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,080
Don't, well, I'm not here to kink shame you, but I am gonna tell you that if you've eaten,

576
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
cooked and eaten all your clothes and Stitch Fix is gonna help you get that,

577
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,440
get that closet, that wardrobe back on point in an easy, stylish, no hassles way.

578
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,960
We all use Stitch Fix.

579
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,240
When I see that box sitting on my doorstep after a long day at the Mines

580
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
and I come home and I see that box on my doorstep, I get so excited to see the clothes inside

581
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,720
because I know that I have worked with a personal stylist, told them what I liked,

582
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,560
and then they have chosen some stuff for me and it's good stuff and I only pay for what I keep

583
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,160
and the $20 styling fee for finding those clothes is automatically applied

584
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,240
towards anything I keep from the box.

585
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,560
It is a real good, real good service.

591
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,000
Griffin, can I ask you a question?

592
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Sure.

593
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,440
You ever bought anything online?

594
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,760
That's, that's just part one of the question.

595
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,120
There's a second part to the question.

596
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,400
Yeah.

597
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,720
Part one, have you ever bought anything online?

598
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
Yeah, man, baseball trophy.

599
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,120
Okay.

600
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,600
Couldn't get one the usual way.

601
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,240
Yes.

602
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,240
When you bought that baseball trophy, did you perhaps find out later that

603
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,960
somewhere else was selling it on a discount and you paid full price for it like a dummy?

604
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,400
I paid $4,500 for my baseball trophy, so like I now know with hindsight that I was snookered.

605
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,960
You know, if you had used Honey, which is a free browser add-on that finds you the best deals

606
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,800
online and applies the best deals at checkout, you could have saved money.

607
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,960
You could have saved money, you dummy, because they find discounts and coupons across 37,000 sites,

608
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,120
including Amazon Best Buy and more.

609
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:28,240
So if you're looking to buy baseball trophies or really any kind of trophies, bowling trophies,

610
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,120
billiards trophies, maybe darts championships, World's Best Dad, dog show trophies,

611
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,680
powerlifting trophies.

612
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,880
That's all of them.

613
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,920
That's it.

614
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,720

619
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,320
I feel like I'm sweating so much.

620
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,400
Hi, I'm Dave.

621
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,360
Hi, I'm Graham.

622
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,000
And we're two house DJs who have been trapped inside our drum machine.

623
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,160
We love it here and we'd love if you stopped by and visited us every week on Stop Podcasting

624
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,960

625
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,000
We're just a couple of doofuses from Canada and listen to our show or perish.

626
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,080
Stop podcasting yourself on MaximumFun.org.

627
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,800
Okay, here's one.

628
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,160
I work for a large retailer in Cincinnati and back in November, I was promoted to assistant

629
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,040
store manager.

630
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,840
I went through training and started in a new store.

631
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,000
I've been working the new store for the past five months.

632
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,680
Today, I received an email that said they reviewed my application and decided to pursue

633
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,120
other candidates.

634
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,960
Did I just get passive slash aggressively get fired?

635
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,920
And that's from, should I go to work tomorrow?

636
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,560
You know who I am gonna ask about this?

637
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,060
Who?

638
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,200
Laura Dale.

639
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,160
Let me see if I have-

640
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:23,840
Well, that's gonna set a pretty wild precedent, right?

641
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
I guess we can address it with Laura once she's on the call.

642
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,120
Oh, I'm here.

643
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm on the call.

644
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
What's happened?

645
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,640
Yeah, sorry.

646
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,920
I beeped in on another call so you didn't hear it ring.

647
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:41,840
Laura was waiting by the phone and then presciently knew that her campaign had paid off.

648
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,480
Yeah, I just, you know, I had a real sense that like, now's the time.

649
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,920
Advice is needed.

650
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,420
Go.

651
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,080
This is the moment.

652
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,840
What's it like, Laura, to be the only person to get to cash in that chip to start to hoist

653
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,040
us on our own petard to be on our show?

654
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,640
To be the one person that did the goof of, hey, if the boys can just confidently say

655
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,680
they're gonna be on a thing and get on the thing, I can do that to get on their thing?

656
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah.

657
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,560
Here's the thing, it would have worked with literally anyone, Laura.

658
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,480
I'm glad it was someone we like and treasure,

659
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,800
because it wouldn't work with anybody because it's only gonna work once.

660
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, it's done.

661
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
This is it.

662
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,800
When I did my Laura K. Buzz will be on my brother, my brother and me, I had a bunch

663
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,880
of people tweet and go, wouldn't it be funny if I did that to get on your podcast?

664
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,640
I was like, do it then.

665
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,200
Oh, shit.

666
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,440
That is how it works, you have to keep paying it backward.

667
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,320
Has anybody done the Joe Rogan one yet?

668
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
Don't you think?

669
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,560
Get on there, plug our show, steal some of his audience, now we're the Rogans.

670
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,880
Laura, did you hear the question that I read before you answered?

671
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,880
The question just came into my mind like some wonderful premonition,

672
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,320
and I have advice for you.

673
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm glad that you realized I was the person for this.

674
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,120
So this person thinks that like, that, you know, they've been passive aggressively fired.

675
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,920
I disagree.

676
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,400
I think they're unfirable now.

677
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,520
I don't think you can fire someone who you never hired.

678
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,680
They're in some like weird, they're a glitch in the matrix now.

679
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,600
They are just, you can't fire me, you never hired me.

680
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,240
Who am I?

681
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,040
I don't know.

682
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,360
I'm a ghost in the machine.

683
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Yeah, you don't have to show up for work, you don't have to do your responsibility.

684
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,560
You don't have to do your responsibilities because if they try and fire you say,

685
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,000
fire who?

686
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,880
Laura, there is one issue there, and that is if the paychecks do not come.

687
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,920
And that was my question.

688
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,120
If you're not hired, have you been getting paychecks for the last five months?

689
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,280
Because if the answer to that is no, my follow up question is more of a statement,

690
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,560
and it's boy, you sure like Best Buy, huh?

691
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,880
You sure like the work there, huh?

692
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,800
Well, I'm assuming, let's say that you have been being paid for the last few months,

693
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
but you haven't been hired.

694
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,480
Can you go talk to your bosses and go,

695
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,480
hey, you know, Tom, who we didn't hire, you know, five months ago,

696
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
and we really, you know, we thought about it hard and we didn't hire Tom.

697
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,280
I think that's a huge mistake.

698
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,920
I think we should hire Tom so that you can get paid for doing the job twice.

699
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,720
Are you saying that you should use your sway

700
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,360
as an employee of the company to get yourself hired?

701
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,720
Yeah, I think you should use your position as assistant manager to get yourself hired.

702
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,360
You could use yourself as a reference.

703
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,040
I actually have a close dear friend that works there already, it's me.

704
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah, and then you can be two assistant store managers,

705
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
which you add them up, that outranks the manager.

706
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,240
You are also then unstoppable because if you answer only to yourself,

707
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:45,600
like I am my own assistant manager and my assistant manager is myself,

708
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:50,560
then I'm pretty sure you can just like restructure the whole company at that point.

709
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,560
And when someone's like, who said you could do this?

710
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,920
Be like, my manager.

711
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,360
I'm like, who's your manager?

712
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,000
Like me, I'm my own assistant manager.

713
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,560
The old manager forged a recursive power loop that I exploited

714
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,920
and now have become, I am Galactus now, so.

715
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,480
I used to work at a telemarketing place that would have a bonus that you would get paid

716
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,560
if you brought a friend in and they got hired there.

717
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,840
That should have been a tip off that that was a bad job, huh?

718
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,120
Now that I'm thinking about it, in retrospect,

719
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,600
that should have been a pretty big red flag.

720
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,640
You know, that happens a lot.

721
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,880
Because I've worked so many retail jobs in my life, I still have that retail stink

722
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,080
that when I am just walking around any retail store, no matter how I am dressed,

723
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,280
at least once I will be asked, do you work here?

724
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,480
No matter what I'm doing.

725
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
But there's just something about me that gives off the vibe of like,

726
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
this is someone who should work here.

727
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,800
It might be that.

728
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,880
There were lots of people who worked at Best Buy with me

729
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,440
whose names I did not and will not know.

730
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,320
So are you suggesting that maybe like the on paper resume was terrible,

731
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,160
but in person, Jimothy showed up and was just like,

732
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,880
oh, don't you seem like you would work here?

733
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,080
Here's your paycheck.

734
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,480
Travis is suggesting that both he and Jimothy possess a retail-esque frame.

735
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,760
A body, a carriage that just seems to-

736
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,240
Maybe it's Travis's broad shoulders or thick hands.

737
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,760
It might not be my gait.

738
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,600
I might have a retail gait.

739
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,520
If you were a stranger to me and I was at the Staples

740
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,840
and I saw your thick hands reaching for a big thing of paper,

741
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,600
I would just assume like those hands have been thickened by paper lifting

742
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,040
and you are an employee here.

743
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,240
That's an employee who knows his way around a crate.

744
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,040
Look at those hands.

745
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,440
Those are crate hands and they will be right.

746
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,760
Hey, Laura, is it true?

747
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Are the rumors true that you have a book coming out this week?

748
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,080
I do have a book coming out this week and I'm mildly terrified.

749
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,080
You've all done books before.

750
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,040
I don't know how you do it.

751
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,600
It's a lot, books.

752
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,760
Laura, here's one of the prime ones that I've learned.

753
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,520
When somebody says you have a book coming out,

754
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,080
that is a good time to say the name of the book so people can buy it.

755
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,560
Hey, uncomfortable labels.

756
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,440
It's a book about being trans and on the autism spectrum

757
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,920
and how that's really common, but no one talks about it.

758
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,720
And it's coming out on July 18th and it's in book places

759
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,000
and you should all check it out.

760
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,160
Oh, we've got a book coming out this week too?

761
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,360
Buy them both.

762
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,200
Get a two for it.

763
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
I've heard that they are good companion books.

764
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,360
Yeah, exactly.

765
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,520
If you don't buy both of them, then you're missing out

766
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,040
on some of the secret special lore of the Adventure Zone.

767
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,720
You got an ARG that kind of weaves between both of them.

768
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
See if you can solve it.

769
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,480
Yeah, if you check the same page numbers in both books,

770
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,600
you can crack the code and find out who Angus McDonald really is.

771
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,120
Yes, that is true.

772
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,520
The books do share a lot of similar words.

773
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,040
I wish people could say stuff like that on one of our podcasts

774
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,280
and me not have an actual panic attack.

775
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,000
Laura, this book is available this week on July 18th.

776
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,880
Please go buy it.

777
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,480
Laura, congratulations on your extensive campaign

778
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,360
to get on our show and its success.

779
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Please close the door behind you on your way out.

780
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,680
I'm glad I didn't have to pull the shout at Sydney

781
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,280
until she lets me be on card because that was ready to go.

782
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,680
Yeah, it was lined up.

783
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
Yeah, please lock the door on your way out and then burn it

784
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,560
and then put bricks over the door.

785
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,000
This door never existed.

786
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,000
This has been great, but never, no one else.

787
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,640
Never again.

788
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,240
You can come back through the door,

789
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,400
but others can't follow your lead.

790
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,800
It's like the wardrobe in Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.

791
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,120
It might not work the same again, you know?

792
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,200
Maybe you'll end up on Joe Rogan's show.

793
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,840
Joe Rogan is Mr. Tumnus in this scenario.

794
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,680
He's a very Tumnus-esque figure

795
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,760
as he's been described numerous times.

796
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,680
Laura, Kate Dale, thank you for your time

797
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,120
and your treasured insight.

798
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,920
Thank you so much.

799
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,080
Hey, I've got another Yahoo.

800
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,680
Is Justin back from Sodatown?

801
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh yeah, whoa!

802
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,400
Rip it, grip it, and drip it, baby.

803
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,640
Right down your soda hole.

804
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,280
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

805
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,760
Oh man, dude, I got a dry soda hole.

806
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,280
Yeah, thanks Merritt.

807
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,800
If only there was some way I could moisten my soda hole.

808
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,520
Yeah, that was a funny thing that I said.

809
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,880
This has been our My Brother, My Brother, Me fan cast.

810
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,480
Shit, Merritt Palmer sent this in.

811
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,040
Thank you, Merritt.

812
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
It's anonymous Yahoo Answers user.

813
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,200
I'm going to call Ronnie asks,

814
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,880
was this woman at the vets rude?

815
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,800
There's a comma in there.

816
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,960
Was this woman at the vets rude?

817
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,920
Took my cat for his usual injections.

818
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,120
And when I get there,

819
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,080
this woman was sat in the waiting room with her two dogs.

820
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,440
She looked at my cat in his carrier and said to her dogs,

821
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,920
there you go, boys, some nice lunch for you.

822
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,960
Okay, that's the end of the question.

823
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,320
Was that rude?

824
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,640
Was this woman at the vets rude?

825
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,320
Because she gave the boys a nice lunch?

826
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,440
Justin, I think the implication there is that

827
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,360
she was encouraging her dogs to eat

828
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,840
the question askers cat, elf style.

829
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,320
How is that?

830
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,640
Cartoons have taught me that the dog hates the cat.

831
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,720
Does the dog want to eat the cat?

832
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,000
Because I don't know that I've ever seen

833
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,800
or heard that necessarily happen.

834
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,360
Yeah, there's never that scene, right?

835
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,200
So what's the issue?

836
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,080
Well, the cat eat the mouse for sure.

837
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,040
Yes, we know this.

838
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,960
Yes, seen this, yes, happens.

839
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,640
And I believe in the circle of life,

840
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,400
something has to eat the cat.

841
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,600
And it might not be the dog,

842
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,680
but I think the dog is just the next size up.

843
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,040
And it would be weird if,

844
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,920
it would be weird if in like cartoon shorthand,

845
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,120
everyone understood like,

846
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,800
well, yes, cats eat mice and horses eat cats.

847
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,840
Like that would be weird.

848
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,760
There has to be some steps between there,

849
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,280
a little old lady style.

850
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,400
Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

851
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,040
And I'm looking at it now, and boy, this feels weird.

852
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,640
Because I think we've probably talked about this before.

853
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,040
But she does swallow the dog to get the cat.

854
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,840
Yes.

855
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,200
Is she expecting the dog to chase the cat out of her?

856
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,120
Because I don't think this dog's gonna eat the,

857
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,040
I think you could have found a better animal.

858
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,600
Does she, she saws the spider to catch the fly.

859
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,880
I don't know why she did that.

860
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,160
I don't know why she swallowed that fly.

861
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,600
But she swallowed the cat to catch the rat,

862
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,800
to catch the spider to catch,

863
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,120
and then she swallowed the dog to get the job, right?

864
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:38,960
What?

865
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,760
What?

866
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,480
She swallowed the dog for the vine.

867
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,320
She swallowed a goat to get the dog.

868
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,360
She swallowed a cow for the vine.

869
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,080
Vine too.

870
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,600
That was also for the vine.

871
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,080
She swallowed the horse to impress Terry Crews

872
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,280
on America's Got Talent.

873
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,280
This old lady loses the fucking plot.

874
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,320
I got a fly in me.

875
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,600
Let's get the spider to get that.

876
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,400
I got a spider in me.

877
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,120
Let's get a bird.

878
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,000
So far so good.

879
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,560
I got a cat.

880
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,360
I got a bird in me.

881
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,160
Cat, get in there.

882
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,200
You know what's up.

883
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
Dog, now it's your turn to go get the cat.

884
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:10,880
All right.

885
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,720
Goat, go get this dog.

886
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,160
Goat's like, are you sure?

887
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,660
Whoa!

888
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,040
I will say a dog's not kind of my natural food.

889
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,920
Whoa!

890
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,760
Hey cow, you're bigger than a goat.

891
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,200
Get in there and eat it.

892
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:23,920
That's not real.

893
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,420
Whoa!

894
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,220
Horse, you're smaller than a cow,

895
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,500
but I've completely just sort of lost the roadmap here.

896
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,140
Do you think at that point,

897
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,620
the goat and the cow and the horse got in there

898
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,140
and looked at the dog and the dog was like,

899
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,180
what are you all going to do?

900
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,540
And they're like, we don't even know.

901
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:43,540
She should have swallowed like a shark or a T-Rex or something.

902
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,380
So anyway, is that rude?

903
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,220
I don't, I have, I am, I no longer have a pet,

904
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,780
but I have, I've had this situation,

905
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,620
not this exact situation,

906
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:59,860
but like in the waiting room of the vet is,

907
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,140
there's some weird etiquette that I don't necessarily know.

908
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:04,260
Okay, go on.

909
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,140
Well, the number one thing is that I don't give a shit

910
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,140
about most people's pets.

911
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,260
And that's just the truth.

912
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,620
Yeah, especially mine.

913
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,980
I have noticed that, yeah.

914
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,020
Yeah, and so that's just the truth

915
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,460
and that's the truth of the matter.

916
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,460
But like, if you sit down next to me

917
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,580
and you got a little pupper dog

918
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,180
and the pupper dog wants to interface

919
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,220
with one of your pets, I don't know how to deal with that.

920
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,780
Cause I don't want, I don't necessarily want that, I think.

921
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:30,500
The only time, the only time that I ever get

922
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,740
a little befuddled at any kind of vet

923
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,020
or any kind of animal daycare thing

924
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,860
is when I see something with their animal

925
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,380
and their animal is just going bonkers,

926
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,900
just like losing it.

927
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,700
And the person is sitting there completely calm and stoic

928
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,740
and like not reacting to their animals,

929
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,740
just like, get me out of here.

930
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,740
Like, and I want to be like, hey,

931
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,940
I don't think they're cool right now.

932
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,020
Like, even my dog will sit there with me

933
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
and go like, are they okay?

934
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:02,820
What is wrong?

935
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:07,540
And then I'll see somebody bring in like a bird

936
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,460
and I'll just look at him like, really?

937
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,180
You'll look at the bird?

938
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,580
I'll look at the person and be like, really?

939
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,780
You need to fix them up.

940
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,500
There's a bird, there's lots of.

941
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,940
Why so serious?

942
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,620
Let's put a smile on that face.

943
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,580
I'm just saying, there's lots of birds out of nature

944
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,740
and they don't need doctors to live.

945
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,260
I'm just a dog chasing a car.

946
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,140
Literally.

947
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,180
I'm just a dog chasing a cat to eat it, I guess.

948
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,860
And then the cat is chasing a bird, I guess.

949
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,780
And the bird is going after a spider.

950
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,340
I'm just a dog running away from a goat.

951
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,940
In an old lady's intestines.

952
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,940
You want to know how I got these scars?

953
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,780
I was eating a large German shepherd.

954
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,340
To get well together.

955
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,380
Let me start over.

956
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,580
Let me start at the beginning.

957
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,100
So there was this old lady, right?

958
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,500
All right, so I'm an old lady also.

959
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:28,100
And my nephew keeps egging me on with these vine pranks.

960
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,540
You want to see a magic trick?

961
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,580
Want to see a magic trick?

962
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:40,340
I have a Shetland pony inside my burrk.

963
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,980
Why, you sounds bad.

964
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,020
Because I've been standing for 40 minutes, Mr. Joker.

965
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:55,780
I've been standing for so long and I want to be an agent of chaos like you,

966
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,020
but I had to stand the whole time.

967
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,700
This sucks.

968
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:10,660
You think if you're a veterinarian and someone walks in with a parrot,

969
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,340
you're like, oh, tell them we're closed.

970
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,500
You deal with cats and dogs every day.

971
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,620
You're good at those.

972
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:20,900
You feel comfortable.

973
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,820
You feel confident dealing with a cat.

974
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,380
How often do you deal like a session?

975
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,140
Maybe you're like a small town vet.

976
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,740
If somebody brings in a big fancy bird, you're like, I'm going to fuck that up.

977
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,820
I haven't done parrots in like 23 years.

978
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,660
Please don't ask me anything about parrots.

979
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,100
This is my pet octopus.

980
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,740
Oh, boy.

981
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,260
Okay, I think I can.

982
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,060
I feel like I have a little bit of a margin of error.

983
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,100
Let me make this argument as a vet, okay?

984
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,420
Okay, I think as a veterinarian, you shouldn't work on animals

985
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,940
that you could feed to other animals you work on.

986
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,700
That seems insane to me, right?

987
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,620
But the little old lady scenario, Justin, that could be anything.

988
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,500
That's anything, yeah.

989
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,500
That's a good point, I guess.

990
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,780
When pushed to their limits, any animal can eat any other animal.

991
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:15,700
I think I'm just saying, listen, this is my hot take.

992
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,460
I think doctors have it easy.

993
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,860
Doctors only got to work on one species.

994
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,100
True.

995
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,060
Veterinarians got to work on like all the other ones.

996
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:26,820
Hey, doctors, fucking share the load with the veterinarians.

997
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,860
Yes, they do.

998
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,860
Veterinarians now do dogs, cats, and that's it.

999
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,780
And doctors, you're still going to do people,

1000
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,380
but now you also have birds.

1001
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,100
Let's start-

1002
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,780
Birds and maybe horses.

1003
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:38,340
No, no, no, no.

1004
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,700
Because there's like farm vets that specialize in horses.

1005
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,500
True, true, true.

1006
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,220
Farm doctors.

1007
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,580
Farm doctors!

1008
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:51,700
I'm just saying, first step, the first step towards a more equal sort of situation,

1009
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,140
veterinarians give birds to the doctors.

1010
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,700
Yes.

1011
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,900
Every hospital is now also a bird hospital.

1012
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,500
And you know what, I'll say this, maybe there's some light stuff with humans,

1013
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,940
you can let vets take care of that.

1014
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,460
Now, I feel like you're losing the spirit of the arrangement we're trying to solve.

1015
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,500
But then if there's like a really big dog, that can go to doctors.

1016
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,100
Okay.

1017
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,860
We'll find a balance, we'll get there.

1018
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:20,820
So you think case by case, Travis's new job is for every hospital in the country,

1019
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,940
deciding if the patient is going to go to doctor, hospital, or veterinarian hospital.

1020
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,300
I'm saying that this is my new hit series that I'm pitching in BC,

1021
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,700
where it is a combination hospital and veterinarian hospital.

1022
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,140
And there's some drama, but definitely more on one side than the other.

1023
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,340
Okay, okay.

1024
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,620
I just want to see the break room where veterinarians and doctors compare notes

1025
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,940
and like, yeah, I also had a tough one today.

1026
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,380
A dog ate a Lego man.

1027
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:51,060
Should we end the show?

1028
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,020
I feel like that's a tough, it's tough for us to answer that fairly, isn't it?

1029
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:56,820
Yes.

1030
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,140
It is.

1031
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:57,860
In this moment.

1032
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:03,620
I just rolled my office chair over my toes, so I don't really like to end the show.

1033
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,540
Think about how good the sitting will be.

1034
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,780
It's going to be so good.

1035
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,220
The sitting will be good and it'll be well-earned, I would say.

1036
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,860
I keep doing stuff, like lifting my shirt up to like vent it and like, you know, scratching.

1037
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,060
And then I realized that I have a big open patio door behind me

1038
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,620
and people can see my stuff and I don't like that.

1039
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,580
We love it.

1040
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:27,620
I at some point in recording, and I can't remember why, put on a second belt,

1041
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,340
but not through the belt loops, just wrapped it around my hip.

1042
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,100
All right, we're all doing some unconscious stuff, yeah.

1043
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:43,220
Yeah, I want to say a big thank you to Laura Kate Dale for coming onto our podcast.

1044
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,020
Bullying her way on, I think it's fair.

1045
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,860
Like in a healthy way.

1046
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,580
Healthy bullying.

1047
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,860
In a healthy, productive way.

1048
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,140
Uncomfortable Labels is the name of Laura's book.

1049
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:54,740
Go buy it now.

1050
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:58,900
Also, if you could this week, please buy our book,

1051
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,820
The Adventure Zone, volume two, Murder on the Rockport Limited,

1052
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,460
which maybe the volume two is probably at the end or it may not even have it.

1053
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,980
There's a two in there, probably somewhere,

1054
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,460
but it's The Adventure Zone, Murder on the Rockport Limited.

1055
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,380
If you, it helps us the most if you buy it this first week,

1056
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,420
because it's, I don't know, book sales are weird and archaic,

1057
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,900
but if you could buy it this week, that would be great.

1058
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,980
And I think it's a really fun book.

1059
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,980
If you've read the first one, you know that it's good,

1060
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,500
and this one's on a train, so.

1061
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,420
Even better, even better.

1062
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:31,380
If you can, maybe go to your local bookstore, see if they're getting in, check with them.

1063
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,500
Check with them.

1064
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,820
Yeah, buy up all those copies, tell them to get more.

1065
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,940
Speaking of comic books, this week is also San Diego Comic Con,

1066
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,500
which we are going to be at with various different events and stuff.

1067
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:49,700
If you want to see the events, I'm sure we'll have it up on McElroy.family at some point,

1068
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,260
but you can also go to my brand new revamped TravisMcElroy.com and right there.

1069
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,300
Here he goes.

1070
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,020
All right.

1071
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,820
Click on the schedule.

1072
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,780
Also, the Cincinnati Underground Society Show,

1073
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,020
which I don't talk often about on the podcast,

1074
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,340
but it's a semi-regular show we do here in Cincinnati.

1075
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,140
We're now offering lifetime memberships for it

1076
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,020
that come with a bunch of other really cool swag and benefits and stuff.

1077
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,060
You can buy those also on TravisMcElroy.com.

1078
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,340
And I just realized we forgot to talk about, along with the book coming out,

1079
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,940
we're doing book tour.

1080
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,260
Yeah.

1081
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,220
We're coming to New York, Austin, LA.

1082
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:25,700
Portland.

1083
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,700
Portland's already sold out, but we will be in Portland.

1084
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,420
We'll see you there.

1085
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,260
LA, and I think San Diego's sold out too.

1086
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,700
Go to McElroy.family.

1087
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,740
Click on tours.

1088
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,660
There's tickets there for the book tour shows.

1089
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,780
Please come to the LA show.

1090
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,580
Please, please, please.

1091
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,540
Yeah, come on.

1092
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,260
Thanks to John.

1093
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,220
Come on, cowards.

1094
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,860
Come on.

1095
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,380
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1096
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,820
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1097
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,340
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1098
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,700
Great album.

1099
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,500
Great song.

1100
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,060
Great website.

1101
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:47,860
Travel a lot right now.

1102
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,740
It looks professional.

1103
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,180
Thank you.

1104
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,540
It was done by Eric Enloe, Courtney Enloe's brother,

1105
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,300
and he did an amazing job.

1106
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,900
I'm really, really pleased with it.

1107
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,220

Got a bunch of new merch, including Monster Factory merch.

Yeah.

1119
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:16,900

It's from Yahoo Answers user, well, shoot.

1126
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:30,580
Darth Beaver, who asks.

1127
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,700
Oh, beans.

1128
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:31,940
Yep.

1129
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:34,820
I went to my first ballet last night.

1130
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,740
What is with all the ladies toe dancing?

1131
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:38,580
Why don't they just hire taller women?

1132
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,580
Why are you just McElroy?

1133
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,700
I'm Griffin McElroy.

For ordinary occasions.

1146
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,580

1147
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,260
