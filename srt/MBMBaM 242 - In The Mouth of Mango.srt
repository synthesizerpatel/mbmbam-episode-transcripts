1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,560
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. I'm very defensive usually of living in West

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,360
Virginia. Why don't you get out of there, people say, um, but I appreciate the pastoral living.

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,400
Is that what you'd call it? I don't think-

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Because of Justin's- Justin's rural lifestyle.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,560
Right, you don't live on or near awe pasture.

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,680
Yeah, it's more pastoral though in nature. That really bit me in the hinder this week though,

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
because my power went out for four days.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,120
For four solid days.

15
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,840
So are we speaking to a ghost now? Because I would literally die. I would literally die.

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,760
I would probably gaslight myself because I would just sit there and go like,

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,800
oh man, power's out, I can't watch TV. That's fine, I'll just play video games. Oh no.

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,920
I used to think that this was a- this was like a- a regular occurrence,

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
and then I told my boss, Chris, who lives in Philadelphia about this,

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,800
and he said, my power went out once for 30 seconds during Hurricane Sandy.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,720
Like, well, okay, I guess that maybe it's not as common a problem.

22
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,240
As opposed to 110 where the mayor sneezes and the power goes out.

23
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,200
Right. Here's the depths of my depravity. This was my lowest moment is I-

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,480
I go to the house on Friday night, I guess it was, and the power is still out,

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,920
and it is fucking freezing. And I walk into the house, the power is out,

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,080
the house is freezing, and there- and the cats are in the house.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,280
And it's so, so cold in there. And I can't get the cats because they're too fast,

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,200
and it's pitch black. So I can't-

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,280
Well, hold on, CJ's not too fast.

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,920
CJ I could've grabbed, but what am I supposed to do? Take one of them,

31
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
the one I like, and let the other one die, it seems to me.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,560
So I'm like, fucking, I gotta do something to help these cats.

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
I don't know what I can do.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
It's like that scene in Pee Wee's Big Adventure, but in reverse.

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,560
In reverse, right. So I wander around the house,

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,320
and I'm like, wait a minute, I got a heater.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,880
And I'm like, downstairs, rummaging through the basement, falling over myself,

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,600
and finally, I get the heater. I find it, and I struggle to carry it upstairs.

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,720
And I go, and I shit you not, I put it in the upstairs hallway, and I plug it in.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,480
And then I just fucking stand there and stare at it for like 30 seconds.

41
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
Like, what have I done? This is literally what happens to me.

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,200
So I do that, I'm like, well, cats are dead, tough titties, I gotta move on with my life.

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
So I go out of the house to, actually, I was gonna go back and retrieve Sidney

44
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,280
to help us get the cats.

45
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,120
So I go out of the car, and I see our next door neighbor

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
lugging a $700 generator into the house.

47
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,800
And as he literally crosses the threshold of his house,

48
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,600
the power comes back on with his generator.

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm like, wow, you did that, because that is something worse

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
happened to somebody else than what just happened to me.

51
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
You had this terrible scenario.

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,240
So he says, I can't believe it, you're welcome.

53
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
I made that happen by buying this generator.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm like, oh, thank God my cats are gonna be okay.

55
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,000
And he said, do you wanna join us for a celebratory post-outage beer?

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,760
I said, no, thank you, I can't.

57
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,360
I have food and a baby and a wife waiting for me back at my in-laws place.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,120
I have to go tell them the good news.

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,840
And I see him literally, I'm just pulling away, right?

60
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
I see him literally clink beer cans with his buddy

61
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,800
who is helping him lug the generator.

62
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,880
I see them literally clink beer cans and the power shuts off.

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,560
I thought you were gonna say clink beer cans with his new buddy,

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
the generator that he purchased.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,760
His new $700 electro friend.

66
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Oh, buddy.

67
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,360
Chappie 2.

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
Now I'm a generator.

69
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,640
We were talking on the phone while you were preparing soup

70
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,800
in a pot that you had positioned over a fireplace.

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
Like some sort of caveman with gas.

72
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,680
You know what?

73
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,040
It was the best bad soup I had ever had.

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,600
You were making fucking goofy movie Hi Dad soup on your cigarette lighter.

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,120
Yeah, it was not pleasant.

76
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
It was not pleasant.

77
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
I could, that was the lowest of low.

78
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,440
Plugging in an electric heater.

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,480
Am I here, cats?

80
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,760
Boy, that was a jarring moment for the cats too.

81
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,480
Like this is the entity that is charged with keeping us from dying.

82
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
This is our lot in life.

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,720
You think the cats are sitting there from the door going,

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,080
no, don't plug it in.

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
Oh, what are you doing?

86
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
Idiots out.

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,300
Idiot.

88
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,400
Come on.

89
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,480
You know what I would have done to keep those kitties warm?

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,440
What?

91
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,480
Just snuggled them.

92
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,080
Snuggle them.

93
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, one of Justin's cats is snuggle averse.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,080
I've never touched one of Justin's cats.

95
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't think anybody has.

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
This has been kitty talk.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,160
This has been kitty talk where you talk about our little bitty kitties.

98
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
Welcome to the little bitty kitty committee.

99
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm Justin McElroy.

100
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,560
I'm Justin Meowcleroy and I love my kitty.

101
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,920
I'm Griffin McElroy, like a grr, like a growl,

102
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
because my kitty's like a lion.

103
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm Travis McElroy.

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,520
My workplace has become prank central.

105
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,480
All the kitties getting in the mischief.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Kitties getting in the milk and mischief.

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,560
Where'd all my sardines go?

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,400
And also all of my accounts.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,840
Oh god, they cleaned me out.

110
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,200
The cat liquidated me.

111
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,600
My workplace has become prank central.

112
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,480
And I just had my coffee spiked with a cup of salt.

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,520
What the fuck?

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
One sip and I thought I was gonna vom on the spot.

115
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,960
Yeah, because that's like what people do to make themselves vom.

116
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,880
My knee-jerk reaction is to go thermonuclear,

117
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,560
but I'd like to keep my job.

118
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,200
What is an appropriate and measured response?

119
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,320
That's from Gmail.

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,480
This is so hard because how do you target the responsible party?

121
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Yeah, that's a good point.

122
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,680
I mean, somebody probably claimed responsibility

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,320
for this ipicac goof that they did on you.

124
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
There's one of two scenarios here.

125
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,600
Scenario one is this is like you work in a good times place,

126
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,320
right, where everybody's everybody's best friend.

127
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,000
Like a good times place.

128
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,120
Like a good times place.

129
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
Travis is suggesting like a fucking startup

130
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,960
with 400 trillion dollars to spare

131
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,320
and so everybody just plays ping pong.

132
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,120
Otherwise you'd be too busy doing goddamn work

133
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,600
to start playing salt in other people's coffee.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,920
So everybody just like pals around all the time

135
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,680
and this is the kind of place where it's like,

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,840
you know what, I just feel like not doing any work

137
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
and just ordering pizzas today, right?

138
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
So maybe it's that kind of place and you don't fit in.

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,760
Where people can just hang out and do whatever.

140
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,560
Right, and be shut down in like nine months.

141
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,200
Work is played, foodie breaks the day.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,160
Yeah, and that's your,

143
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,240
and you're the one who doesn't fit in, right?

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
Because everybody else is like a good time buddy

145
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,720
and you're like, oh guys, can we focus up?

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,720
Or scenario two, this is a place of work.

147
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,640
This is a business where work gets done

148
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,480
and like some fucking, you know, like Tom Green over here,

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,120
some kind of prankster, goofster

150
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
is ruining it for everybody.

151
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,880
And then I think you go to the boss and you narc.

152
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
You just complain so hard.

153
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Oh yeah, yeah.

154
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
You can't, I always hated Jim Halpert on The Office

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
because it's like fucking do anything.

156
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,240
You're being compensated.

157
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,640
You know what the number one like piece

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,160
of workplace theft is?

159
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,200
It's time.

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,880
And when you're fucking goofing constantly

161
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,920
and not hitting the books or those streets

162
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
or the papers or whatever it is you hit

163
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
in whatever job he had,

164
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,440
it's been a while since I've seen the show,

165
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
but just like do some work, dude.

166
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
How do you like sleep at night?

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,920
I mean, he thinks he's so funny with his goofs and such,

168
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,840
but maybe if he committed to his job,

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
he would enjoy it more.

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
He would get more satisfaction out of it

171
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
if he would just do his work and leave that poor Dwight alone.

172
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,840
Dwight's trying to do his work.

173
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,920
He's got some social, you know, issues.

174
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
Maybe he doesn't like get along well with everybody

175
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,760
and he's not your normal fellow.

176
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,040
So he should be tormented for that, Jim?

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,320
Because he takes a pleasure in his craft,

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,920
you fucking dick, Ed.

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,080
Because he likes things like Battlestar Galactica

180
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
and farming.

181
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
So it's your job, Jim Halpert, to just terrorize him.

182
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Congratulations, Jim Halpert.

183
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
You're Twitter, you piece of shit.

184
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,000
You're a terrible person, Jim Halpert.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,680
You and Pam deserve each other.

186
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
In this economy, we have just fallen into a deep pit.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,400
Help me out, Griffin.

188
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,520
I just don't put salt in people's coffee for starters

189
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,280
because some people need that shit.

190
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Salt or coffee?

191
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Coffee.

192
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,560
Some people-

193
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,560
What if you're on like a low-sodium diet?

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,400
Because your doctor put you on that.

195
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,480
Drink it and immediately have a heart attack.

196
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,960
Yeah, cool attempted murder, you piece of shit.

197
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,720
This is why I can't work in an office anymore

198
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,960
because people are constantly trying to fucking kill you

199
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,640
just to get a laugh off.

200
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,280
I think the best response is to wait till that person

201
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,680
is drinking their coffee and then walk up,

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
take the coffee out of their hands,

203
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,480
and smash it against the wall.

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,080
And how's that prank?

205
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,680
This is what you did to me.

206
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,880
I'm literally doing it.

207
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
And then just say like, prank.

208
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,760
I pranked you.

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
You've been pranked.

210
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,560
I would say that if your natural response

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,120
is to go like way over the top thermonuclear,

212
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
you shouldn't-

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Try that word again.

214
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,640
Thermonuclear.

215
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,480
You shouldn't respond at all

216
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
because I don't think you have a good gauge.

217
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,640
And you know the fastest way to not get pranked again

218
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
in the future is to have zero reaction

219
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,960
to the thing that happened.

220
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,080
You take a sip of the coffee,

221
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,280
you almost Vince bomb,

222
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,560
and then you just go like, no.

223
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,680
And then you just pour it out.

224
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
I liked it.

225
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,560
I approve.

226
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
And then you just like walk over,

227
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,520
you quietly dump it out,

228
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,640
you refill your coffee.

229
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Oh, okay.

230
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,040
Listen, I have an actual good,

231
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,720
I have an actual good response to this.

232
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,920
Get in league with your boss

233
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,360
and don't go into work on an upcoming day,

234
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,320
maybe just tomorrow,

235
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,000
whenever you listen to this tomorrow.

236
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,040
And then when the person who salted your coffee asks,

237
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,200
say that, well, Richard quit

238
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,080
because people are so mean with their pranks.

239
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,960
Or even better,

240
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,120
he had to stay home sick with salt poisoning.

241
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
He had salt poisoning.

242
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
Hey, House of Cards season four sucks.

243
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

244
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah.

245
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,000
This Yahoo was sent in by game,

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
recognize the game, Rachel Sperling.

247
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,080
Thank you.

248
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,520
That guy who asks,

250
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
how do I give up rapping?

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,360
At one point,

252
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
it just consumed my life

253
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,240
and I'm tired of sinning.

254
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,960
I look back and my old recordings sound very evil.

255
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,240
Wait, hold on one more time.

256
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,400
First sentence again.

257
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,120
At one point,

258
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,320
it just consumed my life

259
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
and I'm tired of sinning.

260
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Okay.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,480
I look back and my old recordings

262
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,320
sound very evil and scary.

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,820
Boo.

264
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,560
Every time I quit,

265
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
I get drawn back in.

266
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
How do I stop this addiction?

267
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,520
Man, how do you figure it out?

268
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,800
Sincerely, Dr. Dre.

269
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
I just want to do my headphone thing.

270
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,840
I wish I could quit this speaking.

271
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,040
People keep wanting detox.

272
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,520
They say,

273
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,040
please drop detox, Dre.

274
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,600
And I say,

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,080
I can't,

276
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,200
it's evil and sinning

277
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
and I can't go back to those rapping ways.

278
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,600
I just listen back to it

279
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,240
and I'm like,

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,200
what was I thinking?

281
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,120
Can you quit

282
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,920
or can you do like a fucking Will Smith brand shift

283
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,640
where it's just like,

284
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,160
I only rap about things

285
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,200
that make people feel good

286
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,160
and no swears,

287
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,960
no sin.

288
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,200
I don't think God listens to Will Smith.

289
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,520
I mean, of course God listens to Will Smith.

290
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,360
I don't think just like in prayer

291
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
and also he has all of his albums

292
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,440
because they're really good

293
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
and we're all waiting for that new shit.

294
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,560
That new stuff.

295
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,080
Sorry, I'm going to try and answer this question

296
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,440
in the style of Will Smith.

297
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm going to just try and live my life

298
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,040
a little bit closer.

299
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
You're going to have to reference

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,280
Miami a lot more.

301
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm going to have to just try

302
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,040
and live my life a little bit

303
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,160
closer to Will.

304
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,560
And so go do the Will Smith thing.

305
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,600
God listens to Will Smith

306
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,240
and it's like,

307
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,760
I like this guy's style.

308
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
I like how he keeps it clean.

309
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,400
His big Willy style.

310
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,240
It's funny because it's clean,

311
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,080
but it's still so edgy.

312
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,760
Because he has that song

313
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
that's all about candy

314
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,120
and he's like,

315
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,760
you sweet,

316
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,880
good enough to eat.

317
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,040
Make a fellow want to TLC creep.

318
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,520
And it's like,

319
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,120
I love that reference.

320
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,920
I love candy.

321
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,400
And I love how you didn't just swear Will Smith.

322
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
So can we do like,

323
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,280
can you come a little bit closer?

324
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Come with me.

325
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,480
Take my hand.

326
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,160
We're going to walk a little closer

327
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,360
with you, Will Smith.

328
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,640
There's three pairs of footprints

329
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,200
in the sand.

330
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,240
One's me, one's you,

331
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,360
one's Big Will.

332
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,480
And then every so often

333
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
there's like a missed spot

334
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,320
in the middle

335
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,280
and that's where Big Will

336
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,320
and God were swinging me.

337
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,480
And then there's some erratic

338
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
two pairs of footsteps

339
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,760
and then one of them disappears.

340
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,560
And then like,

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,080
and then 15 feet down the line,

342
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,960
there's just like a big like impact mark.

343
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
It's like the shape of a human

344
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,840
and that's where Uncle Phil

345
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,680
picked up DJ Jazzy Jeff

346
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,400
and launched him

347
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,600
like a human torpedo.

348
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,520
DJ Jesus Jeff.

349
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
So you could definitely do that.

350
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,680
I think Griffin,

351
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,720
the point you're missing

352
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
is not how to revamp his rap,

353
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,680
but how does one stop the thing

354
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,280
that is so inherent,

355
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,520
so intrinsic in your DNA

356
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
that like you can't imagine

357
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,360
not doing it anymore?

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,240
You know what I mean?

359
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
Like we all have that thing

360
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,920
where it's like when I wake up,

361
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,160
I'm eating and breathing cross stitch, right?

362
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,640
Like how do I not cross stitch anymore?

363
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,160
It is at this point

364
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
so identifiably me

365
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,840
that when people think Travis,

366
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,120
they think cross stitch.

367
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,360
Sure.

368
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
And to answer this actual question,

369
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,320
if I could just like actually answer

370
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,760
a question for once,

371
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,320
the secret is to not rhyme

372
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
when you're talking.

373
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,920
That's the trick.

374
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,360
You're gonna do that once.

375
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,760
You're gonna be like-

376
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
So like if you catch yourself,

377
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
like let me welcome everybody

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,040
to the wild wild west,

379
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
a state that's untouchable,

380
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,440
like Elliott Spitzer.

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,840
If you see yourself about to rhyme,

382
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,760
you just like turn the whole ship around.

383
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,200
Justin, you are so right

384
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,640
because I was about to suggest

385
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,000
just don't record it,

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,080
but then I've seen people rhyming

387
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,960
but not record

388
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,440
just walking down the street and rhyming.

389
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,480
Is this a thing people,

390
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,000
this is an epidemic?

391
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
Is it, it's gonna be like,

392
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,400
what happens,

393
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,120
you know what happens

394
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,480
to a dream deferred?

395
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,280
It gets all,

396
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,360
it gets all raisiny and fucked up.

397
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
And that's the problem is,

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,680
I feel like if you try

399
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,720
and keep this inside,

400
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,120
you can't,

401
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,080
you can't purge this urge

402
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,800
like a glass of surge.

403
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Do you know what I mean?

404
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,600
Oh no, they got him.

405
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,960
Oh no, here I go.

406
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,560
I've promised I would stop

407
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
because I was a flop,

408
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
but I'd chip it,

409
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,840
chip it, chip, chip, chip, chip, chop.

410
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,800
You're having a stroke.

411
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
It was a joke.

412
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,280
No, it was a joke

413
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,040
and I'm telling on the show

414
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,800
and Elliot Spitzer.

415
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,840
Here's a rap tip from us to you.

416
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,960
If you ever get tired

417
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,920
in the middle of a rap

418
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,880
or sleepy

419
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
or just can't think of words to say,

420
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,160
say chip a chip chip.

421
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
Or and or Elliot Spitzer,

422
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
which is a magical word

423
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,680
that rhymes with anything.

424
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,040
Some would call it two words.

425
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Scientists have yet to agree

426
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
on how many words Elliot Spitzer is.

427
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
You can't give up rapping.

428
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,320
Just I would say

429
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,160
just try and walk a little closer with me.

430
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:02,800
Will Smith.

431
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,320
I've been Will Smith this whole time.

432
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,160
Thank you all for listening to the podcast.

433
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,120
Is it rude to show up

434
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,800
to a themed birthday party

435
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,520
not dressed in the requested attire?

436
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,840
My friend is turning 30

437
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,920
and her husband is planning

438
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,240
a surprise 90s themed dance party.

439
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,960
I don't have any frumpy high-waisted jeans,

440
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,160
overalls, crop tops,

441
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,040
high top tennis shoes

442
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,640
or anything else remotely 90s.

443
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,680
And I don't feel like rummaging

444
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,800
through all the local thrift stores

445
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,920
for these types of items.

446
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
Would I be as lame as the people

447
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,280
who show up to Halloween party stands costume

448
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
or is this different

449
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,720
and not as big as a social faux pas?

450
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,440
Please help.

451
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,000
That's from lost my LA gears in Georgia.

452
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,360
Yes.

453
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,680
Yeah, I just don't like,

454
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,880
you know what?

455
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Like I don't feel like it

456
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,800
is not a is not a condition

457
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
by which you get to not do like

458
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
nobody feel nobody's woke up as like

459
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,320
I've got to dig out my hyper color t-shirts

460
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,360
from storage.

461
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
We do it because it's funny for other people.

462
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
Like nobody feels like doing it.

463
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,440
Unless.

464
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,240
Tough nuggies.

465
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,840
Unless, unless.

466
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,800
This friend is constantly trying

467
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,320
to do themed parties.

468
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
Yeah, and that is rude.

469
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,600
That's the rude shit right there.

470
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,360
If this is like, listen,

471
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,720
he's turning 30 or she's turning 30

472
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
and like we like our group of friends

473
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,880
have like not done a theme party in years.

474
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,360
Yeah.

475
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,440
Then yeah, you have to go.

476
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,520
You have to at least make an effort.

477
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,800
But if it's like every other week

478
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,840
they're trying to do like

479
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,560
a Quentin Tarantino themed party

480
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,920
and we're going to watch shit

481
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,760
and now we're doing this

482
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,880
and we'll do an Oscars party

483
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
where everyone like then it's like,

484
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,560
okay, you know what?

485
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,280
You ran out of ideas so quickly, Travis.

486
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
Holy shit.

487
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,640
No famous magicians

488
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
was the only other thing I had.

489
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
But they all wear the same shit.

490
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,320
They all look exactly the same

491
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
except for David.

492
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
Everybody wore a straight jacket.

493
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,000
Did nobody like talk to each other

494
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
before how are we supposed to pick up drinks?

495
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,240
I think a good rule of thumb

496
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
for anything like this is where you think,

497
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,920
okay, in your mind,

498
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,600
flash forward to the party

499
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
where everybody's dressed up

500
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,840
and you walk in in just your regular clothes

501
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,520
and that's the rest of your night.

502
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,640
You know what I mean?

503
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,360
Where people were like,

504
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,440
oh, you didn't.

505
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,560
Oh, why didn't you?

506
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,080
And your only explanation is

507
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,480
I didn't feel like looking for the stuff

508
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,360
where everybody else has done it.

509
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,640
And like, there's your host,

510
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,760
like looking at you like,

511
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,680
oh, you chose not to participate.

512
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
I think when you think about it

513
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
in that context,

514
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,960
in like the reality of the situation,

515
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
it's pretty clear that you would feel rude

516
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,880
because they asked you to do a thing

517
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,760
and you might as well.

518
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,800
It's like if somebody said,

519
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,520
everybody bring a dish and you didn't.

520
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,000
It's rude to have a theme party at all first.

521
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,160
You should let somebody get that far

522
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,360
out of their head,

523
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,560
like get that much out.

524
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,840
Hey, we're having a theme party.

525
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,640
That's rude.

526
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,560
That's very rude of you to do.

527
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
You are right, Justin.

528
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,240
Here's my suggestion.

529
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
I used to mow the lawn at our house

530
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,280
and then I just started doing

531
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,240
such a shitty job of it

532
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
that dad stopped asking me to mow the lawn

533
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,160
and I gracefully bowed out.

534
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,840
I think if you can show up

535
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,040
to each of these parties

536
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,160
that technically fits the bill

537
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,280
but is so wildly inaccurate

538
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
and bad and wrong

539
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,880
that they will just stop doing them entirely.

540
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,600
I thought you meant 1890s.

541
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,360
Or you show up dressed up

542
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,880
as Sonic the Hedgehog

543
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,360
and they're like,

544
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,800
what the fuck?

545
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,360
And you're like-

546
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,320
That would be fresh.

547
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,760
That would be dope, Griff,

548
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
are you kidding me?

549
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
Right, but then they throw like,

550
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
come dressed up as your favorite food

551
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
and you show up like Sonic the Hedgehog

552
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,840
and you're like,

553
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't know,

554
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,080
you could probably cook and eat a hedgehog.

555
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,280
I don't know, famous presidents.

556
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,200
Hi, I'm Sonic T. Hedgehog.

557
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
That's me, our nation's 61st president.

558
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,240
And you're like,

559
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,840
what are you fucking talking about?

560
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,400
And you're like,

561
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
you can't prove that Sonic the Hedgehog

562
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
won't be our nation's 61st president.

563
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,040
Why don't you keep an open mind?

564
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,600
And then they have a Oscars party.

565
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,880
Everybody's black tie

566
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,400
and I'm Sonic the Hedgehog.

567
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,880
Hello.

568
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,560
And pretty soon you stop being invited

569
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,440
to parties at all

570
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
and then you don't have to worry about it anymore.

571
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,080
Well, no, that's the thing.

572
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,240
Then they have a Sonic the Hedgehog party

573
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,840
and you show up as Judge Lance Ito.

574
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,840
Judge Lance Ito

575
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,160
is part of the extended Sonicverse.

576
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,200
He was in the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game

577
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
playing Dr. Robotnik.

578
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,520
What I'm saying is Sonic the Hedgehog

579
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,360
is just a great character.

580
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

581
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,280
Yes.

582
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,600
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Ian Dunn.

583
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,240
Thank you, Ian.

584
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Fairy Girl who asks,

585
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,000
what is the meaning of every tattoo Adam Levine has?

586
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,640
What is the-

587
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,760
How much time do you got?

588
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,800
What is the meaning of every tattoo Adam Levine has?

589
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,920
I know some of them,

590
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,960
like the Roman numeral 10 and the 222,

591
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
but what about everything else?

592
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,120
He's got the one that wards off evil.

593
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,280
The rose piece is on his left shoulder, right?

594
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:07,680
Right.

595
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,000
He's got the mom on his left forearm.

596
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,200
He's got the Ghostbusters logo over his left eyeball.

597
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,400
He's got the Deathly Hallows around his nipple.

598
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,800
Sure.

599
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,160
He's got the fake beard tattooed on his face.

600
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,960
Right under the Ghostbusters logo.

601
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,160
On his other eye, he has the Ghostbusters logo,

602
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,280
but the two one where the ghost is putting up the peace sign.

603
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
Oh no, wait, that's two, isn't it?

604
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,880
He's got the tattoo on his butt

605
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,120
where it looks like Slimers coming out of his butt crack.

606
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,640
His butt, yeah.

607
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,120
He has a lot of Ghostbusters tattoos.

608
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,960
I didn't put that together until just now.

609
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,040
Yeah, well, it's good luck.

610
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,800
This dude has such a broad assortment of tattoos.

611
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Yeah, I think he adhered to the Travis McElroy school

612
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:05,520
of tattoo themes where it's just like a lot of different stuff.

613
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
Mm-hmm.

614
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
For instance, there's a paw print that says,

615
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,040
Frankie Girl, as it refers to Golden Retriever Frankie.

616
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
There's a script tattoo.

617
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm reading an answer because somebody fucking busted out a bullet point here.

618
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,480
There's a tattoo written in either Hindi or Sanskrit

619
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,640
on the left side of his chest that has been hard to get a photo of,

620
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
but it is believed to say Maroon 5.

621
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,480
It's like there are goddamn dead sea scrolls.

622
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,600
There are apocryphal Adam tattoos.

623
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,720
And I would disagree just by Googling Adam Levine tattoos,

624
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
but that has not been hard to get a picture of

625
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,280
because there are bajillions of them.

626
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,440
On the left side of Adam-

627
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,120
Adam Levine's a fit dude.

628
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,160
Yeah, dude, he's ripped and his body's crazy,

629
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,040
but he's got a tattoo on his left bicep that is an X,

630
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,920
meaning 10, for the 10-year anniversary of Maroon 5.

631
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,080
I got that exact same tattoo.

632
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm surprised I didn't see him there.

633
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,960
Well, they were giving them away free at the tattoo parlor.

634
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,520
Just come in and let us celebrate Maroon 5.

635
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
So this motherfucker is in a band called Maroon 5.

636
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,000
He's got a tattoo that it has 222.

637
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,040
That's for the number on the door,

638
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,280
the very first studio that Maroon 5 ever recorded in.

639
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,480
He's got an X for the number 10 for the 10-year anniversary of Maroon 5.

640
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,840
Nowhere on his fucking body does he have a goddamn 5

641
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,360
for the number in his goddamn number band.

642
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,280
Hi, hi, my name is Matchbox 20.

643
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm from Matchbox 20.

644
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
We've been going for 30 years, so I got a 30 tattooed on my body

645
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,720
because I'm an idiot.

646
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,200
Travis, why are you sending me a link to Pinterest?

647
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,600
Oh, good, an Adams Inc. user guide from People magazine.

648
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,960
Now this claims that the Sanskrit means austerity.

649
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,600
Does this mean austerity of Maroon 5?

650
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
That's the same thing.

651
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,400
He's got a shark tattoo from facing his fear of them.

652
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,680
Of sharks?

653
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,840
Of shark, no, of shark tattoos.

654
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,000
He's terrified of shark tattoos.

655
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,200
Shark, you look at me straight in your dead black eyes

656
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,680
like a doll's eyes because I'm gonna get a tattoo of you,

657
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,280
but I promised myself I'd look at you for 30 seconds first.

658
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,320
I made it 20 and you just gotta stay still.

659
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,160
Well, he got that tattoo from a shark.

660
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,920
Adam, I noticed you keep looking at the door.

661
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,360
Is everything okay?

662
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,320
No, it's fine, it's fine.

663
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,080
Yeah, you know it's pretty good.

664
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,280
It's just getting harder and harder to breathe.

665
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
I've got a great idea for a song.

666
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,200
I've gotta go start a band so I can write it.

667
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,280
Okay, listen to this shit, listen to this.

668
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,640
But then as he stumbles outside,

669
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
he sees five Maroon cars drive by and he goes, Eureka!

670
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
There is another new piece in the collection of Adam Levine tattoos

671
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
on the right side of his chest that is not yet revealed.

672
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,120
There's a teaser for him of 2016.

673
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,680
There are photos that offer a little hint,

674
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,000
but as of yet, there is no confirmation as to what is actually there.

675
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
There is also a rumor of a new back piece that hasn't been revealed yet either.

676
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
Do you know how about, but Jeff Griffin,

677
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,880
do you know how fucked it is of it?

678
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,040
Like, do you know what it says about Adam Levine?

679
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,920
That the fact that people can't see like his skin, all of his skin all the time

680
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,160
is the questionable thing?

681
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,200
Like, we have those things here in the regular world.

682
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,800
They're called clothes and we wear them to cover our tattoos.

683
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:40,160
Dude, if I had a crazy, blown out, rip a dip body like Adam Levine,

684
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:44,400
if my shit was top of the class, so, so tight,

685
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,760
I have moves just like Jagger.

686
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,480
Bumps, ridges, Jagger moves, Jagger bumps and ridges,

687
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,680
Kighton, Kighton under the skin though,

688
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:02,560
to just give it a 14 pack fucking blissful, sweet, sweet pasture of man, man flesh.

689
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
I would never wear clothes anywhere ever again.

690
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Guys, can I ask you a real talk question?

691
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
Just real talk for a second.

692
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,080
What's wrong?

693
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,760
Don't you think Adam Levine's probably super cool to hang out with?

694
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,080
I bet he's probably a super cool dude.

695
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
I bet he's so chill.

696
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,280
I bet, but he's not going to happen

697
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,440
because I just yelled at him on the internet about it.

698
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,040
I haven't yelled at him.

699
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,880
That's a high quality hang, man.

700
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,360
All I want to do is spend the day with Adam Levine and Rob Thomas.

701
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,280
Like that, if I could tell 16 year old Travis

702
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,560
that 31 year old Travis can make that happen for him,

703
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,400
like that would just be the best.

704
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Travis, can you get Adam Levine on the show as a guest spurt?

705
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,960
All right, try and stop me, Justin.

706
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,760
We couldn't get Scott back, but maybe we can get Adam Levine.

707
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
Adam Levine, we'll get him in the studio with the three of us

708
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,600
at one point in the middle of recording when he's doing an answer.

709
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,040
Justin, you're going to sneak up behind him

710
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,960
and we're going to make eye contact and I'll mouth one, two, three, go.

711
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,320
You'll hit him with the chloroform

712
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
and then I'm going to tattoo a five on this fucker's body.

713
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm going to fix Adam Levine

714
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,280
because right now his shit is broken.

715
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Okay, now seriously, let's go.

716
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,880
We got a really awesome new advertiser to tell you all about this week.

717
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,160
It's Slip Shine, which proudly publishes over 150 pages of fun,

718
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,760
sex-positive adult comics every month.

719
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,480
This week, MBMBAM listeners can get a special offer.

720
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,640
SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM.

721
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,800
No first time sign up fee and you get a 10% discount

722
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,480
on six month and yearly subscriptions.

723
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,360
You can get access to fresh content monthly and 10 years of archives.

724
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,280
Now that's the stuff we legally have to say for this ad,

725
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,000
but the thing is you guys really, really have to go.

726
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,280
You have to go. SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM.

727
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,320
SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM.

728
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,840
This is not a test.

729
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,840
There's a special page, you're going to love it.

730
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,000
There's a comic for all of us.

731
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,360
Now this is not safe for work.

732
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,680
This is a grown folks website for grown folks.

733
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,720
This is for grown folks only, but you're going to love it.

734
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,160
If all the comics are so positive and it's so great and everything is so great,

735
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,760
this landing page is so good.

736
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,640
You're in for a treat.

737
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,920
Listen, again, seriously though, this is horny stuff.

738
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,360
This is horny stuff, y'all.

739
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,040
This is really horny stuff.

740
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,960
This is grade A horny material.

741
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,360
If you got Net Nanny, she is going to throw down several flags over this website.

742
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,280
This is NSFW, like teengoogle.com.

743
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,040
Right, well, no, teengoogle isn't-

744
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,000
No, we've been getting a lot of tweets and emails from people

745
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,600
that apparently teengoogle.com gets blocked by a lot of Net Nanny-esque sites.

746
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
People can't check teengoogle at work.

747
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,880
Net Nanny has probably also listened to the show before

748
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,520
and she probably knows the foul nature of our doings.

749
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,280
SlipShine.net slash MBMBAM, go right now.

750
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:36,800
Now, after you masturbate to that, you'll be hungry.

751
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,880
The good news is we got a great solution for you there too.

752
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Wash your hands between.

753
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,520
Wash your hands before you grab your naturebox.com.

754
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,640
After you-

755
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,760
Do it, do it.

756
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,120
After you're done with your box, why not reach for naturebox.com?

757
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,560
It's snacks on snacks on snacks on snacks.

758
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,000
I also call my penis a box, so-

759
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,720
Naturebox.com has something for everyone

760
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
with zero artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners,

761
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,080
zero grams trans fat, and no high fructose corn syrup.

762
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,680
This is wholesome stuff.

763
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,880
I gotta tell you guys, I got a new nature box in the mail.

764
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,440
I have a new hot recommendation for you.

765
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,560
It is the almond biscotti bites, vanilla almond biscotti bites,

766
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
or lemon almond biscotti bites, that's what it is.

767
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,800
It's a delicious, delicious snack that I can highly recommend.

768
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,800
And it came in a trial box.

769
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,240
You get five free snacks, a box of free snacks,

770
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,280
by going to naturebox.com slash my brother.

771
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,720
This is really delicious stuff.

772
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,080
You get a free trial box of snacks.

773
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,040
There's no risk.

774
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,600
Check it out.

775
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,400
See if you like it.

776
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,880
You will.

777
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,720
And you get a subscription.

778
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,280
And then every month you can get whatever snacks you choose.

779
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,080
Maybe some big island pineapple.

780
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm gonna use some pistachio power cluster.

781
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,240
Is it possible to have the website pick snacks for you

782
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,160
so that when I open up that nature box,

783
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
I can like fucking play the Zelda music behind it?

784
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Like, what am I gonna have in here?

785
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,160
And also, I don't want any of the snacks to have labels on them.

786
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,560
I just want to have content that I can start eating.

787
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,640
And no bags, just a loose box.

788
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,240
Just a loose box of basically mystery gorp.

789
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
And if the mailman could really just beat the shit out of the box,

790
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,040
that would be great.

791
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
Maybe drag it on the ground.

792
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,640
A lot of people ask me what the parmesan garlic pop pop sound like.

793
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,120
So this is-

794
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,680
Oh, great.

795
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:32,640
Really?

796
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,840
Oh, God.

797
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,080
Oh, nothing makes good radio like listening to someone gum on something.

798
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,520
Hey, have you listened to my bim bam?

799
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,480
You could really hear the insides of Justin McElroy's cheeks.

800
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,400
naturebox.com slash my brother.

801
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,760
Um, I have a message.

802
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,720
Very special message for Brian Lee.

803
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
And it's from Amber, who says,

804
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,200
Hi, Blee.

805
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,480
I know we don't have an official anniversary date,

806
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,160
so let's just say it's today.

807
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,600
Thanks for seven years of being cute and great all the time.

808
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,600
You are my shining golden treasure,

809
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,560
and I hope I haven't spoiled this surprise by the time you hear it.

810
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,240
I love you a whole bunch, Amb.

811
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,080
Um, that's super great.

812
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,160
I love that Amber probably wanted their anniversary date to be,

813
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,720
let's say a month and a half to two months ago.

814
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
No, we nailed this one.

815
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,760
We nailed this one.

816
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Yes, we hit the window.

817
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,680
She asked for between March 8th and 14th, and we did it.

818
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,680
First time, five years.

819
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,440
Yeah, stuck the landing.

820
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,160
We have established a super precedent for the inaugural date of your love.

821
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,200
And I'm happy that we could be a part of this.

822
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,200
And it is the second Monday of every March.

823
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,480
Well, I don't think it's not.

824
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,960
It's not Hanukkah.

825
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,080
It's not a federal holiday.

826
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,360
Today's not going to wander around.

827
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,000
Got a message for Brian Miskell from Julian, Sanford, Kate, Katie, and Lilla.

828
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,320
Happy birthday, the most truthful Shelmerdian ever to grace the American stage.

829
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,800
To a hunky boy and a NBNB AM aficionado, so dedicated he knows,

830
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,160
we're throwing big words in here just to hear Justin pronounce them.

831
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:25,120
Oh, Sesquipedian, do it again.

832
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,680
Keep doing it.

833
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:30,240
This is the rest of the show.

834
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,080
To an onstage cruder more euphonious than a macarons singing this vampire horse likes blood.

835
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,360
You're going to go far, man.

836
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,080
Well, there you go.

837
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,520
You fucking sicko.

838
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,400
You got your job.

839
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,520
Are you happy now?

840
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,320
Are you happy now?

841
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,040
Is this what you want?

842
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
You monsters.

843
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
Justin, I could really just listen to-

844
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,600
It would be like Grammar Girl starring Justin McElroy,

845
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,520
except you don't fucking know anything.

846
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,400
Grammar goofus.

847
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,800
Kelsey Grammar Girl.

848
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,800
Now, this is a different show.

849
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,440
This would be a different show from the show we just described.

850
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,680
This is just a girl who loves Kelsey Grammar?

851
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,880
This is a girl who sounds like a lot like Kelsey Grammar,

852
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
and it's just her reading the newspaper.

853
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,280
What about Kelsey Grammar Girl fan cast?

854
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,520
We're going down the rabbit hole a little bit,

855
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,160
but this is a fan cast about Kelsey Grammar Girl.

856
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,400
This is dumb.

857
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,760
The Muppet Show, World War II,

858
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,520
the song I Knew You Were Waiting For Me by Aretha Franklin and George Michael.

859
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,760
So many great things have come from the collaboration between the US and the UK,

860
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
but never let us forget that at the heart of it all,

861
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
our two nations are deadly rivals.

862
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,280
Join me, Dave Holmes, for International Waters,

863
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,320
a transatlantic panel game that pits comedians in London

864
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,960
and comedians in Los Angeles against each other.

865
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,480
It's like the Revolutionary War,

866
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,840
but with way more jokes about One Direction and cinema.

867
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,480
Find it in iTunes or at MaximumFun.org.

868
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,200
Dear brothers, I have recently developed a strange fear

869
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,160
that when I'm in the shower with the curtain drawn,

870
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,240
there's a deranged killer in the bathroom that's about to kill me.

871
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,720
How am I able to overcome this strange phobia

872
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,480
so I can once again shower in peace?

873
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,680
Any help is appreciated,

874
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,520
as I have been carrying a fear in the corner of my shower,

875
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,400
peeking out every three seconds to make sure there's no knife-wielding maniac

876
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
in my bathroom, and that's from Andrew.

877
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,360
Here's the thing.

878
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,000
Can I be honest?

879
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,040
The reason I included this question, not only is it a good question,

880
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
I went through the same thing.

881
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,480
How did you get out of it?

882
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,840
Travis, it's the dorkiest shit, but I would put a song on the radio

883
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,440
that was too happy to be murdered to.

884
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,000
I was literally going to say, Travis,

885
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
I was literally about to say,

886
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,320
throw some fucking Beyonce on your iPhone and just blast it,

887
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,600
because you're gonna, first of all,

888
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,000
you're gonna love these tunes, I guarantee it.

889
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,600
Second of all, you're gonna feel too fucking strong.

890
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,480
You're gonna feel like if a killer did break into your room

891
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,160
and fucking partition is blasting and a driver walks in that room,

892
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,560
and pulls back the shower curtain and has a knife,

893
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,920
you're like, I'm too fucking strong and way too fucking sexy

894
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,280
to be killed in this shower right now.

895
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,120
And then you're just dancing in his face.

896
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,880
Or her face.

897
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,520
Or her face.

898
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,200
Whatever this killer is that's going to try and kill you,

899
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,880
you're going to be dancing around their flurry of stabs,

900
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,240
and you're gonna be so fucking strong and awesome while you do it.

901
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,960
Honestly, that works for basically everything.

902
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,640
It's basically why Beyonce is like a goddamn phenomenon.

903
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,360
Everybody just wants to not get killed in their shower?

904
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,680
Well, no, I'm saying it applies to fucking everything,

905
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,680
like running across the interstate,

906
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,800
like the hilarious Bowfinger movie.

907
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,400
You put some fucking Beyonce on,

908
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,680
the cars will just sort of fly around you,

909
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,360
because you're too strong to be killed.

910
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,240
Nobody has ever died while listening to a Beyonce song,

911
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,360
because you're too strong and sexy and fucking powerful and awesome.

912
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,920
I have a better idea than your ideas.

913
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,600
Okay, for this, bring a knife into the shower.

914
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,400
Never gonna see that coming.

915
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,600
He pulls back the curtain like,

916
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,320
and you're like, yourself, motherfucker,

917
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
and stab him right in the eye.

918
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,640
Oh, oh, okay.

919
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,440
Let me one up that juice.

920
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,120
You thought the psycho was out there?

921
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,280
Surprise, the psycho's in here with the Irish spring on him.

922
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,640
Let me one up that, Justin.

923
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,760
You're gonna do a full on-

924
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,320
That text should be the name of this fucking podcast, Travis.

925
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,040
A full on home alone clown in the shower.

926
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,280
Oh, fuck.

927
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,840
What's that?

928
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,040
You're in the closet.

929
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,960
Stop, stop, stop.

930
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,960
You jump out of the closet to stab him.

931
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,680
What the fuck?

932
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,880
He's a clown balloon.

933
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,160
What's that on the ceiling?

934
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,600
Daniel, why do you smell so bad?

935
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,040
I haven't showered in three months, but I'm alive.

936
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,720
Good news though, my clown's clean and my conscience is clear.

937
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
My clown is clean?

938
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,760
Now all you single ladies, come dance with Stinky, dude.

939
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,120
I don't need the Beyonce to keep me sane anymore.

940
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,160
I use the Beyonce to get me pumped up to kill somebody.

941
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,000
Should they come into my shower to stab me?

942
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,040
As long as they aren't a clown balloon and they are perched on the ceiling.

943
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,840
Oh no, shit, that's a second clown balloon.

944
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,800
They double ballooned me.

945
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,840
The floor is a mirror the whole time.

946
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:11,120
A mirror, they are the house and then they eat me, monster house.

947
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,680
The house was a metaphor for my childhood.

948
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,800
Wait a second, this is all a dream, but it's not.

949
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
The killer's inside my dream.

950
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,800
I'm John Cusack and all of a sudden the house is floating.

951
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,120
Look up, balloons, you're in up as he moved.

952
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,640
You're trapped in the television clicking through with your magical remote.

953
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
Sorry, Pleasantville?

954
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,680
No, that was more of, I think it was, no, it wasn't mom and dad saved the universe.

955
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,640
I think you definitely meant Pleasantville.

956
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,240
Channel up, next channel, change channel, channel changes.

957
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,920
Channel changes, do you guys want to Yahoo?

958
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,080
Yeah.

959
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,240
This Yahoo was sent in by John Williams.

960
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,440
Thank you, John Williams.

961
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,840
It's by Yahoo answers user Easton who asks,

962
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,520
what are some sexy foods besides hot dogs, pickles, et cetera?

963
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,440
Of, so it's of.

964
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,120
For example, a hot dog, a pickle.

965
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,880
You just said that, so you're kind of being all right on it.

966
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,920
For example, a hot dog, a pickle, a melon.

967
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,440
Mm.

968
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,680
Those can all be used as another meaning.

969
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,240
What are some other foods than can be used that way?

970
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

971
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,680
This is posted in men's health.

972
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,040
Wait, wait, wait.

973
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,600
I, okay.

974
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,320
I thought this question I asked her was saying not hot dogs and pickles

975
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,480
because of their inherently phallic nature.

976
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,000
But if they're trying to suggest, if they're trying to suggest

977
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,720
that saying like I want to be all over your hot dog

978
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,160
is in any way sexual, they're the worst.

979
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
A, A, A, A.

980
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,840
Let me see that melon.

981
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,800
The, my what?

982
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Your, your honey do.

983
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,320
My what?

984
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,560
I like your melons.

985
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,600
I gotta go.

986
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,120
I have to leave.

987
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,720
I'm having a pickle problem.

988
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
I'm just gonna name foods.

989
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,080
All right.

990
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,480
And you guys tell me gut instinct.

991
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:08,720
Okay.

992
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,680
Don't think about it.

993
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:09,920
Okay.

994
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,640
Gut instinct.

995
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,280
Let me clear my mind.

996
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
Is there anything sexual or a sexual connotation

997
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,280
or a euphemism, whatever, sexual connotation to these foods?

998
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,600
Here's your-

999
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,160
Well, we need to back this up or is it just like gut reaction?

1000
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:20,720
Yes or no?

1001
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,240
Uh, no.

1002
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,640
Yeah.

1003
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,120
Gut reaction.

1004
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:23,600
Yes or no?

1005
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,520
If I completely disagree with you, I will stop.

1006
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,680
I got kind of a hair trigger down there though.

1007
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,680
So chicken salad.

1008
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,280
No, no, no, no.

1009
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:35,840
Okay.

1010
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,800
Pretzels.

1011
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,360
Yes.

1012
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,520
No pretzel rods.

1013
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:39,920
Yes.

1014
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
Yes.

1015
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,240
Anything, any rod, any cucumber rod.

1016
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,840
Well, cucumber is, I guess, we're on shumber.

1017
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,960
It's just a rod shape.

1018
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:47,280
Okay.

1019
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,840
Cucumber.

1020
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,160
Yeah.

1021
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,480
Yes.

1022
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,840
Jello.

1023
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,080
Yes.

1024
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,400
Yes.

1025
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,600
Jelly.

1026
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:51,920
Yes.

1027
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,240
Yes.

1028
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,680
Jam.

1029
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:53,920
Yes.

1030
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,280
You're just saying, okay.

1031
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,920
No, I'm not.

1032
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,720
Yes.

1033
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,840
Just, okay.

1034
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,960
Peanut butter.

1035
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,280
No.

1036
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,680
Yes.

1037
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,000
Huh.

1038
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,280
Okay.

1039
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
Split decision on that.

1040
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,840
I'm into it.

1041
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,560
Half and half.

1042
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:05,600
No.

1043
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,560
Are you just looking at-

1044
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:06,800
Wait.

1045
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,840
Are you saying it's a split decision or the food half and half?

1046
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,800
I'm not sure anymore.

1047
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,960
I want to read some of these answers that have been submitted in response to this Yahoo

1048
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:28,400
Knights mystery because one of them is the greatest and, well, it's the worst thing.

1049
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,160
It's the worst paragraph ever pinned.

1050
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,760
Less offensive are chocolate ding dongs, obviously.

1051
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,120
That's from Vatim S.

1052
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,800
Olivia says, a host is Twinkie.

1053
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,320
They are tan-ish and white creamy stuff comes out of them.

1054
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,200
Oh.

1055
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,320
UOM says, try a banana or a cumber.

1056
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,680
It's just, I guess, or a cumber.

1057
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,560
How into cucumbers do you need to-

1058
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,640
Hey, let me get some of those cumbers.

1059
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Hey, you got any cumbers over there?

1060
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,240
Richie just says, cream.

1061
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,640
Sorry, what?

1062
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,040
Cream?

1063
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:18,560
I want to read, though, this new American classic from Spanky Gaspacho DW.

1064
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,400
This was rated the top answer.

1065
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,120
It has four thumbs up, zero thumbs down.

1066
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,360
The asker gave it one out of five stars, though, so it's a bit contentious.

1067
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,080
It is not the answer that the asker wanted, but it is the answer they deserved.

1068
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,280
Spanky Gaspacho DW says-

1069
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,640
Say that name just eight more times.

1070
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,400
Spanky Gaspacho DW.

1071
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,440
That's an answer right there.

1072
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,880
Yeah, and he was also my favorite little rascal.

1073
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,720
Spanky Gaspacho DW says, and please just let me get through this.

1074
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,440
Mango is really sexy.

1075
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,520
Mango is really sexy.

1076
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,920
Don't cut it up and eat it with a fork, though.

1077
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:12,640
You have to let the juice drip down your face and onto your naked rack.

1078
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,920
You have to suck on that seed, you know?

1079
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:30,000
You know, share it visually and expressively, and then literally.

1080
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:42,640
Nothing, nothing better than a beautiful sweet mango smeared all over the body

1081
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,600
and slowly kissed and licked off.

1082
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:53,520
What are you doing in there, Spanky?

1083
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,120
Not you, I'm internet.

1084
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,080
I'm researching.

1085
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,000
Come down for dinner, we're having mango for dessert.

1086
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,960
Oh, Christ.

1087
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:07,520
My boner, it went inside.

1088
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,240
I'm sharing it visually and expressively, and then literally.

1089
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,160
What does that mean, Spanky Gaspacho DW?

1090
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,880
Can I just quickly, like quick sidebar?

1091
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,480
I did a Googleroo of Spanky Gaspacho.

1092
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,960
This is a unique individual haunting Yahoo answers.

1093
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:36,320
There is a question, the top response for Spanky Gaspacho is the question,

1094
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,600
does anybody here know someone that is nicknamed Gaspacho?

1095
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,840
Well, you do now.

1096
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,680
The top answer is from Spanky Gaspacho.

1097
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,200
He says, I see Gaspacho that is that cold,

1098
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,640
emotionless, acidic tomato-based soupy guy, Gazy,

1099
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,600
that got all suspended by Yamster on Christmas day.

1100
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,280
Obviously a beaten up individual bruised by years of haunting,

1101
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,920
not like a sweet, juicy, dribbling tropical mango man

1102
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,040
smothered with affection from caring and giving strangers

1103
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,800
who have taken him under their wing.

1104
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,760
A truly one side affair for which he is overwhelmingly

1105
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,960
the person who takes the benefit of other's selflessness.

1106
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,280
What?

1107
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,840
What?

1108
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:22,480
Wait, is this motherfucker just like a prophet for mangoes?

1109
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,200
I think this motherfucker is an artificial intelligence who is-

1110
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,560
A very slowly and surprisingly sensually becoming self-aware.

1111
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:42,080
Are you telling me right now that Spanky Gaspacho was created-

1112
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:42,960
In a laboratory.

1113
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,440
Absolutely.

1114
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:43,920
In a lab.

1115
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
Okay, I buy it.

1116
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,920
Is it possible that what the deal is,

1117
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,680
is that Spanky Gaspacho represents everything that's wrong with humanity

1118
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,760
and he realizes or she realizes that Mango,

1119
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,480
that Mango boy or whatever they said was the other person,

1120
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,320
is all the good, right?

1121
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:06,960
And while they're in a constant luck struggle

1122
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,000
with their icy nature versus the juicy nature,

1123
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,160
Spanky Gaspacho also realizes the beauty and wonder that is Mango

1124
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,560
and wishes they could just be closer to them

1125
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,080
but knows that their yin and yang like structure

1126
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,520
stops them from ever actually consummating the relationship.

1127
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,600
That was, Travis, the fucking craziest thing you've ever said.

1128
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,600
We have done this podcast for 242-

1129
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,200
And you literally just created a goddamn bonkers religion

1130
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,080
around some whack Yahoo Answers shit that you just found.

1131
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,040
I'm just saying that it's easy for us to judge

1132
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,480
when we don't know the whole story.

1133
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,640
Okay, I'll do- I'll test that theory.

1134
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,920
You're an insane person.

1135
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,240
You're right, that was easy.

1136
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,760
I judged you like that.

1137
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,800
But, Travis, I was having a dissociative episode

1138
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,080
while you were talking because I was so unable

1139
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,240
to process the words coming out of your mouth.

1140
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,120
This podcast is now officially this episode.

1141
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,320
I thought we had some pretty good stuff.

1142
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,080
Adam Levine goofs, I'm into it.

1143
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,320
Now it's the ring and if you listen to it,

1144
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,600
you die seven days later.

1145
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,920
You know what, what you said was so fucking weird.

1146
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,560
You know what, history will prove one of us right

1147
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,240
and one of us wrong, Justin.

1148
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,240
Yeah, it's gonna prove you right.

1149
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,320
Because Justin's gonna be fucking dead and so am I.

1150
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,240
And so is our millions of listeners

1151
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,320
unless they get somebody else to listen to our podcast.

1152
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,760
But not me because Mango will have welcomed me

1153
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,000
into their arms and taken me away from this gazpacho-y planet.

1154
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,840
We get cold and icy human beings.

1155
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,920
This is great viral marketing, I guess,

1156
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,600
unless all of our listeners die,

1157
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,840
in which case it's bad viral marketing.

1158
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,120
Oh, we have one more money zone from the Mango Council.

1159
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,640
Folks, thank you so much for listening

1160
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,920
to my brother, my brother, and me.

1161
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,800
Want to say a huge thanks to Nature Box.

1162
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,920
You can get your free sample box

1163
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,600
of great tasting wholesome snacks

1164
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,120
like BBQ kettle kernels.

1165
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:07,520
Go to naturebox.com or fuck those.

1166
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,600
Get some Parmesan garlic pop pops.

1167
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,800
Well, don't say fuck those about the BBQ kettle kernels.

1168
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,600
I don't think you should fuck the kettle kernels.

1169
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,760
You could try some mango almond bites

1170
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
or some mango fruit chews or some dried mango.

1171
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,280
Or some mango.

1172
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,360
All available at Nature Box.

1173
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,800
Dried mango is not going to give you

1174
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,240
the kind of juice that you need

1175
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,880
to perform your fucking sacrament.

1176
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,280
You're going to have to get the dried mango

1177
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
and then soak it in the holy wine overnight.

1178
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:36,880
What's the holy wine?

1179
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,000
I'll post all the instructions on the Facebook page.

1180
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,200
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother.

1181
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,440
This isn't even like idiosyncratic

1182
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,960
and like, wow, what a weird tangent they went off on.

1183
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,560
Which is what I think all of our listeners

1184
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,840
sound like apparently in my head.

1185
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,560
This is like, Travis, you are on some like

1186
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,280
Charles Manson shit right now.

1187
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:02,080
And I'm like wicked uncomfortable with it.

1188
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah, I don't even think it's funny.

1189
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,880
I don't think it's funny either.

1190
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,520
It's terrifying.

1191
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,280
It's fucking terrifying, yeah.

1192
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,560
I don't know what you want me to say.

1193
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,360
I don't even know where these words are coming from.

1194
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,520
It's like some greater forces just speaking through me.

1195
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,160
You know what I mean?

1196
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,360
I just opened my mouth and the wisdom comes out.

1197
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:20,480
So you've been in LA for all of like three months

1198
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,040
and you're already founding Scientology 2.

1199
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,800
That's so cool.

1200
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,720
This motherfucker's not even founding Scientology 2.

1201
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,640
It's like he's discovered like some fucking

1202
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,160
some fucking curves and angles that are alien to our world.

1203
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,040
Like this motherfucker is like on some fucking

1204
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,320
Miskatonic shit like Arkham Horror.

1205
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,200
Like fucking Cthulhu talking like crazy cult shit.

1206
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,520
Like a new color between orange and yellow

1207
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,640
that's just been there the whole time.

1208
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,680
It's called mango.

1209
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,800
You're on some fucking rats in the wall shit

1210
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,560
and I'm losing my mind.

1211
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,280
I will never-

1212
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,720
At the mouth of mango.

1213
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,760
That's where you're at.

1214
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,720
We're all teetering on the mouth of mango right now.

1215
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:04,080
I will never stop doing this podcast for my entire life.

1216
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,200
As long as all three of us are alive,

1217
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,400
we'll continue to do this podcast.

1218
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,280
That's my promise to you.

1219
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,880
I wish to God this could be our final episode

1220
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,920
because this would be the best,

1221
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
the craziest finale of a podcast ever.

1222
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,120
Worse than Seinfeld.

1223
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,560
Hands down.

1224
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,000
Zero stars.

1225
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,760
Would not recommend F-minus.

1226
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,160
I hope this is the episode that somebody gives to a friend

1227
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,480
that's like man you gotta listen to the show.

1228
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,840
You gotta listen to the show.

1229
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,880
Oh God I'm safe.

1230
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,240
Get it?

1231
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,760
Get it?

1232
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:40,800
Oh Jesus.

1233
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,160
We're doing two live shows.

1234
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,200
If you're not dead,

1235
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,360
if you go to MBMBAM Chicago,

1236
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,520
bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM Chicago.

1237
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,600
Doing a show there on April 5th.

1238
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,400
We saw bones.

1239
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,560
Bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM,

1240
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,280
or sorry.

1241
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,040
Bit.ly forward slash M-I-L-M-B-M-B-A-M

1242
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,280
and that'll let you get tickets for our show

1243
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,640
at Turner Hall Ballroom in Milwaukee.

1244
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,840
Tickets that are basically almost sold out.

1245
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,640
Like so if you hear this and you wanna go,

1246
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,080
like go get tickets right now

1247
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,120
because they are,

1248
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,120
I mean out of last count where were they?

1249
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,000
They were.

1250
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,040
Yeah we have like 10 left.

1251
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,680
And we're also doing a show in Minnesota

1252
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,640
or in Minneapolis,

1253
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
but we're already sold out on that one.

1254
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,200
But we do need questions for all three shows.

1255
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,880
So if you're going to be at the shows,

1256
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,880
send us an email, MBMBAM at maximumfund.org

1257
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,520
and make sure to put in the subject line

1258
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,440
like for Chicago live show,

1259
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,800
for Minneapolis live show or for Milwaukee live show.

1260
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,480
So we make sure to ask the questions

1261
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,080
at the right ones that you're gonna be at.

1262
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
We'll also be taking some audience questions

1263
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,160
which if you haven't been to a live show in the past

1264
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,760
come with the question ready.

1265
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,720
Not a bummer.

1266
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,160
It's gotta be happy and an actual question for advice.

1267
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,280
Not something like, you know,

1268
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,240
why do you think such and such did such and such?

1269
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,400
We've got a couple of those questions this week

1270
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,480
which they're very funny to read,

1271
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,360
but they're not very actionable as far as advice goes.

1272
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:13,040
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1273
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,640
who used for our theme song is Departure

1274
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,920
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1275
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,560
It is a terrific album.

1276
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:22,320
I'm still waiting on that new shit someday.

1277
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,200
Some day we're gonna get it.

1278
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,240
I was listening to the other night

1279
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,920
having a dinner party and my friends like cool album.

1280
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,120
I was like, thanks.

1281
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,960
I didn't record it, but I purchased it.

1282
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,520
No, you should just say you recorded it.

1283
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,720
We've got Max Fund Drive.

1284
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,840
I am John Roderick.

1285
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,320
We've got Max Fund Drive coming up.

1286
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,880
It starts the 16th and it runs for two weeks.

1287
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,560
Max Fund Drive is your opportunity

1288
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,120
to support all of the amazing Max Fund shows.

1289
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,720
And it's our chance to give you

1290
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,560
some of our best content of the year.

1291
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,640
And if you become a new donor

1292
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,080
or if you upgrade your donation

1293
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,680
you're gonna get some really incredible pledge gifts.

1294
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:57,680
In the past, there's been things like tote bags

1295
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,480
and like really cool Max Fund engraved tumblers

1296
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,200
and stuff like that.

1297
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,800
So there's all different levels of donation

1298
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:05,920
and all of it helps.

1299
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,200
And so starting the 16th running for two weeks

1300
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,880
we're gonna ask you to really step up

1301
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,680
and to commit to some monthly donations

1302
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,920

1303
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,360

And like, and growing.

1308
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,840
Like we have been able to grow

1309
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,960
not just like this show where we've been able

1310
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,720
to like plan and do live show mini tours

1311
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,600
and stuff like that

1312
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,760
but like stuff like the Adventure Zone

1313
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,840
and Bunker Buddies and Sawbones.

1314
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:42,160
Like we have started doing all of that stuff

1315
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,040
since we joined Max Fund

1316
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,040
because we have the freedom and the support to do it

1317
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,640
because of these donations.

1318
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,040
Quite literally, like because of the donations

1319
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,440
like I was able to move here

1320
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,880
and advance a lot of stuff for all of our podcasts

1321
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,240
and start a lot of new stuff.

1322
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,480
So like it really does go to support the shows you love.

1323
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,160
Yeah, thank you all.

1324
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:04,880
Thank you all very, very much.

1325
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,160

I'm doing three Max Fund podcasts.

1332
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,480
It's always hard to keep track of which show

1333
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,680
I'm doing at any given time.

1334
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,200
So Adventure Zone, where we play D&D with our dad.

1335
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,480
We're gonna have some special Pledge Drive episodes

1336
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,360
coming up with that.

1337
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,840
Bunker Buddies that I do with Andy Bolt

1338
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,480

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,840
I have been on a Sawbones binge lately.

1341
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,560
Listened to like eight episodes in the last two days.

1342
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,360
Thank you.

1343
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:41,840
You're welcome.

He does that with his wife, Sydney.

1345
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,760
It's a comedy medical show

1346
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,080
about like the fucked up history of medicine.

1347
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,760
It's really amazing.

1348
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,920
It's Teresa's favorite show on the network.

1349
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,880
Burn.

1350
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,120
That's right, Rachel's too, I think.

1351
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:55,680

Hit me.

1359

Yajru Druid, Drew Davenport.

1361

Thank you, Drew.

1363
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Dave something.

1364
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,800
Dave, something's gone wrong.

1365
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,280
It says, I haven't seen this error message before,

1366
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,160
but I'm highlighting their name to see what the name is.

1367
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,680
And all I'm getting is sorry.

1368
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,280
It appears something's gone wrong.

1369
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,880

1370
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,840

my son acts like Kramer from Seinfeld.

1373
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,280
