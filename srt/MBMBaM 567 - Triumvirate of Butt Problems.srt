1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,860
Hello welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,860
Hello, this is your sweet, baby brother Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:33,100
Even though a lot of people like to pretend it isn't the case like my grandpa Dan. This is my job

12
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,680
Yeah, this is my office. You're in my office. This is on my

13
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:43,420
Courtroom did I record this show last Friday for an audience of our beloved friends?

14
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,540
I did. Yeah, did I record this show again on the following Monday? Yes. Yes

15
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,580
I did my recording it now again on the Friday following that Monday making our

16
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,060
third performance in

17
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,660
Seven days. Yes, but this is my office

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,640
This is where I work. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we also

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,460
Travis you're interrupting me at work. I know I'm interrupting at work, but we did also do you I guess at our other job

20
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:17,780
Adventure zone and saw bones and trainers and wonderful. Are those separate jobs or is in the same office?

21
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,300
I'm lost my office to this different offices different offices different jobs. Same

22
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,160
Coliseum, it's just us versus all the other

23
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,300
So, what about when we do business meetings and stuff that's also in the battle area and when we do phone calls

24
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,200
gymnasium

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,560
Wait, are we fighting? Are we doing our job battle knives?

26
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,460
Why I'm just my office this is my office was it an office where you do battle it's an office

27
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,380
It's a studio. It's a gymnasium. It's an art. Thank you

28
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,140
Dream scene it's a fucking surfboard

29
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,140
Wait, what? It's a fucking a subway sandwich restaurant. It's a fucking pop-up tent

30
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:12,940
It's a desk sucks compared to your guys. Yeah, it's a desk. It's my it's my father my mother

31
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,260
It's my it's it's my desk. Why and that's your desk. It's a Coliseum

32
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,860
It's my studio space my work zone. This is everything. This podcast is everything to me

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
I just want to reinforce that like

34
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,620
We take how to seriously we take this and I got a lot of people

35
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,540
Don't get like they'll just listen to it. And this is just gonna

36
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,340
Beyond but some people listen to this at a faster speed that we recorded it and like I don't want to be the person

37
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,780
It's how you this but I will be it's not sustainable because I can't do them faster

38
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:59,060
You're gonna you're gonna use them all up. That's not sustainable. I want to reinforce sustainable use of podcast

39
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,220
Yeah, when there's not sustainable usage when you harvest a podcast you have to plant another podcast in its place, right?

40
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,780
Yes, you got a cycle through podcasts, you know what I mean?

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,300
Like we've got it

42
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,660
We've stretched this taffy out as far as she'll go if we're not careful

43
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,940
We're gonna we're gonna have a podcast dust bowl people

44
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,180
I've been saying this for years now, but we gotta let some of the fields rest. They're gonna go to dust

45
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,140
they're gonna live it up all the podcast cows are gonna get buried in podcast dirt and

46
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,140
It's gonna be a real problem down in podcast, Oklahoma

47
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,260
And Travis is doing his best by starting a bunch of podcasts and then letting them die

48
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,820
Then burying their corpses in the grounds to let their nutrients enrich the soil for the next podcast

49
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:53,740
I killed how Lublin seven years ago. The next podcast are the mushrooms that grow on the corpse of Travis is abandoned by

50
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,500
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing my best

51
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:07,060
I even started I started streaming just to use up less podcast resources. You guys are welcome

52
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,900
Thank you for that. Your streams are the compost. Yeah

53
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,260
Television show this is what people don't know is I started streaming and I stopped creating podcasts

54
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,020
But I'm still cancelling podcasts at the same rate. So now I'm creating more

55
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,380
I've cancelled other people's podcasts at this point, you know how your favorite podcast listener at home got cancelled. I did that. You're welcome

56
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,220
Yeah, true

57
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,540
Well, we still got to do this one though. And I do we yes we do because this is our office. Oh, right

58
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:49,700
Firefighter doesn't go into the office and say I put out three fires this week. I'm done. I'm done with fires people

59
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:56,020
Still need us, you know, but here's the thing. Hey you guys ever think about if a firefighter goes into work and doesn't do anything

60
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
All day, that's a good day

61
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:03,300
Right, like if I didn't do shit today people like awesome

62
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,340
Congratulations, Jim, but when I do that people are like, where's the podcast Travis? Yeah

63
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,780
Yeah, the work you do is about on par with fire firefighters

64
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,740
Well, I'm not allowed to take an easy day like a firefighter who doesn't get an alarm. You know what I mean?

65
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,940
What's he doing all day or do you think they you think they hit snooze sometimes?

66
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,220
Yeah on the fire a fire alarm because off five more minutes

67
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,140
It depends on how many alarms it is if it's a five alarm fire

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,140
They gotta be there, right two or one of you five cute little fire

69
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Oh one is like a somebody dropped like a lit cigarette in the trashcan, but it's outside and the trash cans made of metal

70
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,420
So it's definitely a fire and there's a little figure itself out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, eventually

71
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:55,060
The trash all burn up and then is that good? We don't know we don't know yet, but it's all stardust, isn't it?

72
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
Yeah star stuff, baby

73
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,340
Yeah, okay. This is an advice show. We help people here believe it or not. You're having fun

74
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,060
Just sit there and enjoy it. Just sit here and

75
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:13,500
Fucking guzzle it. This might be grandpa's last podcast sit there and enjoy it

76
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
We're gonna have a good time together as a family

77
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:21,100
You can go, you know watch a hollow cube on tik-tok after this right now

78
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:28,700
You're gonna have a media delivered either way God attended at one point zero X or slower

79
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,180
or slower

80
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:38,260
Favorite to preserve our limited podcast only you can preserve

81
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
And you know what stop listening

82
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,540
Yeah, that's we would not to keep making them laugh more pause every time you laugh

83
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,860
And died eight years ago and his brain is in a jar. They won't let it stop podcasting. Well, let him die

84
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,940
You know listen to podcast the way sting would that's what I say, you know

85
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,700
I mean five minutes listen two hours off on a beach. I would stay listen to a podcast because

86
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Probably in a really cool oil

87
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Tantric thing but like he probably has a giant podcasting sweater

88
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:25,980
He slips on when he's ready to enjoy one and a huge bug that he uses for his podcasting kombucha

89
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,580
Oh see

90
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,860
I was thinking more he would be in some kind of like floating sensory deprivation chamber where the podcast is all around him and he is

91
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,340
In the podcast and the podcast is him and he fully experiences it with every like ounce of his body

92
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,940
One time sting was like, yeah

93
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,740
I like to take my time before I nut and the rest of us lost our fucking minds and painted this picture

94
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,020
I bet you sting. Here's my thing about sting. I bet you he's the most vanilla acid boring dude in the whole world

95
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,620
It's just one time. He said yeah, I like to not nut immediately and we're all like, wow, what a god

96
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,940
Be my sharpest thing. Yeah, I just like to when I'm having sex I don't like to jizz like instantly Wow

97
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,100
Wow, look at this fucking hippie

98
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Hippie dippie doo-doo

99
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,260
Like his name is Gordon Sumner no one ever mentioned it again

100
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,980
I just don't go full at it right away cuz I'm worried about you know

101
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,300
Jizzin too soon, so I take my time in these fields of gold the man can't even release new music

102
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,740
Cuz we were like he certainly waited before he nutted on this one. Yeah

103
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,620
So is that something anyone could do just like start publicly talking about how that they like to wait before they not and get a

104
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,300
Reputation for like tantric shit cuz you really cool

105
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,700
Yeah

106
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:00,900
Yeah

107
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,580
Is that just a thing like cuz I don't feel like I feel like sting would be like I'm really cool and I wait

108
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Before I nut and everyone went okay

109
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:14,500
Well, what an awesome no one went fuck used to prove it. Yeah, this is starting to feel like

110
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,540
Tantric advice at this point, please read the I just think I just think it's a you brought the point up

111
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,660
That's the only thing we talked about a more of his thing is that he likes to wait a bit

112
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,980
What else does he do? I've gotten really into sourdough lately. I

113
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,780
Mean, here's the thing

114
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,100
He's doing like duets with shaggy and no one wants to talk about it like in a hundred years

115
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,700
It should be like some popular musical artists of the 1980s and 90s were staying a guy that let's take a second

116
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,260
Music does it you it's lost the time. I honestly don't remember

117
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,580
The only thing we captured was that he liked to take a bit before he nuts

118
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
It might just be a breath

119
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,820
We don't right if they let him fit if they had let him finish which is already a challenge

120
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,580
He would have been like, yeah, I'd like to take my time when I have sex

121
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,100
It takes me like seven minutes to do it

122
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:23,140
It's not bad sting so I'm sorry IMDb said he wrote two episodes of Lucifer that can't be right

123
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,460
Okay, it can't be right sting wrote two episodes of

124
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:35,860
Lucifer listen it listen was a writer on two episodes of of Lucifer, but that's got to be wrong. I can't be true

125
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:44,060
Oh, no, sorry. He wrote songs on the soundtrack for this series Lucifer. He did not write two episodes. I was about to say

126
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,460
Okay, my wonderful father-in-law has a trail camera

127
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,460
She has no trail cameras. It's a camera

128
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,220
Automatic camera that takes oh

129
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,900
Yeah trail care. I should have waited for the context clues here that he uses at his house in rural

130
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,760
Virginia to capture photos of the surrounding wildlife between one and four times a week

131
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,260
He will email us photos of deer bears turkeys and coyotes from the camera. Although mostly it's deer. Mm-hmm

132
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,020
I've run out of ways to respond to email photos of these woodland friends

133
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:19,580
And if we don't respond he texts us and says did you see my photo?

134
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:25,720
What are some good ways to respond to email photos of a deer? That's from befuddled in Brooklyn. I

135
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,300
Love these beautiful animals. Yeah

136
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,900
But we have deer that come in our front yard literally every day oh, yeah gobble gobble up the jasmine and

137
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,420
It's it doesn't bother me. It's like

138
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm sure you guys are getting more out of this than I am

139
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,220
Mm-hmm, but I I have become completely

140
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,380
Inoculated to deer unless I saw one that had big antlers the other day. Oh, yeah, that's the best. That's great

141
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,940
That's I don't know why that's so awesome

142
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,940
I don't know why there's a natural thing when you see a deer that has big antlers where you're like

143
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,660
That's different and awesome

144
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,020
And I don't know how that instinct turns into and I'm gonna kill you because of it

145
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,960
Because of how many antlers you have and how big they are that's so awesome and different. You must die

146
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,320
I'll

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
Have them. Thank you

148
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,080
There's another end of that spectrum there too when I see a little youngling a tiny deer who's maybe even a little wobbly need

149
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,920
And I'm gonna protect you with my everything and then there's the between deer where I'm just like fuck off

150
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Get out of the fucking way

151
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,520
Grow antlers the air coming in our yard all the time and every time my dogs go absolutely bananas

152
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:48,000
But especially my little dog buttercup who weighs about 30 pounds and I know what the fuck you gonna do if I let you out

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,520
There right now you're gonna take down that deer buttercup bullshit

154
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,840
sometimes Pete you get too hung up on that you need to create a

155
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,400
Memorable response to something, you know, I sometimes it not everyone has to be gold

156
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,920
Sometimes it could just be like hey nice shot. Yeah cool here cool here. I love it. Love this nice shot. All right, I'm gonna take a

157
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,840
shot in the dark and say your father-in-law might be retired and

158
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Sounds like he enjoys this and he maybe has not processed whether other people enjoy it

159
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,200
So he assumes other people enjoy it at the same level. He enjoys that and simply acknowledging the exchange

160
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,080
He feels like he's giving you something

161
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,560
All you need to do is acknowledge it and say cool deer and that's it help and get on to the gram. Oh

162
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,120
Everybody could appreciate is his great one and all you have to do is like it

163
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,040
All you gotta do is one quick like and then he knows you saw it

164
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,520
You don't got a comment or nothing then you can share with all your friends

165
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,200
You know this great deer this one. This one's a good one everybody

166
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,360
Well, what's more likely is that he won't get a lot of engagement on his deer picks and that's how he finds out

167
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,240
It's like oh fuck. These are actually. Oh wait, these don't have the cool. They don't have a lot of antlers. That's boring

168
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,520
I mean to be fair griffin doesn't sell he's getting a lot of engagement now, right?

169
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,600
But why not have the internet break that to him and have you have to do it?

170
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
Maybe you could find some really juggy deers

171
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
You fucking dog

172
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,520
He's gonna get some juggy deers and then he's gonna get

173
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,600
What is that even what's that?

174
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,580
Think about it. Yeah, think about it. There's deer that can get it. You know what I mean? The ones that humans like

175
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,880
Does tasty be anybody can like it like a nice chuggy deer people can be at the deers. It's 2021

176
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,080
This stop this was this was acceptable. I think no no no no listen listen listen listen

177
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,520
This was acceptable for like the first two times you guys were talking about it

178
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,680
And then I think for a minute and a half was way too long to talk about it. Well, I'm sorry

179
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,180
We talked about it for seven minutes. I'm assuming they that Rachel trimmed it a little bit

180
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,960
We did about a seven minutes of junky deer material. Yeah, I got it. I got another suggestion. I

181
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
Got another suggestion for you

182
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,460
You can after your father-in-law sit. I say his name's Dave after Dave since you picture of a deer

183
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:21,660
Be like this is great Dave you gotta have some more pictures of deer and then be like, oh, yeah

184
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,580
No problem. And then when you get those pictures, you're like, oh, these are pretty good

185
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,380
But you I gotta get some more great pictures

186
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,900
He just keep asking for more and more and more pictures and so he runs out and he's like

187
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,700
This is getting a little bit irritating. I don't I don't really want to send you it anymore. Oh

188
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:43,940
So just you're just saying ruin the relationship. No, I'm just saying like if you get real thirsty for deer pigs

189
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,220
Yeah, eventually he will run out of them. You got any pics of the deer's feet

190
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Dave

191
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,000
You got to be more subtle with that they're like, oh cool pic

192
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,300
I love how you got a good shot of the feet there and then sort of slowly guide him like oh nice man feet looking bigger

193
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,800
Just over and over again. Oh, man, there should be a name for a deer feet

194
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,300
You can also ask him to just hold on to them

195
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:16,900
And so like maybe the last day of the month and then just like let him let him loose and like a huge bodacious wave

196
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:22,480
Or just like ask him to save them all up and make a coffee table book for you for Christmas

197
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,620
Or a flip book. Yeah put all of them in one thing and it's a flip book. Yeah, shitty not like

198
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,000
Mule linear flip book or it's just like bear turkey bear turkey turkey

199
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,300
Dear dear dear dear dear bear turkey be our dear if you flip it quick enough. It's a crime against God in nature

200
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,100
You know what sucks about this if I get pics of turkeys who cares deers who cares coyotes?

201
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,500
Yeah, who cares but if I get pics of bears, I'm like fucking cool

202
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,020
Look at the size it look at the size of that unit. So you can't shut the hose off

203
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,900
Nope, cuz that will mean no more bear pics

204
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,420
No

205
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:03,300
This is like this is a wildlife blind bag and you you have to buy it to see if you get a bear in there

206
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,100
Yeah, chase bear. Yeah bear in there. Whoo. Is this a shiny holographic bear? I love it

207
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,020
The the summer months are upon us and it's the things are a little bit different this year and I don't know about you all

208
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:22,420
But the place I've been most excited to get out to now that we've really cracked this thing

209
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,900
By which I mean coven by which I mean, it's still an issue is the skate park

210
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:35,180
Okay, and so I did I received I talked to the wizard of the cloud via Maria who sent this

211
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,820
Wikihow article in and it's super important. Does Maria work for the wizard?

212
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,140
Maria is a

213
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Apprentice apprentice. Yes

214
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,140
Basically, so the answer is yes, but unpaid

215
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,340
You're better than that. The wizard of the cloud has so much knowledge and power but is

216
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:59,420
Just kind of a shitty as a like ethically as a person. Oh, yeah, I guess an entity

217
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,780
I guess the wizard isn't I'm pretty sure you don't get to be a wizard without being kind of shitty. Sure

218
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,820
Yeah, so anyway, this is gonna teach us how to differentiate between a real skater and a poser skater. Oh, thank God. Yeah

219
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:17,020
Lot of it is watch them skate Wow. Okay, which then we're getting a little bit into

220
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,040
Let's test your let's test your I guess this whole article is about let's test your cred out

221
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,520
But there's ways of doing it

222
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,000
That's not gonna make you look like a huge creep running up on them while they skate and say like do a fucking trick

223
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,200
Do a fucking trick. Let's see it one test their knowledge in a conversation

224
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,640
Ask for bait listen for basic skateboard terms and slang like real skaters are gonna talk real skaters are gonna talk about

225
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:45,240
Frontside and backside tricks. Yeah, they're gonna use basic skateboard terms like pop and kickflip

226
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,680
Listen for one of the most basic terms of all ollie. Yeah, they won't say things like I

227
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,080
I so I hauled a bunch of perps in the station this weekend. It was a great

228
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,760
They won't say anything like who wants a pepperoni on another pizza pie because that's a pizza restaurant worker

229
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,940
Now Griffin skater will typically talk about Ollie's and kickflips

230
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,620
They won't say things about your driveshaft because that's a car person now Griffin

231
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,560
Are you scared that in doing this article publicly?

232
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:20,200
What you're really doing is teaching people what other people are looking for out of real skaters and you're right

233
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,960
You're teaching people to pose more effectively. You're right. You could say one of these terms

234
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:33,640
This first one's I think fake and actually Travis has the uroboros has wrapped all the way around and this article is in fact

235
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,200
A test to see who is a real skater or not because the first term they list here is a slappy

236
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,760
I don't know that kickflip. I've heard a vert. Yes tweak I guess stall sure shifty

237
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,520
Huh kick turn no and mob not real

238
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,400
Some of those are not real slappy is definitely not real when you mess up my trick and your board flips up in the air

239
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,320
And smacks you in the face and you cry a little bit you cry

240
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,160
I mean, that's what that's and you look shifty

241
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,480
But it's a good way to ingratiate yourself to other skaters because skaters are very caring and nurturing a lot

242
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,140
And so when you slap yourself in the face and a single tear rolls down

243
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,240
They'll immediately want to make you feel better and take you out for ice cream and maybe some fries

244
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,400
And then that a better result from this than trying to shame somebody for whether or not they like actually know about skateboarding

245
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,880
Hey, here's a little here's it. Here's a test

246
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,940
Here's a fucking Blade Runner test for how to really catch him in your dragnet

247
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,320
You could try asking something like so have you mastered a kickflip on a vert ramp yet?

248
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,680
Or have you seen Robert do kickflips? He has huge pop

249
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,020
What is this person the article tried to do

250
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,880
Prove whether or not somebody's a real or a

251
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,940
phony fake yeah, we're going to fight void confing some

252
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,420
Void confidence fucking skater poser. Yeah, this article should say watch them skate for five seconds

253
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:59,240
It's a fall over and cry for a half hour and then have their dad come pick him up

254
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,380
They're probably faking it but they just that even that assumes that if I Travis McElroy write down

255
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,080
I have never skateboarded in my life if I went down to a store and bought one

256
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't even know where I would do that and went to a skate park and tried to skate that people would be like

257
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,960
He's trying to pose as a real skater, and I'd be like clearly. I'm not clearly

258
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
There's nothing about what I'm doing right now that implies that I think I'm doing a good job

259
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,680
I'm trying to learn and people might yell poser and I'd say no. I'm just beginning

260
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,680
This is a second phase of my lifestyle, and I'm just learning right now

261
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,600
This is a shitty skater is not a poser

262
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
Yeah, no no

263
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,720
But if someone is just sitting on the sidelines holding a board that they've clearly scrapped up with a pocketknife or something and they're going

264
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,180
That's a bad jump bounce that you did now that my friends

265
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,520
That's about how lazy is that person that they wouldn't even learn the word kickflip. I know

266
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,940
Where were they gonna learn it Griffin? Yeah, that's fair

267
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,900
You could try asking do you hold your board by the trucks or deck do you think it matters now?

268
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,120
That's that one might actually catch me ask if they ride regular or goofy now listen

269
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,360
A poser is gonna hear this and say well. I don't ride goofy. Oh, I'm a fucking kick-ass skater

270
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,800
I'm a good skater a real serious one. Do you say why do you think max goof would say max goof?

271
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,880
Especially nothing

272
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,200
Movie do you think he would be like I ride goofy or even if he knew what he was talking was like?

273
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,560
I don't want to be like my dad goofy aka George Keefe

274
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,480
We can all agree that max from goofy movie is a fucking poser skater

275
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:36,200
Wow, hey fuck off. Hey Griffin fuck off. Bart Simpson is a poser. Yeah, sure

276
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,880
I mean like you see him he skates once and then he'll go two years without skating that is yeah

277
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,560
And then they'll see him skate again. It's like okay, so you do you love it?

278
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,480
Do you live for it? Do you live for the grind the daily grind?

279
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Well, he might also just be doing it when he's not on camera

280
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,080
That's possible. Yeah

281
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,680
Ask them about their board ask what material it's made out of do you tighten or loosen your trucks when you get on your board?

282
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:06,200
What type of arch do you have on your deck? You know real stompers for a person?

283
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,880
Who can't just look at their fucking skateboard and say oh, it's got a

284
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,760
Let's see. It's like some tribal art and

285
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,080
Some fire. Yeah, try the Martian on there. It's pretty good. Yep

286
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,280
Um ask who their favorite skaters and skate brands are

287
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:32,040
They'll know more pro names than Tony Hawk BAM and Ryan Sheckler. Damn it. I'm out. Damn it. I'm out of them

288
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,220
They will know about a few name brands. Even if it's a negative opinion. It's still knowledge. Ooh

289
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,840
That's a good way around it. Is Stussy one? Stussy, Birdhouse

290
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Girlfriend

Wham-o wham-o slam-o brand silly skateboard big kicks

296
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:10,000
Skateboard skate boys skate boys skate men's we can go to the person and just be like hey get this phony Hawk

297
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,000
And if they look at your like arm busted

298
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,720
Then you got them, but look at you like god, that's funny. Hey if they carry their board by the trucks

299
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,640
That's called a mall grab and it's usually considered to be a poser red flag

300
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,980
Let me continue because the next point is there's a lot of controversy about whether or not the mall grab truly indicates your opposer since a lot

301
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,080
Of skaters these days do hold their boards like that. So in conclusive so in

302
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Conclusion this is a bad article

303
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:44,240
Watch them then there's a whole section as I watch them skate study what they do watch them follow them watch them skate

304
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,880
I just feel like

305
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,080
Should be one right? It should be number one

306
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:54,120
No, just yeah, cuz someone could be a bad skater and not a poser, right?

307
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Yeah, I'm gonna be a very good skater and be a poser

308
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,680
That's true classic poser moves include just standing around chatting smoking cigarettes

309
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,360
Oh, that's thing and getting old and I'm gonna say vapes in there, too

310
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,760
Oh texting and get only a poser

311
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,080
Even has their vape rig on them at the skate park because they could fall down on it and either

312
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,620
Break the glass on or explode the battery. Yeah, that's why I built mine into my board. I got ohms everywhere

313
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,120
I got ohms all over my pants

314
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,600
I do this thing where I go up in the air off I vert off the kid flip and then I hold the board up

315
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,640
In the air and just rip a big grip right off the end of the board

316
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,200
And then when I come down I let go of a big cloud and I call it puff of the magic wagon

317
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:46,160
So they've these are getting more intrusive you watch them study them ask them to do tricks they'll say like no

318
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I can't right now. I'm sick and you say oh

319
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:56,800
Here I'm here. You should be at home. I brought medicine for you. Take the medicine and fucking ollie, but then the next one is

320
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,760
inspect their appearance

321
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
Examine them for scrapes and bruises

322
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah, if you skate you're gonna fall off your board and get scraped off

323
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,120
Even if you're good when you're coming up with new tricks, you're gonna fuck you you will I've been skating for years

324
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,160
I don't fall ever. I have never been scraped or scratched while doing my art on the board

325
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,720
Sometimes when I'm skating I will fall into the air

326
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,760
That's how good I am. I look out for name-brand clothing because that means that they're a poser

327
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,360
There's a lot of stuff in here. I'm sure there's good skaters who had just I just bought these shoes

328
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,360
That's why they're not scuffed up fuck off

329
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:38,120
Phony, oh phony jabroni. No, I just got off work at Orange Julius. That's why my shirt says it

330
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,980
Let's take a quick break and head on into the money zone

331
00:27:43,980 --> 00:28:00,380

379
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,180
So it's like this is quiet, but like the the combination of vowels is maybe a little bit different

380
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,140
yeah, like my what would be a good name for like

381
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,700

00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,540

I want a Munch Squid

386
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,820
Hi, why I want a Munch Why

Why dump up up up up up up up?

388
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,480
This is gonna freak you guys out. You guys know the naked chicken chalupa. Yeah, right

389
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,980
Listen this

390
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
They're doing

391
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Oh

392
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,020
Vegetarians are just like us and they want to be dirt bags

393
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,340
Sometimes and this will let them simulate be an absolute dirt bags

394
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,180
It's it's really the main thing they miss out on yeah is getting to live like stay up there

395
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:26,140
They have ways of getting protein and all the strong beef power that I get when I eat a big hamburger

396
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:30,520
But what they don't usually get is that I feel like shit after I eat most meals

397
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,820
Yeah, listen when vegans get drunk they want to make food mistakes, too

398
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,140
You know yes when they're hungover they want to get rumbly tumbly and it gives them the vegan shits later, too

399
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,140
You know what I mean, so let's do this thing

400
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,900
Yeah, everybody an equal opportunity to make bad life choices the naked chalupa

401
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:53,900
This is actually called the naked chalupa with a crispy plant-based shell awesome name

402
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:01,300
Really actual name really described as a new menu innovation that gives vegetarian and veggie curious

403
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,560
I've been looking for a way to get into vegetables

404
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:14,180
This is just a gateway drug I require a new menu innovation that gives vegetarian and veggie curious fans everywhere reasons to

405
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,060
Celebrate oh

406
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,100
Now hold on wait is that spelled

407
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:27,580
Sh-e-l-l a break or did it say do a share impression while you say this next part celebrate, okay?

408
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,860
celebrate so it's

409
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,460
You want one no problem because they're everywhere

410
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:41,100
Oh in the kitchen of the Taco Bell at two two two two Barranca Parkway in Irvine, California

411
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:48,460
Damn it. You got me kid Justin from now until June 27th fucking Marty McFly go get you one

412
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,900
Why would you get you one? They're everywhere and here for good

413
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,700
As long as you can kill my good time and make it to Irvine

414
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,940
So that is happening there Wendy's

415
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,900
What is it constituted?

416
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,020
What is it?

417
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,180
This is the most sinister thing about it is they don't say what it is

418
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,900
It's just you don't know you probably shouldn't worry about it. No. I'm worried about it

419
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,660
I know what I know about like the impossible burger and seitan and tofu and all that jazz, but

420
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,740
Yeah, they'll never mention this fit this yeah, don't worry about it

421
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:26,980
They're doing it. They're they're still working with beyond meat to make fake Taco Bell meat

422
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,540
So like this is you don't need this with us. This is not this is never going to be a good concern

423
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,980
You'll never hear about this thing in you'll never see it again

424
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,260
Okay, Wendy's on the other hand is wants to get into the mix with

425
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,740
the in the plant-based category with a

426
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Spicy black bean burger. Oh

427
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
Right now man. That's pretty good

428
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:52,060
but so Aaron Bennett is the manager of culinary production innovation and

429
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
her team

430
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,260
Helped create this this spicy new product meant for flexitarians, huh?

431
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,660
I don't know if you guys know about this

432
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,420
this term but flexitarians

433
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:12,500
According to John Lee the vice president of culinary innovation who describes it as

434
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,900
Not your parents or your grandparents black bean burger

435
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:25,140
So I mr. Lee I do agree that neither my parents nor my naughty or my grandmother

436
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,860
Barbara Allen would have enjoyed a black bean burger

437
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:34,420
I can't we are in agreement. Hey, can we not blow past the flexitarian thing?

438
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:39,220
Is that somebody who sometimes eats vegetables and sometimes he's me because there's another name for that

439
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,840
There's a definitely another name for that. It's omnivore

440
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,780
It's a yeah, it's a it's some of the centers on plat plant foods

441
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,180
But every once in a while you're like a bit of meat, please. That's nothing

442
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,660
Huh, I don't know what you I don't know what you want from me

443
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:02,740
I'm just here to tell you about the spicy black bean burger. Okay, uh, they explored 70 to 80 different options during the process

444
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:08,140
Wow, and this is what they came to we have a this is I tell you man fucking John Lee

445
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,100
Who I don't know that we featured on the show before a bunch squad

446
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,780
Which is I should have mentioned earlier. It's a podcast then podcast that profiles lazy crazy brandy

447
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,620
John Lee is bringing it

448
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:27,820
He says we have a lot of equity and a lot of strength and a lot of understanding in terms of what our customers want

449
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,940
Jesus part of it is flavor. Yeah in the world of paint plant-based protein

Hey, wait, just a lot of stop you real quick

452
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,100
Customers at a food place wanted to be able to taste the food. Okay

453
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,140
Yeah part listen to John Lee's bringing some fucking heat to you

454
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,260
Now part of it is flavor in the world of plant-based protein

455
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,300
There are a lot of products out there that are just substitutes and they end up getting

456
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,780
built in sandwiches that I call

457
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,180
Okay. Oh

458
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,980
snap, that's

459
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,180
Amazing. They're not flavorful. Yeah, they're bullshit the way Aaron built this

460
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
It really is craveable. I

461
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,340
I don't miss eating me. I swear to God on my dad's grave

462
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:26,980
I swear on the grave of my father John Lee senior. This burger is craveable may Christ

463
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,480
I'll bleed if I'm wrong you you take this knife

464
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,020
You hold in your hand in your other hand taste this burger if I'm wrong on what you stab me directly in the heart

465
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:45,340
May coven 19 be supplanted by a far more vicious cove in 2022

466
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,620
That wife's humanity for the face the earth, but god damn it. This is craveable

467
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:59,160
I love this fucking burger and I don't I don't miss eating meat when I eat that spicy black bean

468
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,380
Not even my ex-wife. I love this burger. I don't miss a fucking second of it

469
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,700
It's not just a black bean says John Lee

470
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,760
Okay, it's all the components together that give it the right texture the right flavor

471
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:18,140
Nutritional profile that we felt good about now. We're focused on taste first. I mean no no no about it

472
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,420
big T

473
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,860
Little in is what I call it. Why what?

474
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:32,860
No say that again cuz that was wild that was now we're focused on taste first make no doubt about it

475
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:39,060
Big T. Little in is what I call it big get the taste, right? Make sure it looks fantastic

476
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,060
Nutrition comes second. Oh, okay. Okay

477
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,780
big taste

478
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,780
little nutrition little nutrition

479
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,180
Big taste and a little nutrition. Hey, hey, um

480
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,540
Lee I think you're pushing the wrong thing here. No, no, no

481
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,660
I let him know that it tastes great and it's bad for you. Yeah, that's the yeah

482
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:08,740
You don't have to say that part. That's what we want you to skip over next time buddy

483
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,820
So all these ingredients, okay beyond the patty

484
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,620
This is like the longest interview of it's an interview on QSR the longest interview I've ever seen about a sandwich

485
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,580
What are the odds that they call them to just get like a quick quote and he would not let them off the phone

486
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:30,820
Guys, I tell you I fucking hate vegetables fucking hate him hate him, but this is when I eat these

487
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:35,100
It doesn't make me want to barf like every other time I eat vegetables. I've never felt anything before

488
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:41,180
I held my own baby in my arms. I look at his face. I love nothing. I took one bite of this burger

489
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,020
I cried for the first time in my life out of happiness

490
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,180
Beyond the patty we wanted to focus is Aaron Bennett again beyond the patty

491
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:55,740
We want to really focus on having some texture and flavor contrast as I mentioned not wanting to have that mushy

492
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,980
boring

493
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,180
Experience that we see in so many other places. So we added a lot of really nice

494
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,980
Crisp fresh produce. Oh, yeah, like onions and tomatoes and romaine lettuce

495
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,820
Then we have this really cool new ingredient crispy chipotle jalapeno

496
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:19,020
They're actually jalapenos that are see which is like so weird that you have a specify that era. Yeah

497
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,620
Oh these things these jalapenos

498
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:29,180
They're actually jalapenos that are seasoned with a chipotle seasoning that perfectly complements the spicy the spicy

499
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,940
Black bean patty itself and we topped with chipotle sauce and then they really come together in addition to nice

500
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,340
Creamy cool

501
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:45,580
Pepper jack cheese. Hell. Yeah. Hell. Yeah. Wait a minute. Not bland. It's not boring. It's spicy. Is it vegan?

502
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
Pepper jack cheese?

503
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,100
It's not bland it's not boring it's spicy

504
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:58,100
But I like to think of it as an approachable spice where you bite into it and you're like, okay

505
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,700
I can eat this, you know

506
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,340
Like when you're at the bar and you see an attractive person, but they're not too attractive

507
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,020
And you're comfortable walking up and talking to them

508
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,460
But then also if they reject you you're not too sad because they weren't that super attractive to begin with you get it

509
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,220
You get it you look at a person you're like, okay, I could eat them

510
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,940
You get it. Was there a PR rep hovering over his shoulder and he was like, it's so spicy

511
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,860
It'll burn your asshole right off. No, no walk back walk back. Okay, it's a it's an approachable spice

512
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:32,100
Yeah, yeah, perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Dave Thomas rose from his grave and tried to choke me and my family to death

513
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,860
This thing's so spicy. He said this isn't my Wendy's anymore. You have to change the name

514
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Change it to hell

515
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
That's what you've done to my beloved brand

516
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,940
This fucking shit is spicy and craveable. Walk it back walk it back. Just a little bit

517
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,940
It's an approachable spice

518
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,940
No, that's what happened

519
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,940
It must be told. Dave Thomas rose from his grave and tried to choke me and my family to death

520
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,620
What he meant to say was it's an approachable spice

521
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:05,620
Dave Thomas actually rose from his grave to say this is a great addition to our menu. It would pair great with a Frosty

522
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,140
It would really have to cool down your palate just 99 cents

523
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,980
He busted out. He said this is great for vegetarians and God love our troops

524
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,500
It's so spicy it made me hate our troops

525
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
I have a clear shot. Take it

526
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:48,500
Take it. Take it out. God is dead and this sandwich killed him. No no no no no. I've seen the end. It was so hot I could see through time to the very collapse of the universe. This is all meaningless. Nothing matters.

527
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Everything you do is pointless. We're all on a trajectory that was planned long before the invention of time

528
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:06,500
But do enjoy the Frosty with it. You can dip your fries in it. It's delicious. He's right. It's craveable. The craveability is inarguable. We can all agree on that.

529
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:24,500
The sniper is nodding his head. Yes we can. Single tear on his face. You are my best friend. I had to take this shot and I have to put you in the ground but this burger is flavorful. But I'll marry your wife just like I promised.

530
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:40,500
I will and I'll raise your son just like you would have wanted with lots of spicy foods. But not too spicy. I'm sorry I have to stop the interview. Sir did you just Morse code tap on the table that your butt got turned into a volcano by this hot hot spicy...

531
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,500
No. No. These are actual jalapenos. Wink.

532
00:44:46,500 --> 00:45:06,500
This is the perfect triumvirate of butt problems where it's incredibly spicy with several new kinds of jalapenos that are actually jalapenos and mainly black beans and also made at Wendy's. So it's going to have a real kind of ribble bathroom after party that you should check out.

533
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:21,500
Hey listen if anyone from Wendy's is listening I'm actually a big fan of Wendy's. I love what you guys are doing. Love Wendy's. Love them. I don't know why Justin said that you guys make people's butts hurt. I've never had that experience at Junior Bacon Cheeseburger. It's like my favorite thing. I don't know why Justin said that.

534
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:32,500
I'm conflating the time that I had diarrhea and had to drive quickly to Wendy's to throw away my underwear. But Wendy's was there for you in that moment Justin. That was and I shouldn't be dragging them down.

535
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Especially when they're churning out some of the most craveable menu options.

536
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,500
I'm a vegan and have a full time job. So my brother called me...

537
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,500
I'm looking for a burger that will fucking shatter my reality.

538
00:45:49,500 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm a vegan and have a full time job. So when my brother called me and offered to make me handmade vegan spaghetti I accepted. It's now sitting in front of me and it's gross. The problem is he spent two and a half hours making it and he's sitting right behind me.

539
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:19,500
Brothers, how do I dispose of the spaghetti he made specifically without him seeing? Follow up. How do I get more food later without getting caught? That's from stealthily disposing of spaghetti in a Spokane.

540
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,500
You can't just put it in the garbage. Too visible. He's going to open that garbage later?

541
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Yeah.

542
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,500
God and there's not a lot of like outside animals that eat spaghetti that you could like chuck it to?

543
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:38,500
You would have to make it to a window at that point too. I think your best bet is maybe a two-part disposal where you're going to put it in like a drawer that's rarely used.

544
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Right? Dump it in that drawer. And then you're going to recover that in an hour or so when the heat's off.

545
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
Yeah.

546
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,500
Right? And then you're going to need...

547
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,500
This is a two person operation.

548
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Yeah.

549
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
No matter what.

550
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,500
You need a friend to collaborate.

551
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:02,500
You could do an accidental dump on the floor, right? Where you turn too quickly.

552
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
That's so mean, Mel.

553
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:14,500
Yeah, yeah. That's really mean. That's going to hurt a lot. You know, spaghetti is a really good food for scooting it into mounds and then acting like, ugh.

554
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
I couldn't possibly.

555
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,500
I'm stuffed. I've eaten so much of it.

556
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,500
Could you put it on your head and pretend it's your hair?

557
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Oh, there's something there.

558
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,500
Is there? Well, I mean, you're going to have to style it.

559
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,500
No, there's something there for sure.

560
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:36,500
It's a kind of permanent solution though at that point because if it starts to fall off, hmm.

561
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:43,500
You could ask, what's in this? And then have them go down the list of ingredients.

562
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,500
And at some point in there, be like, oh, did you say capers? This ain't vegan.

563
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,500
Yeah.

564
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,500
Oh, yeah.

565
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:56,500
Yeah, capers. You wouldn't think it, but they're just little snail eyes.

566
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,500
Are you sure? I thought they were like little weird olives.

567
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Nah, man. They're fucking snail feet.

568
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Sucks. You worked real hard on this.

569
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Sucks that you undid all that good hard work just because you weren't paying attention to the ingredients.

570
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,500
How about I order some steaks, huh? I'll get on DoorDash.

571
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Let's get some steaks and some pork rinds.

572
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,500
I don't know what you want me to say to this question.

573
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,500
I need full situational awareness to do a cheat like this.

574
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,500
You didn't even give us like exits.

575
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
You know, we have no information.

576
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
How big are your pockets?

577
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
Yeah. Are you wearing loose pants like a ginko jean?

578
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,500
Are they lined with spaghetti proof plastic?

579
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Do you have a dog in the house?

580
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,500
And it's so important. Make sure that the plastic is rated for spaghetti.

581
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,500
Don't just use Ziploc. It's not rated for spaghetti.

582
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
How big is the kitchen counter?

583
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Because you could potentially spread like one strand here, one strand there.

584
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Like some sort of Easter egg hunt where even if they saw individual strands,

585
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,500
it would not seem like enough to make up an entire plate of spaghetti.

586
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
And you could just be like, oh, it was so delicious.

587
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,500
I just tore into it like the Tasmanian devil and launched those little bastards all over the kitchen.

588
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,500
Yeah. I tore it up all crazy like a wild boar.

589
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,500
And I spun into it.

590
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,500
I turned into a tornado and I spun into the middle of it and spaghetti was everywhere.

591
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm so, so sorry.

592
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,500
Oh, that's good.

593
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,500
I mean, you could do it for real though, right in front of them.

594
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:31,500
And just like, yeah, like smash your face into it like the Cookie Monster

595
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
and you're only going to have to eat a couple bites,

596
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,500
but the rest of it is just going to go hither and yon.

597
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Yeah. If you Cookie Monster it, it'll look like maximum impact with like minimum intake.

598
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:44,500
Very little work.

599
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,500
You could also do that thing where you turn like profile to him

600
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,500
and you open your mouth up and you turn your head facing upward

601
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
and you hold up one strand at a time and go like, ah.

602
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,500
But actually you're dropping it beside your face on the opposite side of him.

603
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
And you're going to do that a lot.

604
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,500
It's going to take a long time to get through this.

605
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:04,500
Just now and it's going to look like it's disappearing into your mouth,

606
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,500
but you're not really eating it.

607
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,500
It's a magic trick.

608
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,500
Could you turn it into a braided bracelet?

609
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,500
That's cool.

610
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Give it, give it right back.

611
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,500
Yeah.

612
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
Spaghetti bracelet.

613
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Spaghetti bracelet for brothers.

614
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:22,500
How do you fuck up spaghetti that bad, especially once you work on it for two hours?

615
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
Spaghetti squash.

616
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,500
This is where I've been thinking about the entire time I've been sitting here.

617
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,500
Yeah.

618
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,500
Spaghetti squash that you've just done wrong, right?

619
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:39,500
Squash has, we could all agree has a limited window of viability.

620
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
Yeah.

621
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:43,500
Well, here's what I will say as a parent.

622
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,500
It says it's sitting in front of you and it's gross,

623
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,500
which makes me think maybe you haven't tried it.

624
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,500
So maybe it doesn't look, maybe it doesn't look like your thing.

625
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,500
Open it up.

626
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Open it up.

627
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
But maybe take a bite and see if you like it.

628
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,500
How about a three bite rule, just like Pete the Cat says.

629
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,500
You try three bites and you see if you like it.

630
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Because it might be good.

631
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,500
It might be good, little baby.

632
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,500
So open the hair and here comes the airplane.

633
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,500
Vroom, vroom.

634
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,500
Here we come.

635
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Brrrr.

636
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,500
Oh no, we've been shot.

637
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Got to aim.

638
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
We're coming in for a hot landing.

639
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,500
Oh, it's the sub with Campbell being chased by the Red Baron.

640
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,500
You're not opening your mouth.

641
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,500
What's wrong?

642
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Eat it.

643
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,500
Oh no.

644
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Then it never crashes into the hangar, does it?

645
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
No.

646
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
No.

647
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,500
I wish my, I'm glad my son doesn't know that.

648
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,500
That if he just doesn't open his mouth,

649
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,500
I'm not going to smash the spaghetti into his closed mouth.

650
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:44,500
It's a little life hack for you four year olds.

651
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,500
Before we wrap up, can I talk about my life real quick?

652
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,500
Yeah, I guess so.

653
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:58,500
This weird thing happened with minions where the groups that were posting lots of different memes went private.

654
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,500
And then these groups were only minions.

655
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,500
It's really weird, guys.

656
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,500
If you look for these groups, you can't find them anymore.

657
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,500
It was really hard to find the last batch.

658
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,500
That's not what I want to talk about though.

659
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,500
I got into one that was invite only.

660
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,500
Oh, okay.

661
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Where you had to answer questions like, I mean, I think the question was like, do you love minions?

662
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,500
Was that a tough one?

663
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
It was a tough one, but I came down with yes.

664
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:28,500
But now that I'm in the groups, I'm afraid to leave because what if I need them?

665
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,500
They would get suspicious if I left.

666
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,500
I just want to tell you guys some stuff that's happened in the groups.

667
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:43,500
They've gone so that they're not really talking about minions as much as you would think they would be talking about minions.

668
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,500
I would think they would be speaking about the minions quite a bit.

669
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:55,500
I mean, there's a good amount of minions material, but here's a poll that someone put up that said the monsters or the Addams Family, which one was the best show?

670
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
Oh, fuck.

671
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
It's very nuanced.

672
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
I don't know if there's a clear answer to that.

673
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,500
So I'm going to read you guys without any names.

674
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,500
I'm going to read you guys without skipping anything.

675
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,500
The answer.

676
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Okay, the answers that this post received.

677
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,500
By the way, people go absolutely bug nuts for these.

678
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:20,500
There's 283 respondents wanting to rushing, rushing to give you their two cents.

679
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Ready?

680
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Yep.

681
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Both shows are better than most reality shows they have now.

682
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Okay.

683
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,500
That wasn't part of it.

684
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,500
So wait, wait, hold on.

685
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Do you think, can we, did you think those are reality television programs?

686
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:34,500
Huh?

687
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,500
Anyway, so both shows.

688
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,500
Okay.

689
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:38,500
Both.

690
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,500
Both.

691
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,500
Tammy.

692
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Both.

693
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,500
Amber.

694
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
I like both of them.

695
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Beth.

696
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,500
Toss up.

697
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Cassie.

698
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,500
Love them both.

699
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Gordon.

700
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,500
Love them both.

701
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,500
Roma.

702
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Both funny.

703
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Stephanie.

704
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,500
I love both.

705
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,500
Donna.

706
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I love them both equally.

707
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Donna.

708
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
I love them both.

709
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Hermelina.

710
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Love them both.

711
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Huh?

712
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,500
Scott.

713
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,500
Love them both.

714
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,500
Elaine.

715
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,500
I hate making choices.

716
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
Crap.

717
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,500
I love watching both as a kid.

718
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,500
Crap.

719
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,500
Lisa says, I like both.

720
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,500
We're not getting anywhere.

721
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Jan said.

722
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,500
I, both, but a force to pick.

723
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:12,500
I'd go for Adam's family.

724
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,500
Claire.

725
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,500
Both were awesome.

726
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,500
I grew up watching both.

727
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:16,500
Dwayne.

728
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,500
Can't choose.

729
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Love them both.

730
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Angela.

731
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,500
Adam's family spelled A-D-A-M apostrophe S. Hi, I'm Adam and this is my family.

732
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Welcome to my wild mixed up family.

733
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,500
Deborah.

734
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500
Both.

735
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,500
Lynn.

736
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:41,500
Picture of a flossing skeleton.

737
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Okay.

738
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,500
Okay.

739
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Frank.

740
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Both.

741
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Oh, boy.

742
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
Which one would you guys pick?

743
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Don't make me choose, but probably Adam's family.

744
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,500
Adam's family.

745
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,500
Definitely.

746
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:00,780
But that 1313 Mockingbird Lane, an unaired pilot that Brian Fuller made that was an adaptation

747
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,500
starring Jerry O'Connell as Herman Munster and Eddie Izzard as grandpa thing.

748
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,500
What?

749
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,500
Fucking slapped.

750
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,500
Yeah.

751
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,500
It was very extremely good.

752
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,500
The answer is both.

753
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,500
Is what I was looking for.

754
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,500
Oh, both.

755
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,020
Hey, thanks for listening to our podcast.

756

758

Learn something.

759
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,780
Learn something about yourself.

760
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:28,540
Our video on demand of the summer boybeque is still available for just a little bit longer

761

778
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,180
All worth it.

Tell me about that merch, Griffin.

780
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:46,620
Yeah, we got lots of merch at our McElroy merch page, including a new pin of the month

781
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:51,620
for the Gushy Wolves, which if you've listened to the Ethersea Setup episodes, you know,

782
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:57,060
of course it's the mascot for the, I guess, only school in that entire world.

783
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:58,780
We love the Gushy Wolves.

784
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:03,140
And the sales for that are going to benefit the Innocence Project, which exonerates the

785
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,060
wrongly convicted through DNA testing and reforms the criminal justice system to prevent

786
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,660
future injustice.

787
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,980
There's other stuff on there too.

788
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,060
This trash sticker from the MBMBAM TV show.

789
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:19,780
There's a beautiful green stoneware mug with the Taz logo on it.

790
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:26,020
And even the besties is getting in on the game with a video game book club shirt.

791
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:31,780
And it's very, it's very stylish, and you'll get lots of compliments on it.

792
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,560
And hey, you know what?

793
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:38,260
Thank you to Montaigne for using our theme song, and that theme song is called My Life

794
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:44,900
is Better with You, and when it drops, and we know when, we know when it drops.

795
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,300
We basically have our fingers on the Switch that when we flip it, then the song goes live

796
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
on iTunes.

797
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,940
Yeah, it's up to us and we're withholding it.

798
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,100
And that's the important thing is that you make sure that you know that it's fully us

799
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,940
and we're the ones that iTunes calls us every day.

800
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:05,820
It's like, we have a song now and we're like, oh, sorry, we're so busy.

801
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,900
Did you guys know that Montaigne streams on Twitch?

802
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,740
I did not know that, but it tracks.

803
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,260
Yeah, actual Montaigne on Twitch.

804
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,940
I just watched Montaigne do a Sims 4 stream the other day.

805
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,100
It was absolutely wonderful.

806
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,860
If you are on Twitch, you can also check out my Twitch channel.

807
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,300
It is TheTravisMcElroy.

808
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,300
I've been getting into Overwatch, if you can believe it.

809
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:29,300
Trying to get good at it.

810
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,300
It's 1998.

811
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:38,060
Yeah, with that and NBA Jam, new games I'm checking out.

812
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,300
Here's a final Yahoo.

813
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,620
This one was sent in by Breckin Meyer.

814
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,620
Whoa.

815
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,160
Yeah, pretty badass.

816
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,300
And it's asked by Shrek and Pryor.

817
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,300
Huh.

818
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,300
Who...

819
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,360
Sorry, Shrek and Pryor?

820
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,060
It's Richard Pryor's grandsons.

821
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:56,100
Got it.

822
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,500
His Shrek-based grandson.

823
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Shrek-inspired.

824
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,820
Shrek-inspired asks...

825
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:13,420
That's weird, it just says Donkey with five exclamation points and four question marks.

826
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:16,740
I don't even know how this one got past the filters on Yahoo.

827
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:24,340
I think it has to be two words, but it just says Donkey on it.

828
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,340
Is there a question?

829
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,340
That was it, Donkey.

830
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:27,340
That was the whole...

831
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,340
Yeah, that was the whole thing.

832
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:29,340
My name is Justin McElroy.

833
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:30,340
Travis McElroy.

834
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,340
Maybe it didn't load.

835
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,340
Let me refresh the browser.

836
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:33,340
I finished that.

837
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,340
No.

838
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,340
It's...

839
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,340
This is Griffin McElroy.

840
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,340
It's the full page.

841
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,420
This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me, Kissy Tats.

842
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,100
Go wear on the lips.
