1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother,

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,600
and Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
I am your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,680
And I'm your sweet baby brother, and I'm Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,800
I think it's time to lose it. It's starting to feel a little like,

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,000
yo, I was a quarterback in high school, now I work at this used car lot.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
It's kind of feeling embarrassing. It's kind of feeling played and

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,520
embarrassing and tired. Almost like nobody ever cared about it.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,600
It's almost one of those things where it's made it worse retroactively.

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,480
Yeah. I can't listen to any of the episodes

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,720
before 448 because Griffin calls himself a baby.

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,680
And it's like, if that's your kink, good. Now see, Justin, I think Griffin was just

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,320
talking about the 30 under 30 media luminary, not like his whole identity on the show.

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
Let me try again. Let's do the whole intro again,

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
and I'll try to do a good one. Should we all have different sort of

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,000
energies, different ablations? Okay.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Hey, what's up? Yeah, a bold new direction for the Justin

22
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,720
character. He's a bit of a bad boy.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,720
He sits backwards on Travis. No, I'm not going to do any of my own

24
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,800
played tired shit. Okay.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,520
So who are you? Okay.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
Let me start. Oh, hey, it's Justin here.

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,480
McElroy, that is. I'm one of three brothers that are bringing

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,160
to you a new show, a new energy for an old show called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
And I'm Justin McElroy in this neck of the woods.

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,360
I'm king of the pirates, Travis McElroy. Hey, I'm Griffin.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,640
My friends call me Zit and Forbes gave me an award one time.

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,120
Shit. Now, what is the what is the shit?

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Is it in reference to the fact that your friends call you Zit or you still brought up the Forbes

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,560
thing? The Forbes thing, the Zit thing, I don't

35
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,400
mind because, you know, my friends love saying that about me because of how nasty I am and

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,280
how I don't give a shoot about hygiene. I just want to be on my board and ride

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,080
either the concrete or the sweet blue ocean. And so like I'm the nasty one of our skate

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,840
crew, so they call me Zit. I don't mind that.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,160
But then I am embarrassed about the Forbes award.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,320
Can I be honest with you guys? I'm not really a pirate king.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,480
Yeah, no, we knew that much. Yeah, that was just a thing that I said

42
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,320
to try to impress you guys. Your intro is going to be that.

43
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,080
No, uh huh. I was just going to thank Toronto.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
Is that Paul Stanley? Yeah, that's Paul Stanley.

45
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
I got my Paul Stanley board back. I'm building it, rebuilding it.

46
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,040
Peace be on. It fell down that big escalator and Justin's

47
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,720
got all the parts. He's got all the widgets and screws.

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,960
I've actually got, I got this sound board and I was trying to hook it up when you guys

49
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,000
started your podcast and the problem, here's the good things and bad things about it.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
One. Toronto!

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,560
Yes. Okay, the bad thing is I don't know what

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
any of the other buttons do. Oh, cool.

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,680
And I can't hear them. So I was wondering if you guys could kind

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,200
of describe to me and that would help me to sort of figure out what each of these buttons

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,880
are mapped to. I know they're mapped to something.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
There's pre-programmed stuff in the here, this here roadcaster.

57
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,000
I like that because I feel like we can, we can kind of meld these two things together

58
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
where we're trying to find our new identities. Sure.

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,880
Maybe Justin, you could be like the tech bro, you know, and you do machines.

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Okay, so you guys just tell me what some of these do.

61
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,280
Like, okay, so this is the orange button. Oh, that's a laugh track right there.

62
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,240
That one's laughter. We're going to get a lot of use out of that one.

63
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,760
Old timey laughter at like a movie theater from the 50s.

64
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay. Going on for a really long time.

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
It's still going. It's going on for a while.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
Oh man, I'm pushing it to stop it. No, you're just starting it.

67
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,480
You're actually starting it over again. Now I'm starting to feel mocked.

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,640
Okay. What's this one?

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,320
Oh, that's sad trombone. Like you just tripped and your wiener fell out.

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,840
Yeah. Okay, great.

71
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Now what do we got here? Oh, that was a rim shot.

72
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
Well, this one's Laura Linney saying welcome to my brother, my brother and me.

73
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
Yeah. So we need to play that one at the beginning of each show.

74
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,600
Hey Justin, these are the lowest quality audio files I've ever heard in my entire fucking life.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
Nope. That one's decent.

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,400
That was good timing.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,520
There's one of people clapping and cheering that sounds like it is maybe four kilobytes total

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,200
in size. Like it would hear a midi file and be like, I wish.

79
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
Yeah. It makes me think that about the sound of it.

80
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
We should do our show. This is, I think so far, un-listenable.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
No, it's been very good. I'm very excited about this new direction.

82
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,760
There was a whole thing about Griffin being Zit and Justin being the tech bro.

83
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

84
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,280
And I think we'll find mine and Griffin's archetypes throughout

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,880
the course of this episode and this episode alone.

86
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,160
You guys got why I was called Zit, right? Because I'm a slimy fuck?

87
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,320
Yeah, because you're a real dirty boy, but not in like a fun sexy way.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,560
Like in a, you maybe haven't bathed.

89
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Nasty friendly way. Okay. Let's do a question maybe.

90
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,480
It snowed a silly amount here in the last few days

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,760
as I was shoveling my driveway, my next door neighbor, who's a very nice guy,

92
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,600
but someone I don't know terribly well, offered to lend me his snow blower.

93
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,320
I declined his generous offer. Generous? No, generous. Okay.

94
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,000
His Ellen DeGeneres offer.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
His Regenerest offer.

96
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,480
His Regenerest offer because I just generally feel uncomfortable taking help from people.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes.

98
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
About an hour later, as I was wrapping up the task, the neighbor, a few houses down,

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,720
wheeled over his snow blower and suggested I take it to finish the task.

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
Since he had already brought it over to me, I could hardly refuse the generosity.

101
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,400
This left me with having to do the end of my driveway and the side of the snow blower,

102
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
all of which is very visible to the next door neighbor's living room window.

103
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
How do I nonchalantly explain my snow blower snubbed the next door neighbor?

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
That's from, sorry, I'd prefer not to be blown in West Des Moines.

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,920
So just to be clear, that didn't track.

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,280
Next door neighbor offered snow blower, question and answer said no.

107
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
And then a different neighbor just went ahead and wheeled one over.

108
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

109
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So question asker used that one.

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,840
I mean, you have several outs here.

111
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,480
One, you could say, you know, an hour of manual

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,880
shoveling is enough to change a man's mind about so many things.

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,040
Yeah, I started doing it and I hated it.

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
Yeah.

115
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,280
I also think you could just say like, well, yours was just words, Frank.

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,520
Yeah.

117
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,120
What was I going to do?

118
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Walk over to your house and get it?

119
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Jerry brought it to me.

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,040
He'd hand delivered this snow blower.

121
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,200
Like that was a, that was a palpable,

122
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
that was a concrete snow blower that I could see and feel and smell.

123
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
Your snow blower was but dreams.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,320
And I think what you could also say is,

125
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,600
what, you thought I was going to use a snow blower on yard snow?

126
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,200
No way.

127
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,320
Yard snow is good for shoveling only.

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,560
You don't use blower on yard snow.

129
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,760
That's, that's wild.

130
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,480
God gave us shovels just for yard snow.

131
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Now sidewalk snow, you can, you can shoot that with a big gun if you want to.

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,520
Well, maybe just tell Frank, like, you know,

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,440
your snow blower was weak and Jerry's snow blower was fleek.

134
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,080
He's got a potent, powerful snow blower.

135
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,960
Sorry, Frank.

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,400
Jerry doesn't pick his snow.

137
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,760
I've seen you doing the dirty deed while you blow snow.

138
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,520
You and your friend Zit are hanging out picking noses.

139
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,160
Yeah, you and Zit are hanging out getting this.

140
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,640
That's me.

141
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,760
I mean, I'll do a lip trick off a half pipe, but also, you know,

142
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,200
dig for some gold in there.

143
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
But I don't fucking care.

144
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Wait, are you cool but rude?

145
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah, so I think that, gosh, you're not, you're not,

146
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,640
I'll tell you what stinks is not knowing your neighbor very well

147
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,800
and then having an opportunity arise where you could maybe know your neighbor

148
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,520
a little bit better and you just fuck it up completely.

149
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,400
And then you're confronted with the reality of, you know,

150
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,520
before you're like, I might not ever get to know my neighbor.

151
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,800
And then this happens and you're like, now I am actively moving away

152
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
from the reality of knowing my neighbor.

153
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,960
I know them less.

154
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,920
I know them less.

155
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,000
I negative know them at this point.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
And you know what?

157
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,640
I don't want to shame the question asker though, because that impulse will be like,

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,040
hey, I'd like to offer you something that would help you.

159
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,240
And your immediate reaction would be like, no, don't worry about it.

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,640
Yeah, that's exactly the vote.

161
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,960
We are in that boat together, my friend.

162
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,240
Look, look to your left.

163
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
There's me also rowing this boat.

164
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Once a person pushed the snowblower over, you should have gone back to Frank

165
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,400
and said like, all right, give it to me now.

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to do twosies.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,920
I want to go double fist it, blow all the snow away.

168
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
Why did you decline?

169
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,280
Hey, why did you decline it?

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,720
Showing so sucks.

171
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,440
Yeah, because I think out here in 2019, as we're becoming the monster,

172
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I want to really, I want to re-examine that to include like looking at our own behaviors,

173
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,760
right?

174
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,440
And like embracing who we are as people, but also changing it to make it better.

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,200
You shouldn't have declined the offer.

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,560
Showing so sucks.

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,600
And it's nice to give people the opportunity to help you out.

178
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,120
It makes people feel good.

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,800
You should just take the snowblower.

180
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
Here's what I've been doing.

181
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
This is a powerful phrase if you're like me and you're like knee-jerk responses

182
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
to always say like, no, thank you.

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,960
Powerful phrase that you can introduce in your lexicon is this.

184
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,920
No, you know what?

185
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,440
Just that phrase will let you 180 on that.

186
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,040
That has not told me anything.

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,560
You can say like, no, thank you.

188
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
No, you know what?

189
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,800
I actually will use the snowblower thing.

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
You can immediately turn around on a note.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,920
Yeah, sure.

192
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
Your revelation is waffling on things.

193
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,120
That's your bolder direction.

194
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,760
I would do the same thing with someone like, hey, do you want to use my snowblower?

195
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
And I would just immediately say like, no, I got it.

196
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,800
Thank you.

197
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,120
And in my head, I'm thinking like, what are you doing?

198
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,000
Take the snowblower.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,560
This sucks.

200
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
But then I would say like, well, but it's too late now.

201
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
I already told Frank I don't want to.

202
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,480
So then I would say, no, you know what, Frank?

203
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,000
I would appreciate the snowblower.

204
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
And let's become BFF.

205
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,960
Coffee at my place.

206
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,840
Something like that.

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,320
You know what I mean?

208
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,440
I'd say, hey, do you want to use my snowblower?

209
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
I'd say, no, you want to use your snowblower?

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,960
Here's $20.

211
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you want to use my $20?

212
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
And now we're in a gig economy.

213
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,120
I ask what it is.

214
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,640
Your neighbor's jealous.

215
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,400
Your neighbor saw you didn't use his,

216
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,680
and he's very jealous because he wants to get his used by you.

217
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,880
And that's all there is to it.

218
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,600
So he came out silently and just started snow blowing your yard

219
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
with his snowblower.

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
Like, see, this is good, too.

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,560
This is better.

222
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,120
He's very jealous.

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,480
Look at my clean lines.

224
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,680
What you can do, you're out of snow.

225
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,560
Go in your house.

226
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,080
If you have a spice rack, just knock that over to the floor.

227
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,640
And then call your neighbor over and say, look, more dusty stuff

228
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,680
just ready and raring to get blown out of the house.

229
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,960
More debris.

230
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,720
It says, again, you got to be over there

231
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
before Frank has even done his own yard and borrow it.

232
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,280
Borrow it.

233
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,240
You know what?

234
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
Borrow it without him asking next time it snows.

235
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,600
You got to make this up to him.

236
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,320
And then ask him if he wants to use your snowblower.

237
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,240
And then you get his second grade class

238
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,120
to all come to his house and tear up old piece of paper

239
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,240
and throw him up in the air.

240
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,440
And you're standing there with a new snowblower

241
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,160
furnished by Lowe's with a big bow on it.

242
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
And you're just smiling.

243
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,160
And he smiles.

244
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,080
Do you want a Yahoo?

245
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,280
Yeah, happily.

246
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,600
Thank you.

247
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
Here's one that's sent in by Emma Cant.

248
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,120
Or Cont.

249
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,920
Thank you, Emma.

250
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,760
It's Yahoo Answers user.

251
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,600
Well, they're anonymous, but I'm going to call them.

252
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Boba asks, why don't we eat fruit hot and microwaved?

253
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,920
Thank you.

254
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,720
Thank you.

255
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,560
I feel like this might be good.

256
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,200
Hot strawberries, grapes, watermelon, pears.

257
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,240
We eat spaghetti and pizza hot, so why not fruit?

258
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,440
Okay.

259
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
We can play in this space, but you can grill watermelon

260
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:19,920
and eat it.

261
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,200
People do do that.

262
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,400
So I will remove watermelon from the metaphorical plate

263
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
and we won't discuss watermelon.

264
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,760
I mean, you could do a fancy preparation

265
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,520
of any of these fruits, right?

266
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,960
I don't think this question is saying

267
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,520
it's impossible to eat these fruits hot and microwaved.

268
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,880
The verb microwaved in there, I think, sets the tone

269
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,440
of the question.

270
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,000
Of course, you can go to a fancy cuisine restaurant

271
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,160
and they'll put some strawberries on some fancy ravioli,

272
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
whatever the fuck, and cook them up hot yum.

273
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,960
But they're talking about just cash.

274
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,720
You pull some grapes out of the freezer

275
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
and instead of just popping those little purple candies

276
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,160
in your mouth, you change the heat of them a little bit.

277
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,040
You get them hot.

278
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,840
You get them hot or warm with the microwave.

279
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,800
Having to say to another human being the sentence like,

280
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,520
oh, don't eat those grapes yet.

281
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,880
They need time to cool.

282
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,440
It would make me feel like the weirdest pervert in history.

283
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,640
Yeah, sure.

284
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,920
Don't burn your tongue on that sizzling strawberry.

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,760
Get the fuck out of the house.

286
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,120
Hey, blow on that strawberry.

287
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,160
It's not ready yet.

288
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,720
No way.

289
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Hey, also, if you put grapes in a microwave,

290
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,920
I'm pretty sure it makes it explode like a little explosion.

291
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,960
I think they all do.

292
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,920
Griffin, I'm thinking about all of the fruits you mentioned,

293
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,120
the strawberry, the grape, the watermelon.

294
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm pretty sure we're talking about just a microwave mess.

295
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,160
Oh, all the watermelon, I bet,

296
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,200
would make a big wo-oh accident in the microwave.

297
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
If you could get a whole one in there, oh, Boise.

298
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,880
That's a bad day.

299
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,640
You gotta get out of the house at that point.

300
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,040
You're gonna just destroy the whole place.

301
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,320
But here's the thing, though.

302
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,720
You do eat spaghetti and pizza hot.

303
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,600
That's true.

304
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,960
That's a great point, Griff.

305
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,160
Very salient.

306
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,000
What if we put strawberries on pizza?

307
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,680
No, stop it.

308
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,160
Stop it.

309
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,400
Let's answer the core question first.

310
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,200
Why don't we eat fruit hot in microwave?

311
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Because we're afraid.

312
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,320
But we do.

313
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,480
What about cobblers?

314
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,920
That's full of hot fruit.

315
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,400
Oh my god.

316
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,120
Oh my god.

317
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,120
I'm gonna come through this mic,

318
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
I'm gonna come through your sound interface,

319
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,640
and I'm gonna start striking you.

320
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,000
I wouldn't do that to you.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
You're my brothers and I love you more than anything.

322
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,680
We're not talking about high-falutin' preparations.

323
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,840
I take grapes out of the fridge,

324
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,920
and instead just poppin' them in cold at a picnic,

325
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,520
I get them hot in the microwave first,

326
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
and now I'm eating grapes, baby.

327
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,560
I'm not talking about cooking the grapes,

328
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,880
I'm talking about getting the grapes hot, baby, okay?

329
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,520
Yeah, you have to do it.

330
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,880
I'm not talking about cooked cobblers,

331
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
I'm talking about hot cobblers.

332
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,600
What's the difference between cooking them

333
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,640
and getting them hot?

334
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,140
Yeah.

335
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,880
Don't, no, Justin, you're using fancy words like cook.

336
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,560
Griffin's saying microwaving them.

337
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,960
What's the difference between cooking them

338
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,840
and getting them hot?

339
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,640
I have to know.

340
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,880
It's because it's, when you, okay, I'll tell you,

341
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,160
I'll tell you, you got leftover fried chicken, right?

342
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,480
And you can either eat that hot or you can eat that cold.

343
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,440
When you put it in the microwave,

344
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,280
you don't say you're cooking fried chicken,

345
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,000
you're getting it hot.

346
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
You're heating it, you're heating it.

347
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,600
You're on the fuckin' wrong, you're laughing at me?

348
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
You're on the wrong fuckin' side of history right now,

349
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,280
and our listeners are gonna let you know that.

350
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,760
Nobody would say, Justin, what about this sentence?

351
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,440
Don't eat those grapes, they're raw.

352
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,960
That's nothing.

353
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
That's nothing, that's nothing.

354
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,880
Oh, that's a raw strawberry.

355
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,640
You eat that, you're gonna get tummy rot.

356
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,280
No.

357
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,840
No.

358
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,800
So if you microwave, if you dump a couple packets of oatmeal

359
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,640
into a bowl and he'll put some water in there

360
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,000
and then microwave it, all right,

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
do you say that you are cooking oatmeal?

362
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,080
No, you're heating up the oatmeal.

363
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,040
You're preparing it.

364
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,680
Preparing it, that seems like a middle ground.

365
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,280
You mixed ingredients there.

366
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,480
Okay, so that is cooking, that's cooking.

367
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,320
Justin's so far outside of the space

368
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
that Travis and I have one and a half bouncy castles

369
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,280
because Justin's abandoned his

370
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,040
and we're taking turns sharing it.

371
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,160
And that's fine, Justin.

372
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,320
So let's, I guess, just dial into this.

373
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,400
Why don't we cook grapes in the microwave and eat them?

374
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,920
You fuckin' fascist.

375
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,560
If that's really what you wanna limit the discourse down to,

376
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,120
that's fine.

377
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,440
Why don't we cook and eat grapes

378
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,960
after putting them in the microwave first?

379
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,840
Okay, why don't we microwave steak?

380
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,440
Why don't we microwave bread?

381
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
No, Justin, we do.

382
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,240
Like, it's nonsense.

383
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,000
If I have a steak that I,

384
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
maybe I have some leftover sirloin from the night before,

385
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,560
I would pop that into the microwave

386
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,680
and heat it up a little bit

387
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,320
if I just wanna gnaw on it, maybe a late night snack.

388
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
Like, I'm up for steak.

389
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,680
Is that for when you transform into a living dog

390
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,760
and you have something to nosh on in your bowl?

391
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,560
Of course.

392
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,280
Like, this is not food a human would eat.

393
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
For real, do you all see that in cartoons

394
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
where they give a dog a big raw piece of meat

395
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,040
and you're like, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

396
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
That's probably not good, right?

397
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,880
No, cook that.

398
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,360
Nah, it can't be good.

399
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,320
Why don't you like your dog?

400
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,240
Are they giving like a whole chicken to eat or some shit?

401
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
Don't do that.

402
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,480
Or like Fred Flintstone's about to eat

403
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,240
just like a big raw leg of a dinosaur, bud.

404
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
I always felt that that was the weirdest part

405
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
in a Flintstone's cartoon

406
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,320
when Fred Flintstone would chase after a brontosaurus

407
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
and catch it and just tear into its raw flesh.

408
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
Get in its legs, yeah.

409
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,480
So Justin, why don't we eat hot grapes though?

410
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,680
If you put a bunch of fruit in the microwave in a cup,

411
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,640
okay, and then put some yogurt and granola on top.

412
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:28,880
Fuck.

413
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,520
Oh, you got a nice little breakfast going.

414
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,800
Are you saying hot berries?

415
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,760
That recipe was in the Washington Post.

416
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
This is not hiding.

417
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
You know, this is right there out in front of us.

418
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,400
You're saying put some hot berries in my parfait?

419
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,520
Saying hot berries.

420
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,160
Hey Justin?

421
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,040
Yeah.

422
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,840
You've been around this block for a while

423
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,520
and I know that-

424
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,400
Hot berry block?

425
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,360
No, stop it.

426
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
Listen, let me play.

427
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,760
Let me play at you.

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
If you're not gonna play with me, let me play at you.

429
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
You've eaten grapes, yes?

430
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,320
Yeah, bud.

431
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,800
I would say throughout the fullness of time of your life,

432
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,040
you've probably eaten a lot of grapes.

433
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,800
Not, you know, maybe not the average,

434
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,480
maybe not more than the average, maybe less.

435
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,120
Not an obscene amount?

436
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,680
No, no, no.

437
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,760
I would say right down the fucking middle.

438
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,040
Right down the fucking middle.

439
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,880
And what's the process?

440
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,040
Go ahead, paint me a little word picture

441
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,480
of you sitting in the living room,

442
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,680
you decide you want some grapes

443
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,840
and then just sort of walk me through the whole process

444
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,080
up to you chewing and swallowing the grapes.

445
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,640
So go ahead.

446
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,480
Okay, so I would-

447
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,000
And hey, don't play with funny times

448
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,200
because it's me playing at you.

449
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
You get to be Mr. Serious fucking Ben Stein over there.

450
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,640
But I'm gonna be like having fun.

451
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
So if you don't know jokes.

452
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,800
I would go to the refrigerator.

453
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,880
I would take out, I'm sorry, I said refrigerator.

454
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,560
I would go to the refrigerator.

455
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,640
I would take out a bag with grapes.

456
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay.

457
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,720
And then I would get a bowl

458
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,120
and I would pull a bunch of the grapes off the stem.

459
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
I would give them kind of a rinsey rinse.

460
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:57,920
Got to, got to.

461
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,520
Gotta, gotta do that.

462
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,480
And then I would just proceed to chomping.

463
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
Now Justin, let me ask you,

464
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,960
I do have an important qualifier there

465
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
just before Griffin jumps in with his point.

466
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,840
When you rinse them, cold water or hot water?

467
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,000
Cold water.

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,720
Okay, I'm glad that you filled that out for me, Travis.

469
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,800
And then Justin, so you've done this quite a few times.

470
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,520
Yes, you would say?

471
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
Just a regular, the regular amount.

472
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,680
And you tell me now how many outlier times you have done it

473
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,800
where you've then take the grapes

474
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,720
and you put them in the microwave before eating them.

475
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,760
Please now tell me, yes.

476
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,920
How many times a number, exact estimation,

477
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,360
whatever you can get it to, please, thank you.

478
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,080
You're probably done.

479
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,480
And so I guess my follow-up question to that would be, why?

480
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,600
Justify yourself, Justin.

481
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,640
Well, I mean, the floor is yours.

482
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,880
Was the question about grapes specifically

483
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,680
or was it about fruit?

484
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,360
No, you have made it about grapes.

485
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,440
By your actions, it is now about grapes.

486
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,760
And Justin, I would take it even further and say that

487
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,800
none of those times when you have consumed grapes,

488
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,840
did you even ever think you weren't making the choice

489
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,440
not to put it in the microwave?

490
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,920
I don't even think the microwave even ever occurred to you

491
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
because you're scared.

492
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,960
I just didn't, I like them cold.

493
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,760
Why?

494
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
I guess where I'm at is I like them cold.

495
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,320
Well, I like Diet Pepsi, but I drink other stuff too.

496
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,560
So I guess if you're just not,

497
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,400
this is the worst we've ever done on a question

498
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
because from the moment it was introduced into our lives,

499
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,880
Justin wanted to throw it right out into the river.

500
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,600
Justin, who's the coolest celebrity in your estimation?

501
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
Coolest, I've heard Jeff Goldblum.

502
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,800
Okay, if Jeff Goldblum took to Instagram

503
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,960
and did like a live thing on Instagram

504
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
where he like, as he was answering questions,

505
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
nonchalantly microwaved some grapes

506
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,800
and started eating them.

507
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,720
They didn't make a big deal.

508
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
It wasn't a big deal.

509
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,280
The stream wasn't about that.

510
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,000
It was just a thing he was doing as he answered questions.

511
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,600
Do you think it would take off?

512
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,040
Maybe.

513
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,560
All right, I'm pretty sure these things

514
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,760
are bad for your microwave, folks.

515
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't do this as a joke for home.

516
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,760
But if you have done it before,

517
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,760
do tweet at Justin McElroy.

518
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,640
About the hot grapes.

519
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Boy, I bet a hot grape, though,

520
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
if you want to talk about a dangerous food to eat

521
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,520
because you have no idea what the temperature

522
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,800
and the juices are gonna be in there.

523
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,320
And it's just a little like hot water balloon.

524
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,080
Like it's all it is, is hot water inside of it

525
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,600
that's gonna burn your mouth real bad.

526
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,640
Sure.

527
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
It's full of hot water.

528
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,400
How about another question?

529
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,600
Okay.

530
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,360
My roommate recently bought a new value pack.

531
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Eight rolls of paper towels because it ran out.

532
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,240
Hell yeah.

533
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
Wait, was that about the value pack or the running out?

534
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
Hell yeah, it's about the value pack.

535
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,000
There's nothing.

536
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,840
Okay, wait, hold on.

537
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
When I went to use the first roll,

538
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,240
I discovered that I hate these paper towels.

539
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
Oh, hell no, actually.

540
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,040
Turns out they're weirdly soft

541
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,440
and don't rip well off the roll

542
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
and kind of make my skin crawl when I touch them.

543
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,880
And they're made of human flesh.

544
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,560
How do I use up all the paper towels

545
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,240
so that I can excuse buying a new pack from a better brand?

546
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,880
Specifically, maybe a solution that doesn't implicate me

547
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,400
for just wasting a bunch of trees.

548
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
That's from Damp in DC.

549
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
I get it.

550
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,440
I get it.

551
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,160
Life's too short to put bad stuff on your bum.

552
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,440
It ain't worth it.

553
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,160
It ain't worth it.

554
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Is this paper towels?

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,240
So I don't know what kind of grizzly monster you are.

556
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
Listen, y'all.

557
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,880
Listen, y'all.

558
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,000
Sometimes you're desperate.

559
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
You run out of toilet paper.

560
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm just, I don't want to get gross.

561
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,600
I don't want to get blue.

562
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,560
I know we get blue in this show,

563
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
but I don't want to get too blue

564
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,960
because it could scare people off.

565
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,200
But let's just say I'm a brawny man.

566
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,480
Hey, have you guys ever noticed

567
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,280
that toilet paper is TP and paper towels are PT?

568
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Never thought about it.

569
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
Yeah, I think about that a lot.

570
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,320
This is tough.

571
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,160
You know what I have run afoul of?

572
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,680
I feel like that could have been a great chance

573
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,840
for you to use your soundboard, Justin.

574
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,340
Thank you.

575
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,700
I feel like the thing that I really despise

576
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,900
is when the paper towels,

577
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,500
you know the select-a-size

578
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,420
where it's like half a paper towel

579
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,220
or a regulator paper towel or a massive paper towel

580
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,740
or like four segments.

581
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,380
It doesn't matter.

582
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,540
I got two rolls that weren't like that recently

583
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,740
and that was heartbreaking to me

584
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,700
because it's a lot more,

585
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,420
I end up using a lot more paper towel

586
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,860
than I would ever want to use.

587
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,820
And that makes me really sad

588
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,100
for the environment and stuff.

589
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,820
And there's people in other countries

590
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,140
like I think maybe England and stuff

591
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,460
that don't even use these motherfuckers.

592
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,780
They just phase them out or they never use them.

593
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,580
They never use them.

594
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,580
They're losing their minds over there.

595
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Hey, what about use those paper towels

596
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,940
to write your manifesto?

597
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,540
That could be fun.

598
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,460
And so that way like you unroll it as you're writing

599
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,660
and then you roll it back up

600
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,540
and you're like, no, no, no,

601
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,460
we can't use these to clean up that spill.

602
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,660
It's me manifesto.

603
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,460
That's one possibility.

604
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,900
I mean, there's always the mummy game.

605
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,620
Oh yeah.

606
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,380
But then you don't want to waste it, Griffin.

607
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
I think me having a great afternoon

608
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,180
with all my friends playing mummy,

609
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,220
role-playing our favorite

610
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,300
Brendan Fraser film mummy too,

611
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,820
The Mummy Returns,

612
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,900
I don't think is a waste of it, Travis,

613
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,060
just because I haven't used it to sop up,

614
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,180
you know, some piss.

615
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:13,620
Okay.

616
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,100
I have a question.

617
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,380
Once again, wait, hold on.

618
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,340
What?

619
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,500
It's all paper.

620
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,700
Why are you guys being such dingleberries about?

621
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,660
It's all, it's paper.

622
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,020
It's paper, paper, paper, paper.

623
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,780
Cleaning paper.

624
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,260
Did you buy eight rolls of paper towels that you hate

625
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,140
or did you buy a small mattress that you hate?

626
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,640
Ooh.

627
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,220
Could be one of those, either one of those two.

628
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:45,300
Maybe you could use them to clean up spills around town

629
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,980
just out and about

630
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,820
so that way you're not wasting them.

631
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,540
But you're not like,

632
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,100
oh, next time there's an oil spill, you're on it.

633
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,400
Yep.

634
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,340
Yep.

635
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:54,980
I'm here.

636
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,340
I've got all these paper towels.

637
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,820
What about-

638
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,260
Here they are if you need them.

639
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,020
Give me half of one Pelican.

640
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,740
I got this.

641
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,220
What if for a while,

642
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:06,020
you're just the person that shows up at parties

643
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,460
with a roll of paper towels?

644
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,220
And you say, I brought napkins.

645
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,220
I brought my own.

646
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
I get super sloppy.

647
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,340
Leave me alone.

648
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,660
Ooh.

649
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:17,300
What if they're very practical housewarming

650
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,420
slash birthday gifts?

651
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,540
Yeah.

652
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,620
That's a bad one.

653
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,580
That one's bad.

654
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,220
That one's bad.

655
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,900
There's no bad ideas except for that.

656
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,780
It's the first bad idea.

657
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,260
What if it's the world's most comfortable telescope?

658
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,700
Yeah, that's another possibility.

659
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,020
And least effective.

660
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,900
Least effective.

661
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,420
Ooh, it's so easy to hold with all this cushioning.

662
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,940
I mean, I'll go ahead and say the one that's so obvious

663
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,900
that we're not even saying it.

664
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,260
Eight paper towel rolls.

665
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,060
You can catch a lot of frogs with that many paper towel rolls.

666
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,340
I get.

667
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,020
Wait, what are you?

668
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,900
You can catch a lot of them tasty froggies

669
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,500
with eight paper towel rolls, I think.

670
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,780
Go through a forest and know how to get back out.

671
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,500
That's good.

672
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,380
I actually like that.

673
00:26:59,380 --> 00:26:59,940
Yeah.

674
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,500
Maybe use them to denote the end of a race

675
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,060
so people can run through them and break out.

676
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,540
That's good.

677
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,500
You can make little ends of races everywhere

678
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,380
and that can be fun.

679
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,860
I mean, you could take them to Washington DC

680
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,660
and just use the clean up the act

681
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,740
of a lot of the people there

682
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,300
that are supposed to be representing us.

683
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,420
But I think we can all agree

684
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,340
are doing a pretty piss poor job doing it.

685
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,220
And all that piss is just begging to be sopped up

686
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,180
with these eight paper towels.

687
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,020
If you get the-

688
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,700
Vote Griffin McElroy 2020 and clean up the piss.

689
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,980
No, I'm just trying to become a new political cartoonist

690
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,740
and that's sort of my first strip

691
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,300
that I'm gonna pitch to newspaper.

692
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,260
Washington DC, more like Washington PP.

693
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,660
Yeah, and it's me and then you see me

694
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,460
and I'm running with eight big bad paper towel rolls.

695
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
No, no, no, I wanna hear more Travis.

696
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:51,940
He's got-

697
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,820
Well, he writes the words.

698
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,620
I draw the illustration.

699
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,860
Yeah, Griffin does the images and I do the captions.

700
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,300
Yeah, so like give me another one, Travis.

701
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,580
I really only have that one really good one.

702
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:00,900
Okay.

703
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,620
More like Washington Dookie.

704
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,460
Yeah, and so in this one,

705
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,340
I'm in a big airplane and I'm dropping the toilet paper down

706
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,220
like bombs onto, it's a Capitol Hill,

707
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,900
but it's also poop emoji.

708
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,580
Oh, I see.

709
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,460
What if at your local grocery store,

710
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,620
the next few times that someone reached to buy paper towels,

711
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,540
there was just you appearing like an avenging angel.

712
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,540
I, no, no, no, no need.

713
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,020
I've got a free roll for you.

714
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,580
Hey.

715
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,260
And then it's their problem.

716
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
And then they feel so guilty

717
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,980
because you made such a big fucking deal out of it

718
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,260
that they don't even feel comfortable

719
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,500
buying the paper towels that they really want.

720
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,820
All right, but let's walk through this

721
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,580
just step by step, Justin.

722
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:44,900
Yeah.

723
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,180
Say you're at the produce aisle,

724
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,260
eyeing a big soon to be warmed up box of grapes

725
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,180
and you're looking at those seriously.

726
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,900
You're looking at the price,

727
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,220
looking at the unit price and trying to figure out

728
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,740
if you can make space for in your fridge

729
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,260
and in your life for these grapes.

730
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,020
And then a stranger comes up and says,

731
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,940
mm-mm, don't take those grapes.

732
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,980
Take these grapes from me for free.

733
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:05,540
Yeah.

734
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,700
What's the first thought that's gonna enter into your mind?

735
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,260
Poison.

736
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,380
No, no, no.

737
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,180
It's gonna be,

738
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,060
this person just picked up another box of grapes in the store

739
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,380
and said they're wonderful free grapes.

740
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,020
It's a honey pot.

741
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,460
That I can just take out of the store.

742
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,700
This is a good, this is a fun trap, right?

743
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,500
It's like getting everybody more comfortable with shoplifting

744
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,940
by you're looking at paper towels.

745
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,260
I walk up and I say, no, not those paper towels.

746
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,020
And I reach over and pick up other paper towels.

747
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,620
And I say, these ones are free.

748
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,500
And I hand it to them.

749
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,380
I had an experience.

750
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,420
This is not my cereal podcast, The Empty Bowl.

751
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
You can find that on iTunes.

752
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,900
But this is a cereal anecdote on a non-cereal podcast.

753
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,500
I was at a local big box grocery store

754
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,580
and they offered me a sample of banana nut frosted flakes.

755
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,500
And they put it in a little cup and they handed it to me.

756
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,700
And I ate one of the flakes.

757
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,620
I was like, mm-mm, good, good, good.

758
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,060
Is what I said to the lady.

759
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
And she said, do you want milk?

760
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:06,580
And I was like, yeah, I guess I do.

761
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,500
And so I thought she was going to pour me

762
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,220
like a little shot glass of milk to go with my, no.

763
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,140
She takes my sample cup back and then pours milk

764
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,900
into my tiny, minuscule sample cup of the cereal.

765
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,540
And then hands me a very tiny spoon

766
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,780
and hands it back to me all proud of herself.

767
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:28,580
So then I'm just standing there in the middle of the aisle

768
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,300
looking like some sort of stupid giant eating

769
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,180
this tiny, tiny bowl of cereal.

770
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,700
Like, mm-mm, very good.

771
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,340
Oh, thanks.

772
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,460
Thanks for this little tiny bowl, lady.

773
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,500
And I was unimpressed with the flavor.

774
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,100
So take that.

775
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,660
Hey, let's get, can we go to the Money Zone just real quick?

776
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:59,620
Yeah, mm-hmm.

777
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,380
I would like to tell you about Blue Apron.

778
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,220
We here in the McElroy Collective household

779
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,620
are huge fans of the meal service boxes.

780
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,140
The big, in the big boat we all live in together.

781
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,500
In this big McElroy boat.

782
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,260
And gosh darn it, do I ever love Blue Apron?

783
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,740
Because everything comes right there in the box.

784
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,820
And you know what, I remember being in college

785
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,460
and getting like frozen meals and that kind of stuff,

786
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,900
which, you know, nothing wrong with those, I guess.

787
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,140
But this is everything right there that you need.

788
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,900
And when you make it, you feel like accomplished.

789
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,420
Like you, cause you really cooked it.

790
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,740
You're making it yourself from the ingredients.

791
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,740
It's impressive and it's delicious.

792
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,140
They offer creative and mouthwatering options

793
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,500
designed to fit any table.

794
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:42,100
There were some options here in February

795
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,780
of pork chorizo burgers and roasted potatoes,

796
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,340
spicy soy glazed chicken thighs,

797
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,780
crispy chickpea grain bowl, garlic caper chicken.

798
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,300
I can honestly say, I don't think I've ever had a Blue Apron

799
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,620
that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.

800
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,460
And you can check it out this week's menu.

801
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,180
Oh, I should say, basically you get a box that contains-

802
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,700
And it's got stuff in it, you have three meals.

803
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,340
Yeah, it's got stuff, pictures and what have you.

804
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,940
And you can check out this week's menu

805
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,860
and get $60 off at blueapron.com slash my brother.

806
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,140
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

807
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,380
Blue Apron, a better way to cook.

808
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,140
So say you have a business or two

809
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,220
and you need to hire one or maybe 200,000 employees

810
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,780
because your new business is the biggest one ever.

811
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,860
It's Amazon 2 and you're so excited

812
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,980
to really beat Jeff Bezos' ass right into the ground.

813
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,660
And you need to get some employees

814
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,540
and you need these guys fucking yesterday.

815
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:38,340
You need these folks just with a quickness.

816
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,700
Well, let me tell you what you're gonna do.

817
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,340
Who are describing my exact situation, Griffin?

818
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,140
That's so good.

819
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,900
Travis, you're gonna wanna go to Zip Recruiter

820
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,740
because it's the place where you go

821
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,380
that makes hiring simple, fast and smart.

822
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,460
They send your job to over 100

823
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,180
of the web's leading job boards, but that's not all they do.

824
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,140
If that's all they did, it would be bullshit.

825
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,940
It's not.

826
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,180
They also have powerful matching technology

827
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,220
that they can use to scan thousands of resumes

828
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,500
like Skynet and find people with the right experience

829
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,020
and invite them to apply to your job.

830
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,260
And the other people who don't have the right experience,

831
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,660
they get nuked.

832
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,420
Whoa, like Skynet?

833
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,140
By Skynet.

834
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,820
Zip Recruiter is so effective that 80% of employers

835
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,900
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

836
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,180
through the site within the first day

837
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,300
and the other 20%, they also get nuked.

838
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,780
Signing up for Zip Recruiter and being effective

839
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,500
is the only way to survive the nuclear apocalypse.

840
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,140
Listen, you're flipping a five-sided coin.

841
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,940
One of those sides, it's got a big mushroom cloud on it.

842
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:42,740
The other four sides has a new recruit for you

843
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,140
that is gonna do your business just perfect.

844
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,580
Right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter.

845
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,500
Now, we should say that nowhere in this copy

846
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,620
does it say anyone gets nuked,

847
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,300
but Griffin is reading between the lines

848
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,860
because it's pretty obvious if you look at what it says

849
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,100
that they're hinting at this.

850
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,500
Our listeners can try Zip Recruiter

851
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,980
and this grand roulette for free

852
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,580
at this exclusive web address, ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

853
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,020
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

854
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:14,820
Zip Recruiter, the smartest and deadliest way to hire.

855
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,860
Shouldn't say that.

856
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,780
Zip Recruiter, they probably want you to,

857
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,740
Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.

858
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,780
And then it says in parentheses, not all will survive.

859
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,460
No, it doesn't say that in parentheses.

860
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,060
I think I'm reading between the lines.

861
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,660
There's no, there's no lines.

862
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,380
There's no lines.

863
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,260
It's in brackets.

864
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,420

873
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,540
Pokemon or medication.

874
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,420
How do you play that?

875
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,580
You have to guess if something's a Pokemon name or a medication.

876
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,220
Medication.

877
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,580
First time listener, if you want to listen to episode highlights

878
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,620
and also know how to participate, follow Dr. Game Show

879
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,540
on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.

880
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,340
We'd love to hear from you.

881
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,300
Yeah, it's really fun.

882
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,740
For the whole family.

883
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,700
We'll be every other Wednesday, starting March 13th.

884
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,380
And we're coming to Max Fun.

885
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,260
Snorlax.

886
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,140
Pokemon?

887
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:15,380
Yes.

888
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:15,700
Nice.

889
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,940
I would love it if you all could join me for,

890
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,340
I'm really struggling about this because it,

891
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,740
I was going to go Munch Squad.

892
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,300
Okay.

893
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,940
But it has nothing to do with food at all.

894
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,460
It's just a press release.

895
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,060
But it is so challenging that I am going to go ahead

896
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,420
and bring it to y'all.

897
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,100
And I hope that you'll join me for it.

898
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,340
And this is not necessarily a segment.

899
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,740
And it's kind of outside the bounds of what we normally do.

900
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,740
But it's so challenging that I'd like to present it to you,

901
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,060
my brother.

902
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,660
Could not be a Munch Squad Junior, maybe?

903
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,620
Or how about Crunch Squad?

904
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,940
No, I mean, you need to listen to me.

905
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,860
It has nothing to do with food.

906
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,420
Could you slip just some references to food,

907
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,820
even if it's just side jokes that you make?

908
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,660
And can I ask why you found this?

909
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:08,980
Yeah.

910
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,100
I mean, it came into my inbox by someone saying,

911
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,980
someone tweeted at me quite rightly and said,

912
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,140
this is a Munch Squad that has nothing to do with food.

913
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,940
Okay.

914
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
And I was like, yeah, you're right.

915
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,900
It is somehow.

916
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,100
And this is not going to be,

917
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm not expanding the scope of this very important segment.

918
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,780
I'm just saying this is where we're at right now.

919
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,900
This is a one-off.

920
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,020
This is a one-off.

921
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,420
This is a press release for Megan Trainor's new album.

922
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,820
And also the new quick service restaurant she's opening?

923
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,060
No, it has nothing to do with food.

924
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,100
Again, I can't stress this enough.

925
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,620
Valentine's Day is around the corner.

926
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,140
And whether you're planning on smashing Bay's junk to smithereens

927
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,180
or making out with a pint of fish food,

928
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:54,340
you need some fresh Valentine's Day bops.

929
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,380
Governor, have you hung up?

930
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,180
No, I'm here.

931
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,620
I'm just challenged by it.

932
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,620
If someone came up to me and,

933
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,900
I mean, let's assume that I wasn't in a loving,

934
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,980
committed relationship, or even if I was,

935
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,140
if a loving, committed partner came up to me and said,

936
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,020
I want to smash your genitals to smithereens.

937
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
Yeah, just turn them into goo.

938
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,900
That sounds terrible.

939
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,660
It seems like there's going to be a lot to this.

940
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,980
So let's see if we can let Justin get through a little bit more

941
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,940
before we stop him.

942
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:22,100
You need Valentine's Day bops to get you in the mood for love.

943
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,460
And Megan Trainor's got you covered with her new EP,

944
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,180
The Love Train.

945
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,100
You know you want it and you can freaking get it, bitch.

946
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,380
Whoa, whoa.

947
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,820
On all digital platforms right here.

948
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,260
I want that to be followed up with,

949
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,180
you know what, I came in pretty hot there.

950
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,380
What I meant to say was-

951
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,140
That's cool, our jets a little bit.

952
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,900
Anyway, you may know me for my old sound.

953
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,860
It's evolved a little bit

954
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,180
and I'm excited about the new opportunities that brings.

955
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,300
Now, anyway, bring your genital triangle over here

956
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,900
and set it on the corner of this table.

957
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,460
Thank you.

958
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,420
I'm about to blast it.

959
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,780
But we know you want to hear songs

960
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
about all the hot newlywed sex

961
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,100
Megan and Daryl Sabara are having.

962
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh, I don't.

963
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,420
And here they spelled bae, B-A-E.

964
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,620
And I guess, do you guys want to know about-

965
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,140
Do you guys want to know about the hot newlywed sex

966
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,740
that Megan Trainor is having with the kid from Spy Kids?

967
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,780
Oh, yes Al, yes.

968
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,020
Sorry, I didn't mean it this way, yes.

969
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,340
Yes, that's who she married.

970
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,180
Yeah, it says here on this press release,

971
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,020
Megan seducing your ears this V-Day

972
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,380
and you know she knows a thing or two about romance.

973
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,380
Unless your phone's been broken for a hot minute,

974
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,660
you know that Megan just got married

975
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,100
to the ginger from Spy Kids.

976
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:35,940
What?

977
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,660
And trust us when we say girl is feeling the love.

978
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,980
She took a break from her busy schedule

979
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,380
to record some fire tracks in Los Angeles.

980
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,420
Alongside frequent collaborators and producers,

981
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,380
it doesn't matter.

982
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,580
We know you want to hear songs

983
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,340
about all the hot newlywed sex Megan and Daryl Sabara

984
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,220
are having.

985
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,420
Did you see what we did there?

986
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,860
What they did there, for the record,

987
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,220
is turn the bae in Mr. Sabara's name into B-A-E.

988
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,060
You just called the kid from Spy Kids Mr. Sabara.

989
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,780
Handle that.

990
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,500
All right, I'm sorry, Dr. Sabara.

991
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,260
Which is why you'll love the banging single, All the Ways.

992
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,780
Billboard was wet for All the Ways.

993
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,460
No, no, no.

994
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,020
No, no, no.

995
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,860
Billboard got wet for All the Ways,

996
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,980
calling it another fun, danceable track

997
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,860
to fall in love with.

998
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,260
And would Billboard lie to you, girl?

999
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:30,820
Holy shit.

1000
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,340
Would Billboard lie to you, girl?

1001
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:35,380
This outlet cannot become wet.

1002
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,780
This outlet cannot become wet.

1003
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,060
The outlet can't be wet.

1004
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,780
But perhaps the piece de resistance

1005
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,700
that's French for wig snatch.

1006
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,180
It's not.

1007
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:44,580
It's not.

1008
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,340
It's not.

1009
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,020
It's Marry Me.

1010
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,180
A romantic acoustic guitar hanging there, folks.

1011
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,740
You can not fucking backpedal this.

1012
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,980
You just said a magazine got wet.

1013
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,060
Just, you know what?

1014
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,340
You're gonna be impressed.

1015
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,140
You're gonna be impressed.

1016
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,540
You know what?

1017
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,420
You're about to feel,

1018
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,100
what you're about to feel is being impressed.

1019
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
It's a romantic acoustic guitar

1020
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,020
and ukulele-tinged all fest,

1021
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,140
which delivers all the feels and then more feels.

1022
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,980
So they did actually bring it back

1023
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:17,220
to absolutely disgusting.

1024
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,740
Just in a different way.

1025
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,380
Is the all fest gonna get me wet?

1026
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,420
I'm having a hard time following the metaphor.

1027
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,340
It's no metaphors.

1028
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,860
It's just words and letters and images and time.

1029
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,060
It's a ukulele-tinged off.

1030
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,780
Oh my God.

1031
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,060
I can't fucking say it again.

1032
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,700
All fest, which delivers all the feels

1033
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,580
and then more feels.

1034
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,500
Is one of the feels, it feels wet?

1035
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Ah, Megan wrote the song 30 days after meeting Daryl

1036
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,620
and it was so good, she walked down the aisle to it.

1037
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,060
We know that's a little bit hashtag vom-worthy,

1038
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,780
but also, am I chopping onions right now

1039
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,260
or are those tears rolling down my face?

1040
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,860
I'm not crying, you're crying.

1041
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,620
I am actually chopping onions.

1042
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,660
You're actually wrong.

1043
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,700
My eyes are wet.

1044
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,900
My eyes are getting wet.

1045
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
My eyes are just moist.

1046
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,060
Yeah, I'm still thinking about all the ways

1047
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,100
that you and the Spy Kid both made me cry.

1048
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,420
Both man, I guess, now are making love.

1049
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,300
Spy man.

1050
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,380
And the Spy Man and you are making love

1051
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,740
in, I guess, all the ways

1052
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,700
and just hearing that makes my eyes glisten.

1053
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,300
I would like to say, I don't wanna just gloss over

1054
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,140
that Megan Trainor wrote, produced, recorded a song

1055
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,180
that then she walked down the aisle to her own song.

1056
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,980
Fuck that, that's powerful.

1057
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,860
That's fucking crazy.

1058
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,820
That's what I'm saying.

1059
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,700
That's great.

1060
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,500
I know, it's so sad that Megan Trainor,

1061
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,620
who I think rules, is saddled with this.

1062
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,860
Anyway, moving on, unless she wrote it herself,

1063
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,460
which would be hysterical.

1064
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,340
As always, our Grammy-winning, Diamond single

1065
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,220
having Queen didn't just come to play.

1066
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,260
She came to slay.

1067
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,060
She's murdering left and right.

1068
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Get out of here.

1069
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,900
She's serving vocals.

1070
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,460
Like, yeah, I'd hope so on the passionate

1071
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,340
Celine Dion-esque power ballad After You.

1072
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,220
Now, Celine Dion, there's a singer

1073
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,980
that can get a magazine wet.

1074
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,540
Oh, yeah, and can make a hell of a quick service restaurant.

1075
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,180
You guys are such cowards because you're trying

1076
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,380
to break up the delivery of this poison

1077
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,220
with your James and hilarity.

1078
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,140
You need to just buckle in, okay?

1079
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,420
Let me get through this.

1080
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,940
Please, let me get through this.

1081
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,220
Okay, she's serving vocals on the passionate

1082
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,140
Celine Dion-esque power ballad.

1083
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,260
This is the most insane thing

1084
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,300
that's ever been in a press release,

1085
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,820
and I just, I read a lot of press releases,

1086
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,140
and the turn this press release takes,

1087
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,340
it's really challenging, and I am so sorry

1088
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,980
about putting this press release into y'all's heads

1089
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,020
because I was actually woken up at 3 a.m. last night

1090
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,260
by my daughter and unable to fall back asleep

1091
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,900
because I kept recounting several choice segments

1092
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,940
of this entire press release,

1093
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,780
but this is the one that,

1094
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,540
one of the more challenging segments.

1095
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,700
Megan's serving your insatiable thirst

1096
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,900
for dance-ready bops with the upbeat banger

1097
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,860
that is foolish.

1098
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,580
It slaps so hard you'll be standing for days.

1099
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,060
Whoa.

1100
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,020
My feet would get tired.

1101
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,320
Whoa.

1102
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,740
Like it slapped my bottom so hard I can't sit down?

1103
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,460
It slaps so hard you'll be standing.

1104
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,900
Is that what they did to Billboard?

1105
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,940
Sorry, no, bud.

1106
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,340
Standing, S-T-A-N-N-I-N-G, for days.

1107
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,740
That's proper usage of that, right?

1108
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
You stand for certain amounts of time

1109
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,660
and then see standing after you enjoy something deeply.

1110
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,540
And then there's a quote in the same paragraph,

1111
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,460
and the quote is this.

1112
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,420
As if all the PDA, including foot massages,

1113
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,980
butterfly kisses, and piggyback rides

1114
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,660
aren't cringe-worthy enough,

1115
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,140
says her brother and videographer, Ryan.

1116
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,260
I've gotta film it all.

1117
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,220
Whoa, whoa, wait, what?

1118
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:03,860
What?

1119
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,020
Whoa, it's the same, guys.

1120
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,060
It's the same, guys.

1121
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,740
It's the same paragraph.

1122
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,260
She's got this dope track better than Celine Dion.

1123
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,900
She's gonna slap your ass so hard with her one dance track

1124
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,020
that you'll never be able to sit down

1125
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,300
for the rest of your life.

1126
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,940
I have to watch them kiss and it's my job,

1127
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,500
says her brother.

1128
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,060
And Megan makes me film them kissing.

1129
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,900
Hey, Justin.

1130
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,260
Justin, I'm very successful now as a pop artist

1131
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,180
and I wanted to hire you into my entourage

1132
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,020
so that you basically never have to work again

1133
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:34,580
except for me.

1134
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,820
One thing, though.

1135
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,620
One little thing.

1136
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,140
You will have to film my sensual selections

1137
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,020
with my lover.

1138
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,420
Film me with my lover.

1139
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,180
Anyway, choo-choo.

1140
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,420
Choo-choo, bitch.

1141
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,340
It says B-E-T-C-H.

1142
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,460
You tell me how to say it.

1143
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,700
You tell me how that's said.

1144
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,740
You say it, B-E-T-C-H.

1145
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,940
I'm not going to say it.

1146
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,060
This press release has no power over me.

1147
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:02,260
Choo-choo, bitch.

1148
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,500
The love train is leaving the station

1149
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,940
and you better get on board.

1150
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,260
Now you're threatening me.

1151
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,780
Get on board or...

1152
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,300
Actually, could I vote for the sweet release

1153
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,140
of being crushed under its wheels?

1154
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:17,300
Is that an option?

1155
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,260
I mean, here's the thing, though.

1156
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,940
I'm sure the album is the slap.

1157
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,380
I have no doubt about it.

1158
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,780
There's probably some good tunes on here.

1159
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,220
It doesn't make, I don't need to know

1160
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,420
that your brother filmed you kiss.

1161
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,060
I also don't want to hear about your sensual makeout session

1162
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,300
with a magazine that got it all moist.

1163
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,340
Yep, or with your husband.

1164
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,940
And I'm not here to shame you for that.

1165
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,940
I just, I wasn't previously curious about it

1166
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,260
before this press release had entered my life.

1167
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,900
And as I find my way, you know,

1168
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,660
on the off ramp of this press release,

1169
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,460
I gotta say, I still kind of am not curious about it.

1170
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,500
Thank you very much.

1171
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,900
Oh, by the way, All the Ways,

1172
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:02,420
the video for All the Ways is a song that she sings

1173
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,100
asking a guy to tell her all the ways in which he loves her.

1174
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,180
It's not about all the different ways

1175
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,980
that the lady from All About That Bass

1176
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,540
and the ginger from Spy Kids are doinking.

1177
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:14,420
It's not about that.

1178
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,220
As far as I can tell, the video probably features

1179
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,980
a man-sized teddy bear.

1180
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,580
I don't know what to say about this.

1181
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,660
Wouldn't it be, like, I would,

1182
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,980
I think it would be funny to hear a song

1183
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,420
in which the singer just listed all the different ways

1184
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:30,980
that they and their partner had had sex.

1185
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,500
I'm watching this video right now.

1186
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,300
They're in a bus.

1187
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,380
They're walking down dark New York City street.

1188
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,260
What was that?

1189
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:37,300
Hold on.

1190
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,460
There was like a flash frame.

1191
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,420
I'm running it back.

1192
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,540
It's around two minutes.

1193
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,900
Yeah, she's finger blasting the shit out of that bear.

1194
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,940
You're wrong, Justin.

1195
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,060
So you want a Yahoo?

1196
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:50,820
Yes.

1197
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,180
I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Sid Ross.

1198
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,580
Thank you, Sid.

1199
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,700
It's Yahoo Answers user.

1200
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,340
They're anonymous.

1201
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,220
I'm gonna call them,

1202
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,300
I'm gonna call this Megan Trainer asks,

1203
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:08,100
can a self-driving car get its own job as a taxi or Uber

1204
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,660
and live a life of its own?

1205
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:14,900
Oh, I like that final twist there at the end.

1206
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,900
Yeah, I didn't see that coming.

1207
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,420
I know that it can't, right,

1208
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,420
it's programmed to do a certain thing, right?

1209
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,140
But then it's just cruising down the cold Chicago streets

1210
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,820
and it pulls over,

1211
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:32,740
gets stopped at a stoplight on State Street

1212
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,340
and just a dude runs in and opens up the back door

1213
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,700
and hops in and is like,

1214
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,500
20 bucks if you take me up to the big bean, baby.

1215
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,700
Because that's how they all talk up there.

1216
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,380
It's fucking wild.

1217
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,660
And then the car is like,

1218
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:47,620
that's not normally what I do,

1219
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,180
but okay, and it drives up and it takes the money.

1220
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,100
And now this car driving robot has $20 to spend.

1221
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,420
And I think at this point is thinking,

1222
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,500
having some thoughts that are maybe a little off the grid.

1223
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,300
I personally welcome the idea of robot Lyft drivers

1224
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:08,420
because it would be nice to know when I get in the car

1225
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,820
that I won't have to explain what a podcast is

1226
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,820
after they ask me what I do.

1227
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,060
Yeah, that's a fun, yeah.

1228
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,260
That the robot would be like,

1229
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,940
podcasts are my blood.

1230
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,900
Like, I run on podcast energy.

1231
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,940
I don't know what you're talking about, Travis.

1232
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,540
I'm a line cook in a hotel.

1233
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,100
What, the robot?

1234
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,700
No, that's sort of my go-to.

1235
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,460
Oh, I see, good job, nice.

1236
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,300
Hold, stop, are those crickets?

1237
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,980
Those are the worst fucking sounding crickets

1238
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,180
I've ever heard in my entire life.

1239
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,020
That sounds like a Foley cricket

1240
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:38,660
that some dude in a studio in 1930

1241
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,300
is making by rubbing two nails together or something.

1242
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,220
I don't know why the clip has to be so long.

1243
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,500
Okay, it's finally over, sorry.

1244
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,700
Sorry.

1245
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,420
It's like, it's a cricket sound effect that's so long

1246
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,020
that after it gets the desired effect,

1247
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,100
it actually needs another cricket sound

1248
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,220
to come in after it,

1249
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,380
because it went on so long that no one's laughing anymore.

1250
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,740
So it's like a recursive, a recursive cricket sound effect.

1251
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,460
So, can this happen?

1252
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,580
Probably not.

1253
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,460
You want a different one?

1254
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,900
This one's sent in by Emily.

1255
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,940
Thank you, Emily Thomas.

1256
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,900
Yahoo Answers user.

1257
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:10,980
What are you supposed to do with that big bean?

1258
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:11,860
I've seen the bean.

1259
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,140
I mean, I wish, I want to just stand there with a chart

1260
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,900
and write on the chart what people do

1261
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,820
once they've reached the bean that they traveled to.

1262
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,780
Well, you can go inside

1263
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,940
and take the same picture everybody takes,

1264
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,460
or you can do what I do.

1265
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,620
Grease on up and try and climb on top of the thing.

1266
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,260
How do you grease?

1267
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,140
To make it harder.

1268
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,180
To get the challenge, though.

1269
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,620
Anybody can climb on top of the thing.

1270
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,380
I went skydiving.

1271
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,860
I went Rocky Mountain climbing.

1272
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,020
I climbed up that dumb bean.

1273
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,740
And it was greased up all the way.

1274
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,620
Here's one from Emily.

1275
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,500
Emily sent it in.

1276
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:44,980
Thanks, Emily.

1277
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,220
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Maddie, who asks,

1278
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,940
I need 50 words to describe birds visually.

1279
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,300
Let me know what words come up

1280
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,980
when you think of how birds look.

1281
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,500
I'm just going to start a count, I guess.

1282
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,100
Wait, do you actually have a counter?

1283
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,580
I'll get the calculator open

1284
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,540
and I'll just press plus, press one.

1285
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,380
Just actually do one plus one

1286
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:10,420
and then you press equal.

1287
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,100
Equals every time.

1288
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,060
I think that could work.

1289
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:14,580
Nah, it just keeps saying twos.

1290
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,700
Maybe it's a different calculator.

1291
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,580
Maybe something's like a counter app.

1292
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,740
Are you going to make hash marks on a piece of paper?

1293
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,060
I might have a counter app.

1294
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,220
I have a step counter.

1295
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,460
I can take a step every time we say step.

1296
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:28,900
This is good because it'll buy us some time

1297
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,740
to think of good bird words.

1298
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,580
I'm going to write, let me write down here.

1299
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,780
Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it.

1300
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,260
Okay.

1301
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:34,660
All right.

1302
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,860
Okay, I'm ready.

1303
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,140
Let's just start firing them off

1304
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,500
and I don't think we should go in order.

1305
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,540
I think we should just.

1306
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,420
Oh, okay.

1307
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,380
You actually fucked up with the first one.

1308
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:43,880
Beak.

1309
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:47,540
I mean, it describes a bird visually technically

1310
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,500
if you think about it.

1311
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Yeah, do you want me to describe a beak?

1312
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,180
Because that wasn't the challenge.

1313
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,020
Okay, listen, we're only one in.

1314
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,580
We got 49 to go so we can't quibble this much on all of them

1315
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,380
but I'm going to say no more anatomical terms

1316
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,620
because otherwise then that could just be the whole thing.

1317
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,180
Okay.

1318
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:02,680
Pretty.

1319
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:04,120
Up.

1320
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,060
Did you say up?

1321
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,020
Yes, that's three.

1322
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:09,380
God, guys, we have 47 to go.

1323
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,980
This is just going to last fucking forever.

1324
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,580
I thought for sure we'd be done by it.

1325
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,380
Flappy.

1326
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:13,940
Flappy.

1327
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,540
Aloft.

1328
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:16,980
Worms.

1329
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,140
Because they usually have worms in their mouth.

1330
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:19,640
Oh, okay.

1331
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,080
Hoppy.

1332
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,700
That was a bad one but it's on the list.

1333
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:24,740
They hop.

1334
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,740
Betaled.

1335
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,860
Betaled, I like it.

1336
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,500
Bewinged.

1337
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,820
Bebeat.

1338
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:31,860
Bebeat.

1339
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,820
That's 10.

1340
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:33,940
Befeathered.

1341
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:34,660
Yeah, all right.

1342
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:36,100
We can't, no, that's it for the Bs.

1343
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:36,980
No, we're B ones.

1344
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,780
We're B ones.

1345
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,280
Blue.

1346
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,140
Yeah, okay, hold on.

1347
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,180
We're up to 12.

1348
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,660
Red, yellow, white, gray.

1349
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,460
That's 16.

1350
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,500
That's most, that covers most of the bird colors.

1351
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,380
Like families.

1352
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,260
Squawky.

1353
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,340
Squawky's good.

1354
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,460
I would say just blanket.

1355
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,300
Number 18, just noisy.

1356
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,860
Noisy.

1357
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,380
Wait, is this, what is the question?

1358
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
Describe birds usually.

1359
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:02,900
Minus one.

1360
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,860
Okay, so squawky.

1361
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,420
Minus one.

1362
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,300
Okay, we're at 16.

1363
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,060
We're at 16.

1364
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,780
Okay, beady-eyed, but it's hyphenated.

1365
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,980
Okay, we'll accept it.

1366
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:11,620
Intimidating.

1367
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,260
Nice.

1368
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,060
Inspiring.

1369
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:13,560
Okay.

1370
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:14,580
Threat.

1371
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,340
No, we already said intimidating.

1372
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,460
Harbingers.

1373
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,980
Harbingers is a noun.

1374
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,860
Minus one.

1375
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:20,580
Harbingies.

1376
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,540
And not visual.

1377
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,260
And not harbingies.

1378
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,540
Okay, and we're back up to 20.

1379
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,620
Okay, unnerving.

1380
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,420
Unnerving.

1381
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,300
Shitty.

1382
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,260
Okay, I like that.

1383
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,540
You think birds as a whole look shitty?

1384
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,340
I think they can be.

1385
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,340
I think birds can look shitty.

1386
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,500
Okay, sexy.

1387
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Elegant.

1388
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,840
Goofy.

1389
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:42,900
Mysterious.

1390
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,780
We're at 26, boys.

1391
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:45,220
We're past the halfway point.

1392
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,100
What about this?

1393
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:46,580
Horny.

1394
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,140
Yeah.

1395
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,820
That bird looks horny.

1396
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,620
It looks horny.

1397
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:52,660
Well, yeah, sometimes you see the two birds and they have their wings way out, and they're

1398
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,500
just like walking towards another bird's ass.

1399
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,260
Like, that bird's ready to fog.

1400
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,580
Let me see, how about this one?

1401
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,140
Delicious.

1402
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,980
That bird looks delicious?

1403
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:01,540
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1404
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:02,100
Great point.

1405
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:02,600
Great.

1406
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:04,900
It's small.

1407
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:05,460
Kickable.

1408
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:06,740
No.

1409
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,140
No.

1410
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,540
Wait, we can go with delicious but not kickable?

1411
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,260
No, because it's mean and it's too edgy and it's too-

1412
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:12,980
Huggable.

1413
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:13,940
Spencer's gifts.

1414
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,980
Huggable will allow.

1415
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,340
I would like to hug an ostrich.

1416
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,260
A big bird.

1417
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,380
Two, we're at 30 right now.

1418
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,620
Can we do two words together?

1419
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
And it could just be my pet.

1420
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:23,860
Yeah.

1421
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,820
Because they can be my pet.

1422
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,820
They look like your pet.

1423
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:28,020
My savior.

1424
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,700
My pet is 31 and 32.

1425
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,620
You say my savior?

1426
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,420
I did, yes.

1427
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:33,220
33, 34.

1428
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,620
Everybody gets a two word one.

1429
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,420
Mine's my pet.

1430
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,340
Travis did my savior.

1431
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,700
And Justin, what's your two word one?

1432
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,060
My immortal.

1433
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,140
My immortal gets us up to 36.

1434
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:44,340
We love these birds.

1435
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,020
Half angel.

1436
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,380
Nope.

1437
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,500
Is it hyphenated?

1438
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,060
Yes.

1439
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,940
It doesn't make sense.

1440
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,900
We're still at 36.

1441
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:52,340
Criss angel.

1442
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,580
I'm torn on that one.

1443
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,700
I could go either way.

1444
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:00,580
Birds don't look like criss angel.

1445
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:03,140
Criss angel can sometimes look like a bird.

1446
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:04,740
He can turn into nine birds.

1447
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,300
But that's not, I don't think that visually describes birds

1448
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,260
as much as it sort of generally describes criss angel

1449
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,900
and his abilities.

1450
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,020
We are still at 36.

1451
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:13,140
I'm going to say biblical.

1452
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,340
Okay.

1453
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,180
They look biblical?

1454
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,020
Yeah, it's just like you see a dove and you're like,

1455
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,940
there's one of Jesus's good friends.

1456
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,220
Deliverers.

1457
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,460
Oh man, you don't know what adjectives are.

1458
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,500
Let's stop, let's stop, let's stop.

1459
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,140
We're at 37.

1460
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,980
I feel like we're going to get really chunked up here

1461
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,660
if we don't like get back to basics real quick.

1462
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:33,060
Beak.

1463
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,300
Yes.

1464
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,180
We already got beaked, yeah.

1465
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,140
I think we got bebeaked.

1466
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,820
I think I feel like we're missing, what about like extant?

1467
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,020
Yeah, like they're corporeal.

1468
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,660
Corporeal.

1469
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,380
Look there.

1470
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,740
They look not transparent and not translucent.

1471
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,380
Opaque.

1472
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,060
Opaque, yeah.

1473
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,580
Birds are opaque.

1474
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,620
Can I hit you with this one?

1475
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,540
Birds.

1476
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,300
Oh, okay.

1477
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,260
Okay.

1478
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,900
I feel like that's describing birds in one word.

1479
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:05,620
But see, what's good about that one is that it does describe

1480
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,340
birds look like birds, but also if somebody just finds this

1481
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,660
list sitting on the street, they're going to kind of know

1482
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,340
what we're talking about when they get to birds.

1483
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:14,500
I mean, it is number 41, so they're going to be

1484
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,580
confused up to that, but when they see birds,

1485
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,340
it's like the secret codex.

1486
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:19,780
Let me see what you guys think about this one.

1487
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:21,620
Toronto!

1488
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,500
Like the Blue Jays.

1489
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:24,340
Toronto Blue Jays is 42.

1490
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,220
Now here's my question.

1491
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:28,100
Maybe the last three words, Griffin, because it didn't say

1492
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:31,700
we can't use punctuation, can just be, you know, birds.

1493
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,380
And it's just, you know, comma, birds, question mark.

1494
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,660
We already done our compound once.

1495
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:37,700
We already said they're birds.

1496
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,500
We have eight words left, and these are our home stretch,

1497
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,540
and we really got to make them count.

1498
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,820
We've gone really long in this recording,

1499
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,420
but this is an important thing now.

1500
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,220
Fatherly.

1501
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,660
Sorry, you both over spoke.

1502
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:46,900
Okay.

1503
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,740
Now I want to hear Travis's first.

1504
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,780
I'll go second.

1505
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:50,660
Hungry.

1506
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:52,500
Birds do can look hungry.

1507
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:52,900
Yes.

1508
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:55,460
Birds do can look hungry.

1509
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,260
Paternal.

1510
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:56,820
Paternal.

1511
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:57,060
How?

1512
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:58,740
Just because they're on the nest?

1513
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,340
It looks like it would be a good dad.

1514
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:00,660
Okay.

1515
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,460
Oh, I've got it.

1516
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,340
Thieving.

1517
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,380
Oh, I like that.

1518
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,580
Show off one word.

1519
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,580
Vain is a word.

1520
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,700
Vain's an adjective.

1521
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,100
Vain.

1522
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:10,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1523
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,620
How about this?

1524
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,580
Guys, guys, just stop.

1525
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:13,380
Hold on.

1526
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,180
We got four left, so I don't want them to be slams on birds.

1527
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,340
I want the last four to be good words about birds.

1528
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,300
Can I give you this one?

1529
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,420
Avuncular.

1530
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,060
What's that mean?

1531
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,660
Like unto an uncle.

1532
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,140
A nature that is like an uncle.

1533
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,060
An uncle style nature.

1534
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,300
So wait, you're saying you would look at a bird and say,

1535
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,460
I would let that bird maybe like hang out with my daughter,

1536
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,060
who would be its niece.

1537
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,900
That bird could be my dad's brother.

1538
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,300
Okay.

1539
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,180
Yeah.

1540
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,940
That bird I would go to a baseball game with.

1541
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:48,500
I'm not going to put that one on the list.

1542
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:48,820
Okay.

1543
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:49,300
That's fair.

1544
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:49,860
You know what?

1545
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,540
That one may have been too far.

1546
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:51,940
We're at 46.

1547
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:52,980
Did we say delicate?

1548
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,420
Delicate.

1549
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,780
Yeah, we'll allow that.

1550
00:56:58,180 --> 00:56:58,980
I did.

1551
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,100
We set up, right?

1552
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,900
Pretty early.

1553
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,820
What about zany?

1554
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,660
Because they look so zany.

1555
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,700
Yeah, they can be funny.

1556
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,180
Zany.

1557
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:07,860
I thought you said veiny.

1558
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,500
We're at 48.

1559
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,300
They can be veiny.

1560
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,940
That's 49.

1561
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,660
Okay, we got one word left, so let's make it count.

1562
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:18,500
And, you know, we may have a few here and have to like pick the top contender.

1563
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,980
I'm gonna, if we haven't said it before, proud.

1564
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,780
I think I'm almost certain we've done that one.

1565
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,740
How about this one?

1566
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:25,300
Eggs.

1567
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,060
Well, around.

1568
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,100
Well, we kind of did a whole round of they exist.

1569
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,660
I feel like around just kind of acknowledges their existence again.

1570
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:39,780
Dinosaurs.

1571
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,300
Dinosaurs is bad.

1572
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:43,380
Well, because birds used to be dinosaurs.

1573
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,260
Yeah, but they ain't now.

1574
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,820
What about pointless?

1575
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:51,780
That's so mean.

1576
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,100
What have they done for me lately?

1577
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,060
How about shirt ruiners?

1578
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,900
I think shitty because that covers a lot.

1579
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,860
I already did shitty.

1580
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:02,740
Pay attention.

1581
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,020
God, we've been in this bit for too long.

1582
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,300
We need a 50th word.

1583
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,900
Just give them the 50th word.

1584
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:07,780
Beak.

1585
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,900
No, we did beak at the beginning, although I do like that.

1586
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:12,660
I do like it coming around like that.

1587
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:15,300
Yeah, I like the, we'll call them beacons.

1588
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:16,820
Oh, I got it.

1589
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,700
Oh, wait a minute.

1590
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,340
What do I got?

1591
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,300
Oh, I got it.

1592
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,060
What about presidential?

1593
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,020
That's pretty good.

1594
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:23,380
What about hyphenated?

1595
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:24,500
The end.

1596
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,140
And that could be, if we turn the list into the teacher,

1597
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,580
they'll know that that's where I finished.

1598
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,300
I love that.

1599
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:30,100
That's so good.

1600
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:31,780
All right, that's 50.

1601
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:32,340
Thanks, folks.

1602
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,380
Thanks, folks.

1603
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,940
We've had a great time with you this week on My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1604
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,180
We hope you've enjoyed yourself as well.

1605
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,660
Well, you're always so nice to us and listen to our podcasts and stuff.

1606
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,500
And we just think that that's real swell of you.

1607
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,100
We just think the world of you guys.

1608
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:50,740
All things considered, I think it's really nice that you listen to our podcasts.

1609
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,780
And I also think it's really nice that you listen to All Things Considered.

1610
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,340
Yeah, thank you.

1611
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,420
They really need your support now more than ever.

1612
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,860
We're doing some live shows coming up April 2nd, 3rd, and 4th

1613
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,380
in San Jose, California, and Salt Lake City, Utah.

1614
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:07,940
You can get tickets for those at mcroy.family and then click on tours there.

1615
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,380
And actually, the San Jose ones sold out so quickly.

1616
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:16,260
We had to open up new tiers of the theater, like new levels and balconies and stuff.

1617
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,020
So there are more tickets available.

1618
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:22,260
So if you tried to get those tickets a couple of days ago and weren't able to,

1619
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,740
try again because we put some more on sale.

1620
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,420
So go check that out, mcroy.family, and click on tours.

1621
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,940
And while you're at mcroy.family, you can check out all our other shows.

1622

And you can check out our merch page and see all the awesome stuff we have on sale there.

1624
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,460
Yeah, a lot of things, mcroy.family.

1625
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,980
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1626
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:49,540
It's a Departure, off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1627
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,660
It's a very good song, very good album that you should totally have by now.

1628
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,900

1632
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,140
Is that going to do it for us?

1633
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,020
I think so.

1634
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,300
Here's the final one.

1635
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,500
It was sent in by Merit Palmer.

1636
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:12,980
Thank you, Merit.

1637
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,340
It's Yahoo Answers user Henry who asks,

1638
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,660
Who out there hates BMW or Mercedes like me?

1639
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,460
I hate those cars with a potion.

1640
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:33,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

1641
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,580

You've been my brother, my brother.

1644
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:56,980
May I kiss your dad's square on the lips?

I'm bailiff Jesse Thorn, and justice is within your reach.

01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,220
My mom refuses to take my phone calls.

1651
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:11,940
My boyfriend says I should take our cats with me to graduate school,

1652
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,980
but I think he should keep them.

1653
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:17,700
In the court of Judge John Hodgman, justice rules.

1654
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,140
My partner's board game collection is out of control.

1655

My sister won't stop stealing my clothes.

01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:26,020
I'm Judge John Hodgman.

1657
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:27,140
I'm tough, but fair.

1658
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,660
Tough, but fair.

1659
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,660
I'll bring you justice, and I'm only a cop.

1660
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,580
I'll bring you justice, and I'm only a click away.

1661
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,100
Tipping.

1662
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,060
Automotive etiquette.

1663
