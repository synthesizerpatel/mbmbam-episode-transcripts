1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds come into your dream, take a chance on me.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like Chilean miners emerging from the ground, so does our wisdom bubble up to the surface and say to you,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hey, it's time to grow. Come grow with us. We're my brother, my brother and me.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We're an advice cast for the modern era.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Did you guys watch all the footage of those Chilean miners getting over it?

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I saw one. I was like, I get it.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't know why the entire time I was watching all 33 of those men be pulled from the loam.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All I could think about was, fuck yeah, America. We got in there and we did it.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We didn't have to do it. We just got in there and we got them all out.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think it was a real buzzkill though when the last one popped up and saw a shadow and went back down.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And now we got six more weeks of winter.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm glad they all survived because now we can make jokes about it.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If they hadn't, it wouldn't have been as funny.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, it would have been as funny later, but not now.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It wouldn't have been funny.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So our show, My Brother, My Brother and Me, is an advice show for the modern era.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We take your questions.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We think about them. We chew on them all week.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, a lot of people think we just read them and then make up stuff.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We really mull these over.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So let's take on the first question that we've carefully considered.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As always, if you have a question or a friend has a question, we love to get them.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We ran a little light this week.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So if you've got a good one, send it in to us.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The more challenging, the better.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
FormSpring asks, is it okay to sneak glances at the cleavage of women who are sitting down on the subway while I'm standing?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm over six feet tall, so I have a good height advantage.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a victimless crime, right?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Brian in a major metro area.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is actually, that crime does have a victim.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It is a victimful crime, I believe.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think it is your God-given right.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, okay, no.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
How are things in Mad Men world?

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah, really.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How is 1960?

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Did you hear about Kennedy?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think it's one of those things where as long as you can accept that they totally know you're doing it.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's never been a dude who's like ninja-like scoped out a chase cleavage and she wasn't aware of it.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And you've never, and let's say that no one's ever scooped a peak of cleavage down a turtleneck.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a two-way street, okay?

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think the thing is to be like, it's a fine line between grabbing a peak, that's what a cool kid does, and grabbing a leer.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You've got to get that smooth, smooth Roger Dodger glance out the periphery down.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you haven't seen Roger Dodger, you need to, especially if you're in high school.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It'll change your world in a lot of ways.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's got a Facebook in it.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It does have, it has Jimmy Facebook.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Kid Facebook and Johnny Zombieland.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Kid's good.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
George C. Scott's son.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's an awesome man movie.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it'll teach you about how to do things like this without being a total monster about it.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The thing is, you biologically are going to do it.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The thing is, don't be a creep.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yeah, don't be a weird beard.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And always wear sunglasses.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Always wear giant sunglasses to protect you.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Novelty-sized.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you do do it, if you can change your face into the face of a wolf, and then like a big cartoon wolf face,

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and then let out like a howl while stomping your foot.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A wooga, a wooga.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's good too.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you make your eyeballs shoot, you know, one to two feet out of your head.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is a good opportunity actually to build some self-confidence if you do it properly,

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because you can get in there for a look, burn it into your mind.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just burn it into your mind.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And then look away knowing you could look more, and it's a big self-confidence booster.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You say, wow.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wow, Justin.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What restraint.

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yep.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What restraint you're showing.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're like a Zen master.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you're not a creepy weirdo.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you had restraint when you not do it in the first place.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're saying once you get a sampling, once you get a sampling of it.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Get a sampling.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And then you're like, it's like when you go into Cold Stone and you're like,

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
let me try the peanut butter chocolate hoedown.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then they give you a little spoonful of it.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And you're like, you know what, fuck this.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And then you flip the spoon at them and you walk out.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's insane.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to go get some yogurt.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was going to make that exact same analogy with that exact same flavor of ice cream.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, wow.

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I guess I'm not the only fan of this made up ice cream flavor.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My friends, no, sorry.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let me start again.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good start.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My wife's best friend sucks.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, David.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Infidelity is not the secret to a happy marriage.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All she does is critique the, oh, not that.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
All she does is critique things and she is way too negative and she disagrees with everything I say.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Every time we're together, it's like she's competing with me on who knows my wife better.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Also, she always has to one up what I have to say.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I usually ignore her and I don't indulge her, but sometimes she just pushes way too many buttons.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I am never flat out mean to her, but I'm reaching my breaking point.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is there any way to handle the situation without being mean?

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh, David.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm starting to get the impression that like half of the questions we get have something to do with a friend of a friend or a friend of a brother or a friend of a wife.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Just like a second hand acquaintance who just sucks and nobody knows how to deal with them.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We should like start some kind of service where we roll up in a van and we just take that person away.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not hurt.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No, not hurt.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Just take them away and leave them in a cornfield somewhere.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yeah.

122
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dazed and confused and spin them around a couple of times and then just leave them there with a bottle of water and a granola bar.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Pretty sure that's a federal crime, what you just described.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That is kidnapping, yes.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Technically.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,000
To quote Spice Girls, if you want to be her lover, you got to get with her friends.

127
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Right.

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm having déjà vu.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Have we answered this exact same question in this exact same way before?

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, I just think it's such a common problem because David and I might be going out on a limb here, but give me a chance.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think that a lot of the times that you have these problems where, you know, my wife's friend or my boyfriend's friend or whatever,

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think it has to do with the fact that there's a dichotomy sometimes between who you are with your friends and who you are with your SO.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And I think that sometimes that dichotomy can cause problems.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I often said that the key to finding the best possible person for you is the person who you feel like you could be the same you around your friends and around them.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And when you find that person, that's a really good indication that there's someone you can really build a life with.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And it sounds like there might be a dichotomy here.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And I'm not saying that like you and her are meant to be.

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm just saying that that can cause some real friction because a lot of times you're different people with your significant other and friends.

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I also think that if it really feels like she's competing with you, she probably is, dude.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Like, she's probably, you know, this is her best friend and, you know, she's married now and she's probably feeling like she's losing her best friend and everything like that.

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So I think as far as taking care of it without being mean, I think the more you strive and this is going to feel counterintuitive, but the more you strive to include her in things and be pleasant with her and let her know that she's not getting cut out of the situation.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't have to say it, but you have to show it and be like you're included.

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
But at the same time, you also need to talk to your wife and be like, hun, your best friend is being a complete bitch.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And either this needs to stop.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, don't say that. Why are you? Why not? You have to be upfront animal today.

146
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Part of the part of the problem is that you it's not just that you don't like the friend.

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's that you feel like the friend is competing with you for the affections of the person that is more important to you than anything.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which she probably is. She probably is. Just eat that. Just eat it.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't there's nothing you can do about it.

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Get confident. Say there's no way that you can move in on this special love that we have.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, yeah. You've won, dude. You've got it over. Yeah, you won.

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So now you got to be a good sport and, you know, invite the second place finisher to hang out.

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, I have so many Yahoo answers questions that we've been at.

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The embarrassment of riches, right? I have been flooded in Yahoo answers questions.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think I'm going to kick it off with this one. This one was sent in by Thomas Reese.

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's by Yahoo answers user. Love you. They sell out.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's the fight of salad. Yeah.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Who asks help my water just broke, but I need to finish watching this hilarious movie on YouTube.

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is there any is there any way to hold off labor for another hour? I really don't want to miss the ending.

160
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Additional details. I'm not missing the ending. I already had to miss the homecoming dance because of this babby.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
God, babies are such an inconvenience. They are. They are an inconvenience.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The top answer is by Doc Mojave, who says, Get an iPhone and hurry. That's a pretty good suggestion, I guess.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Did he mean hurry to get an iPhone or hurry to go to the hospital?

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I mean, those iPhones are selling out pretty quickly. Yeah, they're banging, right? They're huge.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I would posit that maybe you should get your fucking shit together because you're about to give life to a human.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's going to be your responsibility. And YouTube movies, they can wait. You can finish that movie later.

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So often there's if it's a movie, like if someone just uploaded Save the Last Dance or something,

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
there's a copyright infringement claim while you're giving birth. I didn't think about that.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah, you see, you guys just can't. This is why I think about these ahead of time.

170
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is why I did some legal research into Save the Last Dance and copyright holders and things like that.

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm reading more answers on this and people like nobody's saying the obvious thing, which is what the fuck is wrong with you.

172
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're saying things like stick your feet in the air and elevate your hips. No.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
She said in other details, she's not missing the end of the movie. That is not an option.

174
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
She's not looking for that option. She's looking for like a cork kind of solution.

175
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I love that she goes so far as to clarify that she's already missed the homecoming dance.

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And everyone knows the second biggest point in a young lady's life is that funny YouTube video.

177
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's just balanced out. She's not missing that. She's already missed the homecoming dance.

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What movie is she watching? That takes an hour on YouTube.

179
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't understand. It's something historic. Oh, no, it's hilarious.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Maybe it's about the clean miners. They're pretty funny.

181
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Boy, I don't know what to tell you other than. How late is a late term abortion?

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like how does it go? What are you talking? You're talking like the six minutes till midnight.

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Which one is closer? Do they have YouTube at the abortion doctor's office?

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Because if so, I think you might have a what? Oh, I finally get it.

185
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That she's watching is that is vampire suck. And that way she can have two abortions at once.

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There it was. Hey, I've got a question from the Internet.

187
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When my fiance and I get married this summer, we'll have been together over five years.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Everyone says that any good couple will have their fights, but working through them is what makes the relationship last.

189
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
However, I've never had a fight with my wife to be sure.

190
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We've argued over where to eat and things like that. But the relationship has been pretty much conflict free thus far.

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are we doomed? Is it true? We need to fight more addled in Ann Arbor. That's a good one.

192
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
She hates you so much. She hates your guts in her heart of hearts in a deep down your heart of hearts.

193
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
She hates your guts. She hates your ever loving guts. And you might hate her guts a little bit.

194
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Other than that, though, you're probably good. Listen, you're talking to three guys who are raised Baptist.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't talk to us about stuff and your feelings deep, deep down and no one can ever find them. You put them right in that bottle.

196
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You cook that shit. You keep that in like a baby while you're watching YouTube.

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What does he use to say, Griffin? You stuff them down in a bottle and then you get a bigger bottle?

198
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You know what? I don't think there's anything wrong with it.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think that there are some couples that just don't fight, and I don't think that's not I don't think that's too weird.

200
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think that there are types of people who are just non confrontational and that when two of those people start dating, you know, it's normal for them not to fight.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I will tell you, though, that and this isn't for better or for worse, but the tenor of your relationship will change after you get married,

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:15:04,000
because the some of the things that you can sort of laugh off when you are not permanently hitched to this person for for your entire life become far more serious when you when you when you get married,

203
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
because then it becomes issues that affect both of you. And as as things happen.

204
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You will run into two problems. I think the only deficit you get from not fighting for this long is that when real conflicts do come up, you're not going to have a lot of experience with resolving them.

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So I guess what I'm saying is be more serious when you're picking a restaurant, like get a pros and cons list out and go to a relationship counselor.

206
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah. Just next time. Next time you guys are arguing over where to eat, just fucking turn up the heat on that shit. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You bitch. I will turn this car around and we are going to Applebee's.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I think that the fact of the matter is, as long as you feel like you're not holding anything back, that you're saying everything, then you're good.

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I mean, only you can judge it. But that's a good point. Are you look down deep in you and see if there's if you're getting everything out?

210
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because a lot of times fights can be people can put them off.

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I know I do this by saying, well, that's not worth fighting about.

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
My opinion isn't worth getting upset about.

213
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I guess I'm telling you, just be angrier, like get serious about this or maybe you just don't care at which point. That's great. That's fine.

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's so many things in my life that I'm like, I could get. No, I don't care. I'm not worried about that. I'll worry about that later.

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, you know the people they are. They're the people who sit and they say, what do you want to have for dinner tonight?

216
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You know, it says, what do you want to have for dinner? Yep. I don't care. What do you want to have?

217
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And then they eat their hands. Three hours later, they're like each other's hands. They eat each other's hands. Romance.

218
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Sweet, sweet romance. Let's do a Yahoo. This one's from Gun Blader sent this one in. Thank you.

219
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Thanks, Gun Blader. Yahoo answers user me.

220
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's like eight I's and nine O's. They ask, how do I become a prostitute without my parents knowing? I really want to be a prostitute, but no way will my parents even think of it.

221
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Stuffy uptight parents. These parents nowadays. The first most important thing you need to do is memorize the fuck out of your dad's license plate number.

222
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You do not want to make that that particular mistake. Holy shit.

223
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I guess you do it the same way you do anything that you don't want your parents to know that you're doing, although I imagine that there are more things to consider when you're hiding your prostitute lifestyle from your parents.

224
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Like the makeup, you got to take that off before morning before they drive you to school, right? Because they'll know if you get any shiners during the thing, it can happen. It can happen.

225
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're going to have to come up with a solid excuse for that. You got to be you got to be careful about what lies you tell your parents as to what you're really doing.

226
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Because the last thing you want is your mom to confront you at the breakfast table and say, Debbie, why is it every time you come home from church group, you're walking like slim pickings like the inside of a whiskey bottle?

227
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I imagine the hardest thing to hide is probably forging the parents signature on the permission slip because pimps won't just take underage women.

228
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They have a lot. That's what I was just thinking about is how is how to introduce your pimp to your family without.

229
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Now, you say that Dr. Money Money here is your tutor. He's correct. What do you teach, Dr. Money Money?

230
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, I do hard lessons. I see. Teach this bitch about the streets. I mean, pre-algebra sociology. What did I say? I'm sorry, Destiny. I mean, Debbie. Fuck. So, Dr. Money Money, is that a is that did you get a Ph.D. or is that like a medical?

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah, Ph.D. in hard knocks. What? Nobody. Do pimps say things like hard knocks? Is that a thing pimps say? I'm not only only the old fashioned pimps talk about how it used to be.

232
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Tell your parents every time you go out hooking, tell your parents that you're going to science club. And then when you introduce your pimp to him, tell him it's an Android you invented.

233
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is my Android, Dr. Money Money. Yo, what's up? He's so lifelike. In order for this this scenario to play out the way we've envisioned it, you need to have really stupid ass parents.

234
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
To be fair, if you want to be a prostitute, I'm guessing that they're not doing a good job so far.

235
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I think for hooking advice on Yahoo Answers, they're probably not a brain trust. I just got sad all of a sudden.

236
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It went from being jovial to just kind of sad. That's really a person out there. That's a real person with that question on the Internet. They're looking for real advice.

237
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, Griffin, prostitutes hurt people. Don't be silly. That's like saying chairs are people.

238
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yeah, that's like saying chairs are people, which is appropriate because you sit on them.

239
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And they're made of wood. Don't you wish everyone still wore hats? Nope. Nope.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'd like to rock an awesome trilby, but I'm afraid of the ridicule. What should I do?

241
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You've made the mistake of asking three guys who don't look good in hats.

242
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We're really anti-hat because our heads aren't big enough.

243
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We have long heads. That's a good way to describe it. Just big heads.

244
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I wouldn't even say big as much as they're deep. We have deep, deep heads.

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's hard to put something on top of that without looking just silly.

246
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Whatever the reverse of a chasm is, we have that for heads.

247
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's like putting a hat on a boat is pretty much what you're doing.

248
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can't bend society to suit the fashion that you wish you could rock for yourself.

249
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There are only two ways to deal with this situation.

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You either get in line or you just start wearing that hat.

251
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's the risk if you wear the hat of being like, what's up with hat guy here? Who does he think he is with this hat?

252
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The important question you have to ask yourself, because I was talking to someone about a similar situation last night.

253
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Are you the type of person who wants to wear a hat or are you the type of person who's meant to wear a hat?

254
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
If you are meant to wear a hat, then you wear the shit out of it.

255
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you just want to wear a hat, then you're Billy Hat Guy and you don't want to be Billy Hat Guy.

256
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's the thing. Once you put this hat on, once you start rocking an awesome trilby, which by the way, no such thing.

257
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Once you start doing that, that's what your whole world is about after that.

258
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's what your whole situation is.

259
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh, you were in the Peace Corps for two years? Tough fucking break.

260
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Nobody cares. You're Hat Man. You're Mr. Hat. You're Sergeant Hat.

261
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Dr. Hat, I would like to wear a cape.

262
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay guys, question for you. Sub-question to the question. If you could wear one article of clothing and it would be considered socially acceptable that you can't wear right now, what would it be?

263
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
A vest.

264
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
A vest? That's okay, right? Doesn't that Glee teacher wear a vest?

265
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Vests are okay. Vests really are coming back.

266
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I would say brightly colored cis offenders.

267
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh yeah? Like Gallagher?

268
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like what?

269
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Like Gallagher?

270
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Like Gallagher or like Morgue.

271
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Morgue, yeah.

272
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Mine's cock rings.

273
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh God. That's your gut too.

274
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Can I ask, if you are putting yourself in a situation where people are commenting on your cock rings, you're doing it wrong.

275
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, yeah.

276
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I guess what I'm saying is I wish I could walk around with my wiener out. By extension.

277
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Yeah, by extension indeed.

278
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
In the baseball analogy, what is getting to third base?

279
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I think it's pretty clear that second base is getting touch boobies.

280
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
And home is intercourse.

281
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What would you call third base?

282
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I think it's got to be something that has at least the possibility of an orgasm.

283
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What do you think, Seth from Gmail?

284
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, in my experience, it's when second base is touch boobies.

285
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Third base is think about the terrible things you've done with your life.

286
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Sure, third base is guilt.

287
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Yeah, and then fourth base is sitting at home by yourself crying.

288
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Third base is getting to second base without having to pay for dinner.

289
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
No, for real though. First base is kissing.

290
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Second base is hand stuff.

291
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Third base is mouth stuff.

292
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And then a home run is, as you so delicately put it, intercourse.

293
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Like a robot. And a grand slam is her and her sister and a teacher.

294
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Right. A ground roll double probably has something to do with premature ejaculation.

295
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'll set that out later.

296
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
An error is true love waits.

297
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And never bunt.

298
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Never bunt. Absolutely. Absolute malt.

299
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I feel like there's more baseball analogies.

300
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
If only I knew more sports.

301
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Buying a cotton candy in the stands.

302
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
What is that?

303
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Paying too much for a program.

304
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, that's a metaphor for Mars, Venus, I guess.

305
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Going to the bullpen.

306
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What would be an in the parker?

307
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What?

308
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like when you hit a ball.

309
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
That's why it happens while she's still asleep.

310
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Yeah.

311
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That's accurate.

312
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Or when you have sex with a girl named Parker.

313
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Good luck with that.

314
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey, let's make this an appropriate segue, which we never do.

315
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Jphonic.

316
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Known creator of the dopest beats.

317
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And it is from Yahoo Answers user River Cole who asks,

318
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What does BJ or HJ mean?

319
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
What does HJ mean in sex terms?

320
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Well, my friend used it in abbreviations and IDK what it means.

321
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I think that the answer to this one is pretty clear cut,

322
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
but I just wanted to share it because the first answer,

323
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
the top answer is the best thing I've ever read.

324
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's from Answerer 1 who says,

325
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Um, fun?

326
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Source.

327
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And the source for their information that HJs and BJs mean fun,

328
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,000
their source is 14 and loving it.

329
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Okay, so that means one of a few things.

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
One, this person has had 14 blowjobs or hits and is a fan.

331
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Mix and match, I would say.

332
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They are still in fact loving it.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Nine HJs, five BJs.

334
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah.

335
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Two in the Parkers.

336
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
They have bought cotton candy in this dance.

337
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
If you know what I mean.

338
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
If you know what I mean.

339
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Man, the rest of the answers on this are weird.

340
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I bet.

341
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah?

342
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know that I should be answering that.

343
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You mean what I'm going to do to you?

344
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Email me.

345
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm teenboy13.

346
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
HJ stands for Howard Johnsons.

347
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Yeah.

348
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Howard Johnsons.

349
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's when you guys fuck and then go to a Hojo's.

350
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
What's up?

351
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
What's up?

352
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Get the scramble.

353
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What?

354
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Pinch hitters.

355
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
I'm terrified of what that would be.

356
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Sit down, girl.

357
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm going to give you...

358
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Sit down, girl.

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm going to give you a Dusty Baker.

360
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
This is Jimmy.

361
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
He's my designated runner.

362
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I don't think you have this anywhere, do they?

363
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You just got to make sure you wear protection or else you'll get Lou Gehrig's disease.

364
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:48,000
I'll do this.

365
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Oh, God.

366
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm so sorry.

367
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
If Mrs. Gehrig is listening, it's our bad.

368
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Mrs. Gehrig, I'm so sorry.

369
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, God.

370
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Wouldn't that be a trip if your doctor was like, you have Lou Gehrig's disease?

371
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What?

372
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
No, that's a metaphor.

373
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You have chlamydia.

374
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, I guess it's better.

375
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, shit.

376
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Now I'm going to have to tell my parents about my prostitution.

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
My longtime friend of 20 years has turned into a bitter jerk in the past year.

378
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
How can I get him back to his old self again?

379
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
A frying pan to the head.

380
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Yeah, drop something heavy on him.

381
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Jeff, it sounds like you may not have your...

382
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We got another question right after this.

383
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It says, I've been really depressed for a year and my friend Jeff only thinks about how it affects him.

384
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
How can I find new friends?

385
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Come on, snap out of it.

386
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
My grandma just died, Jeff.

387
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Come on.

388
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Come on, I'm trying to party.

389
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's go get Loke tonight.

390
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Jeff, I told you.

391
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I have Lou Gehrig's disease.

392
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yeah, but you go to doctor...

393
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
No, like, for reals.

394
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Literal.

395
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:25,000
God, someone is going to think, God, these guys used to be funny, but then when they started laughing about Lou Gehrig's disease...

396
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
We're not laughing about Lou Gehrig's disease.

397
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

398
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
It's not funny at all.

399
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:41,000
But when you use it as a, like, referencing, like an STD for baseball metaphors, that sentence was so fucked up.

400
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Yeah.

401
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It was a real fucked up sentence I just pieced together there.

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Jeff, have you considered purchasing your friend a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt available now at bmbam.com?

403
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Nothing makes me feel confident and lovely like a My Brother, My Brother, Me T-shirt.

404
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Jeff, talk to him, buddy.

405
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Just say, like, hey, friend.

406
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Let's call friend Gregor.

407
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hey, Gregor.

408
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What has been bothering you for the past year?

409
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Because I feel like you're kind of down.

410
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Because, you know what?

411
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The problem is you're not an advice professional.

412
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
We are.

413
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So find out what his problem is and have him write in.

414
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Or you write in.

415
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then we can help him from there.

416
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But until you talk to him and figure out, like, like, bitter jerk, okay?

417
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's how it manifests on the outside.

418
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
But what, like, what's inside that bitter jerk?

419
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
What's inside that bitter jerk?

420
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Because somewhere deep down is that heart of that guy you've been a friend of for 20 years.

421
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You just got to help him brush away all that bitterness and get back to that guy who used to drive you home after you've been drinking too much.

422
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Shortcut, take him to Vegas.

423
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Vegas fixes everything.

424
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Also, he's secretly in love with you.

425
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Boom, boom, pow.

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Like, you have a situation on your hands that, you know, you got to talk to him about it before it develops from a schoolboy crush into a full blown, like, swim fan love affair.

427
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah.

428
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now, maybe it's reciprocated, in which case, God bless you, mom.

429
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Good work.

430
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Don't ask, do tell.

431
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What?

432
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
NBNB AM, there's this girl that I like.

433
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Original, right?

434
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
She's my best friend's girlfriend's best – wait, no.

435
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Okay, hold on.

436
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Let's try this again.

437
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:27,000
She's my best friend's, okay, girlfriend's best friend.

438
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

439
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Okay, got it.

440
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What should I do?

441
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
It could get kind of messy.

442
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The best things always are, FormSpring.

443
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The best things always are.

444
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
How else – like, okay, God bless you.

445
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
How else are you supposed to meet people?

446
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You can't eliminate people because they are of a tertiary friendship.

447
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No, like, my cousin used to go to science class with her brother-in-law, so I don't

448
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
think it's going to work out.

449
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's going to be messy.

450
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Her mom is my aunt and – no, wait.

451
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Do rule that out.

452
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's a good one.

453
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah.

454
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
This is – that's too many degrees of separation for you to be worried about it because if

455
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
you guys date and then break up, it's not like your best friend's girlfriend is going

456
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
to, you know –

457
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Unless you're in high school.

458
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Unless you're in high school and you guys all go to class together.

459
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
If it works out well, it could be really good because it's like double dating and stuff.

460
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
The problem with double dating couples that people don't tell you about is you can't

461
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
ever break up.

462
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No one can ever, ever break up because then it is a problem.

463
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Why is it going to get messy?

464
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Why are you thinking about the end of this relationship before you're thinking about

465
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
the beginning?

466
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
That ain't no way to love.

467
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It could be beautiful.

468
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It could be beautiful.

469
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
She could be the one.

470
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,700
What if she's the one and you let her go because it could get messy?

471
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,200
You know what's messy, FormSpring?

472
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Love is messy.

473
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Mm-hmm.

474
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,700
Love – there ain't no rules to love.

475
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,000
Untreated Lou Gehrig's disease is messy, for example.

476
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah.

477
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,320
Lot, lot of drainage.

478
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Just really –

479
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
Oh, God.

480
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Hey.

481
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,000
See a doctor and get rid of it.

482
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,520
Let's do another Yahoo because I got like nine more.

483
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Hit me.

484
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
Okay.

485
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,320
Let me pick the best one.

486
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Let's do two back-to-back because they're somewhat related.

487
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,400
This one was sent in by Dilbob.

488
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,880
Good name.

489
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,480
No, Dilbob is – Dilbob submitted an answer last week, so don't make fun of him because

490
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,480
he's a big, big fan of the show and he's a big supporter of the show.

491
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
And he's bad at picking names.

492
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,000
He's bad at picking names.

493
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,800
God love him.

494
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,920
It's from Yahoo Answers user iamattrolley who says –

495
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm going to call bullshit right now.

496
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,520
His profile image is the shopping cart, which I guess – do people call those trolleys

497
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
and where is this?

498
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
Probably British.

499
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
Oh, this is from Yahoo Canada.

500
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Whoa.

501
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Whoa.

502
00:33:52,520 --> 00:34:00,000
They ask, how far could Jesus give me a piggyback before tiring?

503
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,800
Now keep in mind, he weighs 75 to 80 kilos and he hasn't weighed himself in a while.

504
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Okay.

505
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,320
Do we have any idea what that conversion is?

506
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Because that could be like 700 pounds.

507
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,360
What we don't have is information about Jesus' upper body strength.

508
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah.

509
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,860
We know his calves are banging.

510
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,720
I know he's got to be totally ripped.

511
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,760
I imagine that working as a carpenter really blasts your core and it gets your delts and

512
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,480
your body is just banging, just banging and bustling out of your arm skin.

513
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Yeah.

514
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,360
He used to turn water into protein powder all the time.

515
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,200
I get why this guy's concerned though because there where there's one pair of footsteps,

516
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,520
that is where he's going to carry you.

517
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,520
So you want to know exactly how long of a trip you've got.

518
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
Right.

519
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,200
That's where you were getting an old piggyback ride and some cotton candy.

520
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,200
You know, the problem is Jesus will never tell you if he's tired of carrying you.

521
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,840
That's the thing because you could ask him all day because he's not going to admit to

522
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,840
it.

523
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,840
He'll just kind of pass out.

524
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,120
He'll just turn the other cheek.

525
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,040
This question was sent in by Jay.

526
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Thank you, Jay.

527
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:20,680
It's by Yahoo Answers user askamexican who asks, why does Jesus only visits when my camera

528
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,600
is out of batteries?

529
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:34,200
See, this sounds like a guy who has a lot of stories that a lot of people aren't buying.

530
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,280
One answerer, toke lover, he replied, he must be allergic to batteries.

531
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,280
That's a pretty good theory, I guess.

532
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,040
That's why he hasn't been around for a while.

533
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,960
I just love that it's not just that Jesus visited once, Jesus just keeps coming back.

534
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,320
Why don't you have batteries on hand?

535
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,200
Oh, Jay-Sue, it's so great to get the Nikon, get the Nikon.

536
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,480
I actually like to think that Jesus knows when it's out of batteries and he shows up

537
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,600
at that moment and goes, hey everybody, and then poofs out.

538
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,880
You think Jesus, you know, only stops by at random intervals?

539
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,280
No, he waits until you're out of batteries and then he comes to visit you.

540
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,760
I actually have used that for a system to know when I need to go buy batteries.

541
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Jesus, what the hell?

542
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Oh, hey Jesus, that time again?

543
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Alright.

544
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,680
I gotta get those rechargeables.

545
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Your dad, damn it.

546
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,480
I should have been ready.

547
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,480
You got me again, Jay-Sue.

548
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,520
Got me again, Jay-Sue.

549
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
Let's see, where are we at?

550
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
What do you think?

551
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
One more?

552
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Yeah.

553
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,080
Yeah, one more, we'll do a short one here.

554
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,520
Do you guys have any suggestions for a diet that will keep me working at the most efficient

555
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
rate?

556
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
Evan, Gmail.

557
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:00,040
It sounds like you need robot components to keep you working at maximum efficiency.

558
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Yeah, you need batteries.

559
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,920
That's why you'll never see Jesus.

560
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,840
All Subway sandwiches all the time.

561
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Yeah.

562
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
They seem to work really well.

563
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,880
I actually get what he's saying.

564
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,800
I think that there is a way of eating and taking care of yourself that makes you active.

565
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,440
I haven't followed that regimen in a while.

566
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Right.

567
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,920
Eat exactly the opposite of what your body is telling you to eat.

568
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,360
That seems to be the path to proper nutrition.

569
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,880
Be careful of like, if you get on a, and this, God, we're like the worst people to be asking

570
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,760
this question, but if you have too many carbs and sugars, then your body's just going to

571
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,760
keep wanting those, crashing.

572
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Yeah.

573
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Don't eat candy all day.

574
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Don't eat candy all day.

575
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,480
God knows I've had a two pound bag of Swedish fish and just like, this is what my day's

576
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,480
about now.

577
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Yeah.

578
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
But you're going to hate it.

579
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,080
You're going to hate how you feel.

580
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,520
What you got to do, and what I've been trying to do, trying to train my body up to do lately

581
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:08,600
is to combine all of my meals into one super big meal that I eat at around 2 PM.

582
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Super meal.

583
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Right.

584
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:16,800
And I call it Brunner, which is a portmanteau.

585
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,240
And it gets, I get all of my food groups in there and it takes about an hour to fully

586
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
eat.

587
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,240
Yeah.

588
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,960
And then you sleep for six hours.

589
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,760
And then I sleep for six hours, wake up at around 9 PM and just live the day out.

590
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,520
The weird thing about Brunner is, or super meal colloquially, is that if you, Griffin

591
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,080
needs complete concentration to avoid retching in the middle of it.

592
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,080
That's right.

593
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,280
If you call Griffin between two and three o'clock, you will just hear protracted vomiting

594
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,280
noises.

595
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Uh huh.

596
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,280
It's, he will.

597
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
But that's it.

598
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,280
That's another handy, that's another handy skill to have.

599
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,720
That's just one of the many benefits that Brunner gives to its, to its users.

600
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,440
Protracted vomiting or concentration?

601
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,960
The ability to not vomit when your body, just everything inside your body wants you to.

602
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,480
Every organ is working in harmony to try and get you to, to expunge.

603
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,600
I think the best suggestion is, think about, is this something the McElroy brothers would

604
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
eat?

605
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,120
And if the answer is yes, do not eat it.

606
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Don't eat it.

607
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Eat the opposite thing.

608
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
Well, let's be more specific.

609
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,160
If it's something that Travis would, does, and regularly eats.

610
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,360
Or has in the past.

611
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,960
Or has or is currently eating while you're asking the question.

612
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,720
Every so often, my lunch consists of eating an entire Papa John's large thin crust

613
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
pizza in one sitting.

614
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Yes.

615
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
Every so often.

616
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,000
See, I was joking about, I was joking about Super Meal.

617
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
But you really, you really go the whole nine yards on that.

618
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Your problem is that.

619
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I live that dream.

620
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,320
You do Super Meal and then you also do Mini Meals at around 10 AM and 10 PM.

621
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
Second Brunner.

622
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Pre-Brunner.

623
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
And then a spot of tea.

624
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,920
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

625
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,640
But first a couple of housekeeping things as always, nbnbam.com is the address.

626
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
For our website.

627
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,900
You can ask us questions there.

628
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,960
Please ask us questions.

629
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
I know you've got them.

630
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,460
Nobody gets through life without them.

631
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,880
We are going to have new t-shirts.

632
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,800
Just got a finalized design for a new design.

633
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Brand new design coming.

634
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,800
It's fresh.

635
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,800
It's fresh.

636
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,760
It'll probably be pre-orders in a week or so.

637
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,360
But of course we'll give you the heads up on that.

638
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,880
You can still get our app.

639
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,400
My brother and my brother and me, the App Experience.

640
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,800
It's on iTunes and there's a link at nbnbam.com.

641
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,280
Oh, I didn't mention it on the show, but there was a little bonus on last week's episode.

642
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,440
It was the full version of the acoustic number that we had at the end of the show, which

643
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,640
was, I can't remember the guy's name who wrote it, John Paloma.

644
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm so sorry.

645
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm sure he's listening and I just butchered his name, but thank you.

646
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,720
I'll get his full name and put it in the show notes.

647
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,760
A lot of people like that.

648
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Paloma.

649
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,760
Paloma?

650
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,280
P-A-L-O-M-B-A.

651
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
Thank you, you guy.

652
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,960
You guy, fella.

653
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,600
Thank you to people out there spreading the word.

654
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:19,260
I love to see people who just start listening to the show and then they go into like a show

655
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:23,440
coma and listen to all of them like back to back to back.

656
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:33,680
Corey was here, 1212, let's with a K, said, I just caught up on, no, no, no, no.

657
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Which one was Corey?

658
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,040
Oh, here it is.

659
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,800
Just listen to all 25 episodes and this show is amazing.

660
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:48,640
That's Corey was here, 1212, just a new listener on board and is preaching the converted.

661
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:58,040
Also we would be remiss to not mention Eric Smith, who is, if all goes according to plan,

662
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,840
currently getting a my brother, my brother, me tattoo.

663
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
God damn it.

664
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Don't do it.

665
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
Yeah, do it.

666
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
Do it.

667
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
Do it to yourself.

668
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
Don't listen to Griffin.

669
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Don't listen to Griffin.

670
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,960
If he does it, we're never recording the show again, everybody.

671
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,360
Just to let you know, this has all been a hilarious months long prank.

672
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,880
We'll actually remove all the episodes from the internet and we'll make it as though it

673
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,760
had never existed.

674
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,000
We didn't get too many, didn't get too many voicemails this week.

675
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,480

00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,800

678
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,880

We'll wait.

686
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,880
It's not a big deal.

687
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,800
Thank you guys so much for listening as always.

688
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,280
And we have a final question, sort of one to grow on, one to think about over this,

689
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:06,680
this week while we are apart, you and us.

690
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,920
And of course we will catch you back next Monday.

691
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,660
Oh, if you want to have a listening party, we've got a few people talking about it.

692
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,200
Make sure you email us with listening party and the subject line it's bmbam at gmail.com

693
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,040

694
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
party.

And we are happy to do it.

697
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:37,420
Um, thanks for spreading the word to everybody and turning your friends on everything.

698
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
Spread it around.

699
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,800
Spread it like Lou Gehrig's disease, Griffin.

700
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:48,320
This one is sent in by Cal, um, who sent in a few real, just bang up questions before.

701
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,600
Thank you so much, Cal.

702
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:55,720
Uh, it's by Yahoo Answers user Kane Forever, um, that's all caps, which is why I said it

703
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
like that.

704
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Okay.

705
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:04,720
Kane Forever asks, what is the earliest age that you should use anabolic steroids?

706
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, this has been my brother,

707
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,680
my brother and me, kiss your dad, square on the lips.

708
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
You will never know me.

709
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:38,680
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, this has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss

710
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:53,480
your dad, square on the lips.
