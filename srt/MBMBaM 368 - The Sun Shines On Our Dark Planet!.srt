1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Teelon McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am your babiest brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm your Uncle Dane.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Uncle Dane, welcome to the show for your, wow, is this your 300th episode with us?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's my 300th episode, and my brother's children, I'm so happy to be here with both of you today in the studio space.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Such an exciting place to be with you, my nephews.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I guess everybody was able to celebrate today, the brief time at which our son was uncovered.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Happened around two o'clock my time, we got to just see sunlight for once every hundred years.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now, I missed it because a bunch of mean school kids locked me in a closet.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yeah, it was a real fart in the face, but 2024.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Those kids at Bradbury High are so fucking cold.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They're such ding-dongs.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And you're a teacher there, Uncle Dane, you shouldn't let the kids treat you like that.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know, but my body's so small.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So I heard a thing on news that said that when the sun came out, there was a weird sort of radio interference.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And everybody pretty much across the world was hearing what they call podcasts,

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
which sounds like our data orbs, you know, how we like projected the show out on a data orb.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We were receiving a lot of podcasts and they suggested, like I heard this thing called Radio Lab.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And then this one podcast called Cereal, but not like the food stuff.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And they suggested that ours might also be projected out through the sun using the sun as some sort of weird conduit.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Did President Jerry O'Connell make a statement about this?

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Did he have anything to say about it?

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's our go-to science expert.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, and he did a lot of Slider's references, and I thought that that might be a fun vein for us to tap into as well.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I thought it was a little bit weird that he used Twogger to just put it out there.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Broken up into, I guess it was about 38 Twogs, it's weird that he's not taking to a stage or something more formal rather than using social media.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Frankly, it's weird seeing anybody use Twogger for anything other than just like complimenting each other and being like really, really nice to each other,

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
which is, of course, in this world.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And I don't know why I said in this world, but in this world, just sort of the way that everyone uses Twogger.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
To be fair though, President O'Connell has never been a traditional president.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, after he broke the country up into eight different countries.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At that point, using Twogger to make announcements isn't really that big a deal if you think about it.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So, boys, the question on everybody's mind is, how did you spend the sun period?

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Locked in a closet by bully children. I literally just said it.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, obviously Uncle Dane is on one of his cantankerous rants, Dane's drops that he does.

41
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Dane's veins.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Listen, I'll be the first one to go against the grain here.

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is one of Dane's grains where I'm going against it and sort of rubbing up against.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Because I know everybody's always saying how great millennials are.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll be the first one to say that I think there's some issues here.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I'll be the first one to highlight those.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Whoa, from downtown Dane.

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't even get on board with you, Dane, because think about all the things that millennials have saved.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They've saved the napkin industry, they've saved the housing industry, they've saved the magazine industry, they've saved everything.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This might be a weird thing to say, because we're literally just saying things that happened today on this very special day where the sun came out.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And we're just saying the truth, right?

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
For some reason, I feel this thing in my gut where this bit isn't working.

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Which is weird, because we're just saying the truth. We're just literally talking about what our day was like.

54
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Wait, but did you guys see Better Off Ted last night?

55
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh yeah.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It was so good.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every season gets better and better and better.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Every season gets better and better.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They've been going for so many seasons now.

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And you would think up against Firefly, they'd never be able to stay on air, but the two of them work together.

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Really, that's the thing.

62
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Interestingly, I love the crossover episodes between Better Off Ted and Firefly.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Right.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And I remember the first time they did a crossover episode.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think it was the first of 20 at this point.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And it was like, what? This is ridiculous.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But once you explain the matter transference technology that they had developed, I was like, oh yeah.

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay, totally get it.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
All right.

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Listen, we've talked about banal things that are very commonplace for us long enough.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I feel like we didn't really hit on an intro topic, though.

72
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Should we do a watch?

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We could talk about the Pushing Daisies movie that's coming out.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, we're all very excited about that.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Travis, all of our intro bits have always been so great every time that it seems like one clunker is not really going to upset the orange cart, I would say.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I would love to talk to you all about this new tentacle moistener I've been using for my tentacles.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I actually kind of like my tentacles scaly and dry, frankly, but different strokes.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My friend and I were hanging out one day and I asked her for the time.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She said, oh, it's almost seven in the afternoon.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was confused and said, oh, you mean seven in the evening?

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She said, no, it's seven in the afternoon.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:57,000
She even said that her friends also call it seven in the afternoon and prove that after 7 p.m. it's technically always afternoon.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, after 12 p.m. is what the question says.

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
After 12 p.m. it's technically always afternoon until 12 a.m.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Am I in the wrong or is she?

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's from Stuck in Time in California.

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Now, this is very interesting because for me, without the sun, it becomes very hard.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't put a lot of value in this one.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There's something wrong with our categorization of time chunks because it goes morning and that can go from fucking 12.01 a.m. to like 11.59 a.m.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's literally half the day.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Then it's noon for one minute and then I guess it's afternoon until like, what, five?

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then it's evening and then it's night.

93
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not efficient enough, I don't think.

94
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There are some periods.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
See, I would argue that 12 a.m. is not morning.

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That is not morning.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That is not the morning.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The morning is, I would argue, at five a.m.

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now, if you talk about three to five, that period, I think, could go either way.

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you're still up, it's the evening.

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But if you have a really early gig, it's the morning.

102
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So that's very confusing.

103
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think what we need to do is we need to start designating that time as a zero.

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That is a nothing time.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That is a time during which nothing should occur.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Three a.m. to five a.m. should be left blank.

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, shouldn't exist.

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That is like, if you see that, there's an episode of Twilight Zone where they somehow got out of time

109
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and they could see the people building the next minute.

110
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's what three to five a.m. is.

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Three to five a.m. is the time at which nature reverts back to nothing to build the new day.

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You shouldn't be there.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Have you ever noticed at three a.m. to five a.m. if you see like a raccoon or a deer, they give you this look like,

114
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Can we not? Yeah, this is ours.

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Can we just, right now, can we have a second, please?

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let me hit you with this.

117
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Breakfast time, lunch time, dinner time, sleep time.

118
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Those are the new categorizations.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I just wish that science would have broken time down by now into like smaller chunks,

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:22,000
like 24 chunks that you could much clearer say the time rather than just having to say afternoon or even.

121
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Like if only we had some sort of system that everybody pretty much universally understood that we could use that was very specific.

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And even within maybe those chunks, you had even smaller chunks that allowed us to know what time it is.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We do have those.

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We do have those, and they did say it in the question, and so I'm confused.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, no, I know.

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Sorry, that was not an alternate joke.

127
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That was sarcasm.

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
See, I got confused because I thought it was an alternate.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And I don't know why we say alternate because it's our truth or reality.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah, no, no, no.

131
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I think we've edited the past two minutes out anyway, so I think that we're fine.

132
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've been developing a new skill set called sarcasm.

133
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's never been used before.

134
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I've just developed it.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Sounds really funny.

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That was great.

137
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How about a yahoo?

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you know how everyone here is sincere all the time and just says what they mean and is very direct?

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What do you mean by here?

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's confusing.

141
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Here, like, you know how everybody says what they mean all the time?

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What if they didn't?

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I call it lying.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Here's a yahoo from the really successful and widely respected Yahoo Answers service.

145
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was sent in by a few people.

146
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The first one to send it in, I think, was Aaron Palmer.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Thank you, Aaron.

148
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Bill who asks,

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Could the police still arrest me if I had plans to get a pizza delivered to me?

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If the police show up at my door and arrest me for a crime, I did.

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But at the same time, I was waiting for a pizza that I ordered that didn't come yet, what will happen?

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What if I tell the police that I need to wait for my pizza to be delivered and if I had plans for someone to come over?

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Would the police still be able to wait for me before arresting me?

154
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What if I really need time to do something important on the day I am getting arrested?

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Anytime you've ever seen someone run from the cops, they're usually running to pizza.

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If they have got a pizza in the oven, they don't want their perfect Pizza Hut record.

157
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You know how Pizza Hut keeps a record of everybody whether or not they come to get their pizzas.

158
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They have the streak board up where it's like,

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Justin has picked up his pizza when he said he was going to every single time for the past 20 visits.

160
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You just don't want to lose your pizza streak, so you're running to go get the pizza.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Not necessarily away from the cops.

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sir, you are under arrest.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, I'm sorry. My boy Dylan's coming over.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just ordered a pizza. We were going to play Mortal Kombat.

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sounds like a chill hang, sir.

166
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sorry, we didn't realize. We'll just come back tomorrow.

167
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You have the right to have a chill hang and play with Sub-Zero and Scorpion and all their friends.

168
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Everyone knows if you are standing on a pizza, you have personal pain and diplomatic immunity.

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And that's just straight up.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
First of all, you have to ruin a pizza to do it, or at least two footprint-shaped parts of the pizza are going to be no good after that.

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You could eat around the footfalls.

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But yeah, if you're standing on a pizza, you're untouchable.

173
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Can't do it. Can't do it. That's in the Constitution.

174
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's why the New York police were never able to arrest the Ninja Turtles.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You know what I mean? They always tried to.

176
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They're like, oh, we have to get these vigilantes.

177
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, damn it.

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey, they did do a lot of vigilante justice and probably ran afoul of some statutes.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They murdered a lot.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Could they arrest the Turtles even without their personal pain and diplomatic immunity?

181
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
First of all, they'd need big wrist cuffs.

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Big, big handcuffs, as some people call them.

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They would need big, big wrist cuffs to get around their big, meaty wrists and hands and palms and stuff.

184
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
They would also have to be very fast, Griffin, because you go for the wrist and they're inside the shell.

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You know what I mean?

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Like, get those arms back out here.

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
In a recent live show, we talked about my realization that you cannot arrest a dog for a crime,

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
and therefore furries are just running Grif's 24-Sev, right?

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I think the Turtles are on a very similar vein, because it's like, you have the right to—

190
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Wait, that's a Turtle.

191
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Jerry, we can't arrest a fucking Turtle.

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are we talking about here?

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What will we put on the paperwork?

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Gorillas are so smart, and the thing you've got to be careful about when we're teaching them sign language,

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
which I love, and is adorable.

196
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I loved watching that gorilla sign about how sad it was that its cat died.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, yeah.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If you guys saw it.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's so good.

200
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a classic.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How tripped out would you be if one time, like, you were signing with the gorilla and just going over the basics of human society,

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and the girl was like, so, can I get arrested for stuff?

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And the person signed, no, I guess not, you're a gorilla.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And the gorilla's like, I'll be right back.

205
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Peace.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because you can't arrest a gorilla.

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's ridiculous.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But Big Turtle gets arrested for nunchuck crimes.

209
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe they go to zoo.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Okay.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, that is more, yeah.

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I think zoo is animal jail.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Maybe.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm just still working on this.

216
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Can police still arrest me if I had plans to get a pizza delivered to me?

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Hands up.

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Here's my badge.

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm showing you my badge.

220
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She'll let you know.

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And it's like, okay, here's my Domino's pizza tracker.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Fucking chill for a minute.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Can you chill for a minute?

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Well, that's the trick, Griffin.

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can do this.

226
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But to pull this off, you have to time it so that you call for the pizza, then commit the crime.

227
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Like, you can't commit the crime first.

228
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Double jeopardy.

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yeah, because then clearly, like, no, we get to arrest you first.

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
But if the pizza was already in the works and then you committed the crime,

231
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
you can't be arrested until the pizza consumption is complete.

232
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
See?

233
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And that's how you get them.

234
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Because they're like, all right, your pizza's here.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Fucking yummy down.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And let's go to the pokey.

237
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And you're like, okay.

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Ah.

239
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Little bite.

240
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hot, hot, hot, hot.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ooh, it's so hot.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Ooh, got to blow on the cheese.

243
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Got to blow on the cheese.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And then all of a sudden, you're at your fucking, you know, your daughter's wedding,

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
and you're still holding the slice with a detective right behind you,

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and you're still blowing on that cheese and that old stinky pizza.

247
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then the detective's like, oh, you're done.

248
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And you're like, oh, no, still got the crust.

249
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The Domino's Pizza Tractor used to say who was making your pizza.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And for a period of about three years, back when the service first debuted,

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
every time we got Domino's, and I was younger then,

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
so it was a lot of times, every time we got Domino's, it was made by Daniel.

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Pizza Daniel.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Pizza Daniel.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Thank you.

257
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, Pizza Daniel.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And we got pretty obsessed with the idea that this guy, Daniel,

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is working there all the time and making all the pizzas pretty much.

260
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And then recently, like fairly recently, I got a Domino's pizza order,

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and knock, knock, knock, opened the door.

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Who was it delivering the pizza, but a man named Daniel.

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
How did you get that data?

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hi, here's your pizza.

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Cool.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What's your name, partner?

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He had a name tag on.

268
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Okay.

269
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yeah, he had a name tag on.

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And I was so sort of like, I couldn't tell if it had been a promotion or a demotion.

271
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It doesn't seem like a good resource to take him out the oven, right?

272
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yeah.

273
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But maybe riding the oven is like being a desk jockey for cops,

274
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
like not really in the field unless you're getting out there slinging crust.

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Daniel, you know what I mean?

276
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Daniel, you're so good at delivering pizza.

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You got it here so fast.

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why haven't you been doing this the whole time?

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I shot a kid.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Okay.

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
First of all, you shouldn't be allowed to be in public.

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You should be in zoo, I think, because you did a really bad job.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I don't think that pizza delivery people, this isn't fucking snow crash.

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You shouldn't have a fucking samurai sword.

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What are you talking about, pizza Daniel?

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm a junior in college, and recently while in a math class,

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I was talking with some fellow students about some political news.

288
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Mistake.

289
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Mistake.

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is when things get real wild.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The girl sitting a few desks over turned to us and said,

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
no spoilers, I haven't watched the news yet.

293
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, man.

294
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
After recovering from uncontrollable laughter,

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I tried to explain to her that there aren't spoilers in real world events.

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
All evidence to the contrary, I will say.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
A lot of spoilers out there.

298
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But she said she would just put in headphones until class started

299
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
so we could continue talking,

300
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and she could still be surprised by the news later that day.

301
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Am I good?

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Is she good?

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Have I been having the wrong attitude towards news all my life,

304
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
or should I try to explain to this person that discussing actual political events

305
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
doesn't qualify as a spoiler?

306
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Please help.

307
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's from politically perplexed in the Pacific Northwest.

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I am, I do not know what's wilder,

309
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that this person thinks that people can spoil the news for her before she watches it,

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
or that she willingly sits down and says,

311
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm going to ingest some news now.

312
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The news has got to fucking find me.

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The news has got to track me.

314
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Whoops, news.

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oops, news.

316
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You got me again, news.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oops all news.

318
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This person's a sentient Portlandia sketch, I think.

319
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
There's no such thing as news spoilers.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If somebody is talking about current events near you,

321
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and you hear it and receive it, it's just more news.

322
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's news.

323
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's what news is.

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I would like to acknowledge and then move away from the possibility

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
that this person just didn't want to hear you talk about politics,

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and this was like they're out of like,

327
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
oh, oh, oh, oh, well.

328
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah, we need to always-

329
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I guess I'll put on, skip over that.

330
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
We always need to be cognizant of the fact

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that somebody might just be very funny.

332
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let me tell you why you are both wrong.

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh.

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And I'm going to connect it very simply.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You wouldn't find this weird if this was a big sports game.

336
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, but I'm not affected in any way.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's a real life event, Griffin.

338
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If there's a real life event that people don't want spoiled for them,

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
that's only two steps away from a new bill getting signed.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah, but I'm not affected by the Buffalo Bills scored a cool touchdown

341
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
as much as I am by the fact that fucking Steve Bannon unzipped his skin suit

342
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and revealed he was a fucking toilet literally the whole time,

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
a toilet with arms and legs.

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That actually did happen, Griffin,

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and we didn't really delve into that in the introduction.

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That was strange.

348
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you arrest a toilet?

349
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think this person is just very funny.

350
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I think this was a very funny joke, right?

351
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This seems like a very fun.

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This seems like a person you should probably try to hang with either way.

353
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Especially if you are being literal about your uncontrollable laughter.

354
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If you laughed uncontrollably in this person's face

355
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
and they still continue to be like,

356
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
well, better put my headphones in so I don't find out

357
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
about what happened this morning on CNN,

358
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
like that's a very funny person, I think.

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How about another Yahoo?

361
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Hit me.

362
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This one was sent in by Nick Potter.

363
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank Nick.

364
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's Yahoo Answers.

365
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Thank Nick.

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah.

367
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user Oscar Smith,

368
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
and Oscar Smith says,

369
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
My neighbor is cooking some pancakes next door.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The aroma is overwhelmingly wonderful.

371
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Would it be rude to knock on her door and ask her for one?

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay, first I want to acknowledge something,

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and that is the sheer bravery of using what is potentially your real name.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Either that or you're so clever that you have used a nom de plume

375
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
that sounds like a real name.

376
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
A nom de pancake.

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
These are amazing.

378
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There was actually recently, I saw a commercial on the Hulu

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
that was like the Pancake Sunday is how apartment 4B makes friends,

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and it's just like someone putting flyers up in their apartment building

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
like stop on by our apartment for pancakes on Sunday.

382
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No chance.

383
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No, that's a trap.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No way.

385
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, that's a trap.

386
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's literally the most perfect bait for me.

387
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Like literally, if I smell pancakes and I walked along that stink line

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
through the air, you know at the end of it,

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
there's going to be a fucking cage held up with a stick,

390
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and I'm going to knock down the stick, and all of a sudden I'm in zoo,

391
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and I don't want that.

392
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There's a moment in this commercial in which an adorable little girl

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
carries a plate of pancakes, sits them on a welcome mat of an apartment

394
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
of a man who has not attended Pancake Sunday yet,

395
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and that is what pushes him over the edge to go attend.

396
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If I opened my door to find an uncovered, unwrapped,

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
completely unsealed plate of pancakes, I'd call the cops.

398
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'd call the police.

399
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yeah.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm the victim of something,

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
and I need you to get down here and help me figure out what.

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This is an unspecified threat.

403
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We've talked about neighbor anxiety for a while.

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I kind of know my neighbors,

405
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
but the chasm between where I'm at

406
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
vis-a-vis my relationship with my neighbors,

407
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
where it's basically a rear window situation,

408
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
where like one of my neighbors had like three U-Haul trucks parked outside,

409
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
and then the next day the U-Haul trucks were gone, but they didn't move.

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And I'm like, what happened?

411
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I have to know fucking everything.

412
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The chasm between where I'm at now, rear window style,

413
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
to knock, knock, knock, let me get one of those good flapjacks I'm sniffing,

414
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
is so wide that I cannot believe that me and this person are like

415
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
members of the same society, that we are the same like species.

416
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It is wild to me.

417
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I would actually be very relieved if this happened.

418
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I would never take the initiative to go ask for flapjacks.

419
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But if someone did open up the door and say,

420
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
well, let's hope they didn't open up my door.

421
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's say they knocked.

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You want the flapjacks?

423
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Whoa!

424
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Flapjacks!

425
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, God.

426
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's me, Flapjack Nicholsack.

427
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm going door to door.

428
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Ask the people for flapjacks.

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
So if Flapjack Nicholsack knocked on my door and was like,

430
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
hey, you got pancakes?

431
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because I would love to get into one of those bad boys.

432
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't think I've ever made exactly the right number of pancakes.

433
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That's bad.

434
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You always have a couple of crusty boys that sit out on the plate,

435
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and then maybe around two in the afternoon, you're like,

436
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
well, you're still here, huh?

437
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Let's see what you got.

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And then you're like, ah, this was a mistake, and I'll throw these away.

439
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Oh, everybody loves room-temperature cold pancakes.

440
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Mm-mm.

441
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But Mom used to make the kind that had apples and cinnamon in them,

442
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and those were extremely edible.

443
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And they got a good and powerful stink to them,

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
and you're going to smell those and need them.

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I need these.

446
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The problem that I would have if someone did this would be this.

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I would say, okay, yeah, no problem.

448
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll go get some pancakes for you.

449
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And then I would think like, okay, so do I put them in a Ziploc bag,

450
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
or do I wrap them in a paper towel, or should I syrup them?

451
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Just toss them loose in a grocery bag?

452
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Should I syrup them on a paper plate, and then do I have to give them paper?

453
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
If I give them glass and plate and silverware,

454
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
are they going to stay on my porch and eat them?

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I would be paralyzed.

456
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
They would have to come in, and I would just say,

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I'm going to lock myself in the closet.

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Take whatever you need.

459
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Take whatever, my fucking plasma screen, my laptop.

460
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Just do whatever you need.

461
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I think what everyone should start doing is,

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
much like if you're going to throw a big, loud party,

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
and you go around your neighbors, and you're like,

464
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
hey, I'm going to have a big, loud party, feel free to stop by.

465
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
If we get too loud, please give me a call before you call.

466
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I think you should do that with everything.

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like, hey, I'm going to make some pancakes.

468
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Feel free to stop by.

469
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
If it smells too loud, please don't call the police.

470
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And like, hey, I'm going to be playing some Overwatch.

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You'll hear me yelling because I got fucking frozen again.

472
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
And please don't call the police about my freezing.

473
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
But if you want to come over, and you want to do some LAN, that's fine.

474
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
What if there's an alternate reality to our own,

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
where somebody knocks on their door and is like,

476
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
can you please turn down the smell of those pancakes?

477
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
My family and I are just trying to watch our veggie tales,

478
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and we're having a really hard time doing so,

479
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
because the stink is just so powerful.

480
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
My cheat day is tomorrow, and you're killing me.

481
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I have a true life neighbor anxiety tale,

482
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
a horrifying true story, if you guys want to hear it.

483
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah.

484
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We've never talked about our anxieties before on this show,

485
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
so this will be an exciting segment maybe.

486
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
My neighbor who lives across the street is a very pleasant older woman

487
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
who seems to always be on her porch smoking.

488
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
She comes over and knocks on the door at 8 p.m. a few nights ago,

489
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
and says that her phone has stopped working

490
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
because she shares it with her family,

491
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and she needs to make a call to Nate to ask him to recharge her boost mobile phone.

492
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
This is exactly how she puts it to me, by the way.

493
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And here is where it gets terrifying.

494
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I say, sure, fine, that's no problem,

495
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
but my daughter has just gone to sleep,

496
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and the front door is about four feet from her bedroom.

497
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So if I hand this woman my phone and close the door,

498
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
then she will have to take some baby waking action

499
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
to alert me that her audio transaction with Nate

500
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and the refilling of the boost has taken place.

501
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
So without even thinking, I hand her my phone and then realize

502
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I am trapped on the front porch standing here

503
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,000
while this woman talks to Nate and tries to explain the boost mobile situation.

504
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And she is repeatedly telling Nate that it's telling her

505
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
she needs to find a place to charge her boost mobile phone

506
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,000
and download this app that tells her where the boost mobile hotspots are

507
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
to recharge the phone.

508
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And this is all far, far beyond this blessed woman's capabilities,

509
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
technologically speaking.

510
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
This is all Greek to her,

511
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and I'm just standing here for the whole conversation

512
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
while she talks to Nate.

513
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And I was sitting there trying to think like,

514
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
what do people do?

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
What do people do when they just stand in a place

516
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
and listen to a conversation?

517
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
What have I ever done? I've never done this before.

518
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I should get on my, oh God, she has my phone.

519
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I can't even look at my phone.

520
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I started like looking at the plants.

521
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah, I was about to say you started gardening.

522
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I did. I started like, these have some holes.

523
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm a gardener now.

524
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm so uncomfortable that I became a gardener.

525
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I take care of these plants.

526
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
This got so bad, guys, that I actually like opened the door

527
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and grabbed the first thing that I could reach

528
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
because I didn't want to risk her ending the conversation

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
and yelling because she doesn't give a shit.

530
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
She'll wake a baby up.

531
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
And I grabbed the first thing I could,

532
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
which was one of Sydney's medical journals.

533
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh my God, Justin.

534
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I just stood there on the porch perusing like cool new rations

535
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
that people have just found out about

536
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
while this woman tries to explain the situation to Nate.

537
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And eventually she thanked me profusely

538
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
and went back to her home.

539
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But it was probably the most terrifying

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
two and a half minutes of my life.

541
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
This Nate sounds like a real techno wizard.

542
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I would love to get him over here to look at my printer.

543
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's been acting up lately.

544
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Your new printer?

545
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Yeah, I can't download any pictures of my nieces and nephews anymore

546
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
because I ran out of space.

547
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
That's so weird because all printers always work

548
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
and are great.

549
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
So it's so strange to hear about somebody having problems

550
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
with a printer.

551
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And their print juice is so cheap.

552
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
So cheap to get the print juice.

553
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
McDonald's doesn't exist.

554
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Hey, should we go to the money zone?

555
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I mean in our world money doesn't...

556
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
We're going to need some more clamshells and shiny stones

557
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
to pay for things.

558
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Yeah, clamshells and shiny stones.

559
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Let's go to the bartering post.

560
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I would like you boys to imagine

561
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
a box.

562
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And this box glows.

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
And you can put different pictures

564
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
in this box.

565
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then other people can go to these pictures

566
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
and using some kind of controller

567
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
they can access these pictures

568
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
and actually do things with them.

569
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I've just now invented this

570
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
and I'm calling it a website.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Okay.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Now imagine you want to make your own website.

573
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Right?

574
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I mean I just learned that this thing existed.

575
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Can you give me time to process this concept

576
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
before I jump into it?

577
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
No.

578
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What I'm thinking is they're all connected to each other

579
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
like a big web.

580
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
But there are no spiders

581
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
in this scenario.

582
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Where's the fucking web come from, genius?

583
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You are the spider.

584
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Oh, I hate it.

585
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So I'm Spider-Man?

586
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You're Spider-Man.

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

588
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Somebody write that down.

589
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Spider-Man.

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
We'll circle back to that.

591
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
But so all of these websites are connected.

592
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And I know what you're thinking.

593
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's got to be hard to make my own.

594
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No, no, no.

595
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm going to partner.

596
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I'm going to take pictures

597
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
and they tell you to poke them a bunch.

598
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I think, and it's called Squarespace

599
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
because that's the shape of the store.

600
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
It's just a Squarespace.

601
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'm going to talk with them

602
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
about taking their pictures

603
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
and putting them in these websites.

604
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
And I think they'll be able to provide

605
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
award-winning 24-7 customer support.

606
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There's never going to be anything

607
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
to install, patch, or upgrade.

608
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And I don't know what that means.

609
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
But they already have award-winning templates

610
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
and they have that one platform that you stand on

611
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that's an all-in-one platform.

612
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
And I think it's going to offer

613
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
a unique domain experience.

614
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That's what we're going to call the name

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
you call your website.

616
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It's fully transparent, easy to set up.

617
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And so I'm going to talk with them

618
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
about making a deal that's a free trial

619
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and 10% off your first purchase

620
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
by visiting squarespace.com.

621
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And.com is going to be...

622
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah, what's.com?

623
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
So I'm calling the box a com box.

624
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I'm calling the box a com box.

625
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh, okay.

626
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because you communicate to each other with it.

627
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
So squarespace.com

628
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
slash my brother.

629
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So once we get that up and running,

630
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
free trial, 10% off your first purchase,

631
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
squarespace.com slash my brother.

632
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This electric web

633
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
sounds like a really efficient way

634
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
to send and receive pornography.

635
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Exactly. You won't have to go

636
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
and buy it at the corner store anymore.

637
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
At your old mom and pop pornography store.

638
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Where they

639
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
send them in data globes.

640
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Now, you guys

641
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
know I love

642
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
eating rocks.

643
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Yeah.

644
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Any type of rock, sandstone,

645
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
slurry,

646
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
limestone, pie, all kinds

647
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
of rocks. Well, you're only sloomin'.

648
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah, well,

649
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
imagine a world where agriculture

650
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
was possible.

651
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
If the sun shone, this is silly,

652
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
we're getting into some

653
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Twilight Zone territory, but

654
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
imagine a world in which the sun shone

655
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
most of the day.

656
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And agriculture was possible.

657
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, we don't burn off the face of the earth.

658
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah, I don't understand if the sun

659
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
doesn't make any sense.

660
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
This would be so exciting,

661
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
how exciting would it be to just eat

662
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
as many beans as I wanted to?

663
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Just all day beans.

664
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Instead of just one bean every 100 years.

665
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, in this reality,

666
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
our skin wouldn't be translucent.

667
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And our eyes would not be

668
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
18 inches in diameter.

669
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
How would we examine our own organs to make sure

670
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
we're healthy?

671
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Listen, it's just a fantasy, Travis. You don't have to pick everything apart.

672
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay?

673
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
So, in this world,

674
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
imagine you could just send the

675
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
vegetables and I guess there would be

676
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
creatures that would eat the vegetables

677
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
that we could kill for fuel.

678
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And to feel alive.

679
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And to feel alive and horny.

680
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And we could put all those parts

681
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
and let's call them

682
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
vegetables and stuff

683
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
into a box and send it to people.

684
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And that's what this imaginary service

685
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that I just invented called Blue Apron.

686
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it would cost less than $10,

687
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
which is roughly 30 clamshells

688
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
per person, per meal.

689
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
And Blue Apron would deliver seasonal recipes.

690
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I have no

691
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
reference for that.

692
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Along with pre-proportioned ingredients

693
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
to make delicious, home-cooked meals.

694
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Justin, can I ask you a quick question?

695
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah.

696
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What is blue?

697
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Yeah.

698
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
There's a lot.

699
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
There's actually too much lore,

700
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
so let me just kind of get through

701
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
the main thing.

702
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And there's like a codex you can go and check out

703
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
on a Combox if you want to.

704
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm just going to imagine some foods

705
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
right now.

706
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm spitballing here.

707
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm spitting on here.

708
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Um...

709
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Garvalax

710
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
with

711
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
flown flame.

712
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
No, that's nothing.

713
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Grimbulon with

714
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
uh...

715
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Pumsel juice.

716
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Is there rocks in all these, though?

717
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Because that's what confuses me now.

718
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
There's no rocks, because we wouldn't need rocks.

719
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Basil pesto chicken. That sounds good.

720
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
That sounds like a real thing.

721
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Vegetable panzanella.

722
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Salted shrimp.

723
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Salted shrimp and green beans

724
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
with globe tomatoes, spinach,

725
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
and orzo pasta.

726
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Again, there is

727
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
going to be sort of a novella

728
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
prelude to this

729
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
story that will explain a lot of the concepts.

730
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But you can see,

731
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
if you want to see...

732
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I've set up an ARG for this

733
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
thing if you want to check out this fantasy story.

734
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
An actual reality game, of course.

735
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
An actual reality game.

736
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Three meals for free with free shipping

737
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
by going to blueapron.com

738
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
slash my brother.

739
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And you will love how good to read

740
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
about it feels and tastes

741
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
to create incredible home-cooked meals

742
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
with Blue Apron. So don't wait.

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
That's blueapron.com

744
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
slash my brother.

745
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Rocks not included.

746
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Box not included.

747
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Blue Apron is a better way to cook.

748
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Um, I just went

749
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
to the corner shop and I got myself

750
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
a Combox and I plugged it into

751
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
my Vision Cube

752
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
so I can receive and send messages

753
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
and I did grab just a few

754
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
pornographies from the store also.

755
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But you have to. At those prices?

756
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
And so here's some

757
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
messages that have come through. Here's one

758
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
for Joe and it's from Emily who says

759
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Grab a glass of your finest

760
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
whiskey. Cheers to our 17 year

761
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
friendship and the podcast

762
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
that has kept us in touch for the last six.

763
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Podcast. Podcast.

764
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This may not be for us. Remember in 2010

765
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
when the McElroys advised you

766
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
to give your girlfriend half

767
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
a dog? Glad it ended with a

768
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
marriage to your beautiful wife, Jenny.

769
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Here is to making more

770
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
memories. Bim bam or otherwise.

771
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
That's terrible advice.

772
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Yeah, I don't know.

773
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't remember saying that.

774
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Which is the weird thing, but I guess 2010 was

775
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
a long time ago. We've all been through a lot

776
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
since then.

777
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And we haven't existed for 17 years.

778
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What are they talking about?

779
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Now that's a weird thing to say.

780
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Can you back that up?

781
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
No. Here's another message that I

782
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
just got in the Vision Cube. Oh, God.

783
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Fuck. It's so hot. It burned

784
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
all my tentacles real bad on it. But that's

785
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
what happens when the messages come through. Here's one

786
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
for Bess. My totally kick

787
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
a little sister.

788
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Although I read it at first as my totally

789
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
kick a little sister. I don't

790
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
want. No. It's from

791
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Tori, the bestiest

792
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
big sister ever, who says

793
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I wanted to get our favorite

794
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
brothers to send you a non-celebration

795
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
related greeting. Also, to publicly

796
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
point out that yes,

797
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
I could have blocked, but

798
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
when I have no lightsaber training

799
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
and you went to

800
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
college, maybe you

801
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
should not start with a slash to my face.

802
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Wait, what happened?

803
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I could have blocked, but when

804
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I have no lightsaber training and you

805
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
went to in college,

806
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
maybe you should not start with a slash to my face.

807
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And yes, most

808
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
still beautiful even with my roguish

809
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
cauterized wound.

810
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Okay, so it sounds like they were

811
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
just having a fun lightsaber fight as

812
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
we all do from time to time.

813
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Maybe things got a little

814
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
bit too real. They weren't using the training

815
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
sabers. And

816
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
this can happen. This is such a common

817
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
thing. I wish people would exercise a little bit

818
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
more caution when they're sparring.

819
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Mugs, shirts,

820
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
stickers, patches, tanks, and

821
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
more are yours for the purchasing at

822
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
you already love the podcasts, so why not

take this to the next level and

825
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
outfit your home and bod with our

826
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
merch? MaxFunStore.com.

827
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Because if you have to wear a shirt,

828
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
it should be one of ours.

829
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Recently, I have been

830
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
smoking pot with my dad. Totally normal.

831
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We shared some kick-ass

832
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
times together, but I became too

833
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
greedy. I would sneak out

834
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
to enjoy a joint every couple days, but he

835
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
started to notice. Now he

836
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
smokes alone. Oh, man.

837
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And the cat's in the cradle in the

838
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
silver spoon. That's a beautiful

839
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
song, Travis. I know, I just made it up.

840
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, you should make up the rest of it.

841
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Little boy blue with the man

842
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and the moon. Now, I don't know what a moon

843
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
is. Yeah.

844
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Or blue animal. When you coming

845
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
home, Dad, I'm Spider-Man.

846
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm just trying to work him in.

847
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Yeah, yeah, it's good.

848
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Kind of a transmedia character. I love to

849
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
eat non-rock food.

850
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
This is getting very

851
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
dark side of the moon. There's a lot of fantasy

852
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
elements. Now, what's the

853
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
moon and why does it have a bright side and a dark

854
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
side? I don't understand.

855
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
How does Dylan

856
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
make it up to their dad?

857
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Well, weed is

858
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
everywhere. Yeah.

859
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You can go get weed at the corner store.

860
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Now, I'm just sad.

861
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
This is...

862
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't understand why this would hurt your

863
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
daddy's feelings. You just had a couple

864
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
little sneaky

865
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
doobers.

866
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
As a bonding activity,

867
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
that's the only way I could read it.

868
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's like, aw, doobers are our

869
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
thing. You can't do doobers by

870
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
yourself. Maybe, Dane,

871
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
maybe

872
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Pops has been buying all the

873
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
doobers. Oh, no.

874
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This is like, we'll

875
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
doober together, but I don't want you

876
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
doobering by yourself. I will doober together

877
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
because I'm a responsible

878
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
dad. Then, you got

879
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
greedy and you snuck some doobers. I was like,

880
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
now you're grounded from doobers.

881
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah. If you blaze it

882
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
once with your dad, I think

883
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
that would put a lot of this behind you.

884
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
When I doob up, the last

885
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
thing I want to do is hold any

886
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
grudges. I just want to bliss out

887
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
and listen to

888
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Greg Matthew's band.

889
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
You just need some social

890
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
doobercant that's going to smooth

891
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
everything right over.

892
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I mean, you could

893
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
there's so many ways to make things

894
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
up to a dad, isn't there?

895
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Making a

896
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
sweet post on Facebook with a picture

897
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
of the two of you. What now?

898
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Posting a sweet picture

899
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
on the front of your house

900
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
of the two of you. Just like, I love

901
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
this dad. Then, people

902
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
will come by and see it. I think he'd really appreciate

903
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that. Maybe

904
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
get him a nice Squall Lark card

905
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
that says, number one dad,

906
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
best to doob with, 24-7,

907
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
420, blaze it. Nice.

908
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
What if he's one of those

909
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
grudge dads, though, where you buy a big

910
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
bag of pot for you to share. You're halfway

911
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
through. You're just ripping through it.

912
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
It just takes a huge

913
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
rip. He's like,

914
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
this changes nothing.

915
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
It's like, well, great.

916
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Now, this is just perfect.

917
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I haven't fixed anything, and all my good

918
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
pot is gone.

919
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Hmm. Maybe

920
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
one free back rub.

921
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Back rub coupons. Very

922
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
smart. I wish I had

923
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
more here.

924
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I don't know what to say.

925
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Maybe just apologize?

926
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Apologizing's good.

927
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's good.

928
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I don't know why we didn't think about that

929
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
first, because everybody always

930
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
says so directly how they're feeling.

931
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You know what I mean?

932
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Hey, dad. I'm sorry I snuck doobers

933
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
when doobers are supposed to be our thing.

934
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You know, I'm

935
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
impulsive, and I'm

936
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
so sorry. Let's doober together.

937
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
What if you got a new thing

938
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
with your dad, and you started doing

939
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
huge lines of coke? No,

940
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
stop. It's no longer the thing

941
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
you do with your dad. The thing you do with your dad

942
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
is coke. Or, like, most dangerous

943
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
game. Okay,

944
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
you hunt people for sport?

945
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
That's your thing with your dad? Yeah, with your dad.

946
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know, just dad stuff.

947
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Just dad

948
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
stuff! You know, you laugh,

949
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
but we already do that

950
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
with Fish.

951
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
So, you know.

952
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
To be fair, in many ways,

953
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Fish are the least dangerous game.

954
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Not piranhas. Hey,

955
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
you can take a couple tickets,

956
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
get a couple hot dogs

957
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
and take them to a game

958
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
of our national...

959
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
rock dogs, and then you take them to

960
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
our national pastime

961
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yu-Gi-Oh! tournament.

962
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Um...

963
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Hey, I've got a

964
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yahoo here. It's sent in by Seth

965
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Carlson, the delivery man. Thank you,

966
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Seth. It's a Yahoo Answers

967
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
user, Robby

968
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Raffel, who says,

969
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
on IMDB,

970
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
why was Kevin James' height changed

971
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
from five foot eight to five foot

972
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
nine and a half?

973
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
He got taller.

974
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
He got taller.

975
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
He had a growth spurt.

976
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I don't know what to tell you.

977
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I mean, I'm confused by this because

978
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
obviously Kevin James is six foot eleven.

979
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

980
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
The premier rock ball player.

981
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Let's just pretend, though,

982
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
just for a laugh, that

983
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
this is all legit.

984
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
It's kind of alternate.

985
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Give me percentage odds

986
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
that this was

987
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Kevin, who stepped in and said,

988
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
I can fix this.

989
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Let me fix this. I gotta boost this.

990
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
People are fucking telling tales

991
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
out of school about my size,

992
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
and I'm the only one who can do something about this.

993
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm five foot nine and one half

994
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
of one inch.

995
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
We all know

996
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
that Kevin James is the most

997
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
powerful man on our dark

998
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
planet. Yeah.

999
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I'm pretty sure that if he wanted to,

1000
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
he could just change how much

1001
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
an inch is.

1002
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
You know what I mean?

1003
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Now it's 1.1 inches.

1004
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know? Or like

1005
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
.8 inches. Whatever the math works out to.

1006
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know. I didn't go to math school.

1007
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Then suddenly

1008
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
he is taller.

1009
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Just because of how an inch works.

1010
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
This is nice.

1011
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I think this would be neat if

1012
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Kevin would do this for all of us.

1013
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Because then we'd all be just a little

1014
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
bit taller. That's true.

1015
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You know, if I

1016
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
convince a bunch of rich people who had

1017
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
presumably seen Paul Blart Mall Cop 1

1018
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
to make Paul Blart Mall Cop 2,

1019
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I would probably stand a little taller myself.

1020
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
And 3 and 4 and 5

1021
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
and 6. And 6.

1022
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And Hitch 1 through 15.

1023
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And Paul Blart Mall Cop

1024
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Nights. And Paul Blart Mall Cop Origins.

1025
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And the animated series.

1026
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And the Blart the Furious.

1027
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And the Blart Files with his daughter.

1028
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
All of them. And here comes the boom.

1029
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
And there went the boom.

1030
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
The sequel that I loved so much.

1031
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Has anyone seen the boom?

1032
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
I got the boom. Was the new one.

1033
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Which way did the boom go?

1034
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
The new boom kid. Which was about

1035
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
his daughter from Paul Blart Mall Cop 2

1036
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
getting into MMA. Which is weird.

1037
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
The death of the boom which was

1038
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
many thought the end of the series.

1039
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
But then the boom comes again.

1040
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Which in many ways I thought

1041
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
was even better than the original.

1042
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And boom for 2 where he cloned himself.

1043
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I thought that one was a new high point.

1044
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Guy Ritchie really outdid himself.

1045
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Here's another question.

1046
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I'm in high school and a lot of kids at my school

1047
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
don't lock their lockers when they leave to go to class.

1048
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
There hasn't been an issue

1049
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
before but recently someone's been going through people's lockers

1050
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
and stealing an item or two.

1051
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This happened to me and I decided to go to the school office

1052
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
to check the lost and found.

1053
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I asked if they had seen an iPod to which as if on cue

1054
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
my school principal came around the corner

1055
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
very dramatically and handed it to me and said

1056
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
next time lock your locker.

1057
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What?

1058
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Excuse me? What?

1059
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
From the clues I could gather I think the principal

1060
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
was trying to teach the kids a lesson?

1061
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
How do I tell him that he's making an issue

1062
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
that isn't there? Is it okay for him to do so?

1063
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Nora from Victoria.

1064
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
That's wild.

1065
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
That's a criminal

1066
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
crime maybe?

1067
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Do principals have immunity?

1068
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Can they just steal and steal

1069
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
and steal and it's like it's cool

1070
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm the president of school?

1071
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I don't think that's

1072
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
how it works at all.

1073
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
That's definitely bonkers.

1074
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Call me old but it's also

1075
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
weird to me that you're keeping

1076
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
things. If I just had books

1077
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
in my locker I don't think I'd worry about it.

1078
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
If you're keeping electronics and

1079
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
personal stuff in your locker

1080
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
why aren't you locking it?

1081
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You know what? I went to high school

1082
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
in the early 2000s

1083
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I locked my locker then

1084
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
and are you under the

1085
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
impression that things have gotten better everybody?

1086
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Are we under the impression

1087
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
that it's way better to leave

1088
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
your locker unlocked now?

1089
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Let's stop shitting because

1090
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
obviously this is some sort of

1091
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
utopian society

1092
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
where theft doesn't exist

1093
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and so this principal

1094
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
is trying to introduce the concept

1095
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
of theft to this

1096
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
society. It's wild to me.

1097
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's so

1098
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
the next time. And he just steals

1099
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
and he opens it and he steals.

1100
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
He's like a reverse Robin Hood.

1101
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Do you think he dresses like a teen?

1102
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
This would be my big question

1103
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
is if he's gonna go in for this

1104
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
is he gonna like put on

1105
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Justin remind yourself later

1106
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
go find out what teens wear

1107
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and then edit it into your file before you send it to

1108
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Griffin. And

1109
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
he's wearing

1110
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and then

1111
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
he's trying to hide his identity

1112
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
so the kids are like I don't know I saw

1113
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
a really normal looking teenager

1114
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
open the locker and run away with

1115
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
your iPod and he definitely wasn't the principal.

1116
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
All I know is like

1117
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
how is there not one

1118
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
bully who's just like

1119
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
alright cool and just like

1120
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
walks the halls just like

1121
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
how

1122
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
statistically is there not

1123
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
just one kid who's like cool

1124
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
you got it. There is and they call

1125
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
him Mr. Jeremiah the principal

1126
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
of the school

1127
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
because all bullies have to grow up

1128
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
and go somewhere. He did not

1129
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
he did not track this question

1130
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
ask her down. He did not track Nora down

1131
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
and say hey got your iPod.

1132
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
He is just hoarding

1133
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
this stuff until they notice it's gone.

1134
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
There is no way he is going

1135
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
to return all these items to their proper owners.

1136
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Not going to happen. And

1137
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
although it would be a pretty

1138
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
amazing end of your assembly

1139
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
where if he was like alright

1140
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Victoria pull back the curtain

1141
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
and she opens the curtain and is like look

1142
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
this is my it's the greatest crime

1143
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
of the century.

1144
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You open a closet in Mr. Jeremiah's

1145
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
office and just a wave of

1146
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
fidget spinners comes pouring out.

1147
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Why do you leave your

1148
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
iPod in your. Just sitting on a throne of

1149
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Pokemon cards.

1150
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Why do you leave your iPod in your locker I want to

1151
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
know it's to listen to the good

1152
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
portable entertainment device.

1153
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Do you not have backpacks?

1154
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
How is your iPod the thing that's weighing you down

1155
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
like oh I just can't stand to have

1156
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
this six ounces in here.

1157
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I can't remember high school. You guys

1158
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I honestly just had

1159
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
the thought did I have a backpack in high school

1160
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
and did I carry it to classrooms or did I

1161
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
put it in my locker? Where did my lunch go?

1162
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'll never I don't remember

1163
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
in high school. I do remember middle school because

1164
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
I had a the Wiz. Guys remember the

1165
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Wiz? Yeah I had a leather

1166
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
passenger bag because I had

1167
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
so many friends.

1168
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
The weirdest thing about

1169
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
the fact that I had the Wiz

1170
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
is that I don't anymore.

1171
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So that means there was

1172
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
a period at which I was like

1173
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
this backpack is a locker

1174
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
and I don't need it.

1175
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
I cannot imagine that happening in my day to day life.

1176
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I'm sorry I must have been confused

1177
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
because you kept saying the Wiz and I

1178
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
thought you meant the musical.

1179
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
No I just googled what the Wiz was

1180
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
and that's a good backpack

1181
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
juice. It looks very spacious and

1182
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
rectangular. It was a

1183
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
rectangular backpack that had a

1184
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
built in shelf and was basically

1185
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
a portable locker that you carried

1186
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
on your back.

1187
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Oh shit. Yeah I know.

1188
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
It was the Wiz locker backpack

1189
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
and I had one of those and I don't

1190
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
anymore and that's very strange to me.

1191
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm looking at the Wiz on my

1192
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
cube right now my com box

1193
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
and this one just is

1194
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
pitch black and across

1195
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
one of the surfaces it just says

1196
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Batman on it.

1197
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Which is very cool.

1198
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Would love one

1199
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
of these. Now I'm looking at one that

1200
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
has Wiz Khalifa on it

1201
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
and that's just funny.

1202
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
That's pretty good.

1203
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
You think this is a real grab bag situation if everybody

1204
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
goes to the principal and is like

1205
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I lost my keys

1206
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
to a Hyundai Sonata

1207
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
and he's like alright here it is

1208
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and like tight I got a Hyundai Sonata

1209
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
now. That would be

1210
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
a really epic rewards program

1211
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
if it's like oh you got straight A's

1212
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
you can come into my theft closet

1213
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and choose any one thing.

1214
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
This is how they inspire

1215
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
students to sell candy

1216
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
bars.

1217
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Sell the most candy bars and you can have

1218
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
his shoes.

1219
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Alright. Well that's gonna

1220
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
do it for us folks.

1221
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Thank you so much for enjoying our program

1222
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
today. Presumably you enjoyed it.

1223
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
I hope you made it this far enjoying it.

1224
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Everyone has always

1225
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
loved our show. We've never done a bad one.

1226
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We've never done a bad show.

1227
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's a great point Travis.

1228
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I hope everyone made the most of the sun time.

1229
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I

1230
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
know I got out there and got a base tan

1231
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
for 50 years from now when it happens

1232
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
again I'm pretty excited about.

1233
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Thank you to John

1234
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Roderick and the short winners for the

1235
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
use of our theme song. It's a departure off the

1236
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
album Putting the Days to Sleep

1237
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
and

1238
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
it's a good song and I hope you enjoyed it at the beginning

1239
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
and end of our program. We also

1240
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
want to say thank you to minimumfun.org

1241
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
for

1242
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
all their

1243
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
shows are bad and you shouldn't

1244
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
listen to them. Now it's

1245
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
kind of getting a little bizarre.

1246
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's hard to parse that

1247
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
one. Ah fuck.

1248
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I just fucking realized

1249
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
because I was locked in the closet

1250
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
by those awful children that

1251
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I didn't have time to charge my

1252
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
calculator.

1253
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
And now my calculator is

1254
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I can't do any math for 50

1255
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
years. Ah fuck.

1256
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Ah beans

1257
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
whatever those are.

1258
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We're going to be doing

1259
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
some shows in the near

1260
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
future. We

1261
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
October

1262
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
20th through the 22nd we're going

1263
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
to be in Atlanta and Nashville

1264
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and there are still some seats for those

1265
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
because they're very large venues

1266
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
and we hope you'll come out and join us

1267
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
for those shows and then November

1268
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
18th and 19th we're going to be

1269
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
in Minneapolis and Milwaukee.

1270
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Minneapolis is almost sold out.

1271
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Milwaukee is not anywhere close

1272
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
so we're not very popular in Milwaukee but

1273
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
please. It's because somebody

1274
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
tweeted us it's because the Packers are playing a home game that day

1275
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
and.

1276
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
It's not my fucking fault.

1277
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Well no it's Jordan Rodgers beautiful arms fault

1278
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
but

1279
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
maybe we can just skip the show and go.

1280
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Maybe we can take a rain check

1281
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
and just go to the big football game.

1282
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Also hey everyone.

1283
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
There's a chance Aaron Rodgers

1284
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
will be at our show.

1285
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You can't say that.

1286
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Well I mean there's a chance anything will happen Griffin.

1287
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But legally I think FCC is going to get us there.

1288
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
He could be on a scavenger hunt

1289
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
that leads to our show.

1290
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
He could have accidentally skateboarded the wrong way

1291
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
instead of skateboarding to the arena.

1292
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
By the way

1293
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
when I said Packers I was of course

1294
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
referring to the Card Packers

1295
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
the Yu-Gi-Oh! team.

1296
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Thank you.

1297
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Also if you are going to be

1298
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
at our upcoming shows in September

1299
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
be sure to send in questions

1300
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
whatever any of that jargon means.

1301
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I think that's it.

1302
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Yeah.

1303
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Here's a final Yahoo!

1304
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
sent in by Seth Carlson and The Deliver Man.

1305
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Thank you for the new delivery.

1306
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yahoo! answers user CuteCuriosity

1307
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
who says this was not really funny

1308
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
as much as it is eye-opening.

1309
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And the website crashed.

1310
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
This is weird. It's the first time the website crashed.

1311
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's usually such a good fucking website.

1312
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
If Buzz Lightyear

1313
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
truly believed he was not a toy

1314
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
then why does he freeze

1315
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
when humans are around?

1316
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1317
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
My name is Justin McElroy.

1318
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

1319
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm Uncle Dane.

1320
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Keep it silly, y'all.

1321
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1322
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:59,000
You kissed your dad square on the cheek.

1323
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Do you want to learn weird new facts?

1324
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Do you like hearing successful, creative women

1325
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
talk about their poop?

1326
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Do you want the scoop on Martha Stewart's pony?

1327
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
If you answered yes to any of these questions

1328
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
our show is for you.

1329
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
We interview people like Paul F. Tompkins,

1330
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Kristen Schaal, Michael Che, and more.

1331
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So check us out on Maximum Fun.

1332
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And let us mess up your brain.

1333
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:41,000
We know everything.
