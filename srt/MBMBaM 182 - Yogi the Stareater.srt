1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, the advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,040
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,120
And I'm the baby new year ghost. Welcome, baby new year.

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm the ghost of the baby new year, apparently. Oh no.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,320
The new year is already dead. Sometimes.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,920
Long live the new year.

11
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
When I try to do, like, an impression, it almost always comes out ghost,

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,920
and I think that probably explains, like, a lot of shit about A, me, and B, this podcast.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,560
That's Griffin, he's our baby brother. Hi.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,960
And this is 20 Forward. We made it. Yep.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,480
20 Dirt got pretty, um, tasey there at the end. I was a little worried about whether or not we're

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,560
gonna be able to forward that there stream, but we made it, and we didn't lose any supplies.

17
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,880
Nope. I rung in the new year. I don't know what you guys did. I rung in the new year

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,920
at a castle in the center of Ohio while I was trying to solve murder mystery clues.

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
I didn't know that that was, like, a fucking, like, castle-y.

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,200
Was there medieval times, like, the actual time, not the restaurant, in Ohio?

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
Like, were there sieges? Yeah.

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
It's all in the Book of Mormon, Griffin. I guess.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,680
Yes. Were there dragons and squires and blacksmiths and shit, like, in-

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
So you're under the impression that dragons were a part of medieval history.

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
Because I guess I just kind of thought that, like, Ohio missed out on that. I could maybe

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,720
see, like, New Hampshire, like- No, it just, it just cycled later. Like,

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,800
here in Ohio, our Middle Ages happened about two years ago.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
Yeah, because I was there for that shit. Thanks, BK.

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah, and then you left, and then it was the Dark Ages for about a year and a half.

30
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,760
Because I left- And we just found medicine. Yeah, you took it with you.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Oh, Trav, way do you guys get to the Renaissance?

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah. Gonna be a lot of naked lady pictures.

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,320
Nice. Just warning you.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Yummy. Yummy.

35
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Heads up.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,720
I did karaoke for my New Year's Eve, which was fun. They had an old-line sign in the book,

37
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,040
and it was, there was just a lot of cheer. There was a lot of opening of our private booth doors.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,840
Timing that's a nightmare, though, right? You put it in, it pops up at 10 30. Like,

39
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,760
okay, this is gonna seem- Talking about a private booth, it wasn't like a,

40
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,880
it wasn't like a total request live situation. Whoa, look at-

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,400
So you were able to do like karaoke and like strip at the same time.

42
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,320
Biggie Smalls over here with his own private booth. Did you get some crystal?

43
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,920
It was like $6 an hour.

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,760
Whoa.

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,640
It was not, there were no like fondant fountains. It was, it was a $6 an hour karaoke,

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
Korean karaoke place.

47
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,240
You know the Golden Corral now has three fountains? Chocolate, white chocolate, and caramel.

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Really?

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Hey, hey, I got a prime rib, but I want to put it in chocolate, but also caramel.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
Okay, I want to say I'm actually amazed that there's not more. That there's not also like

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,320
a butter fountain, and like a nacho cheese fountain, and like a gravy fountain, and like

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,280
a cookie fountain, and like a sprinkles fountain.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,800
There's a gravy hose.

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,920
There's a gravy hose.

55
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,880
Step on up.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,160
Then there's the cookie trough.

57
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, their newest ads are just step on up you fat piece of shit.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,120
Just give in.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
Turn it on, shut it down.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,320
How have the first five days of the year been for y'all?

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,560
My favorite thing is seeing on Facebook, and it apparently our standards as a society have

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,880
become so little to establish whether a year was good or not when it's like woke up and

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,920
put on my slippers.

64
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,160
2014 is looking good so far.

65
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,520
I mean I guess like you haven't like nobody's come up and like punched you in the in the

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,080
taint like put on my put on my slippers.

67
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,880
They were scorpion free, smooth sailing.

68
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
So far so good.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,040
I just hate to be with that person the one day they're like went to get the peanut butter.

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,520
We were out of smooth and only had crunchy left.

71
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Fuck 2014, fuck 12 hours in.

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
It's already the worst year ever.

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,360
If it keeps up at this pace.

74
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Let's uh, let's help some people.

75
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm ready.

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,840
I'm in good shape for it.

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,880
20 forward.

78
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,200
Here we go.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,040
First question of 20 forward is this.

80
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
I'm relatively in shape.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,080
Enjoy running.

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,600
Well, well, well.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Oh, lardy da.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,400
Lardy da.

85
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,120
Look at me.

86
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,240
I'm fit, damn.

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm the running man.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm the running man.

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,680
I love it.

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Uh, I typically run an hour a day.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,040
But have found that listening to music just doesn't cut it for me.

92
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,800
I really enjoy singing along.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,880
I found it makes running more fun and singing in general makes me a happier person.

94
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,400
Is this a bad thing to do?

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,760
I get embarrassed very little.

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
And I am not looking for attention here.

97
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,200
But I'm curious if you think it's rude to others to run by them singing skater boy.

98
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,440
That being said, I think it's far more ridiculous to go from full out singing to nothing as soon

99
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,760
as I see someone as it looks like I'm embarrassed.

100
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
It's a very Doppler effect.

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,240
Just, ah, ah, he's just a skater boy.

102
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,280
See you later, boy.

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,040
Outside running only.

104
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Sing as one would sing in the shower or car.

105
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,000
And I try to censor myself.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,320
Are there a lot of swears in skater boy?

107
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
He's a fucking skater boy.

108
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
I love you skater dick.

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,200
What?

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,400
Ladies.

111
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,760
What is a skater dick?

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
From piping in pizza.

113
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,120
It's like a regular dick, but he has one of those little finger flip skateboards that

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,720
they sold at Toys R Us for a while.

115
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,160
And a tiny helmet.

116
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,800
He only wears Vans condoms on it.

117
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,720
Hey, do you want to have sex?

118
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,040
I can't.

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,240
My dick's a warp tour.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Shit.

121
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,040
Again.

122
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,800
I bet this crazy, this crazy cool lunge lady.

123
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,840
She's totally rad.

124
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
Lineup sucks this year, but he'll have fun.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,880
It's more about like the experience.

126
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
There's a really easy solution to this.

127
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,840
If you're going to say don't sing, like.

128
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,320
No, no, no.

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,680
Can you tell a bird to not sing?

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:29,920
No.

131
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,560
God, no.

132
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,120
You have to do Queen's don't stop me now on repeat.

133
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,720
I like that.

134
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
And then make eye contact with everyone you pass and like kind of maybe do like finger

135
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:38,880
points.

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
And then they're like, am I stuck in a music video?

137
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,560
And I didn't know it.

138
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
And then they'll think, well, I don't, if he, am I stopping him now?

139
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,920
I really don't want to be, he's been very clear about that.

140
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,560
I don't want to salt your running game.

142
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,040
Come back.

143
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,200
But then the twist there is by calling out after him, they stop and they're like, what?

144
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,560
And like, oh shit, I stopped him now.

145
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,440
Fuck.

146
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,240
Also, I imagine you have headphones on.

147
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,920
I hope you're not just like fucking carrying, carrying like a boom slammer.

148
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
What are those things called?

149
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,760
Boom slammer.

150
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
Boom slammer.

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,200
Yeah.

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,160
Carrying a boom slammer with you as you run.

153
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
It's like a jail for your booms.

154
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,040
It's a, it's a boom slammer that you have like strapped to your arm with one of those

155
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,160
little iPod arm bands.

156
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,560
And you're just like, you just like bringing your tunes with you that way.

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,000
Cause nobody sounds as good as they think they do singing while they're wearing.

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,840
Well, I mean, I earbuds.

159
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Hey, big ups to you, uh, uh, for being able to both run and have the extra lung capacity

160
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,560
to, to like.

161
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,000
Here's the skater boy.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
He says see you later boy.

163
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,120
And it's been good enough for her.

164
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,520
Oh God.

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,400
What an amateur move.

166
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,160
If God, I got to tell you from an outside observers perspective, like it wouldn't be

167
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
a situation of like, if somebody was running towards me in the streets, like shrieking

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,880
Avril Lavigne, it wouldn't be a situation of, Oh, that person's so weird.

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,720
It would be like, I'm, I am genuinely feared, fearful for my life right now.

170
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,760
I genuinely, I need to be in a different place in this place right now.

171
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,360
That's across the street situation.

172
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
Like that would make my day.

173
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you kidding me?

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,960
Think you said that Justin, you're saying that in like, in to like goof, actually think

175
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,920
about a person running towards you, singing a song while they're running towards you as

176
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,040
fast as they can for fitness.

177
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,160
Okay.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
Why am I, why am I at the track?

179
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,040
That's the first thing I got to know.

180
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,080
Are they, are they at the track?

181
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,480
Well, you're at the running track, right?

182
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,600
No, no, no, no.

183
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,880
See, sometimes people just like run on the street where people like walk to go to the

184
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,120
store.

185
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Are there dogs chasing them?

186
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,760
You were walking to H-E-B to pick up a flick at the red box.

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,400
And then all of a sudden, somebody's fucking running down, down Guadalupe at you on the

188
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
same side of the street, singing a song.

189
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
I think that's very rude.

190
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,760
When people jog past my house, I feel like they're having a parade for themselves.

191
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,000
Like, yes, okay, you're running.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,880
Everyone sees you.

193
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,960
Oh, what if you just join a parade?

194
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Oh, oh, you could mask your, uh, you could just stick to only like running with things

195
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
that make noise.

196
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,760
Like run next to an ice cream truck.

197
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,640
That would look good.

198
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,440
I think Travis is suggesting what if there were events or circumstances like a parade,

199
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
but instead of like floats and stuff, it was just like a bunch of people running like a

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,320
long distance.

201
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,040
What if like we could, what if like we invented that?

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,520
Like a bunch of people all running down the street and it would like, here's the thing

203
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:29,680
though.

204
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,640
Here's the best part about it.

205
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,520
It would block traffic for normal people and it would be like pretty annoying in big

206
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,400
cities.

207
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,240
Now Griffin, I feel like you're doing a marathon goof, but what if you did that?

208
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
But the whole marathon was like a giant choir.

209
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,800
It was a big sing along.

210
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,120
Well, actually, I was just actually picturing my head.

211
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,800
Can you imagine doing a 5k?

212
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Well, no, but I can't.

213
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
Can you imagine doing a 5k?

214
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,440
But like as soon as it starts, there's a guy just like, islands in the stream and that

215
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,720
is what we are.

216
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
And then there's also a woman jogging next to him, harmonizing.

217
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
That would help me set my pace ahead of those people.

218
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,640
Just got to keep ahead of them.

219
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320
Um, cause you can't afford to have douche shells in a long run.

220
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,440
You got to stay hydrated.

221
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,840
See, I would suggest maybe like, if like you are instinctively singing along with the song,

222
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,200
listen to some like non non lyrical shit, but then like there's nothing stopping you

223
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,400
from like when you're listening to like, I don't know, let me think of a non lyrical

224
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
song real quick.

225
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,400
The Seinfeld theme song just running down the street.

226
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:44,240
Like I would say that what I love about this question is that they're not worried about

227
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
looking weird.

228
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,040
They're worried about seeming rude, which I think is so considerate that you're missing.

229
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,400
I don't think it's rude at all.

230
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,560
I don't think anyone's going to see you running past and go, how rude?

231
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
I think they're going to go, I need to get inside.

232
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,840
I need to get somewhere safe behind a threshold.

233
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,840
This is the, well, this is the thing though about, I think there's a law of like, if you

234
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,720
there's momentum impacts the, your, your value of a crazy person.

235
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,040
Right?

236
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
So if you are, how often do you run into that situation?

237
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,440
Are you saying like, well, you get into an elevator and it's like, Oh, what are we stuck

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,000
in here for?

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,880
And then it turns out the person's, you know, talking to a corn dog or something happened.

240
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,560
Or maybe you're just trying to use the bathroom with Cracker Barrel and a weird guy comes

241
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
up and shows you his nipple through the crack in the door.

242
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,520
Maybe that happened to you once.

243
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,840
I guess I'm just like uncomfortable with the crazy terminology.

244
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,040
I prefer maybe eccentrics.

245
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,080
Yeah.

246
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay.

247
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,360
He was an eccentric, an eccentric gentleman who showed you his eccentric nipple.

248
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,600
Was the nipple eccentric or was it pretty like cut and dry?

249
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,800
Had he drawn a little winking smiley face on it?

250
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,360
No, it's just a regular nipple and it was super upsetting.

251
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
I actually want to talk about anything else.

252
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:02,960
Okay.

253
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,040
Here's another question.

254
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,840
Recently I had my vehicle stolen, which really bummed me out.

255
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,400
I was wondering if you guys had any advice on things to do for a good cheer up session.

256
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,080
And that's from Canadian Couldn't Car.

257
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
Get justice.

258
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,960
Like hunt the person down and get justice.

259
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,640
For every car stolen from you, you must steal 10 other cars.

260
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,400
Well, no, that's opposite of justice.

261
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,680
Well, then it balances out.

262
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,440
You got to pay it forward.

263
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
I never saw the movie, but I understand that.

264
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,600
What do you say if the three of us need to sit our asses,

265
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
sit our fat asses down and watch fucking pay it forward

266
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,880
so we can like reference this film in a way that makes sense.

267
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:35,920
Yeah.

268
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,520
Once you've, if something is stolen from you, the only like reasonable response is to try to

269
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,840
fill the hours that that thing would have filled for you with justice.

270
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,040
Like trying to pursue justice.

271
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,560
That's how Batman, Bruce Wayne became Batman is because once his parents were dead,

272
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
you know that fool wasn't going to go to school anymore.

273
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,160
He's going to make him nobody.

274
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,400
So he decided to just stay home, become Batman.

275
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
He had a lot of free time on Batman.

276
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,680
If like he was the world's greatest detective and crime fighter

277
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,000
and also illiterate and couldn't do his timetable.

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Completely illiterate.

279
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,400
Batman, to solve my latest riddle, you have to write in cursive.

280
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Wait, no, no, absolutely not.

281
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,920
Can I help you there?

282
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,040
Hey Alfred, could you come here and sign this check for me?

283
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,440
Thank you.

284
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,560
Please.

285
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,080
In for a billion dollars for cancer research.

286
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,920
I wrote Batman, I wrote Batman, but the N, I did it in big block letters and it ends backwards.

287
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,120
I don't think they'll take that because my bank account's not under Batman.

288
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,080
Alfred, what's three times two?

289
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,440
Quit laughing, you old fuck.

290
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,800
Stop it.

291
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,880
It'd be really frustrating for the Joker because all the jokes would go over his head.

292
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,200
They've all got like historical punchlines.

293
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,120
You'll be fiddling like Nero when what are you saying?

294
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,240
I don't follow.

295
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,320
Mad Hatter.

296
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,920
Yeah, like what's a Mad Hatter?

297
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,640
You know, from the book.

298
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
About punching some more.

299
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,200
I know about punching.

300
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
And the villain he's most impressed by is Clock King because he can tell time.

301
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
Like, wow, that is something.

302
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
You're not using digital or anything.

303
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm super intimidated by you, Clock King.

304
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,360
But on the real side, I just go buy a bunch of stuff on Amazon.

305
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,240
Usually does it for me.

306
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,520
He's got to save money for a car though, he can't buy anything.

307
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,040
No, you don't really need a car.

308
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,000
You could go just test drive cars all day and then not buy one.

309
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,440
Well, that's-

310
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
Just to kind of get your fix.

311
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,680
I mean, because like if you're really like jonesing for a car ride.

312
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,160
Oh, could you live next door to an auto dealership and use that to get around town?

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,840
Hey, I will have this back to you, my man, but I gotta hit up Go-Mart.

314
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,520
But there's no situation more stressful than test driving a car.

315
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
So I don't think that would be like, especially, I don't think that would-

316
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,160
Okay, so maybe like smoke a little weed first just to even it out.

317
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,080
And then go test drive a couple cars.

318
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,600
It's fresh with a little hashish.

319
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,400
I was shocked when they, when I test drove, we bought a car like six months or so ago.

320
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,080
I was shocked that they just let us drive it.

321
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:23,200
Like I've been driving for 15 years, but suddenly I was terrified about my ability

322
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,800
to operate a motor vehicle.

323
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,240
I had forgotten everything.

324
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,640
That happened when Teresa and I bought the Matrix and I-

325
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,720
Great, great.

326
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,360
I don't think that-

327
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,920
I know you hesitated like for a second, like, I don't know.

328
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,320
I don't think that franchise has a lot of legs on it still.

329
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,720
I don't think it's a great-

330
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,280
Giannis burned me before, I just don't know.

331
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,720
I was so indecisive.

332
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,320
I love Laurence Fishburne though, shit.

333
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,560
Everybody's talking about this.

334
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,760
Who's this Carrie Ann Moss?

335
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
I don't know her.

336
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,720
That might be an adventure, fun acting adventure.

337
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,920
I always love finding new actresses I love.

338
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,960
Ah, let's give it a shot.

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
It's got guns on the box.

340
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,600
This is great.

341
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,160
Let's get the other two right away, sight unseen.

342
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,120
Ah, fuck.

343
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,180
God.

344
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,860
Shit.

345
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,740
It shouldn't, fuck, should have rotten tomatoes those.

346
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,980
Got me a can Keanu, fuck.

347
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,860
Yeah, buy the first one.

348
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:08,660
You'll love the other two.

349
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,420
Won't love the other two.

350
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,420
I shouldn't even like bother finishing the story now, should I?

351
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,580
Nah, it didn't sound like it was going anywhere like great.

352
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,380
You guys want Yahoo?

353
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,840
Yup.

354
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,020
Are you eating something?

355
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,580
You eating some food?

356
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,620
No.

357
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,260
I can hear you quietly guiltily crunching.

358
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,940
I thought you guys would be riffing for a while.

359
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,420
In my defense, I thought that goof had better legs on it.

360
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,940
That's my fault.

361
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,740
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by somebody anonymous.

362
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,580
It was like I got it from like a Yahoo Answers referral service and I assume that like somebody

363
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,460
sent it in through that service and not that like Yahoo has like gotten self-aware.

364
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,180
Um, cause man, if Yahoo knew how much we'd made fun of it.

365
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,940
Anyway, it's asked by Yahoo Answers user Flaundre Scarlett who asks,

366
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,020
why doesn't the penis gain fat?

367
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,020
Good question.

368
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,220
It just hit me suddenly.

369
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,080
That's it.

370
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,860
We gotta eat the right foods.

371
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,780
You're suggesting that there are foods you can eat.

372
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,500
Just so I'm clear that specifically, like, I guess it makes sense cause like you eat

373
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,100
like a big burger and you're like, oh, this is going straight to my hips.

374
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,820
You're saying there's a way that there's like dick smart bombs in food form.

375
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,740
It's where there's originals.

376
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,740
This whole time.

377
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,700
You couldn't have picked a more upsetting.

378
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:49,140
You picked, you're saying like grandpa's, preternaturally fat dicks.

379
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,140
The fattest dicks.

380
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,380
You're making me think right now of every Werther's commercial I've ever seen

381
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,420
where a kindly silver haired septuagenarian has a little kid on his lap, which is amazing

382
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:08,260
that he has room for anything on that lap other than his enormous, not enormous.

383
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,820
We should, we should be careful with the vernacular here cause we're not talking

384
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:17,620
about like a huge, a huge hog in the typical size.

385
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,180
Not impressive anyway, just horrifying.

386
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,060
Like a fleshy Campbell's can just there.

387
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:24,820
It looks at it.

388
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,540
You look at it, which you don't want to be doing anyway, but you are looking at it

389
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,380
and you think to yourself like, that dick looks out of shape.

390
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,660
That's one flabby wiener.

391
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,460
That's why old people always get offended if you take one of the Werther's

392
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,140
out of their candy dish.

393
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
I'm like, why, that's nature's Viagra.

394
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,460
Be careful.

395
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,900
No, it's not nature's Viagra because it doesn't make, I don't want to get like gross

396
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,060
or blues this soon into 24, but it doesn't like get you hard.

397
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,220
It doesn't get you, it doesn't get you swole.

398
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,380
If anything, it gets you softer.

399
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,540
It gets you, it gets you buzzier a bit.

400
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,420
It's a little bit around the middle.

401
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,740
It gets you swole in a bad way.

402
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,660
And then the problem is after that, if you don't keep it up, you end up with stretch marks.

403
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,700
Oh God.

404
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,340
I can't with this.

405
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,620
I can't do this with you.

406
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,180
Okay, let's-

407
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,500
I just mean, if you don't have a constant source of Werther's, it deflates back weird.

408
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,940
Sure, it deflates back weird.

409
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,700
Like Fat Bastard at the end of the Austin Powers movies, where he's got the weird flaps of skin.

410
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,220
Are you like imagining this?

411
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,220
No, this is a scene.

412
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,580
Okay, let's fucking jump as fast as we can away from this topic of A,

413
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,660
visualizing fat dicks and B, making any Austin Powers references.

414
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,900
Justin, that's going to sound like it's your cue to do your thing.

415
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,740
To do both simultaneously.

416
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,820
Why doesn't the penis gain fat?

417
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,340
It just hit me suddenly, Flaundre Scarlett said.

418
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:01,540
Now, finish your short story.

419
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,900
I think it's because it's all bone.

420
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,180
Now, Justin has been pushing this theory for a long time.

421
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,060
I don't know if Sydney has been a co-conspirator in this, but she should really know-

422
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,660
She's probably my biggest detractor.

423
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,380
Okay, good.

424
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,460
Because like, she's a goddamn doctor.

425
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,540
Like, I think it actually breaks the Hippocratic Oath to suggest that there's a bone that lives

426
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:29,460
in your penis. Justin's been pushing this theory about penis bone for a long, long time.

427
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,180
Some animals have a penis bone.

428
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,740
That's true.

429
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,180
Humans are one of them.

430
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,980
That part, I have a little bit of a problem.

431
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,380
Justin, do you have any kind of medical science to back that up?

432
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,220
Boners.

433
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,260
Boners, okay.

434
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,340
The word, the word, the word boners.

435
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,620
Of course, that being said, the word chubby has recently taken on an entirely like,

436
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,980
just like, it's not a good word.

437
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,780
Well, like, it was a great word before.

438
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,340
Like, it was the medically accepted word.

439
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,980
Just get your chubby out and let's take a look.

440
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,340
I am a chubby doctor.

441
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:04,980
No, no.

442
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,180
Not a fad doctor.

443
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:06,740
A chubby doctor.

444
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,540
You don't understand.

445
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,660
Like a proctologist.

446
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,700
Yeah, yeah, a chubby doctor.

447
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,380
What doesn't it gain?

448
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:20,420
A penis bone is called a baculum, which is so close to scot bacula that it-

449
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,740
He's actually the only human being with a penis bone.

450
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,580
That makes sense to me a lot.

451
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,020
Do you want me to ask Sydney real quick?

452
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

453
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,060
I'll just ask her.

454
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,620
Okay, hold on.

455
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,780
But I want to hear it.

456
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,540
Hey, Sydney!

457
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,300
Hey, Sid!

458
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,060
Why doesn't the penis gain fat?

459
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,060
Why doesn't the penis get fat?

460
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
She says Jesus.

461
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,660
I'll take it.

462
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,660
I'm not sure she's a good doctor anymore.

463
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:00,180
I really wanted a more thorough explanation than that.

464
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,740
Wait, hold on.

465
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,700
Was it an exasperated Jesus or is she implying that Jesus' power stops?

466
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,580
She's implied that Jesus was the one that makes it so your penis doesn't get fat.

467
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,180
I think she is trying to-

468
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,660
She heard you ask that question and thought,

469
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,220
this is a great topic for a saw bones episode.

470
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,700
And now she's trying to fucking- she is trying to hold on to this podcast comedy

471
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,700
and use it for her own thing.

472
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,260
Justin, your marriage is tearing our brotherhood apart.

473
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,860
Sorry.

474
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,460
We had a good run though, didn't we?

475
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
You and your wife or you and your two brothers?

476
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,260
Time to pick.

477
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:34,660
This is it.

478
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,460
This is when you pick.

479
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,780
I pick Jesus.

480
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,500
Okay, so I got another question for you guys.

481
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,140
You want to hear it?

482
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,100
Yeah, yeah.

483
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,140
Hey, guys!

484
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,860
Quick question.

485
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,420
I've been married for over a decade now.

486
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,260
In the past few years, I've really come out as a geek girl.

487
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,540
For example, I enjoy playing D&D, watching Firefly, debating-

488
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,380
Hey, listen, we know what geeks are, okay?

489
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,340
Covered.

490
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,940
We got that covered.

491
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,940
But my husband doesn't appreciate my geekdom.

492
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,540
It makes fun of me, making me feel immature and less of a woman.

493
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,180
Sure, he does appreciate the occasional Star Trek episode,

494
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,820
but he draws the line and allowing me to attend a con.

495
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,220
My question is, should I just go back to the closet and try to suppress my geek urges?

496
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,300
What can I do to help him realize how lucky he is and let me explore this side of me?

497
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,420
That's from Sexy Geek Girl.

498
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:28,420
Man, I got to tell you, we have talked about the idea of self-identity based on cultural

499
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,860
consumption and how most of the time that is not the healthiest thing.

500
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,140
Not that we're shaming those proclivities at all because Christ knows we've got them.

501
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,980
Yes. But the terminology, the phrase

502
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,540
allowing me to attend a con gives me the royal skeevers.

503
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,660
You know, here's the thing.

504
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:57,060
In my opinion, people that make fun of or make people that enjoy things like this feel less

505
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:03,540
is because they themselves are afraid to allow themselves to wholeheartedly love something that

506
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,100
much.

507
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,580
Yeah.

508
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,100
You know, if you see someone make fun of like someone at a Star Trek convention, I doubt

509
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,660
that it has anything personal to do with that person so much as they're looking at someone

510
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,460
unabashedly loving something and it scares them.

511
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,380
Something that I've had to keep in mind throughout my marriage, which isn't as long as yours,

512
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,020
but it's getting there.

513
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,980
Sydney can appreciate some things that would fall into the realm of geekdom for sure, right?

514
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,620
She watched Battlestar with me. She loves Doctor Who.

515
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,660
But there are some things where I have to be honest with myself.

516
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:44,900
I have to look at myself and say, Justin, this is a show about Green Arrow getting his feet

517
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,340
underneath him and maybe meeting the Flash at some point.

518
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,940
Like, probably not.

519
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,500
This isn't gonna fly. Probably not.

520
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:00,660
Probably doesn't need to watch my DVDs of that show, The Wizard, which was about a little

521
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,940
person who invented things and was rich and a genius and a toy maker.

522
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,860
Probably would not get into that with me.

523
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,900
I mean, now I really want to watch that.

524
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,620
Now, if you want to come over and watch The Wizard, you can.

525
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:20,900
But I'm saying is sometimes you feel like something can't be a part of you unless that

526
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,340
person is sharing it with you.

527
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Like, you love it so much you want them to take part.

528
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,780
That can be a little off-putting for some people because everybody's got their own taste,

529
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:31,860
their own things that you like, you have common ground with Star Trek.

530
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,380
Maybe that's a place to build from.

531
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,140
You build out from Star Trek.

532
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,740
Hey, you want Star Trek but good?

533
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,580
It's Battlestar Galactica.

534
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,460
Come watch this with me.

535
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,060
You like Battlestar Galactica?

536
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,340
Why don't you tune into the OC?

537
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,140
It's basically the same thing.

538
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,260
It's a real good show.

539
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,580
Seth is a Cylon.

540
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,300
I've ruined it.

541
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,140
Justin and I are thinking about doing a spin-off from a boom-bam called Ock Ock Ock, maybe.

542
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,780
It's just the OC three times.

543
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,380
We just talk about our favorite episodes.

544
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,260
Anyway, let us know in the comments what you think.

545
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,660
Thanks.

546
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,620
Rate and subscribe.

547
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,460
Don't let anyone make you feel bad about anything.

548
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:13,140
I mean, it's your husband and I'm sure it would be easy to look at this one facet and

549
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,820
for us to judge it, so I'm not going to do that.

550
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,060
But if it's something that's important to you, you should say something to him and be like,

551
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,780
hey, whether you mean to or not, you're making me feel bad about this and that ain't cool.

552
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,900
Am I like, I was willing to give this dude the benefit of the doubt, but like saying,

553
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,420
no, you can't go to the con.

554
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,900
Is he worried that you're not going to come back?

555
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,900
You're going to meet some, I don't know, some Twi'lek there that's just going to swoop

556
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,540
you away?

557
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,220
You know, Griffin, I'm willing to bet that it's something like seeing it as a reflection

558
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,900
of himself in some way of like, oh, no, please don't go to that.

559
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,420
Please, that'd be so embarrassing.

560
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:48,740
Don't go.

561
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,860
He doesn't have to fucking go.

562
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,300
But that's what I'm saying is I think that's what you say and be like, hey, listen, this

563
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,220
is a partnership and we're in us and everything, but I want to go to this thing.

564
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:57,940
You don't have to go.

565
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,940
No one there is going to care that I'm there because everyone else there is also there.

566
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,060
So why is that embarrassing in any way?

567
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,500
I mean, it's not embarrassing.

568
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,700
Like, it's not.

569
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,420
But that's what I'm saying.

570
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,140
That's what I'm saying.

571
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,740
Tell that dude, like, there's nothing embarrassing about it because it's not like you're rolling

572
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,380
up to someone's birthday party in your full out, you know, Star Wars regalia.

573
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,340
But if you roll it to Star Wars convention, what does it matter?

574
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,220
I mean, you could do that.

575
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,100
You could put on your ceremonial head tails and just like fucking roll up to roll up to

576
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,820
this birthday party.

577
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,460
Like, sorry, hon.

578
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,900
You didn't like give me a place to like vent this.

579
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,660
I bought these head tails.

580
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,780
I got to wear them somewhere.

581
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:42,180
I'm sorry, but also mentioned to your husband that the Avengers was the biggest movie that

582
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,580
the year it came out, that J.J.

583
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,940
Abrams makes Star Trek and Star Wars movies now.

584
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:54,660
Like, if they canceled sports, the battle is over, you know, Geeks inherited the earth.

585
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:59,700
I really wanted to watch the Packers 49ers game after this, but you're saying that canceled

586
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,420
sports.

587
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,580
You would think they would wait until at least until the end of the season.

588
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:02,980
I think the Packers...

589
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,100
Due to lack of interest.

590
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,580
See, I don't think that's true because they like...

591
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,540
They said, you know, they said like only like six people are watching.

592
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,620
They turned out everybody got concussions.

593
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,420
They canceled all sports.

594
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,300
So they managed to sell out the Packers game, which isn't like especially surprising because

595
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,380
that fact everybody bought the seats.

596
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,900
Ironically, everyone bought this.

597
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,100
No one's actually going.

598
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,940
Yeah, no one's going like Lambos.

599
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,460
I saw like every single game.

600
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,900
So it's not super surprising.

601
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,140
It is like negative 40 degrees right now in Wisconsin.

602
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,740
People sitting around negative 40 degrees.

603
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:36,820
I got to get a high, high price ticket to do that to lose to lose my gins in the cold.

604
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,740
The toe comes off in the boot.

605
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,260
God, it's insane.

606
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,900
How do you do that?

607
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:48,660
It's right now at the Packers game, it's 48 to 39.

608
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,380
Is that the score?

609
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:49,940
No.

610
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,980
Number of penises that have fallen off versus the number of butts that have fallen off.

611
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,820
They're just frozen off and come off.

612
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,900
But we'll keep you updated throughout the game.

613
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,420
Now let's go back to the Totino's Halftime Show starring John Madden.

614
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,660
Sorry, John Madden and his band, the Madden Knights.

615
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,460
Hey, I'm no better at commentating than I'm at playing bass.

616
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,260
One, two, three.

617
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,220
Let's hit it.

618
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,660
Oh, wait, hold on one second.

619
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,340
There's fucking pizza rolls.

620
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,620
Boom, and he's on his back again, covering himself in pizza rolls.

621
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,580
You know, when I was in middle school, I read the book All Madden by John Madden like five times.

622
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,540
I still have passages of that book that I remember.

623
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,780
You want to know how John Madden treats a sore throat?

624
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,140
Don't even worry about it.

625
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
You want to know how strong he thinks LT is?

626
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,700
Very.

627
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,420
I just googled John Madden dead because I was, no kidding, guys,

628
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,140
500% sure that John Earl Madden, born April 10th, 1936, was dead as fuck.

629
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,900
But right now it just says born and this is dead question mark.

630
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,140
Dead?

631
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,260
End of the day, sexy geek girl, don't suppress your urges.

632
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,820
Don't let anyone make you stop doing anything you want to do,

633
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,180
as long as it's not hurting anyone.

634
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:16,260
But Devil's Advocate, there is absolutely nothing, nothing, nothing wrong with these habits.

635
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,340
But I always say, when we talk about this stuff,

636
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,140
I get super uncomfortable when people define themselves with it.

637
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,620
I mean, the thing is, marriage is a partnership.

638
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,820
Yes, on the one hand, you shouldn't let him make you feel bad about it.

639
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:34,100
But on the other hand, you're in a partnership with this dude.

640
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,780
So there's got to be some level of,

641
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,420
maybe what he doesn't want to do is decorate the whole living room in a Doctor Who theme.

642
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,540
Right, but I don't think she's-

643
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,060
What I'm saying, but like, so don't go like fucking hog wild.

644
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,060
Find a nice, even keel that the both of you are happy and comfortable with.

645
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,220
But if you want to go to the con, go to the fucking con.

646
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,900
Yeah, go to that con, girl.

647
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,540
Girl, damn.

648
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,180
We'll see you there.

649
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:54,740
Let's get paid.

650
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:06,740
Let's get paid.

651
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,740
Guys, I have a pretty fat penis and the rest of me is pretty fat too.

652
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,500
And I decided that in 20 forward, I'm going to move my weight number 20 backward,

653
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,420
by which I mean I'm going to lose 20 pounds.

654
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,900
But I love-

655
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,140
Wow.

656
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,140
The problem is I like eating food that tastes good.

657
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,580
Oh, well, there's no solution.

658
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,080
Damn it.

659
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,380
Excuse me.

660
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,900
Maybe you haven't heard of Nature Box.

661
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,180
Remember earlier when I was eating and it was rude?

662
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:38,100
Well, I was eating sweet potato fries that I got sent to me from the fine people at Nature Box.

663
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,980
Curbing your appetite doesn't get any easier, guys.

664
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:47,460
It's going to help you lose weight with these snacks that are shipped in a box to you monthly.

665
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,300
I get like 10 snacks a month.

666
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,340
You get to choose whatever you want.

667
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,580
They have like a crazy assortment of things you wouldn't have even considered having.

668
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,700
But Man Alive, they are delicious.

669
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,100
So like-

670
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,900
And here's the thing.

671
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,180
They got the sweets covered.

672
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,420
They got the French toast, granola, like the salted caramel pretzel pops.

673
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
God, I ate so many of those when I was in town.

674
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,340
But they also have like some amazing like salty savory shit because I prefer that.

675
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,020
I like my chips and stuff.

676
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,220
They've got some stuff.

677
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,340
Oh, they have-

678
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,420
Italian bistro pestles are very good.

679
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,300
They have very elusive chili lime pistachios.

680
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,060
One of these days I'll eat those without my-

681
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,500
Without my wife just like hoovering them up, shelling all.

682
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,660
So I guarantee no matter what your tastes are, they've got something that you're just-

683
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,380
And it's all natural.

684
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,740
There's no trans fats, no high fructose corn syrup, nothing artificial.

685
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,500
And the best news is you can try it if you want for half off.

686
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,260
You use coupon code MYBROTHER.

687
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,100
Go to naturebox.com and use the promo code MYBROTHER.

688
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,740
All one word.

689
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,940
All one word.

690
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,100
And you're going to get like 50% off these great snacks.

691
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,020
So like my thing right now that I've been using to lose weight in 20 forward is I-

692
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,820
Every time I get hungry, instead of eating, I smoke a whole cigar.

693
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,820
I've also been dipping all my food in Olestra.

694
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,460
Just because like I remember that that was on those chips for a while.

695
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,540
And those did actually I think help me lose some weight.

696
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,540
So is this a better option or-

697
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,700
No, this is much, much better.

698
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:12,420
It's all natural.

699
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,540
But I would assume-

700
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,300
Olestra is pretty all natural, I think.

701
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,620
Yeah, but with your frequent bowel movements,

702
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,340
you're going to be missing some highlights from your favorite TV shows.

703
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,980
And I'm sure you're pretty worried about that.

704
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,500
Not really, I just like let it r-

705
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:25,860
Just like let it leak.

706
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,420
That's my 20 forward, colon, let it leak.

707
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,780
That's the colon, by the way.

708
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,740
Colon, let it leak.

709
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,020
It's not, it is not a punctuation mark.

710
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,460
It's just my, it's my butt.

711
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,220
The good news is there's Hulu Plus.

712
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,100
That's going to help you catch up on all your shows that you missed.

713
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,940
You tried Hulu.com, everybody loves it.

714
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,260
It's great.

715
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,340
They had this great accident with Alex Baldwin for a while.

716
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,700
You probably tried Hulu Minus.

717
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,380
Yeah, that's just like a blank screen for a couple hours.

718
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,300
But now they've got a lot of huge JPEGs of your favorite shows at Hulu Minus.

719
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:55,940
You don't want that.

720
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,820
It's actually just a guy describing TV shows to you.

721
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,620
You'll never believe what happened on Doctor Who last night.

722
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,740
Is there Hulu colon?

723
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,260
They got SNL, they got Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, and Scandal.

724
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,380
And there's like every episode of shows like Lost, Law & Order SVU,

725
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,500
Doctor Who, and Community, and they got some original stuff too.

726
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,780
The Wrong Man's Behind the Mask, which is the show Travis was watching about sports mascots.

727
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,620
And the best of all, it's only eight bucks a month.

728
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,980
No problem.

729
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,820
Eight bucks a month, anybody can spare that.

730
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,300
And, and it always costs eight bucks a month forever, right?

731
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,580
Griffey, you have to pay that right up front.

732
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:31,860
Yeah, pretty much.

733
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
Oh no way, you stupid idiot.

734
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,940
Right now, you can try that Hulu Plus.

735
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,860
You can get on that tip for free for two weeks.

736
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,700
Get that free two week trial.

737

Get it, watch it, view it, enjoy it.

740
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,180
Stop what you're doing right now.

741
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,020
Breaking news.

742
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:58,660
Twice a month, Chicago comedians Cody Melcher and Ranjit Suri invite a funny friend of theirs

743
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,420
over to talk about a really weird book they've all just read.

744
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,260
Now hold on, do they, do they broadcast these discussions?

745
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,060
Or are we just including everybody in-

746
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,100
No, there is no way to listen to this, but-

747
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,060
No, I would say if you are outside their window on a warm summer's day,

748
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,820
and the breeze is in the-

749
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,060
No, you can, you can listen to this podcast.

750
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,060
They have people like Dan Telfer, our, our dear friend.

751
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,860
I think I can say that.

752
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,700
He introduced us once, Dan Telfer.

753
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,220
SNL's Tim Kasrinsky, Community's Danny Pudi.

754
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,980
They've done so many books from Edgar Allen Poe's only novel to a conspiracy book about

755
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,860
homosexuals starting the Nazi party to Twilight.

756
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
It's called Tomfoolery.

757
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,740
Nope, Tom.

758
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,380
There's a clever fucking pun like in the name of it.

759
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Well, just call me Batman, sorry.

760
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,540
Tomfoolery is the actual name of the actual thing.

761
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,340
The newest episode is Children of the Matrix with Aaron Lane.

762
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,540
So go over to Tomfoolery, that's T-O-M-E-F-O-O-L-E-R-Y.com.

763
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,860
And listen to this great show.

764
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,580
And tell them we sent you, and tell them they're welcome.

765
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,900
Well, like, and apologize.

766
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,460
You know, Tom's like a book.

767
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:17,780
They didn't just like spell Tomfoolery like wicked super wrong.

768
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,220
Tomfoolery.com was taken, and they're like, well, what do we throw in there?

769
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,540
Well, if we throw it in, it's like a book thing.

770
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:25,140
Anyway, check that out.

771
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,380
They're on Facebook slash Tomfoolery.

772
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,900
They're also on iTunes.

773
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,620
All right, I'm done.

774
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,580
You guys do this next one.

775
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm done.

776
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,300
I'm out.

777
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,940
I'm done.

778
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,540
This next one's for Justin from his brothers Travis and Griffin.

779
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,580
Dear Justin, we're sorry for making fun of your illiteracy.

780
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,700
Love your brothers.

781
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,820
It's not illiterate.

782
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,260
He's like Pauline illiterate.

783
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:49,460
This message is a special message, and it's for Pauline from Brandon, who is the nice boy who

784
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,100
lives with her.

785
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,100
Who hopefully you're aware of.

786
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,860
Hopefully you, oh God, that raccoon's back in the crawl space.

787
00:36:55,860 --> 00:37:04,260
This special message is coming from inside the house, and it says to my favorite partner,

788
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,300
thanks for hanging out with me for almost three years.

789
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,380
If there's a day when you haven't made me laugh, I don't remember it.

790
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,180
Thanks for turning me on.

791
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,460
Bim bam and Merry Christmas or Happy New Year or Happy Valentine's Day,

792
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,020
depending on when the mackerels get around to reading this.

793
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,500
Nice.

794
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,380
Burned.

795
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,060
Yeah, that's painful and accurate.

796
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,580
I will need some salve for the burn you just laid down.

797
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,300
Severe burn.

798
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,460
Brandon, sorry, we said that you're a monster living in Pauline's mirrors that only hops out

799
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,500
when she turns her back.

800
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,060
We are sorry about that, that I just said, and we hope you guys have a great holiday.

801
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,780
Great Hanukkah.

802
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,500
Happy Hanukkah.

803
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:53,300
Happy Christmaca, you guys.

804
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:40,340
And one final announcement, Dave Holmes, the great Dave Holmes from television,

805
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,580
is joining the network as the new host of our funny as heck international quiz show,

806
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,860
International Waters.

807
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,180
It's going to be a great year for Maximum Fun.

808
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,940
You can check out all our new shows at MaximumFun.org or wherever you find your podcasts.

809
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,540
Here's another question.

810
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,660
How about a Yahoo?

811
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,940
Any Yahoo's lying around?

812
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,580
Yeah, I got a Yahoo.

813
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,860
This one was sent in by John Williams.

814
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,500
Thanks, John.

815
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,820
It's by Yahoo answer user, Ben, who asks,

816
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,700
What bear is best and why?

817
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,060
God, don't get me started.

818
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,460
What bear is best and why?

819
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,620
It lists black bear, grizzly, and why?

820
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,740
Let's take these one at a time.

821
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,540
Black bear, official animal of West Virginia.

822
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:25,940
Pretty great.

823
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,380
Pretty hard to beat.

824
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,020
You know what he loves?

825
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,700
What?

826
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,500
He loves berries.

827
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,140
That's not a pun or a play on words.

828
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,380
That motherfucker do love him some berries.

829
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,180
Mm-hmm.

830
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,680
Okay.

831
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,020
Grizzly.

832
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,340
Like Grizzly Adams.

833
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,460
No, I think like the bear.

834
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,380
No, like Grizzly Adams.

835
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,900
I think they're asking about bears, so.

836
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,420
Oh, Grizzly Adams was like a bear of a man.

837
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,740
We're getting into semantics.

838
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,540
I don't think we should.

839
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,300
And why do you think so?

840
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,220
So like this person only listed just the two bears.

841
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,180
I don't know if they want us to decide between black bear and grizzly

842
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,620
because that's a pretty easy one, black bear.

843
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,780
My favorite kind of bear is poo bears.

844
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,620
Oh, Travis.

845
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,980
Because like me, we both enjoy smack rolls of honey.

846
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,060
Travis is trying to take us back to the days of Christopher Robin and poo.

847
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:16,740
The great thing about black bears.

848
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:21,380
Got a honey bar stuck in honey's nose.

849
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,260
It's the great thing about.

850
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,780
And from there when there was no one.

851
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,820
Travis is only singing this song because he knows it makes me cry every time.

852
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:34,980
They did this to me before.

853
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,620
Please don't.

854
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,260
I'm serious.

855
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:36,660
I'll cry.

856
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,460
They did this to me before Griffin's wedding.

857
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,660
And then everybody thought I was crying about happiness.

858
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,900
All the bees in the hive.

859
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,060
Count the bees.

860
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,620
Chase all the clouds from the sky.

861
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,660
Chase the clouds away.

862
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,420
And now it's no longer fair use.

863
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:56,660
Hold on.

864
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,940
It's not fair use anymore.

865
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,540
It was fair use up until the bees.

866
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,700
They had a good run.

867
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,980
I think the good thing about black bears versus grizzly bears is that black bear didn't eat

868
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,620
grizzly man.

869
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,180
That's true.

870
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,220
And grizzly bears are going to have a hard time getting that one off their record.

871
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,180
It's right there in the name.

872
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,340
I like the pole.

873
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,380
I like a polar bear.

874
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,500
They're pretty good.

875
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,060
I guess in their hair, their hair is in white.

876
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,260
It's sweet.

877
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,380
Their hair is in white.

878
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,500
It's translucent.

879
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,860
I mean, if we're done with jokes for a bit, I'm a big sun bear fan.

880
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,820
Those guys with their like long, long claws and their little faces.

881
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,660
I also like the Kodiak because it's like 10 feet tall.

882
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,740
That's a pretty horrifying bear.

883
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:38,980
Is that the bear that was in that movie with, oh god, you know, where they're like on the

884
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,700
river and there's a bear that just like won't leave them the fuck alone and they eat that

885
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,980
dude from Lost.

886
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,620
They don't eat it.

887
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,740
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

888
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,140
Man, this story, guys, is getting away from me.

889
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,820
There's a bear that eats the guy from Lost.

890
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,780
Michael eats Michael from Lost.

891
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,900
And then there's that older guy.

892
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,420
And then I want to say anyway.

893
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,660
Wow, when you said we were done with jokes, you meant for the whole show.

894
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,340
I need to remember the name of either of the actors in The Edge.

895
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,620
It's Hulk Bolin and Anthony Hopkins.

896
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,060
You couldn't fucking help a brother.

897
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,540
You couldn't fucking step in and be like, let me get this for you.

898
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,420
I heard you were doing so well by yourself.

899
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,100
I like a koala bear because it's not a bear and that's gotta be awkward.

900
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,020
It's a Marmaduke.

901
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,900
We can do this for hours and hours and hours and like we'll have a great time doing that.

902
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,420
And like so will the listeners.

903
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,260
I think we need to like come up with some metrics.

904
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,420
I think we need to like boil it down to who would win in a fight.

905
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,700
Okay, so we have to eliminate human bears.

906
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,220
Bear Grylls, Grizzly Adams.

907
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah, because that, sorry, like Bear Grylls.

908
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,700
Kodiak Jack.

909
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,140
Bear Grylls is okay, but Kangaroo Jack.

910
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,420
Kangaroo's the type of bear.

911
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,140
Now would Gentle Ben be eliminated just by the fact that he's so gentle?

912
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,540
He's not going to win in any fights.

913
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,980
Are we looking for a species of bear that is the most dangerous?

914
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:03,620
Let's sit here and let's each come up with a bear represent- an ursine representative

915
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,180
that we can then see pit against each other.

916
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,180
And we'll like, we'll role play it out.

917
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:14,900
We'll do a bit of bear role playing and then we'll see who comes out the victor.

918
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,420
Okay.

919
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:20,260
I know what mine is, like I sort of came prepared.

920
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,780
Okay, what's your bear?

921
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,300
I mean, I don't want to say mine first because then what if you like figure out the strength

922
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,380
level, the power level of my bear?

923
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,780
You quantify.

924
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
What if we've already named all the bears?

925
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,820
I've got mine, I've got mine.

926
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,180
Travis has his.

927
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,740
Justin, you need a minute?

928
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,140
Okay, just our species or a specific bear?

929
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,540
A bear, the most powerful bear.

930
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,420
Okay, you guys go first.

931
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,460
Okay, Travis.

932
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,300
Wait, I need to hear your bear.

933
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,380
Now, should we say our bears at the same time?

934
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,500
Yeah.

935
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,300
All right, I'll say, I'll say my bear and then you say yours right after so you don't

936
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,340
have time to like, like change, change.

937
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,140
Okay, you ready?

938
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:56,900
Ursa Major.

939
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,220
Teddy Ruxpin.

940
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:06,100
Okay, so Teddy Ruxpin is flung into one of the many stars that compose Ursa Major and

941
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,100
his- Listen, I knew as soon as you said it Griffin, but we specifically said no cheating,

942
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,940
so I wasn't going to deviate from my preset course.

943
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,540
Is it cheating or is it the most powerful bear that there is?

944
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,820
Because it's celestial?

945
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,460
I feel like the rules are pretty clear about what we were looking for.

946
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,060
So what's the best kind of bear?

947
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,860
Star bear.

948
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,580
Yeah, star bear.

949
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,220
Can't really beat that.

950
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:26,580
Star bear is the best.

951
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,500
Justin, I guess you have a pretty good opportunity here to think of what beats a bunch of stars.

952
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,180
It's one star.

953
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,140
It's one star.

954
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,660
Ursa Major is one star.

955
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,180
I think it's a bunch of stars.

956
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,940
No, it's one, it's the north star.

957
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,300
It's not the north star.

958
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:40,420
Hachi machi.

959
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,580
I'm almost certain it's the north star.

960
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,420
It is most certainly not.

961
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,020
It's in all the ancient texts.

962
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,300
Let me get out my astrolabe and prove both you fucks wrong.

963
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,940
Oh yeah, guys, I'm looking at my lab right now.

964
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:54,980
It's a bunch of stars.

965
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,260
It's a bunch of stars.

966
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,420
It's like six to eight stars.

967
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,740
Okay, I have something I have to beat.

968
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,780
Depending on the season.

969
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,260
I have something that can beat your bear.

970
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,380
My bear is one to eight stars, so let's see what you got, hotshot.

971
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,100
All right.

972
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,940
How about the brightest star in the Hanna-Barbera galaxy?

973
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:14,900
Mr. Yogi Bear.

974
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,060
Hey boo boo.

975
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:19,780
That one isn't even like, especially outside the box.

976
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:20,820
Hey boo boo boy.

977
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,900
I certainly like picnic baskets.

978
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,700
Here's the thing about Yogi Bear that you didn't think about.

979
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,460
He eats stars for power.

980
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,260
He is galactus.

981
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,460
He is Yogi Bear system killer.

982
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,300
Yogi Bear star eater.

983
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:40,740
He is something that you don't know about Yogi Bear is that he's 56 years old.

984
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:45,220
No bear has ever been that old, so we have to assume that Yogi Bear is immortal.

985
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:45,700
Okay.

986
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,540
So from that, like if you were to extend that out, then even stars burn out.

987
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,580
But Yogi Bear's presence.

988
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,860
Yogi Bear will be there after the star has winked out of existence.

989
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,220
Yeah, the stars wink out of existence and who still stands strong.

990
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,140
I don't care how many movies they throw at him.

991
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,820
Yogi Bear still.

992
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:11,140
Okay, so the, but the fact that, that Teddy Ruxpin is an android doesn't come into effect.

993
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,180
Burnt, burned.

994
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,660
There's not an android that you can throw into a star that's going to like survive that shit.

995
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,500
Just can't happen.

996
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,900
There's no substance that it's certainly not Teddy Ruxpin, whatever he's made of felt burned to death.

997
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,420
Justin has a pretty good argument actually with this eternal cartoon bear.

998
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:29,700
Thank you.

999
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,740
Which is funny because I feel like this is a rock-paper-scissors thing because I feel like

1000
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,220
Cyborg Bear could beat Yogi Bear.

1001
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,900
This is the new rock-paper-scissors is what you're saying.

1002
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,180
We need to put some branding on this.

1003
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:42,660
Yeah.

1004
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,620
That is, Ursa Major, Teddy Ruxpin, Yogi Bear.

1005
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:53,460
I actually have a problem with what Travis is saying because much like, like the legend of some

1006
00:46:53,460 --> 00:47:00,260
people and like characters from history will outlive them.

1007
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,220
Even if he killed Yogi Bear, Yogi Bear, if he struck Yogi Bear down, so I'm saying he would

1008
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,380
arise more powerful than your Cyborg Bear could possibly imagine, mainly because your Cyborg Bear

1009
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,700
doesn't have a soul, which if there's one thing Yogi Bear certainly does, it's a lot of heart.

1010
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,020
Okay.

1011
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,300
Let me pitch this situation.

1012
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,100
One of the stars up in Ursa Major goes rogue.

1013
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,300
Yes.

1014
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:26,340
Like in that, like in that Lars von Trier movie, the name of which escapes me.

1015
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:26,980
Rogue Star.

1016
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,940
Rogue Star.

1017
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,780
I think it was a planet in that movie.

1018
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,260
I think it was called like Super-

1019
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:32,740
Armageddon.

1020
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,540
Super Sadness.

1021
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:34,840
Okay.

1022
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:42,420
This star comes flung from Ursa Major, travels at the speed of light,

1023
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:49,380
destroys our solar system, just burns it all up, burns up every Teddy Ruxpin doll that was

1024
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:55,460
ever produced, burns up all the celluloid, and every person that ever watched an episode

1025
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:03,060
of Yogi Bear, it burns up Hanna-Barbera land in King's Island, just like destroys the whole thing,

1026
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,260
and there's like nobody left to like carry on these two legacies.

1027
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,420
Okay.

1028
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,460
Let me counterpoint.

1029
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,020
Okay.

1030
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,700
As that's happening, Teddy Ruxpin learns to forgive and thereby wins a moral victory.

1031
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,500
But Teddy Ruxpin has been evaporated.

1032
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:26,900
Yes, but he was able to forgive Ursa Major, and so he is the victor in the confrontation.

1033
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:32,340
The problem is we've been broadcasting Yogi Bear cartoons for over 50 years now.

1034
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,380
They've been done every-

1035
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,900
The fucking radio broadcast.

1036
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,940
Ruxpin had a cartoon.

1037
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:36,420
Yes.

1038
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,460
Ruxpin had a cartoon.

1039
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:37,940
Okay.

1040
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,780
Yeah, but they were predated by, like I'm saying, by the time Yogi Bear reaches Beetlejuice

1041
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:48,500
to the planet, those, sorry, yes, it's a planet, well, yeah, the planet-

1042
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,420
No, it's super, super not.

1043
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:50,660
Okay.

1044
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,580
One of the planets around Beetlejuice, you know what I'm saying?

1045
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:52,900
Thank you.

1046
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,980
So once the broadcast from Yogi Bear hits them, it's the only message they've ever received,

1047
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:01,460
they think of Yogi Bear as a deity.

1048
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:06,100
So that time your Teddy Ruxpin signal arrives at the planet near Beetlejuice-

1049
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,500
Oh my God.

1050
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,020
You will see him the bear antichrist.

1051
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,420
There will be-

1052
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,180
He will be a heretic, is what I'm saying.

1053
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,380
There will be a splinter group-

1054
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,020
False bear!

1055
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,580
Of Beetlejuice-

1056
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,220
False bear!

1057
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,340
There will be a splinter group of Beetlejuicians that adopt him as their god.

1058
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,940
There's a horrible, horrible civil war that breaks out on this bit.

1059
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,620
Oh no, what's that in the sky?

1060
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,460
It's Ursa Major's butt star.

1061
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,820
I win again, motherfuckers.

1062
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,780
2-0.

1063
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,380
2-0-0.

1064
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,260
Do you think they would-

1065
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,740
Wait, so the stars become sentient and is seeking out any remnants of Yogi Bear's

1066
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,340
antichrist in the galaxy.

1067
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,740
This is how the universe ends.

1068
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:43,380
Not with a-

1069
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,060
Not with a bang, but with a no booboo.

1070
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,940
The problem is that by the time that the Beetlejuice planet has already, like,

1071
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,540
adopted Yogi Bear as its personal savior, they've already built a giant picnic basket

1072
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,140
shaped communications tower where they've started beaming out the message, the word,

1073
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,180
to all the other galaxies.

1074
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:05,140
You will never-

1075
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,740
You can't stop the signal.

1076
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:09,860
You will never catch the myth of Yogi Bear.

1077
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,340
It's moving at light speed in every direction of the galaxy.

1078
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,900
There's no way that it can be caught.

1079
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,300
Except by the Ranger.

1080
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,660
The only thing you could do, maybe I would grant you this, Griffin, and this is more

1081
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:28,180
than I should do for you because you have not earned this, but the only thing that your

1082
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,820
sentient star could do-

1083
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:37,460
Or sorry, your sentient collection of stars is if one of them were to volunteer to collapse

1084
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:42,980
and in doing so perhaps create some sort of possibility of time travel that would allow

1085
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,380
them to go back in time and kill William, Hannah, and Joseph, and Barbara.

1086
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,260
So one of the-

1087
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:53,540
Wait, so one of the stars collapses allowing the other stars to go back through to kill

1088
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,220
Hannah and or Barbara.

1089
00:50:55,220 --> 00:51:01,700
Hannah and Barbara one day while beginning to do the sketches that would first-

1090
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:02,500
Hey, I have an idea.

1091
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,820
This is my favorite Doctor Who episode.

1092
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:06,900
Tell me about your idea, Hannah.

1093
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,060
Oh man, it's totally sick.

1094
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,500
What if there's like Jellystone Park and there's like a bear, super hungry, got a little friend,

1095
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,140
ranger's kind of-

1096
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,020
He's kind of like Ed Norton on the Honeymooners.

1097
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:19,620
What do you think?

1098
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:20,660
I think that's great.

1099
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,140
And can I tell you how much I love this open office space that we have with the skylight?

1100
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,580
Hey, look up through the skylight.

1101
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,900
There's a singularity in the clouds.

1102
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,140
25 stars come storming in like, what's up?

1103
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,780
What's up?

1104
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,660
Heretic.

1105
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,100
Now, here's the problem though.

1106
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,660
Shit.

1107
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,700
One of the stars has to agree to collapse and you know how stars are.

1108
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:42,660
Yeah, that's true.

1109
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,340
They are not going to be thinking big picture.

1110
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:44,740
No.

1111
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,260
They're going to think, well, not me.

1112
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,620
So you know what happens.

1113
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,740
What about Daryl the star?

1114
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,060
25.

1115
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:49,940
Maybe he could collapse.

1116
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,260
He's the last one to join up in the constellation.

1117
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,460
Lots of people don't even count.

1118
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,300
Without Daryl, it's just a bear with a shorter tail.

1119
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:02,100
25 of the other stars murder one of the other stars and that is where sin came from.

1120
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,060
That's original sin.

1121
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,860
When you read about original sin in the Bible, that's what it's talking about.

1122
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,940
That's amazing.

1123
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,300
I am glad that we were able to really play out this whole scenario.

1124
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,500
I do not know who won.

1125
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,260
I think it was mine because I killed Hannah Barbera.

1126
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,500
Still not as weird as Scientology though.

1127
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:18,900
No.

1128
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,420
Which is surprising.

1129
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,260
Man, we did that for like 30 minutes.

1130
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,940
Where do you go from there?

1131
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:26,820
I think we have to stop.

1132
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,860
Let's do one more.

1133
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,860
Let's do one more regular question.

1134
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,080
Okay.

1135
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,240
I'm getting married within weeks and I want to make my wedding night a special one for

1136
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,600
my soon-to-be husband.

1137
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,960
I'm not interested in making it a hypersexual experience.

1138
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,280
I want to do something more interesting.

1139
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,000
Any ideas?

1140
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,000
You'll give me a cosplay.

1141
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,040
Yeah, you'll give me a cosplay.

1142
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:47,400
That sounds pretty hypersexual to me.

1143
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:55,000
How like, oh man, do you think this person has like gone through systematically the

1144
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,800
Extreme Restraints library, the Extreme Restraints catalog, and has exhausted every product on

1145
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,000
there like, ah, sex is just so passe for me.

1146
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,280
Well, maybe she's not, maybe she doesn't want it to be all about sex.

1147
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,120
Maybe she wants something to get about like the emotional magic of like, now we are one,

1148
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:15,000
now we are bonded, now we are forever in love.

1149
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:21,880
Anything that you do, you are going to run the risk of making him feel guilty that he

1150
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,560
did not also do something.

1151
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:28,440
If you put together like a photo collage of like your greatest moments, all your greatest

1152
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,560
hits, then he's going to just look around the room and be like, I got you hotel soap.

1153
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,960
I got this for you.

1154
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:38,440
It's special, reminds me of, remember that hotel we stayed at that one time the night

1155
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,240
we got married?

1156
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,520
I saved the soap.

1157
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,800
That is an excellent point.

1158
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,960
No matter what, get a hotel room.

1159
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:47,960
Even if you're like getting married next door to your house, get a hotel room.

1160
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:48,760
Do not go home.

1161
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,200
Yeah, don't go home.

1162
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,080
That will make it special.

1163
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,040
Location is important.

1164
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,880
So find a place where you can maybe get a nice suite.

1165
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,360
Don't make it about sex, make it about relaxing.

1166
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,080
Get a suite with like a nice jacuzzi tub in it and get some-

1167
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,600
Order some fancy cocktails.

1168
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:13,080
Get a gravy hose and then if you do decide to turn up the sex, then you have that just

1169
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,040
like on hand.

1170
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,320
You got the graveyard there, you can do a gravy in the jacuzzi bath, turn on the jets,

1171
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,520
get gravy jets, and then just see where the mood takes you.

1172
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,720
I can tell you where the mood's going to take you when there's gravy jets in play.

1173
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,840
To the Golden Corral?

1174
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,640
Right to the Golden Corral.

1175
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,160
Right to the Golden Corral.

1176
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,920
Get a nice room, make it about relaxing together because you guys are going to be so exhausted.

1177
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:39,400
You just planned a wedding, you just met everybody you've ever known and they've all told you

1178
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,600
how happy they were for you.

1179
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,120
That's emotionally exhausting.

1180
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,360
Just make it like a nice relaxing time.

1181
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:49,160
I mean, Theresa and I wrapped up in robes and watched like HGTV while we ate chocolate

1182
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,000
covered strawberries and drank champagne.

1183
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:52,040
Perfect.

1184
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,440
And then you had sex.

1185
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,520
I don't want to talk about this.

1186
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,640
Justin, did you not like express yourself sexually?

1187
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:06,360
I would rather talk about anything including Darfur.

1188
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:16,040
You have to like have a conceptual release and like a consensual release and a physical

1189
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,520
release.

1190
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:21,000
You have to have three different releases on your wedding night because it's like symbolic

1191
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,760
and it's like love.

1192
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,560
And a press release.

1193
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,280
It's like love.

1194
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,040
Well, you do that the next morning when your aunt is like, so how was it?

1195
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,280
Dateline.

1196
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,000
I had sex.

1197
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,160
Breaking over the wire last night.

1198
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,000
Jim Parsons had sex.

1199
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,240
I didn't mean to summon up the star of Big Bang Theory.

1200
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah, Jesus.

1201
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,840
I've got a Big Bang Theory.

1202
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,520
He had sex last night.

1203
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,240
Guys, this has been a very enjoyable time that I've enjoyed having with you until Griffin

1204
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,840
tried to go this into talking about sex.

1205
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,120
I don't want to hear about like your sex lives.

1206
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:05,800
I just want to know that you indulged in the carnal release.

1207
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,280
Does it make it easier to talk about when we say carnal release?

1208
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,440
I think Justin is dead, so I don't think it made it much easier.

1209
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:16,840
You guys were breaking up for a bit, but now you're back.

1210
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,200
We're talking about carnal release.

1211
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,280
I don't want to do that now.

1212
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:20,600
Okay.

1213
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,120
We do have a lot to talk about though, so let's wrap it up like one would before they

1214
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:26,680
have sex.

1215
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,320

What?

1219
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,320
No, it's just talking about sex with you guys is gross.

1220
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:36,920

Thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1251
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,860
It's a departure, which is on the album, putting the days to bed.

1252
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:37,900
It's a terrific album.

1253
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:44,300
It's just listening to John Roderick and Jonathan Colton's Christmas album, which is, which

1254
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,340
is similarly great.

1255
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:50,300
We don't have a theme song off that album, but it's, it's good to also make sure you

1256
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,300
listen to all the other maximum fun podcasts.

1257
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,380
We just got five brand new, four brand new shows and one brand new host.

1258
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,140
They're so great.

1259
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:58,940
What have you guys been?

1260
00:58:58,940 --> 00:58:59,820
They're all really great.

1261
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:05,180
I was redoing my office last week and I listened to listen to all of them.

1262
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:12,300
Like, um, I wouldn't recommend all of them, but especially I really liked a song exploder,

1263
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:15,660
which is very good, which is a very, very brief.

1264
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:20,220
I think it's like 11 minutes, uh, podcast, uh, where they take songs apart and talk about

1265
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:21,340
how they made them.

1266
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,820
I also really liked the goose down is, is super, super funny.

1267
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:31,660
Um, so check them and I haven't got a chance, um, is it Oh, no Ross and Kerry Ross and carries

1268
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,180
and I like go on where they talk about, um, the concept of it to me.

1269
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,980
I haven't got a chance to listen to it yet, but it looks fascinating.

1270
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:38,620
I can't wait to listen.

1271
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,340
You would like it.

1272
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:43,740
It's, it's almost like a mix of like saw bones and in case of emergency, it's yeah, they

1273
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:48,620
explore like French science and religious groups and they join cults and everything.

1274
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,500
It sounds really cool.

1275
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:49,900

Okay.

1316
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,620
I just, you're not, you're not like hip to like HTML.
