1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,640
Hey everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,400
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother of the show.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,640
My name is Travis McElroy, and I'm your middle-est brother of the show.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,720
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Boys, it's good to have you here.

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,960
I'm excited to have the opportunity to speak to the both of you today.

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
Thank you, Griffin. I'm glad we could be here for you.

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
I forgot how we do it.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,240
This ain't how we do it, this isn't how we do it.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Justin, I have great news for you though, and that is that we don't have to stay

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,760
in the podcast game anymore because I've discovered a new exciting career opportunity

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,160
that I think the three of us can spearhead together.

16
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,120
I've been working on it for the past 48 hours, and I'm already a multi-dollar heir.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
And I think that I can grab the two of you and I can bring you up with me,

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,080
up the success ladder.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,480
Is it gambling? Because I've been doing that already.

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,360
No, God, you're not on that fucking fan duel, are you?

21
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,800
We can talk about it later.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,240
Yeah, we can. Yeah, we're gonna talk about that shit later, Travis.

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,680
No, it's not gambling because gambling assumes a risk of failure.

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,120
This is a 100% guarantee.

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,640
It's a proven system, scientifically proven system.

26
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Boys, I'd like to talk to the two of you about joining me in becoming a beauty-tainer.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,120
Excuse me?

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
Now, what's a beauty-tainer?

29
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,400
A beauty-tainer is, of course, a secondhand retailer of the cosmetic line

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,880
belonging to one Miss Tyra Banks.

31
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
She has a new cosmetic line, and it's called Tyra, and she's looking for...

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,200
And guys, the hard part is gonna be getting on board,

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,840
because the audition process is rigorous.

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,440
But if you can get on board, you can join me in selling these Tyra beauty products

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
to your friends, to your colleagues.

36
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
You can have tie-tie parties at your house, and you will.

37
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
I already have tie-tie parties, so it's really encouraging for me

38
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
that I'm gonna be able to sell merch.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,600
Uh-huh, you're gonna get something out of these tie-tie parties

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,360
because they're expensive to put on, aren't they?

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Getting salon people in there to give people that tie-tie chop,

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,560
and bartenders to make my tie-ties.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
Listen, it's gonna be...

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,720
I almost said risky, but it's not risky.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,440
It's guaranteed.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,720
I've made $16 in the past 48 hours.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,920
Wow, just like that?

48
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,120
Do you know what that translates to?

49
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Do you know what that translates to?

50
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:12,960
No.

51
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,840
It's pennies.

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,880
Pennies on the hour.

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,560
Pennies on the hour, guys.

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,520
But do you know how many hours you have in a week?

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,280
525,600.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,160
Girl, let me ask you this.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
So you're already a beauty tainer,

58
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
so you should be able to answer this question.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,480
What is it?

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,760
What sets this product apart from all the rest?

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,680
It's gonna make your whole gut pop.

62
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,840
Whoa, are popping guts back?

63
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,960
Yeah.

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,280
Your gut, it's gonna pop.

65
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
And your face is gonna...

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,480
And that's good.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,240
Yeah, that's like a new word.

68
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,080
So that's a word that Tyra...

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,400
Every week, Tyra sends you a letter in the mail,

70
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,720
and it just has like a new Tyra-ism in it.

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
And this week, it's like, make that face...

72
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
Now, can you give me a spelling?

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
Just a quick spell check on that,

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,320
so I can add it to my dictionary?

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:04,720
Yeah.

76
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,680
My auto correct.

77
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,680
S-W-E-W-P.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
S-W-E-W-P.

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,960
It's pretty much phonetically...

80
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
So it's pronounced S-W-E-W-P.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, you got it.

82
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,400
Just for yourself, like a regular beauty tainer yourself.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,520
Is there any upfront cost to getting on board?

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
That's exactly what I was gonna ask.

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,600
Thank you, Travis.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,480
$35,000.

87
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,560
$35,000 at very reasonable.

88
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
One time fee, one time fee though.

89
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
And it's like, you know, the title doesn't go away.

90
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,400
Once you become a grand master chess player,

91
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
you're always a grand master for life.

92
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
It's a one time only fee per year, right?

93
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,720
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,760
That's what I meant, one time.

95
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,480
Per annum.

96
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,520
Yeah, you only have to pay it once every calendar year.

97
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,320
And if you don't pay it, they actually do come to your house

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,480
and they take away all your beauty tainer credentials.

99
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,440
But I feel really, I feel good about myself

100
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
for the first time in a long time.

101
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
And that might just be because I am completely

102
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,480
just fucking covered in the stuff.

103
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,200
Oh, so you're using, you're high on your own supply.

104
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah, well, I've got $35,000 fucking dollars worth

105
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,640
of creams and salves and there's a sparkle element to it.

106
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
And I look fucking incredible.

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
I feel like a million dollars,

108
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,640
but I feel like actually I probably have about $600 worth

109
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
of creams and salves on me at this exact moment.

110
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,280
Anyway, I want to talk to the two of you.

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,640
Maybe we can do it after the podcast

112
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,480
because I sense your hesitance.

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,960
But I want to turn that hesitance into fucking glamour.

114
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,360
President has a sense.

115
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,320
Prestidigitation.

116
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
Like presidents like the Bills.

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,800
I want the two of you to become the presidents of America.

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,040
Okay.

119
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,880
I don't think that Tyra can help with that.

120
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
No, I think she can.

121
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,400
I think this is the first step.

122
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,440
She has a lot of power.

123
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Tyra Banks is an inspiration.

124
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,520
My daughter will say in the speech to her civics class

125
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
in 10th grade, Tyra Banks is an inspiration.

126
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
She was our nation's first fabulous president.

127
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,240
That is true.

128
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,960
She was our sixth female president.

129
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,600
Six female.

130
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,920
But she was the first one that was like really fucking rocking it.

131
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,360
Did anybody watch Friday's episode of ANTM 2.2?

132
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,800
I'm a little behind.

133
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
You're a little behind.

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Well, she does a whole music video promoting her line of products

136
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
and there's the chorus of it.

137
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,440
Can I perform it for you now?

138
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,600
Because we have to perform it every time you hold a party.

139
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
Please do.

140
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,760
And by party, I mean enclave.

141
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,920
That's what she says to call them.

142
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Anyway, the song goes,

143
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
Work the hallway like a runway.

144
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
Work that hallway like a runway.

145
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,240
Excuse me, Ms. Banks.

146
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,840
Excuse me, Ms. Banks.

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
What do you mean by work that?

148
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,160
What do you mean by work that hallway like a runway?

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,200
I, Griffin, I guarantee, let me take you behind the curtain

150
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,440
to where they were writing this hit single.

151
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, please.

152
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
I want to reference a runway,

153
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,320
but Ms. Banks, like not everybody has access to a runway.

154
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,920
Well, can anybody find a hallway?

155
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,320
Yes.

156
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:50,560
Okay.

157
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,720
So we'll just make it like a hallway is like a runway.

158
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,680
What do you mean?

159
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,440
Except it's not because it's like enclosed

160
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,520
and there's nowhere for people to sit and snap pictures.

161
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
And that's why you have to make the hallway like a runway.

162
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,320
Come on, Steven.

163
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,840
If you're at a dinner party

164
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,680
and you're waiting on the bathroom

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
and then just coming down the hall from the bathroom,

166
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,360
you saw the host of the party just working it,

167
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,040
you would think that's insane.

168
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,280
Yep.

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
Or if you saw like a 16 year old kid

170
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
walking down a hallway at school,

171
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,920
just like working it like they were on a runway,

172
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,240
they're going to be shunned.

173
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,280
I just wanted to like warm you guys up to the fact

174
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,480
that whenever we're together

175
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,880
and you see me moving between a narrow chamber between rooms

176
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
and I'm just fucking on my grind.

177
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,600
Griffin won't even acknowledge always anymore.

178
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,880
He just calls them shitty runways.

179
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,360
Yeah.

180
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,520
Enclosed runway cages.

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
One of my best friends is an incredibly cheerful

182
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
and positive person.

183
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
Like relentlessly so.

184
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,480
I am fairly eh with my outlook on life

185
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,760
and appreciate her disposition.

186
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
Although at times it can be very overwhelming.

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,920
How can I tell her to tone down the sunny side

188
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,680
without sounding like a total monster?

189
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,040
Overcast in Omaha.

190
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,600
Bad news.

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,320
It's too late.

192
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
It's like you already sound like a total monster.

193
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:07,760
Yeah.

194
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,480
His friend, you've come to the wrong place.

195
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
I think the reason you have a problem

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,360
figuring out how to say it

197
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,800
is because like there is no reason to say,

198
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
like play that out.

199
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,120
Like, hey, hey, Debbie, don't be so happy.

200
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,920
Yeah, like it doesn't make sense.

201
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,200
I mean, think about it.

202
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,600
How does it negatively affect you at all?

203
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,480
How cool is your life that you're not just like

204
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,960
feeding off of people like that relentlessly?

205
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
You gotta feed off.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Do you not realize that that's,

207
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
maybe you don't realize that that's the secret

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,280
is you have to be a joy leech

209
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,160
by hanging off of the fatty flesh of your happy friends.

210
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,760
You are not harvesting enough.

211
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,880
That's the problem.

212
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,400
The problem is with you.

213
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,080
You are supposed to come at like the little bird

214
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,480
and peck the joy from between her teeth.

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Like the rhino.

216
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,360
And that's good for both of you

217
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,240
because then she gets her teeth cleaned

218
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,720
and you get a little bit of happiness chunks.

219
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Do you know that song Rainbow Connection?

220
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,080
That song is literally about like a virulent proboscis

221
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
that you just jam into your happy friends

222
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
and you sustain yourself.

223
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,680
Yeah, you are the pilot fish to her shark of joy.

224
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
You need to just clean that joy off.

225
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,280
If she has to do her abundance

226
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,880
it's because you're not filling your quota

227
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
of just draining it.

228
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
But listen, don't change too much

229
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,960
because she's also feeding off your sorrow

230
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,160
and that's important.

231
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,640
If it wasn't for that, she just wouldn't,

232
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
she would just be dancing in the street.

233
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,240
I think we've basically just described

234
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,000
the plot of Inside Out, right?

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,760
Like that's the happiness and sadness go together.

236
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,280
And we've also described like the truth

237
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,400
about cats and dogs.

238
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,280
There's a lot.

239
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,480
Must love dogs.

240
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,400
Must all dogs go to heaven.

241
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,160
Air Bud one through six.

242
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,560
I just don't see why it's important to you to like-

243
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,200
Unless.

244
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,480
Like you understand.

245
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,760
Unless she's cheerful at like the exact wrong times.

246
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,560
Oh boy.

247
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
Like a friend like has just like had their car totaled

248
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,000
or like a loved one passed away

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,960
and she's like, awesome, great, totally cool you guys.

250
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,200
You didn't say she's unbalanced.

251
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
But they said at times overwhelming.

252
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,800
Yeah, they just watched the harrowing documentary

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
Dear Zachary and then it's-

254
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,080
Good one TV program.

255
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Classic.

256
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,360
Classic.

257
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
I could also see though in like if everybody's like,

258
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
oh, do you wanna order a pizza?

259
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,880
And she just is like, it's the greatest thing

260
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,960
where I could see it coming across as very insincere

261
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,480
if she's overly cheerful and excited about everything.

262
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,120
But that's on you.

263
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
If a person's being sincere and you think they're being insincere

264
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,040
that is not a them problem.

265
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,000
That is a you problem.

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,520
But is that a conversation you'd have?

267
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,120
Or like if you're that excited about everything

268
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,560
then you're that excited about nothing?

269
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
Like you have to vary it up into-

270
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Absolutely not.

271
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
Why not be senselessly joyful?

272
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,560
Why not just be completely happy about-

273
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,560
We all used to be fucking stoked about pizza.

274
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,360
We all used to get that stoked about pizza

275
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
and she has somehow preserved that

276
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,000
and for you to come around and try to snatch that from her hand

277
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
is a sin.

278
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,480
It's sinful.

279
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,160
If you say someone's over-

280
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
Like my friend is really happy

281
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,920
and sometimes it can be overwhelming.

282
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,160
You sound like Lydia from Beetlejuice.

283
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,000
You have to just lighten up a little bit.

284
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,080
I agree.

285
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,960
I agree too.

286
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,000
How about a Yahoo?

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,640
Wait, is that-

288
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
Well, I don't wanna be-

289
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,080
Oh man, I don't know.

290
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,760
I don't wanna be like callous or hurt somebody's feelings.

291
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,440
No, you are the way you are.

292
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,080
It's just like I understand that this is not a-

293
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,640
Okay, let me put it to you this way.

294
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,720
If this is genuinely a problem for you,

295
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
the onus is on you to distance yourself from this person,

296
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,680
not to try to fucking bring them down.

297
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,240
Or to hang out with them at appropriately cheerful times.

298
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,680
When you're in a good groove,

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
you got that radiation vibe you're grooving on,

300
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,520
you're gonna call her up,

301
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,720
get out there in the sun,

302
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,960
get some mochas and just have a day.

303
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
And if you find yourself in a situation

304
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,560
where she's like super cheerful about something,

305
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
try to see it how she sees it

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,440
and maybe you're like, you know what?

307
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,200
There is a lot of good in this situation.

308
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,080
People like this are fucking magic.

309
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,440
They're real life magic.

310
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
And you've got to surround yourself

311
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,040
with as many of them as you possibly can.

312
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,960
Build yourself a flesh barrier with these happy SOBs.

313
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,600
You need it.

314
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,880
We all need it.

315
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
How about a Yahoo?

316
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,480
Yeah.

317
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,080
This Yahoo was sent in by game recognized game,

318
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,800
Rachel Sperling.

319
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,440
Thank you, Rachel.

320
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

321
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,760
Oh, they're anonymous.

322
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,640
And for good reason, based on this question,

323
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
it was posted in education and reference,

324
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,480
higher education, university plus.

325
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,480
Have you guys started university plus yet?

326
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
Oh no, I wasn't willing to pay the subscription fee.

327
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, you gotta pay a subscription fee,

328
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,920
but they let you keep your level and the items.

329
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
I haven't found all the collectibles in university.

330
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,360
From the original university.

331
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,600
Anyway, this anonymous answer, Yahoo asker,

332
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,560
let's call him BJ asks.

333
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,840
Nice.

334
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Nice, come on.

335
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,360
BJ asks, do colleges look at Yahoo Answers?

336
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,600
And if they did, I have asked some very personal questions,

337
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
such as when I did vape.

338
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
Now, I just, there's a lot.

339
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
His test scores are out of this world.

340
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,400
Lots of really great extracurricular.

341
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,200
What's this?

342
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,840
Wait a minute.

343
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,960
When did vape?

344
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,840
When he did vape.

345
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,240
Wait, he's also spelled vape with an at sign instead of an a.

346
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
Is vape like banned on Yahoo?

347
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,360
Yeah, so that way it can't be.

348
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
It's actually pronounced va-ta-pe.

349
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,560
Hand me that va-ta-pe cigarette.

350
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,560
If you can be tracked from your human identity

351
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,800
back to your Yahoo Answers identity,

352
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,560
you have fucked up worse than anybody could fuck up ever.

353
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,200
All right, let me finish reading the additional details.

354
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,480
Personal questions, such as when I did va-ta-pe,

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,280
or when I was younger, I asked how to master,

356
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't have to finish that word, master.

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,200
Pokemon.

358
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Pokemon bait, master Pokemon bait.

359
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,480
I don't have to finish that word, lol.

360
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,320
Well, I have asked some questions like that and such.

361
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
Do colleges look at Yahoo Answers?

362
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,240
And if they did, would they not accept me when I'm older,

363
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
slash not like me, slash not approve me?

364
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
I mean, if they did, they were just questions.

365
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,360
Questions are the keys to your mind's development.

366
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,080
One, whoever has to do that at a college

367
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
has the worst job in the world.

368
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,880
Two, I want the answer to be not like you,

369
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,200
but still accept you from the college.

370
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,880
Like, yes, you can come here.

371
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,840
Oh, God, look at you.

372
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
This person you've just described, Travis,

373
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,600
who asked the Yahoo Diver,

374
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,840
like I'm imagining somebody just wearing fucking riot gear,

375
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,800
just connected to a fucking like oxygen tank.

376
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
I guess it's the logical conclusion

377
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,960
of if like Drew and Rachel and Zoe Kinski went pro.

378
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,160
Yeah, yeah, oh, God, they went fucking white hat.

379
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,200
They're on the right side of the law now,

380
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,960
surfing the deep web for dumb questions.

381
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,120
This is my brother, my brother and me civil war.

382
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,360
This is the sort of thing that like somebody would invent

383
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
like an AI program to do data mining into Yahoo Answers

384
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,640
to see if college applicants had ever asked

385
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,960
how to masturbate or how to Vitape.

386
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,840
And then that program that you create

387
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,080
to do that data mining would definitely become sentient

388
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,520
and definitely kill humanity

389
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,680
because it's seen the darkest, darkest side of us.

390
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
It's lived through the darkest universe.

391
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,720
I will answer the greatest Yahoo Answers question,

392
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,600
how to protect humanity from itself.

393
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,440
Yeah, by annihilating it.

394
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,600
I think that was Robot Kennedy I just did.

395
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
I think it definitely was.

396
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,440
I loved it.

397
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,440
Ask not what you can error, logical fallacy.

398
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,320
I cannot imagine why,

399
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,960
can you even imagine being the person,

400
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,080
not just the person who has to read them,

401
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,640
but the person who has to connect the identities?

402
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,480
Like how would you even?

403
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,200
Oh, sorry, this guy, I'm actually his Yahoo name loaded,

404
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,120
it's actually Steve Jefferson, Huntington High School,

405
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
class of 2016.

406
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,080
Okay.

407
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,200
So that's his username.

408
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,840
So that might actually be-

409
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,800
His GPA is on there.

410
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,160
His GPA is on here.

411
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,880
Can I say something?

412
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,040
His SAT and his ACT, wow.

413
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,160
He fucked them both up.

414
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
He did a really bad job on both tests.

415
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,600
Yeah, very substandard.

416
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,960
Like really super bad.

417
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,240
All the stuff that we see in like movies and TV shows

418
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
where it's like your extracurriculars

419
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,680
and all that stuff,

420
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,200
does that stuff actually matter?

421
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,760
Like I didn't like super do a great job applying to colleges

422
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,360
and got into the University of Oklahoma

423
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
because I was a National Merit Scholar.

424
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,480
I never really went through the application process.

425
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,520
Is it that in depth where they like would even care?

426
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,080
Like do they even check like your Facebook profile?

427
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,200
Do they care that much?

428
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh, they definitely do.

429
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
Just like you got money, you're not dumb, get in here.

430
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,280
Oh no, they definitely do a deep dive.

431
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,040
A hundred percent.

432
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,560
They are getting deep down in there.

433
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:24,960
You're sure?

434
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
Oh my God, yes.

435
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,920
Oh, every single applicant, they do a full blown deep dive.

436
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Oops, looks like you said a racist thing

437
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,840
three and a half years ago, you're out.

438
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,040
Well, then they're like, listen,

439
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,720
there are lots of kids in them colleges.

440
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,880
There must be a pretty loose guy where they're like,

441
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,280
okay, we take off 12 of these boxes.

442
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,160
No, that's why there's no racist kids in college anywhere.

443
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,120
That explains it.

444
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
I've been wondering why they-

445
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
You say one racist thing and you're out.

446
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,440
Unless you go to RacistU.

447
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,960
Yeah, there you're welcome with open arms.

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
Open racist arms.

449
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,680
I can't, I-

450
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,400
What if this person's applying-

451
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,320
RacistU is actually my safety school.

452
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,800
What if this person is applying to vape university?

453
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Vapin' and Baitin' university

454
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
where they always teach you how to vape and bait

455
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,280
and you've shown a lack of proficiency with those things.

456
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Or no, no, no.

458
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,440
Or because you got started in the game so young,

459
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
though maybe they might hire you to be like a TA

460
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,800
or something like that.

461
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay, I think that whether or not a school's gonna do

462
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,960
this deep of a dive depends on the quality of school

463
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,760
you are attending.

464
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,240
For example, I live in Huntington and applied to Marshall

465
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
and if you live in Huntington and apply to Marshall,

466
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
they're just like, yeah, cool, come on.

467
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
They just assumed you were already going there.

468
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,440
Oh man, do you know Greg?

469
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,640
You're in.

470
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,920
Yeah, cool, come on in.

471
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,720
But isn't it kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

472
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,280
where if you are the sort of person

473
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,400
that is combing Yahoo Answers for data about vaping

474
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
and baiting, you are probably not looking at a top tier school?

475
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
Is that inaccurate, do you think?

476
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
That's hateful, that's hateful, that's hateful.

477
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,440
That's hateful because you know what that means, Justin?

478
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
What?

479
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,240
This person's got a fucking curious

480
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,400
and therefore beautiful mind.

481
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,560
I'm not worried about the person-

482
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,000
Have you seen that movie Beautiful Mind

483
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,920
where all he does is vape and bait?

484
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,080
And get on Yahoo Answers and make sure he's doing both

485
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,520
as good as he possibly can.

486
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,040
I also enjoy that this gentleman or lady

487
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,840
is worried enough about this to ask Yahoo Answers

488
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,120
but not so worried about it

489
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,920
that they're going to just delete their Yahoo Answers account.

490
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,120
Like, oh, I might need some of that information again.

491
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,760
It's gonna be harder to index.

492
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,200
Because if they don't get into college,

493
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
they need a place to learn things.

494
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,320
My point is, my non-hateful point, Justin, is this.

495
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,640
I'm not worried about the person who gets on Yahoo Answers

496
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
to learn how to optimize and streamline their jerking

497
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
and their smirking, which is what I call vaping now.

498
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm not worried about that person.

499
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,320
I'm worried about the person who does both for the first time

500
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,800
and is like, yeah, this seems about right.

501
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,400
And then they are lazy about it

502
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,600
and they don't hone their craft.

503
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
This person has a curious mind, a hungry mind.

504
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,520
And that's exactly the kind of person that I want

505
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
attending my new program at Harvard.

506
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,440
Welcome to the club, Steven.

507
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
And by club, I mean the school club.

508
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,360
It's just a school.

509
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,040
They said it's called vape and bait.

510
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
It's, yeah.

511
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,200
Tyra went to Yale Business School,

512
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,560
took some business classes there.

513
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,400
Yeah, and that's exactly why I've decided to follow her

514
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
into the fucking fungible battlefield.

515
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,400
My sister and her husband are a few years younger

516
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
than my wife and I.

517
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,480
We're all in our 20s.

518
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,200
Whenever we're together, they complain about how poor they are

519
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
at one point or another.

520
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,120
In this neck of the woods, it's called poor-mouthing.

521
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
Is that an expression that she's used there?

522
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,360
Is that really a thing?

523
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:43,860
Yeah.

524
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,960
Sydney's like, Sydney's grandparents used to say it.

525
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,840
She's told me.

526
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,360
It's just like saying you're poor when you're not?

527
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,200
Just saying you're poor.

528
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,040
Like just talking about being poor.

529
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,240
Like poor-mouthing.

530
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,200
Anyway, at the same time, I see them making expensive purchases.

531
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,000
A huge telescope to look at the blood moon eclipse.

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
An air rifle with the same caliber as a 22 rifle.

533
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm gonna, tonight's the night, baby.

534
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,920
We're, tonight's the night, baby, we're gonna kill the moon.

535
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,400
Wait, no, wait.

536
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
Now line up the shot.

537
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
Tell me where to aim.

538
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,440
A huge telescope to look at the blood moon eclipse.

539
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,680
An air rifle with the same caliber as a 22 rifle.

540
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,240
Silver bullets.

541
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,280
Some shackles.

542
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,400
Wait a minute.

543
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
These people are werewolf hunters.

544
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,040
But I know for a fact they make a lot more money.

545
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,440
No, you skipped an important part of the puzzle.

546
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:29,920
Okay.

547
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,720
Another gift that they got.

548
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,840
The air rifle and they got us really nice gifts for our new baby.

549
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,560
But I know for a fact they make a lot more money than we do

550
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,120
and don't have any right to complain to us.

551
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,520
How do I get them to stop claiming they're poor

552
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
when I know they're not?

553
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
That's from actually poor in Atchison, Kansas.

554
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,840
Yeah, I mean, I feel like it's just sort of a good rule of thumb

555
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
to pretend in social situations with family and friends

556
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,920
like money just does not exist.

557
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,440
Yeah, I feel like that was the, like the thing that

558
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,720
I was kind of raised like,

559
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
don't ask someone how much money they make.

560
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
Don't talk about like how much money you have.

561
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,640
Do you remember when we used to ask mom and dad like,

562
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
are we poor?

563
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,680
Because they didn't like buy us stuff.

564
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,880
Like our like spoiled friends would get their parents

565
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,760
would buy them stuff.

566
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,680
And mom and dad would always like dodge the question.

567
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,920
I'd be like, oh shit, I don't know if we're poor or not.

568
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,880
And now looking back, I see like, of course we weren't poor.

569
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,480
We just weren't fucking spoiled.

570
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Like they didn't just buy us shit constantly.

571
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,120
I worked at one of the many jobs I have worked.

572
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,640
Like a dude on like his first day looked me in the face

573
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,560
and said, how much do you get paid here?

574
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,320
And it was like, oh, go fuck yourself.

575
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,000
Like, I don't want to tell you at all.

576
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,880
Like what possible good could come from me discussing

577
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,320
how much money I make.

578
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,800
I just say, I just tell people what tax bracket I'm in.

579
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,720
Three.

580
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,480
Three, I'm in the third one.

581
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm in the third one.

582
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Which one are you?

583
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
Oh, I'm in blue.

584
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
I really don't think there's like, okay.

585
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
The problem with engaging with this issue for you

586
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
question asker is like, you cannot,

587
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,720
if you try to challenge them on like the telescope

588
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,160
or the rifle, you're opening up a discussion

589
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,040
that you severely do not want to have.

590
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,280
Like the first time you challenge like,

591
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,560
maybe you aren't poor.

592
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,440
Like that is going to be the rest of your afternoon.

593
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,920
Yeah, sure.

594
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,840
I needed that telescope for my work.

595
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
Well, and also what this is, is like-

596
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,760
As a scientist.

597
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,640
As a moon hunter.

598
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,360
This is also like a matter of like everybody's,

599
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
it's all relative, right?

600
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,040
So like, maybe they are poor

601
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,440
because they're spending their disposable income

602
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,200
on stuff like telescopes and rifles and shit.

603
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,160
I've got all my money.

604
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,480
I've got my money in telescope futures.

605
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,680
But like, and so like, if you sit there and go,

606
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,120
like you're not poor, they're like, yeah.

607
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,880
Like we can't afford to like fly to Hawaii

608
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,560
and be like, okay, well that doesn't mean you're poor.

609
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,480
But to them, maybe it does.

610
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,720
Yeah, sure.

611
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,440
And so it's such a relative term that trying to argue

612
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,000
with someone whether they are poor or not

613
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,280
is like trying to argue with someone

614
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,640
whether they're happy or not.

615
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:08,880
Yeah.

616
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,440
You know what I mean?

617
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
Maybe they're so egregiously bad with money

618
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,160
that they do not understand the direct correlation

619
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,040
between buying telescopes and being poor.

620
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,360
Like they-

621
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
I've gone over the finances a thousand times.

622
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,480
What is this here where 20% of your income

623
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,760
is going to telescopes?

624
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,680
Oh, but that's like, that's not-

625
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,120
That is non-negotiable.

626
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,080
That's in the telescope.

627
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,840
See, we budgeted for telescopes.

628
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,880
Yeah, we actually underspent on telescopes

629
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,920
if you can believe that.

630
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,120
Yeah, we saved it.

631
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,280
Every week they get an email from Mint

632
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,160
or some other financial planner just like,

633
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,720
what the fuck are you guys doing?

634
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,920
Credit with the teller that you have like a hoarding.

635
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,360
It's a weird telescope hoarding.

636
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
Hey, just a quick update.

637
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,120
You spent a little bit more than you did last month

638
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
on going out to eat.

639
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,040
And also stop buying so many fucking telescopes.

640
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,920
But you say that now.

641
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,520
But when this sister alerts you to the fact

642
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
that there's an asteroid heading to Earth

643
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,120
and they reveal that they spent all of their money

644
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,520
on an escape pod, you're gonna be happy.

645
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,000
They're poor.

646
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,360
An escape pod from Earth made of telescopes.

647
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,880
This is not airtight.

648
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,800
It has no propulsion.

649
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,760
There's no propulsion system and we're all gonna die.

650
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,320
But we're broke.

651
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,840
But we're broke, so whatever.

652
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah, we died penniless.

653
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,840
It's good timing.

654
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,600
Justin, Travis, how much money do you guys have?

655
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:26,800
Right now?

656
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,600
On me right now?

657
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah, like how are you doing financially?

658
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
I have 40 Canadian dollars that for the life of me,

659
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,480
I cannot fucking understand.

660
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,000
Bro, I was cleaning out my underwear drawer

661
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
because I bought a new chest of drawers.

662
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,240
So you know how Chiboy's doing.

663
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,800
You know that new Drake song?

664
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
I check out my new chest of drawers.

665
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
What if Drake only wrote songs that sort of obfuscated

666
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,440
how he's doing financially?

667
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:59,600
Like started from the bottom and now I'm somewhere.

668
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,160
He just writes a song called Comfortable Lifestyle.

669
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,120
It started from the bottom.

670
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,640
I'm not on the bottom anymore.

671
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,720
I got, you know what?

672
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,360
Fuck it.

673
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,800
The song is started from the bottom.

674
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,440
Now we're here.

675
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,120
That could mean anything.

676
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,120
I preferred his follow up song.

677
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,480
And now I'm there.

678
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,120
And I'm there.

679
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,760
And I'm there.

680
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,480
And you're there.

681
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,640
Maybe a little bit higher.

682
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
Maybe a little bit lower.

683
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,640
It's hard to say.

684
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,200
It's hard to say.

685
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,920
Any given day, cash flow problems.

686
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,240
We all have cash flow problems.

687
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,480
And he's got that one that's like 1-800 hotline bling.

688
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,160
And that sounds all about how

689
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,840
now he's a little bit lower than he was last week

690
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,760
because he bought so many fucking telescopes.

691
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,240
He loves them because he uses them to look back into Canada.

692
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
He misses it so much, but he can't go back.

693
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,280
And he wanted to do that thing.

694
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,520
He wanted to point two telescopes at each other

695
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,160
and look down one telescope into the other telescope

696
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,360
to see if like you can see.

697
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,520
To see what's going on in the universe.

698
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,720
How telescopes work.

699
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,400
My sister and her husband, Drake, keep buying telescopes

700
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,680
and complain about how poor they are.

701
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,440
Should we go to the money zone

702
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,520
so we can get some telescope scratch?

703
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,480
Yeah, absolutely.

704
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:16,640
I could just turn these scopes.

705
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
I don't know why we're so concerned about money

706
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,480
because we're all about to be trillionaires.

707
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,520
We're all about to be chameleonaires

708
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,560
because we've learned how to work that hallway

709
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,840
like it is a runway.

710
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
We want to advertise our new beautainment business

711
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
with a new website.

712
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
Where can I turn for something like that?

713
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,280
I don't know anything about anything.

714
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm an idiot.

715
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
Yeah, you are a big dumb animal.

716
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,920
But I'd recommend going to Squarespace.

717
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,720
Squarespace, you know them.

718
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,400
You've seen their beautiful commercials.

719
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,320
Those are some aesthetically pleasing commercials.

720
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,960
I don't know if you guys are getting those in your regions.

721
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,400
But I see those commercials and I go,

722
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,480
damn, that's a well-made commercial.

723
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
Anyway, My Brother, My Brother, Me

724
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,680

No jacket required.

734
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,160
Actually, if you want to make a fan site

735
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,440
to the Phil Collins album, No Jacket Required,

736
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
you can do that on squarespace.com.

737
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,880
Yeah, and you also don't need to know

738
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,960
anything about the album No Jacket Required.

739
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,240
Nothing is required of you.

740
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,120
Please send me a link to that site if you make it.

741
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,720
Go to squarespace.com.

742
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Please make a website about No Jacket Required

743
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,560
that is obviously coming from you,

744
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,800
a place of you never having heard the album,

745
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,320
knowing nothing about Phil Collins,

746
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
knowing nothing about his line of music.

747
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,640
But I do need a track-by-track breakdown

748
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,080
with the actual track listings.

749
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,160
I want that as my fucking homepage.

750
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,440
And I want it made in Squarespace.

751
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,320

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,080
Underpants.

755
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,640
Oh, good.

756
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm just, I'm trying to keep it fresh

757
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,680
because we've talked about me undies,

758
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,760
we told you that they're the most amazing underpants

759
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
on the planet. If you want to keep it fresh,

760
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,160
I recommend putting me undies on.

761
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,440
Me undies.

762
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,480
It's like a fucking refrigerator crisper drawer

763
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,520
for your bits.

764
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,560
Me undies.

765
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,520
Ooh, God, no.

766
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
Oh, let's do this, let's do this.

767
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,680
I'll say me undies and then you guys throw in a tagline.

768
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,480
You ready?

769
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,040
Yeah.

770
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,360
Yeah.

771
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,000
Me undies.

772
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,440
Put your dick in the crisper.

773
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,160
Me undies.

774
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,640
They're like hammocks for your ding dong.

775
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,280
There we go.

776
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,240
Well, both of those were for men.

777
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,640
We need-

778
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,440
Okay, let's try one more.

779
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,280
Let's try for women minor products.

780
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,120
Okay, me undies.

781
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,800
Put your vagina in a crisper.

782
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,860
Nice.

783
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,780
If you go to meundies.com slash my brother,

784
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,100
you get 20% off your first order.

785
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,020
And listen, we talk a lot of bullshit on this show,

786
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:54,340
you guys, a lot of bullshit, but it is not bullshit

787
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,340
when I say me undies are easily my favorite thing

788
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,500
I've ever put on my body.

789
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,900
Yesterday, I bought a new chest of drawers.

790
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,620
Did you guys hear the news?

791
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,180
I heard about that Drake song.

792
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,820
You hear about Griffin's chest of drawers by Drake.

793
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,220
Bought a new chest of drawers and I moved all my stuff over

794
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,900
and I very deliberately put my me undies

795
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,380
at the top of my collection just so when I open it up-

796
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,020
Oh, for sure.

797
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,580
I look like fucking, I look like Robert,

798
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,860
that's probably what Robert Downey Jr.

799
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,420
sounded weird.

800
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,900
Me undies sent me a new product.

801
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,540
What the fuck?

802
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,300
Lounge pants made from me undies material.

803
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,420
Suck it.

804
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,380
I forgot to tell you guys.

805
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,340
Suck it.

806
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,300
Why didn't I get that?

807
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,500
They sent me me undies.

808
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,540
Wear my pants.

809
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,220
They sent to Sydney and I and they are amazing.

810
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,260
Imagine if you could just wear underwear to Kroger.

811
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,700
Now you can, thanks me undies.

812
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,100
I got a personal message here.

813
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,220
Did we do the thing?

814
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,740
Go to meundies.com slash my brother,

815
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,660
get 20% off your first order if you don't love them.

816
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,500
Your first pair is gonna be free, but you're gonna love them.

817
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,700
So shut up.

818
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
I got a message, I got a personal message here.

819
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:03,300
Is it the one for Jackson Cusack?

820
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,060
Yeah, for the Jack sack.

821
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:08,100
Is it the one from Jason Yu or is it a different one?

822
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,820
Yeah, from the Jayce Yu for the Jack sack.

823
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,580
We often get personal messages that have in jokes in them

824
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,020
between the two people.

825
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
I think this one sets the record for like

826
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,820
highest number of in jokes.

827
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,060
This is fucking, this is thought.

828
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,940
Justin read it.

829
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,180
This is thought spaghetti is what this is.

830
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,780
You're today's soft rock.

831
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,020
The Ewok wizard on my skateboard.

832
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,780
The Spider-Man on my Canada day.

833
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,300
Don't let the coke take your blue steel and sex appeal.

834
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,460
Vivi will always be there with polar bears, fishnets,

835
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,940
faux afterwards and fire.

836
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,340
Never stop goofing.

837
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,540
Keep it going.

838
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,420
Now what I really hope is that Jackson listened to that

839
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,780
and was like, what the fuck are you talking about?

840
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,980
Are you having aphasia?

841
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,780
Like that doesn't.

842
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,420
Can I do another one?

843
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,180
That's like real, like Jack sack's gonna get some like

844
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,740
like actual information out of.

845
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,220
Yes.

846
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,860
Okay.

847
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,660
Hey Jack sack.

848
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,860
It's your boy Jason Yu.

849
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,380
Thanks for coming with me on that trip to Boulder,

850
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,260
Colorado three weekends ago.

851
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,700
I had a really good time and I agree with everything

852
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,180
that you said about patriotism.

853
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,940
Thanks for vibing and keeping it tight.

854
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,300
Thanks for vibing and keeping it tight.

855
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,220
If you need me, I'll hit me on my Moby.

856
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,940
And also-

857
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,020
If you need me, I'll be hanging out with the Moby.

858
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,540
And also I love you.

859
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,420
I got a message.

860
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,260
You're a good friend, Jack sack.

861
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,740
From your boy, Jason Yu.

862
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,860
A message for Lauren from Seamus says,

863
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,180
hi banana bread, happy anniversary.

864
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,700
That was very enthusiastic.

865
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,180
Let me try.

866
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,540
Hi banana bread.

867
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,060
Hi banana bread.

868
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,420
Hola banana bread.

869
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,780
Happy anniversary and birthday to my favorite person

870
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,340
in the world.

871
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,620
I can't wait to fly cross country with you to Vancouver

872
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,380
to see MBM live.

873
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,820
Holy shit.

874
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,980
That was in August.

875
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,100
That was two calendar months ago.

876
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:08,980
I'm so sorry.

877
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,180
You did wait, in fact, to do that.

878
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:12,900
You're the best.

879
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,380
People, we've warned you before.

880
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,460
Stop, like don't even reference who the president is.

881
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,660
I hope you're getting this at a time

882
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,420
and we're both still alive.

883
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,540
Well, good times or not are had by some or all.

884
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,500
Can you believe that did or didn't happen together

885
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,180
for not forever?

886
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,300
I'm glad I'm glad we were allowed to commune

887
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:43,540
for one hour under the laws of President Bebeborp,

888
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,860
the robot that controls humanity.

889
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,380
You're the best and I love you.

890
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,660
P.S. Vancouver is dripping with Tim Hortons locations,

891
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,700
so you will not go wanting for a cooler.

892
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,780
Man, that last day we were in Vancouver,

893
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,780
Justin, you had to leave super early in the morning.

894
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,300
But Travis and Teresa and I tried to get in

895
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,980
on this fancy restaurant to get like a fancy brunch.

896
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,340
They like fancy Belgian waffles

897
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,300
and I was very excited about it.

898
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
It's called Medina, Vancouverites.

899
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,740
I'm sure you've been there and you love it.

900
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,660
And it's downpouring and there's such a long line

901
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,780
and we were so miserable.

902
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,300
And we're like, fuck it, turn the corner.

903
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,340
Tim Hortons right there caught us up in its loving arms.

904
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,340
I ate it and I had the strength of 10 men all day.

905
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,440
All day.

906
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm Dave Holmes.

907
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,200
And if you've been missing my show, International Waters,

908
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,720
then you've been missing this.

909
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,720
If there's one thing I know about owls,

910
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,080
they are wise, two things.

911
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,880
They are wise, they love nightclubs.

912
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,120
They wear tiny graduation motorboards

913
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,800
and they love nightclubs.

914
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,040
They also do the best double takes of all birds of prey.

915
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,200
And if you slow it down, they actually go,

916
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,000
get it out, get it out.

917
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
International Waters, a panel show

918
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,080
where US and UK comedians battle

919
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,760
for pop culture supremacy.

How about a Yahoo?

922
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,680
You know you want this shit.

923
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,960
Yeah, OK, fine.

924
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,480
This Yahoo was sent in by Level 9000 Yajra Drew

925
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,600
at Drew Davenport.

926
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,320
Thank you, Drew.

927
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,440
It's by Yajra Answers user Lele, who asks,

928
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,040
how did you learn how to beatbox?

929
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,320
I'm really trying to learn the basic sounds,

930
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,720
but the only thing I can't do is the inward snare.

931
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,520
Well, I don't think I'm doing it right.

932
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,560
At least, what are some websites or videos to watch?

933
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,320
Justin, Travis, I put the question to you

934
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,120
because I'll tell you, Beauty Taynors,

935
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,800
there is a performance element to it.

936
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,480
I don't think anyone should do the inward snare.

937
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,080
Travis!

938
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,360
Inward.

939
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,120
Oh, God.

940
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:52,760
I don't even know what that sound is.

941
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,800
Justin does this fun thing whenever he's on set with Biz

942
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,840
where he just eats spaghetti.

943
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,920
And while he has that spaghetti in there,

944
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,360
while he's eating that olive garden to go,

945
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,400
he does it with the pasta in and around his mouth.

946
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,280
It's really fucking incredible.

947
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,400
I just made that sound and it made the side of my tongue buzz.

948
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,360
Really weird.

949
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,320
Yeah, that's really weird.

950
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,840
I can't unfeel it.

951
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,080
Yeah, that's music, baby.

952
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,240
That's the music leaving your body.

953
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,920
That's your tongue orgasming with the pleasure of creating.

954
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
How does anyone learn how to beatbox?

955
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,360
Are there beatboxing schools?

956
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,280
Are there beatboxing dojos?

957
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,600
If it's anything, it's a dojo, yes.

958
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm pretty sure they just sneeze over and over again

959
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,120
and think, well, that sounds good.

960
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,920
I tried to do that one.

961
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,440
Wait, do that again, Sneezy Steve.

962
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,640
Do that again, sneeze.

963
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,360
Sneeze wouldn't be an expression creative name.

964
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,000
Please, I told you, my beatbox name is Puss Sneeze.

965
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,880
I've told you guys so many times.

966
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,920
Shut up, Drake.

967
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,560
Puss Sneeze?

968
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:52,920
Puss Sneeze.

969
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,960
There's an apostrophe.

970
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,480
It's like a P'Zone, I think.

971
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,280
Yeah, I think this is probably one of many things

972
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,400
you can learn to do on YouTube.

973
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,440
Things I learned on YouTube.

974
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,840
I fixed my garbage disposal the other day.

975
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,680
Just got out the- While learning to beatbox?

976
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

977
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,160
I had them going on two different devices.

978
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,800
I was like fixing up this hole in the sink.

979
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,040
I guarantee with the sheer amount of shit

980
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,720
that's on YouTube, you could Google,

981
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,560
teach me how to both beatbox

982
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,040
and fix my garbage disposal at the same time

983
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,880
and you would get like 10 hits.

984
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,120
Yeah, from like Expert Village.

985
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,640
Hi, my name is Phillip.

986
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,840
Hi, this is Phillip from Expert Village.

987
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,680
Watch me do.

988
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,400
And we're done.

989
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,720
Now, Griffin, it sounds like you were doing

990
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,640
a combination of beatboxing and scatting.

991
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Which one of- Hey, guys, which one of the three

992
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,480
of us do you think is the best beatboxer?

993
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,680
Probably me.

994
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,280
I think it's Justin, hands down.

995
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,920
I just imagined in my head when I said that.

996
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,440
When I just said that, I imagined in my head

997
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,920
the image of a YouTube, sorry, YouTube clip.

998
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,360
Have you been to JawTube?

999
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,520
Have you been to JawTube yet?

1000
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,040
No, the image of a YouTube clip began when I said that.

1001
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,480
Like that is the beginning of this slam dunk bit.

1002
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,840
Which one of us is the best beatboxer?

1003
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,440
That is the question that I posed to you.

1004
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,680
Well, I think Justin.

1005
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,240
I've never heard you beatbox before that I can remember.

1006
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,960
I've never heard any of the three of us beatbox in my life.

1007
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,080
I bet it's you.

1008
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,160
Including and not limited to myself.

1009
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,760
I've never heard myself beatbox.

1010
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,480
So this is largely a theoretical discussion.

1011
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,520
I can do the in like the bass drum hits,

1012
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,280
you know, boom, boom, boom, that kind of thing.

1013
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,680
But that's more like a heavy hand knocking on the door.

1014
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,080
I could do the record scratch.

1015
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,960
But I'd have to warm up first.

1016
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,520
Can I try?

1017
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,360
Yes, drop it.

1018
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,800
I gotta get my lips really, really wet.

1019
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,040
All right, here I go.

1020
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,680
You got it.

1021
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:20,600
Kevin, are you proud of yourself right now?

1022
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,920
Right now we can't even sell ads against this hit bit.

1023
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,200
This is on YouTube.

1024
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,080
On JawTube.

1025
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,520
Hold on.

1026
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,240
Wait, let me try again.

1027
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:33,800
Kevin.

1028
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,960
Wow.

1029
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,840
Kevin, that's funny.

1030
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,320
You just you don't have like a Kevin.

1031
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,720
Hold on.

1032
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,600
I'm still working on it.

1033
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,880
You don't remember me, but we used to work together.

1034
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,240
I never worked in a funeral home.

1035
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,520
There's something I can leave for you, Slick Point.

1036
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,000
Hold on.

1037
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,480
It's coming.

1038
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,560
We're the men in black.

1039
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,160
We have a situation and we need your help.

1040
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,200
And that's the thing I say every time before I beatbox.

1041
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,440
Kevin, are you just watching Men in Black?

1042
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,000
What is that?

1043
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:07,880
Anyway, that's just one of the many routines

1044
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
I picked up on at school.

1045
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,560
Then Griffin, I just got to say that was excellent.

1046
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,520
Yeah, thank you.

1047
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,400
Let me just try one.

1048
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,800
Okay.

1049
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,520
Okay, cool.

1050
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,000
Here we go.

1051
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,120
Hi, I'm the baby brand new just out.

1052
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,840
Gotta love me.

1053
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,400
Come on.

1054
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,680
Gotta love me.

1055
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,280
No, that's just now.

1056
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,640
Justin, I'm the baby brand new just out.

1057
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,360
Gotta love me.

1058
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,000
Come on.

1059
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,720
Gotta love me.

1060
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,320
So that just sounds like the baby dinosaur from Dinosaurs.

1061
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,960
All right.

1062
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,360
That's the lead.

1063
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,720
Okay, now I would like to do one here.

1064
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,360
Yeah, okay.

1065
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,520
But I don't have my computer sound hooked up, Griffin.

1066
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,320
So if you could edit in some beatboxing here, that would be great.

1067
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,240
Yeah, I'm not going to remember to do that.

1068
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,120
Okay, we'll leave a moment of silence here for you to edit it in.

1069
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,920
And then let's leave an extra moment of silence just for this episode.

1070
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,640
Just like in remembrance of it because it died.

1071
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,240
The moment of silence begins now.

1072
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,520
Okay, because it died.

1073
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,840
No, you gotta be silent.

1074
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,080
Okay.

1075
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:20,840
In the arms of the angel, fly away from me.

1076
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,440
Oh, I spit on my pop filter.

1077
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,800
My dad loves playing the piano.

1078
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,280
It's his absolute favorite thing to do and he plays all the time.

1079
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,560
Problem is he's so god awful at it.

1080
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,520
He's been playing.

1081
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,560
Please fix my bad piano dad, brothers.

1082
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,600
See, that's all you need to say.

1083
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,920
Give him new piano hands.

1084
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,600
Please, sweet brothers, give my pop a new piano hands.

1085
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,960
Please fix his bad piano.

1086
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,600
He's got these stupid piano hands.

1087
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,360
He needs smart piano hands.

1088
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,240
Bionic dad.

1089
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,400
He's been playing ever since I can remember and has never improved.

1090
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,600
My mother agrees.

1091
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,760
We would say something, but my dad is really sensitive.

1092
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,840
Even asking if he could stop playing because I'm trying to take a nap hurts his feelings.

1093
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,720
What the fuck?

1094
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:09,880
How can I find a way to get my dad to start playing less often or hint

1095
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,480
at this without hurting his feelings?

1096
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,360
I'm moving on about three years and I don't know if I can last that long.

1097
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,720
Oh my god.

1098
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,080
Billy Joel Jr.

1099
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,240
No.

1100
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,120
No, that's from Bitter Daughter in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.

1101
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,600
That's an amazing question.

1102
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,080
I love the combination of an overly sensitive and really bad at piano dad.

1103
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,360
Hey dad, you're doing a great job in there, but it's four in the morning.

1105
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,520
Do you think you could maybe keep it down a little bit?

1106
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,880
Keep on rocking in the free world.

1107
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:42,920
Thank you.

1108
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,440
Thank you.

1109
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:57,560
Now kids gather around the old key box because daddy's got a special surprise.

1110
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,920
It's Canon MD.

1111
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,280
I just figured out how to do Canon MD.

1112
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:02,680
Here it goes.

1113
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,760
Squinky dink dink dink dink dink.

1114
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,080
Squinkly dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky dinky.

1115
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,600
Hey dad, did you hire the DJ for my Quinceanera?

1116
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,200
Oh, no need darlin'.

1117
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:23,320
I'm gonna play all the hits today on my old finger guitar here.

1118
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,680
Sing along if you know this one.

1119
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,800
Play us the song.

1120
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,920
You're the piano dad.

1121
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,240
Don't you know anything more modern?

1122
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,760
Penguins I can do cheerleader. Do you kids like cheerleader?

1123
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
This is

1124
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,560
Basically you're being held as an emotional hostage

1125
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:55,520
And you really we I know I've said this before your dad is set up quite the honeypot for you here an emotional

1126
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,120
Emotional honeypot you do need to pack your bags and move away you definitely that's the only solution for you

1127
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,800
Your dad has constructed the perfect trap because P playing piano isn't I think it's even like

1128
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:15,040
There's something implicit when you're playing guitar for somebody that is an act of courage because while you're playing guitar

1129
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,960
You're almost certainly going to be staring the person dead in the face

1130
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,800
That is like a cruel thing you're doing to the person because it forces them to react to your show

1131
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,180
Piano I think there's something implicit that where if people don't like it

1132
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,580
You don't see it until you turn around. Yeah, sure more of a betrayal

1133
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,940
But they were always like almost by definition laughing behind your back

1134
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:44,140
I think you know it's it's pretty late in the year now, and I think something we may have all forgotten

1135
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:51,580
Is that it's 20 griff teen oh my god? It's been six months since we've said those words and here's the plan

1136
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:56,460
One day while your dad's playing piano you're going to say you know it sounds a lot of tune

1137
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,540
And he's gonna go what really there's like yeah, I I don't know it's a sound that we need to get a piano tuner in

1138
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,540
Here, but here's the thing you and the piano tuner in cahoots the piano tuner comes in and says oh, yeah

1139
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,420
This is like dangerously worn wire if you keep playing this it could

1140
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,940
Explode or whatever the equivalent of a piano breaking now pianos can explode definitely sure to know because they're under a lot of high

1141
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,220
Tension tune them too tight it tears of tears

1142
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:27,380
And he says I can't tune this and I also can't allow you to keep playing it my creed as a piano tuner

1143
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,980
Doesn't allow me to leave this dangerous object here. We're going to have to take it away problem

1144
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,620
Problem is as soon as he says that dr. Strings pops in it's like I got it. Oh god damn it dr. Strings not again

1145
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:45,980
Dr.. Strings, I'm trying to hold on dr. Strings. Can you come over here? Yeah sure what's this? What's crack-a-lacking dr. Strings listen?

1146
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,820
Can you fucking can you fucking lock it down for a fucking second dr. Strings and trying to grift my dad?

1147
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:56,860
I'd love to but you know my jam. I follow around other piano tuners and try to give a better rate

1148
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,140
dr. Strings needs to get his be quiet I

1149
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,020
Oh, it's the old get rid of the piano from the emotionally sensitive dad scam. I'm into it

1150
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,740
$30 into my help is yours

1151
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:14,540
I can't do anything about that their key box, but I can do something about that daddy

1152
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,960
What are you saying? Dr. Strings? No, just watch me go dr.

1153
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,980
She's huge looking the life out of my father. I'm tuning him. No, you're killing him. Please. You're killing you stop

1154
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,980
I'm your daddy now

1155
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,700
Please

1156
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,780
Let you out of that lamp

1157
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:42,260
Oh fuck doctors who's gonna take this body away. Hey

1158
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,900
Dr. Barney, you got a body here. Oh

1159
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,300
the old bad

1160
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:57,180
Piano sensitive dad called dr. Strings. I get it. I'm there with you another body. Dr. Strings someday. I'm gonna get here before you

1161
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,180
Hey

1162
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:05,300
You need the piano tune I'm trying to pick up some extra cash

1163
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,740
That was terrifying

1164
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:17,220
Dr. Strings. I really enjoyed the doctor strings character and killed that guy's dad. Yeah

1165
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,740
Yeah, that was rough

1166
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:25,340
That was a bad break for dr. Strings. Um, here's another guy next no read the next

1167
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,700
I really like the next one and I want Justin to react to it

1168
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,060
Okay

1169
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:36,180
I just knocked my roommate's toothbrushes off the sink and into what can only be described as a hellish hellish garbage. That's a good priorities

1170
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,180
Oh my god. No, I have to email the brothers

1171
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,580
What can I do no toothbrush cover thing no nothing just

1172
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:48,900
Virgin bristles and to make it work. Does anybody use toothbrush covers? Is that a thing? No god

1173
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,980
I'm gonna put a little helmet on him

1174
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,380
It seems like that would be a breeding ground for bacteria. Anyway, yeah

1175
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:02,140
Absolutely make it worse moments before I ran the vacuum cleaner over his phone charger and basically shredded that thing like sharp cheddar

1176
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,780
Now I find myself in a quandary do I come clean on either of these misdemeanors?

1177
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,900
The charger is probably necessary to reimburse or some shit. But how about the toothbrush?

1178
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,940
SOS that's from toothbrushless in

1179
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,220
Tejas um

1180
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,520
You guys remember that season or I think it was real world

1181
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,300
Where somebody was acting a fool and so they took that person's toothbrush and they scrubbed the toilet with it

1182
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,300
And it's like the only time I've ever seen in a reality show like a producer came in was that hey straight up

1183
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,940
You can't use that toothbrush because it got it got pretty it got kind of gnarly

1184
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,740
Can you believe that that actually I don't normally intercede here in today's in today's reality show market

1185
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,660
They would just like film it like yeah, let's see it. Yeah, let's see

1186
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,340
See him put that poop. Let's see him get like all kinds of disease. I want to see him get poopy mouth

1187
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,620
They probably edit in some funny sound effects like well, it's time to brush my teeth

1188
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,320
Yeah, like a heart. Ah, here's what you do. This is a really easy one. Okay

1189
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:11,680
Right now you have a problem because you have done two bad things. That's not good. That's not great

1190
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,680
Here's one bad things an accident to seems definitely a malicious intent

1191
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:22,600
Here's what you need to do. You need to get into your house and mess up everything. You can't overturn the tables up in the middle

1192
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,320
Take the flowers out of the pot and throw them on the ground

1193
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:31,520
Blow the piano explode the piano and then do you know his dad and then kill sad and then you know

1194
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,600
What you do you go and you get Marmaduke and you get Marmaduke in the house

1195
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:44,120
So when he shows up, you're just like have your hands in your head like Marmaduke. No stop and you get just all the Duke

1196
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,200
That's all of that. You also just put the toothbrush back and don't tell him. Yeah, you put the toothbrush back wait

1197
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:57,520
Okay, yes some three. Can I just three inconsistencies? There's no inconsistencies with the Marmaduke. No, I've got three off the top of my lid

1198
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:04,400
Okay, got it. Number one. Okay, how did Marmaduke put the toothbrush back?

1199
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,920
I get him knocking it off but for him to put it back that was an insane thing that Travis said that's

1200
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,920
Any sense? Okay, number two, okay

1201
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,360
How he ran the vacuum cleaner

1202
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,400
He thinks these people and I know I know I know I know what he thinks

1203
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,760
But like if the roommate was running the vacuum cleaner and Marmaduke was like, hey, I'll put this cord in there

1204
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,220
And then he just sucked the cord. Okay. I've well now I've got another fucking inconsistency because Marmaduke definitely didn't speak you

1205
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,360
Do you honestly fucking think that if you get home and to find that?

1206
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:46,280
Marmaduke has like up ended your whole existence. You're gonna kill Perot the individual clues. It doesn't make any sense

1207
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:52,800
Justin not right away. It's not right away, but there will it will burn in his brain and two years later

1208
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,860
Like hey, do you remember when Marmaduke was in our apartment and like trash? How did he run the vacuum?

1209
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,200
And I also at some point shouldn't we get separate bedrooms? This seems weird to me. Well, good night

1210
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Number four

1211
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,240
Just wrecking shit wasn't Marmaduke's thing

1212
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,960
He thought he was people and he was like a silly boy and he would like sit on the couch like look at me

1213
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,520
I'm a big silly man. He thought he was people but he wasn't Dennis a fucking menace

1214
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:25,560
He wasn't a Tasmanian devil, you know what it had been better is Beethoven more

1215
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:33,720
Palatable me. I was thinking of Beethoven. You were thinking of Beethoven that whole time. We try again. Okay. Okay. See here's what you do

1216
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,920
Right now your problem is you only have two things that are messed up. Uh-huh. Two things. It's intentional

1217
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:47,640
Yeah, two things. It's intentional. But what you're gonna need to do is ruin everything in your house, right like

1218
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,780
Flip your TV over. Oh, and then go get Beethoven

1219
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
I've been poached

1220
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,880
Griffin edited out the first one and now there's just this one and my movement has it's gone

1221
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,580
I've been choked poached

1222
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
Travis is gonna register that

1223
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,900
Tomorrow on the max foot store you're gonna have and then you get Beethoven t-shirts

1224
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,860
It's gonna have Travis's face coming out of it. Try to a bitch on the front page of the Financial Times now Travis

1225
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:26,600
How did you make your billions? Well, it was my uh-oh Beethoven. What'd you do shirts?

1226
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:33,080
So hold on wait, you made license shirts based on the dog movie franchise Beethoven and they didn't know nobody came for it

1227
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,760
I don't know

1228
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:41,520
It was weird now that I've seen rumors online that your brother Justin was a these rumors are false and libelous and scandalous

1229
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,520
I no longer speak to my brother

1230
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,840
We do still do the show you do the show yes, but this is we just never directly address each other

1231
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,840
It's right. It's the two of us talking to Griffin. That's you know, it's funny

1232
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:58,080
If you look back over all the episodes Justin and Travis never actually speak to each other. It's true draft

1233
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Wait, oh shit

1234
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,520
Broke let's it in the in let's end the program. God nothing to make me happier than that. I'm feeling good

1235
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,880
I'm sitting the last like episode that the three of us did we were so fucking down in the dumps tired

1236
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,440
At the congo from LA pop fest. I this is a 180 degree turn out

1237
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,400
Thank you all for being patient with us while we fucking soaked in the soaking

1238
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,960
Rewarded your patience with that effort with a best of it's just like it was that weekend was fucking insane

1239
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,720
And listen, I've seen a lot of people like tweeting and asking about it

1240
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,840
Like I know the schedule has been off for like the last two months

1241
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,920
Where we've been putting up episodes like Tuesday morning and late Monday night and all that shit, but like we're getting it

1242
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,280
It's getting it back together. No. Yeah, it's not gonna be a regular thing

1243
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,520
It just is fully August and September were crazy because I feel the same way that like

1244
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,760
It's really important to me that podcasts be there like what I'm expecting them, right?

1245
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,060
Like I've got my week sort of like laid out for for how far each podcast has to carry me

1246
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,000
And I know that's frustrating when a podcast you like doesn't show up when you expect it to so we are

1247
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,920
