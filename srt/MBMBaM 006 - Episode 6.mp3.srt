00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown away with me.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown away with me. If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown away with me.

3
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to get an octopus tattoo. Really, really bad. I have for a while. Where's the sexiest place I could get an octopus tattoo on my body? Thanks guys. XsoHuxo.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think that's hugs and kisses.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay, got it.

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you, Shawna.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Shawna.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you for that.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Octopus tattoo.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I've been thinking about this since I saw the question. Is there a sexy place to get a tattoo?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
An octopus tattoo, yes. If you get it on your throbbing, glistening ink sac.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you have an ink sac.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you have an ink sac, get it right on there. Or maybe upon one of your tendrils. Other than that.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I actually know somebody who has an octopus tattoo. And she has it on her ribs. It's very tasteful. I would say sexy.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Really?

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay, ribs.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Like right on the ribs.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Adam from Gmail writes in, my girlfriend sleeps a lot. She even fell asleep last night during Iron Man 2 when he was smashing atoms.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I haven't seen Iron Man 2. Does that happen?

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Should she see a doctor?

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Well, kind of.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Should she see a doctor? No. She should get down with naps.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I would say naps are a good course of action. I wouldn't blame her for falling asleep during some parts of Iron Man 2. Namely the parts where Iron Man wasn't Iron Man-ing.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This Iron Man-ing around is scarlet and gold.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
To be fair, one of us in this podcast fell asleep during Jurassic Park. So it's easy to fall asleep in a movie.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I fell asleep during Lord of the Rings. It's possible to fall asleep in a movie, and I do not judge her at all.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But that movie was five hours long. If you saw it in theaters, odds were that it was going to run past your bedtime.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That is true.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Does that make sense?

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you see it after 4 p.m., then you're bound to just hit the hay in the midst.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That makes sense.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I understand. That's a bummer when your significant other just sleeps like a koala bear. Because you want to hang out with her.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She takes those short, sweet koala naps.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And you have to find clever ways of waking her up without her getting mad at you. Like setting off the smoke alarm.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Or doing the laundry too loud.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Doing the laundry too loud. Or just singing...

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's that song? I would always just get in the shower. It's called Sister Christian, guys. Come on.

40
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Get in the shower and just sing Motorhead.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Motorhead! Lambie! Iron Maiden!

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yahoo Answers user Julie A. asks, where can I find a free dog?

43
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Everywhere!

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Everywhere!

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There are wild dogs all over the place.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Every dog is free if you're quick enough.

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's no additional information, but I don't think she's looking for a pound puppy.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't think she's interested in the immunization fees and stuff.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I just think she wants a dog on the free. She wants a complimentary puppy.

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Which is great, because she sounds like she's going to be a really responsible owner.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Have you tried some of the finest hotels? Because often they'll have a complimentary puppy.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
An interim puppy that you can keep for a surcharge.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I heard that if you take the puppy with you, they just bill that straight to your bill.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right off the credit card. That's why you have to give a credit card these days.

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For puppy fees.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But only Visa. Mastercard doesn't have the puppy offer.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's what I heard.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jake from Kentucky emailed us.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Does he ask? He does.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hi guys, so I have a problem I was hoping you could help me with.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I really like this girl a lot, but sadly she's crazy about my best friend.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He doesn't like her back. He likes her best friend.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So I really want to ask this girl out, but I know she doesn't like me.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
She likes my best friend. So should I ask her out now?

65
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Or wait it out and hope she gets over my friend?

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thanks for the help. Jake from Kentucky.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Did that make sense to you?

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I have a suggestion, Jake. Why don't you get the transfer the fuck out of Sweet Valley High?

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I was trying to make that Sweet Valley High joke.

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Were you?

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I couldn't come up with the wording.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If she's all that, and any number of Freddie Prinze Jr. movies have taught me anything,

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you have to start fake dating her best friend so that she gets jealous, as does your best friend.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Then either everything will come out in the wash, or you'll fall in love with her best friend.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think that's how it happens. The best friend falling in love, and also Melissa Joan Hart is there.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Can someone walk me through this timeline again? I don't feel like I'm groping.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is up. Imagine four people. Imagine a square, only this square is not a straight square.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's crisscrossed in the middle. Does that make sense?

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's in love with her, but she loves him, even though he's in love with her, and she is a rump.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is from Jay Guile's band. This is that classic song Love Stinks.

81
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes. Make the best friend lose her glasses, maybe get a haircut, and a sexy now cut, a hip cut.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Jake, let me boil your question down for you.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What you're asking is, should I ask out a girl that doesn't like me?

84
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No. I'm just going to go ahead and say no.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Find someone else, Jake.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go with the robot.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Go with the robot. Or, you know what? Go gay until everyone's so confused, and get really into your best friend.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Then once everyone's sufficiently confused, pull the old switcheroo.

89
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Invite a couple more players into this little dance.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is going to be more confusing. Morgan Jacobson writes from Gmail.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Friend of the show.

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Friend of the show, Morgan Jacobson.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It says, I'm a 17-year-old guy who really likes this girl. Good start.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
She agreed to go out on a date with me, but I don't think she is at all that interested in me.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What is a good way to make a really good impression on our first date?

96
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Morgan, a fine question.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know that she's not interested in it. I think you might just be a little too shy.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You haven't let your freak flag fly.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just like Griffin said.

100
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Just like I said. Maybe not your freak flag, but you know what I'm saying.

101
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think it's that she doesn't know you.

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I think you've just got to be a proper gentleman. I think that's the best way to make a good impression.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If I've learned anything from my wonderful brother, Justin McElroy, and my wonderful sister-in-law,

104
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,000
it is to ask her questions, be interested in her, don't talk about yourself, be interested in what she has to say.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It took me a long time to learn that, because I love me.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But she wants to talk about herself as much as you want to talk about yourself.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So ask her questions about her.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is a great, great point.

109
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Also, I think you've got to go naked day one.

110
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Just saying.

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's how you get her interested in you, by being interested.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You spring the trap!

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Take her out to a nice dinner, and you sit down at Applebee's, and you're sitting down, and you order your drinks,

114
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and then you take a bowie knife out of a sheath that you have attached to your belt that you had hidden underneath your polo,

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and you just pull it out, and you sit it down on the table, and don't address it.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right? That's kind of mysterious.

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I love it.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or halfway through the date, like you're at a movie, and she's sitting on your right,

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you put an eye patch on your left eye, very discreetly, and just make sure she doesn't notice.

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you see what I'm going for?

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do you see what I'm working up to?

123
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You could stage some kind of epic fight with like a dragon or something.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I think that works.

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Well, dragons aren't real, but you could pay a person to pretend to mug you, and then you fight them.

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, I like that.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's got a little something to it.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are all kinds. You've got to get creative.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So, Morgan, our real advice is hidden somewhere in there.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Have a great afternoon.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All said, take her to Cold Stone.

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, go to Cold Stone.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They put the shit in the shit.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yeah, it's right in there.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hold the shit with the shits.

136
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't even worry about it.

137
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Awesome.

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When is the best time to email you guys to ensure my life questions are answered?

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Says William at Gmail.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't compile questions.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What do you guys think?

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What's the best time?

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The best time is any time before Wednesday morning.

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If you want them on the next week's show.

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But really, any time is good because I have no life, and I am constantly checking the email and the Twitter and the forms.

147
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't make it adhere to our schedule.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think if you have an important life question, you've just got to fire it off as soon as it's in your mind, lest you forget it.

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And if it's urgent and you need us to answer right then, say that in the subject line.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Say it's urgent.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We'll get you an answer, and then we'll talk about it on the show.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And I'm glad you brought this up, William.

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
May I call you William?

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You may.

155
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We have been getting so many great questions on FormSpring and Gmail, and we really appreciate it, and it's great.

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But the most rapid response questions you're going to get is Twitter.

157
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you want that, you know, at MBMBAM or hashtag MBMBAM is the best way to go for a question right now,

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
especially because we're looking for more Twitter questions.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So if you've got something you really want answered, hit it up, son.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We've got Tweeter fever, which is a catchphrase I'm trying to get started and perhaps get a parody song written about.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So just tweet right at us, and we'll tweet it back ASAP.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Quotably.

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yahoo Answers user J asks, can I give my pitbull Gatorade?

164
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, it's got the electrolytes that pitbulls crave.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Subquestion, can my pitbull drink Gatorade?

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So this is technically two different questions.

167
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Can you give your pitbull Gatorade?

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yes.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Can my pitbull drink Gatorade?

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Gatorade has a certain drinkability to it, so I don't see why not.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not sure you should give it, nor should your pitbull drink it, though.

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Especially since Gatorade is expensive.

173
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why don't you just give your Gatorade water, Richy Rich?

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Here's the thing, dogs don't sweat, so they don't have to replenish the electrolytes in salt like we do.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's why dogs walk around with their tongues hanging out, because they're getting their excess heat and moisture out that way.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So no, because that's dumb.

177
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're an idiot.

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't give your dog Gatorade.

179
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It turns their tongues red.

180
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Gatorade, it's not called Gatorade anymore.

181
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Obviously this guy didn't get the mem.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What is it called?

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's just called G now.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's just G?

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah, it's just G.

186
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What?

187
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You haven't seen that?

188
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
No.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's just called G now.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Now it's just called G.

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
G is the name of their product.

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, to be fair.

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
They took the whole Gatorade part and they completely subtracted it from the equation.

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Now it's just plain old G.

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I hope that they do that with other drinks, because I would drink Pepsi if it was called P.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Just give me a big bottle of P.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm not touching that one.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to share about this one.

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Travis.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Speaking of P.

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Speaking of P.

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You rascal.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So, Magic Incest.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's just talk about that for a while.

205
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Moving on.

206
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Magic Incest.

207
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yeah, moving on.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's the username here via Gmail.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a great question.

210
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think it's one.

211
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It might be divisive.

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Has the potential to be divisive.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Peeing in the shower, yay or nay.

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Honesty time.

215
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't say anything.

216
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think we all just need to go one, two, three, and then go.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, one, two, three, and then you vote.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
One.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Two.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Two.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Three.

225
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Three.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yay.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No.

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah.

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're a traitor.

231
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So, Travis said no.

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Justin.

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Peeing in the shower.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's gross.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's notps in the world.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,920
I want to throw an addendum in there.

238
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,880
The way our bathrooms set up, I can just open the curtain and the toilet's right there.

239
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,020
So, I will do that from time to time, because the convenience factor is the same.

240
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
You will?

241
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,020
Yeah.

242
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,380
That explains why our magazines are always soiled.

243
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
They're awful.

244
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,080
They're in the worst room.

245
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,560
I've ruined our reader's digests.

247
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,820
So Justin, you're down with it?

248
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,520
Why not?

249
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,020
Cuz it's gross. It's not gross. It's basically like you're peeing on your feet. You're not peeing on your feet, okay

250
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,900
I'm not saying like just start spinning around and urinating wildly on every

251
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,340
Vertical surface in your shower. I'm saying fucking aim for the drain and pee

252
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:17,900
That's a good motivational poster you're lying to yourselves because the two of you are living in sin and

253
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:24,040
You are embarrassed to admit to each other that you might have stepped into one another's urine from time to time

254
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,560
That's all I'm saying you're lying. I want to do

255
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,200
I want to see a poster where a dad puts his hand on his son's shoulder and just says son aim for the drain

256
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,640
We're not stepping in each other we don't take showers together. That's not our style. We're not done with magic incest

257
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,580
We we take separate showers like grown adults

258
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,680
Grown ass men. Grown ass men. I'm gonna say yay. I'll break the tie. Thank you. Thank you

259
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,240
Yeah, I mean this is a drain right there

260
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,680
It's practically a toilet you stand up in to get clean. The shower is a toilet you stand up in to get clean

261
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,880
No matter what, no peeing in the sink. Don't poop in the shower though. That's awful. What do you think in magic incest?

262
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Why do you even do that?

263
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
It takes a while

264
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,800
And it's really great balance unless you have one of those like bars. Okay

265
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,240
We're good on this. You know what I'm talking about. The balance bars. Yeah, we're done

266
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,600
Tim asks via Gmail my brother recently proposed to his girlfriend and she said yes

267
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,240
I am all but certain he's going to ask me to be his best man

268
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,680
And while I'm happy to do so I'm kind of freaked out about the responsibilities

269
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,400
I'll have any general advice you have on this matter would be appreciated also a quick run-through of what those

270
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,720
Responsibilities actually are could be a big help

271
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,300
Everybody knows about the bachelor party in the toast, but there has to be more to it than that Tim Gmail

272
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,120
Tim I'm glad you asked

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:58,440
I had a friend in college. He was a wise wise grad student named Steve Knight

274
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,280
Steve Knight imparted to me this knowledge

275
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:09,440
When you are a best man outside of the responsibilities like the toast in the bachelor party you have but two

276
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
responsibilities the one

277
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,760
Is to give your friend the opportunity to be with a lady the night before do not encourage

278
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,040
No happen the opportunity. I'm just quoting Steve Knight here and

279
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,780
I wholeheartedly disagree with this and duty number two is the day of the wedding

280
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,500
Look at your your brother or friend or what a what have you and say listen man if you want to go

281
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,860
I'll cover for you. Those are your two responsibilities

282
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,260
As a best man you are

283
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,460
Not only a facilitator of shenanigans

284
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,620
vis-a-vis a bachelor party

285
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,180
You are also the final test of

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:01,060
Yes his faithfulness you are you are making sure that he is actually ready to do this

287
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
I am totally down with that Travis

288
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,140
I think that if more best men were like this the divorce rate in this country in this world would be 0%

289
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,900
Justin don't get me wrong. I'm not saying encourage it

290
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:18,860
I'm saying that you're a liar that you're living a lie because you did not offer me the opportunity to be with another lady

291
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,740
But the night before I got married no, but we did sit around with a bunch of dudes in a tiny pool and drink beer

292
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,060
So it's pretty much. You're right. That was awesome

293
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,020
Except when Jason tried to pee on me. Yeah. Yeah, not okay. It's all fun and games

294
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:41,300
Jason you went a little too far. I know we were in a big tub, and it you know things got kooky

295
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,940
Not okay, not okay. What's so either?

296
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,900
You are is to make sure that everything goes well period and either offer them a chance to be with a woman or

297
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,180
in a urine filled baby pool with eight eight dudes

298
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,700
either one of those two and a keg in the middle I

299
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,660
like it

300
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,580
Form spring we're getting some really good accidental transitions form spring asks look

301
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,900
I am gay, and I really like this guy I work with but I just don't know how to get his attention

302
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,740
I've tried wearing provocative shirts and hats, but he just doesn't seem to care

303
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,540
What should I do got it you got to get more provocative with those hats?

304
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,380
I think I think their hats are provocative enough a lot of times. I'll see a hat. I'll be like oh

305
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,340
Interesting, but maybe not provocative

306
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,900
So like a safari hat and then there's a story there, right?

307
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Or show on homes have

308
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,300
Yeah, are you searching for something is it Halloween is that a costume no?

309
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,940
I'm solving mysteries. I like I like you. I

310
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,420
Like you a lot you down the mystery is why aren't we together? Let's solve it. Let's solve it together you and me

311
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,420
Elementary my dear Watson because we haven't gone on a date yet. Oh, I like that

312
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,220
Is that a clue in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?

313
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,660
Is that the game clue in your pocket I

314
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Don't know I mean

315
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,940
This isn't my I love ladies this so this isn't exactly my area of expertise

316
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,140
Maybe you find out if he's gay first. Yeah, that seems like step one

317
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:26,700
When I'm courting a woman I try to make sure that she's down with dudes pretty pretty early in the courting process. Yeah

318
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,780
But if otherwise just more better hats more better hats if he is

319
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,900
If he is gay, then I would say that the same rules apply

320
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,300
You're trying to be more get his attention more

321
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,500
interesting to him

322
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,540
Talk to him dude the same thing applies. Yeah

323
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:53,540
How are his hats how provocative are his shirts? Hey? Hey Steve? That's a nice provocative. How you have to death

324
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,020
I'm a chapeau is that a chapeau

325
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,740
Is that a very late?

326
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:07,780
It is very crisp did anybody did anybody watch army wives last night something like that would be a good sort of acid test

327
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,360
I think

328
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,620
Stephen that is a handsome beret handsome beret Stephen. How about army wives last night?

329
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:21,700
Is that a raspberry beret Prince you like Prince? I do too. How about those ruffled shirts women?

330
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:30,060
Are you saying let's go to this club in the city. Yeah, I know of a club where all the hats are provocative and all the shirts I

331
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,900
Enjoy it you will enjoy it too Steve. I suspect you will enjoy it Steve

332
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,860
I suspect you will enjoy me at if not wait for tomorrow when my hat will be far more provocative than it is at the moment

333
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,620
form spring another one from form spring a

334
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,260
Couple of my long-standing friends have recently decided to be douche bags

335
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:57,580
They've become increasingly hostile passing off as a joke, but rarely letting up when together

336
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,340
Apart they're still great guys, but I can't stand together. Oh, man. What to do

337
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't know what to tell you. I don't I don't think

338
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,140
No, that's not true. I can pick out and some of my friends turn into douche bags. I can think of a few friends

339
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm not gonna name them Jacob dunkel

340
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,740
Oh

341
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,740
No, I'm kidding

342
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,580
I love you Jacob dunkel. I I think you just got to move on. I don't think

343
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,680
If your friends are douche bags, like if they're being social chameleons or whatever

344
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,300
Like they've they've found new friends and and have changed you just gotta that's hard

345
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,660
I I assume you know what this sounds

346
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,140
I don't know if you're in in college or high school

347
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,200
But it sounds high school because that happens a lot in high school like it's a very fickle sort of situation

348
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
You know people ebb and flow

349
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,380
Most guys got us you just got to stick it out if you're in high school

350
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,740
Because those are your the only friends like you've already invested so much time

351
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,300
You might as well just roll with the changes and like oh you guys love evanescence

352
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,300
I do too now because I have to be you to be with you most of the time in a group

353
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,560
There's a de facto not necessarily a leader, but someone who does something and then they start that trend

354
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,480
If you know who that person in your group is talk to them apart and be like listen

355
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,440
You might not realize it because you're in the middle of it

356
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,080
But you guys are douche bags and you need to cut that shit out and I think in this point

357
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,920
Confrontation or walk away are your options or both? Yeah, or or

358
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,920
Unless what unless what if you were to pull the Lord of the Flies

359
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:43,780
The leader kill the leader kill the leader with a big rock kill the leader of the big rock take the conch shell

360
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
How's your conch shell?

361
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Kill him kill someone day one

362
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
Day one kill the leader get his glasses

363
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,920
Take it to the limit. Don't do it at school though because you know the principles

364
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,500
There's a zero tolerance policy on Lord of the Flies takeovers. You will get on the news though

365
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,300
Yeah, we rarely and by rarely I mean never

366
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:15,860
Crossover into the realm of politics. We like to put all of our we have one big umbrella for all of our listeners

367
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,860
It's a safe zone a spin-free zone if you will

368
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,700
But there's a yahoo questions user named stir it up. Oh five that has

369
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
importance political query

370
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,300
That I think we could answer in a fair and balanced way

371
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,060
will

372
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,700
There be a presidential election in 2012

373
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:46,080
Now the the additional information is a bit lengthy so stay stay with me recently the buzz about not having elections in 2012 has gained a

374
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,280
Lot of momentum it seems to stem from several of Obama's initiatives and other legislation being introduced that gives Obama some frightening powers

375
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:03,520
For example cyber legislation gives Obama sole power to shut down the internet presidential term limits repeal of the 22nd amendment in the

376
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,640
Controversial 16,000 armed IRS agents on radio and TV

377
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,760
I have heard several comments about the possibility that we will not have presidential elections in 2012

378
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:21,200
When guests to the various show mentioned the elections and possible turnovers in 2012 several hosts have remarked if we have elections in

379
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:29,360
2012 well your thoughts what other events the legislation could give you concern about whether or not the 2012 elections will be canceled and if

380
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Tried what will the public reaction be?

381
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,600
stir it out

382
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Wow

383
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Well

384
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,160
a

385
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,440
Fair and free democratic elections is the really the foundation of this country of ours

386
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,280
But the experiment called him America now that Obama is a cyber God um

387
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,400
He can pretty much take that out with a wave of his cyber hand so yeah, he's got digital legislation and sole power

388
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah

389
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:05,900
Combine that combine those two together, and it's like yikes. I don't know about if if if President Obama

390
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,720
President Barack

391
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,560
Hussein Obama

392
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,680
Shuts down the internet can we keep doing our show oh?

393
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,840
We can shout yeah, we'll just have to yell really loud, so we'll do like live stage versions. Yes, exclusively

394
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,440
Justin let me ask you something your your wife is a doctor

395
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,560
So I assume you have insight onto this one of my co-workers informed me that the recent health care legislation

396
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,680
allows physicians to make the decision

397
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:41,020
Whether to not parents important to note the physician whether to put to death

398
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,660
Mentally handicapped children is that true or false?

399
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,020
Here's here's my counter that where's the decision?

400
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Yeah, I

401
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,340
Argued with this dude for a solid like 30 minutes going I can't believe that that's true. He was like no no I read it

402
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,520
I've read it. I read it. I said so the doctor can look at the parents and be like listen straight up

403
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,060
I know you didn't ask

404
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:13,820
But I'm gonna have to do this I think more trouble than that is

405
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,620
That Obama has the power to single-handedly shut down the internet

406
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,280
He has a switch on the underside of the of the desk. He can't stand up too quick oops

407
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,500
He can't where's my where's my gmail? What is gmail?

408
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,380
There's that it's a non-existent entity gmail never happened Craigslist. Sorry out

409
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:40,100
Yeah, shut it down Yahoo answers a font of constant comedy. It's gone now this question itself

410
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,060
Whoa, so not only can he shut down the internet he erases the internet from time

411
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,980
He also has that cyber power you mean sole power

412
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,980
He has that sole power from the cyber legislation

413
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,620
held in

414
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
techno Congress

415
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:06,060
There was a cyber bill in techno Congress that gave him the power to go back in time and stop events from happening

416
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,980
Android of the house, can you pass the oil so I can the 22nd amendment hasn't been repealed. It's been

417
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,100
D-written it's been D

418
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,380
D. It's been unsought. I just say we have just written the greatest movie ever

419
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,180
time travel president

420
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,180
a

421
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,720
Soul power every time I hear digital legislation, I think

422
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,900
Minority report gloves on

423
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,260
So

424
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,660
To answer your question. Yes, of course. There'll be a goddamn election in 2012

425
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,740
You but the only thing we're electing is a new president of the collapse society that we have because there's no more internet

426
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,740
It's just like Wolfman and

427
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:05,900
So, yeah, yeah, I recently failed my first semester of college well, let's try through the

428
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,780
Course is in a field. I'm passionate about game design

429
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:17,460
Should I retake the semester or is it a sign to try something else? I failed dude lack of attendance. That's my favorite part

430
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,180
I mean, it's a sign to try going to class. Why don't you try? Why don't you try that method of?

431
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:31,340
Success first try going I've got this study method that I do where I open a book and I sit down in the chair and I

432
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,660
It's not that you're not proficient in your field

433
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:47,380
It's that you're proficient at waking up and getting out of bed and putting pants on and leaving and going to a room

434
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:54,780
Where learning takes place? It's a field. He's really passionate about but not passionate enough to walk away from that SpongeBob marathon. I

435
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,140
Feel you though. I I had a really I did great in high school. I graduated high school

436
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,780
It's like a like a 3.8

437
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,620
Like I killed it

438
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,140
I got a full ride to Marshall University and I got even like a little bonus scholarship because I was just so smart all the time

439
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,100
And then I got to my first semester at Marshall and got like a 2.2

440
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,180
Like I did so so bad because when you have that freedom you just go buck-ass wild

441
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,620
That's totally to be expected. Like you should you stop going to class if it's when you start

442
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,260
College, you know you you what distractions do you have in high school, right?

443
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,580
MTV

444
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,740
Riding in cars. That's pretty much whip whip. It's

445
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,500
With this face face. Look, that's it when you get to college. It's like

446
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,860
drinking

447
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,860
fornication

448
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Rugged shrug us what

449
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,260
There are drugs to take you're you're gonna start a really shitty full man

450
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,940
I would say frisbee just hacky sack you and your buddies

451
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:10,340
You're gonna start a shitty folk band called the hard and the easy you're gonna play out a few shows

452
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,700
Gonna gonna get some good hits gonna get a couple songs that people can kind of sing along to their version of Bob Dylan's the

453
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,700
man and me is

454
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,200
Really bad. It's not good. It's actually not very good. No, they should do their own stuff from now on

455
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,920
Hey, here's what you need to do go to class every Monday

456
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,820
They always cover new shit on Monday and then just talk about it throughout the course of the week

457
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,080
So just go on Monday

458
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,720
So that's what I did and I graduated with like straight A's failed due to lack of attendance Travis

459
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,360
What part of this problem are you not getting? I picture him not going to class at all

460
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,760
Your solution cannot be we'll try going not going to class at different times. No

461
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,560
class 20% of the time

462
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,880
Yeah, you just try again. You'll do it. I believe if you like

463
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Game design is pretty fun. And you seem like I mean you're lazy. So you must like video games

464
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,600
So I think you should just try it again

465
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,320
And I think you'll I think if you get into trouble just email us and say like guys should I go to class urgent?

466
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,960
Yeah, I should I go to class the scheduler classes later in the day take evening classes. Yeah, that's something

467
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,960
Another an honest anonymous one from form spring says how do I politely tell my wife?

468
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,940
That I don't want to watch any more fucking CSI

469
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,600
Margaret

470
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,800
The Margaret part wasn't on in there, but it was

471
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,440
Listen, it's got to sit her down and let us talk to her

472
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Okay. Hey, listen

473
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,800
Marge Marge, can we call you Marge?

474
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,440
He doesn't want to watch CSI anymore

475
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,040
There's lots of good shows. Have you guys tried? Um, oh

476
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,520
No, don't you do that to me lie to me no what likes me is a great show

477
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,160
I just started watching it today that you're you're talking about some out of the frying pan into the fire shit

478
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,280
I think I think this writer has some more discerning taste. He doesn't want to watch CSI

479
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,180
I don't think he wants to watch murder dramas. Yeah, right. Maybe he wants to try have you tried any other show?

480
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:13,320
What about Buffy the Vampire Slayer? That's a good one West Wing go back all of that

481
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,520
West Wing is the best show ever made all of Buffy is on Netflix instant queue, too

482
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,720
So you can just watch that you can just watch that right now, but listen, he doesn't want it

483
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,400
It's nothing against hit you. He loves you. He just have different tastes here. He's afraid of Laurence Fishburne

484
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,640
Mm-hmm. It's the eyes see eyes. Is he on a CSI?

485
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,460
What yeah, he is Travis's Travis is my Bam Bam's

486
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,120
resident CSI expert

487
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,800
Here's the thing. There are so many flavors of CSI in the world these days. Have you tried CSI of Miami yet?

488
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:51,280
That's my note. Yeah, maybe he likes the the sexy bikinis the Sun the lack of sweat

489
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,360
And someone removing their glasses in a dramatic way those criminals get creative too in that heat

490
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,280
With those makes you clever

491
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:08,080
He makes you clever. He makes you crazy or perhaps. He's more a fan of friend of the show Gary Sinise. I

492
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,720
Would like to see a show like CSI Miami it would be Florida based only it would be

493
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,720
CSI Vero Beach. Whoa

494
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:25,160
All ever all of the CSI people are 85 years old and every murderers are 85 years old every case turns out to be natural

495
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,160
causes

496
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:32,400
It was natural causes. We don't see any weapon wounds or signs of entry at all

497
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,160
It looks like he just fell down in the bathtub, and he hurt himself

498
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:43,600
And he just kind of died there because he was old. I think if you are already watching the New York CSI

499
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:52,040
You're probably sick of episodes about 9-eleven because now like eight years later nine years later still every episode is about 9-eleven

500
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,960
And I know I said, I'd never forget

501
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Now you haven't and now you can't

502
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,680
No, I can't cuz it's still on CSI. God damn it all right

503
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Stupid CSI so please don't make him watch it more CSI from Twitter

504
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Whoa wait great

505
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Greg Brady there first I get of

506
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,160
All nude review rights from Twitter. I work from home now, and I'm having trouble concentrating

507
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,160
Concentrating do I need to go on the drugs?

508
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,400
That's not that doesn't seem like it's gonna help your problem

509
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:33,400
Listen meth seems like you're gonna. I'm just I can't focus. I need to do a bump can do about just one bump

510
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,240
That's all I need

511
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,240
need a fix

512
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,160
I

513
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:42,960
It's it's hard. I I'm in your I'm in your boat. I work out of the home

514
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,080
And it's hard because you got the whole internet there. You got all your cool stuff there

515
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,080
You don't have anybody watching over your back

516
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I

517
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,480
Get I so that's that's tough what I would say is try to make your

518
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,520
Work environment a little more pleasing like demo ice a little bit play some soft music

519
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
It's kind of reduce a drawback

520
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,680
Have some checking yourself and scented oil oil up oil up on that I

521
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,400
I don't know. That's the best advice. You're really you're asking the wrong people because right now Justin

522
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,480
And I are supposed to be working yeah, so I don't know recorder podcast

523
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,240
Recorder podcast or something on the real though what I've done

524
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,560
Is I've separated all of my internet bookmarks into three folders one being essential work utilities

525
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,880
One being non-essential work utilities and one being fun stuff. You know a link to my my penguin club

526
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,400
And what have you and so after I write a few stories I will

527
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,520
Open up my fun folder and have about ten minutes of me time

528
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,960
exploring the the Arctic landscape of penguin world

529
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
I

530
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,040
Think that that's a good way to get your your shit straightened out

531
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,360
