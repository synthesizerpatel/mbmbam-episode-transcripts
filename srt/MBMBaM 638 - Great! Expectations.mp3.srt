1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,340
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

8
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:21,980
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. Well me. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,460
I'm a grown-up man, and I'm Griffin McElroy. Now. Why did you feel the need to specify that you're a grown man?

10
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,900
I just feel like it's sort of my thing this year and as I step into 2023 stepping into my adult power

11
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,860
It is into anytime. I post a picture of us when we were younger

12
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:45,460
Yeah, we'll talk about how different I look and and how much more mature Justin looks and people are like that

13
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,460
Griffin didn't even age. I'm like guys. He had look at the bags around his eyes

14
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,540
When they released the video for

15
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,780
Montaigne did the video for my life's better with you, and we were all in it

16
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't read the comments on stuff, but that was somebody else's video

17
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,660
So I read the comments because I was curious and the one that I read that stuck with me really bad is like they all

18
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,660
Look so old. Yeah

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,020
You look old I love a picture you look at me right now

20
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,300
I don't know how my face has done this it does look like I've died my like

21
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,500
Van Dyke around my face, but my cheeks are completely gray, and they just like yeah, I look older shit

22
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,820
I don't know what's happening people are like you look more and more like your dad

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,060
I'm like yeah, my dad's old, and I don't know

24
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,860
I love

25
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,740
When people use us as a yardstick for how old they must be getting oh yeah, whoa if the macro is at this old

26
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,300
I must be old and it's like that's a valuable service. I can provide your

27
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,560
Guys, but BuzzFeed has made a cottage industry of that by showing you what what beans from even Stevens looks like today

28
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Let me save you a few hundred clicks. He looks like an adult be

29
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,020
It looks like it's all beans grown adult beans a big adult energy this weekend boys. I went and saw the glass onion

30
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,300
I don't want to talk about that because there's so many spoilers, but it's very good

31
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,540
Why did you fucking mention it then because if it's if you like the first one see ya

32
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,780
There was 22 minutes of trailers and within those trailers boys. There's a trailer for a movie and

33
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,460
It got me pumped now. Don't look up. Don't look up anything about this movie. Okay done. I will tell you

34
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,060
Tell me so

35
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,540
This is a Gerard Butler vehicle. Okay, and he is a commercial some badass flicks

36
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
We're like he has to get out of prison and kill the press

37
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,700
he punches so many things in movies even when he's not supposed to and

38
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:47,500
He is a commercial airline pilot and they're about to take off and then some police show up, and they're like hey

39
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,820
We we're gonna do a prisoner extradition on your airplane

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,980
Which I don't I didn't know that was a surprise thing that you could drop on something like oh by the way

41
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,260
Yeah, and he's like what I'm not wild about that and like too bad

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,940
You are Butler's not up to you, and he's like what's this dude's deal?

43
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,900
And he's like ah he murdered somebody 15 years ago or whatever and he's like okay, so then they fly through an electrical storm

44
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:17,460
Yeah, and they end up crash landing in scary jungle part of a country and oh no like a cartel shows up or whatever and takes

45
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,740
All the passengers hostage, and then it's up to Gerard Butler and the escaped convict guy

46
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,660
The two of them have to work together to rescue everybody it's fucking cool travel. They play by their own rules

47
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,820
Yeah, and the name of the movie is plane

48
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,980
That's great, I can't be right yeah

49
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Call plane. It's like if they may is that you've described like Die Hard, and then it's like this movie's called feet

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Yep, this movie's building

51
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,180
This one's called Bruce

52
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:56,220
I'm I'm so excited about this is a new naming convention because I think we've had it before you know sometimes

53
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,740
You're like gladiator. I mean my man my man M night Shyamalan

54
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,500
I would say crush the movie title and game with his I believe his most recent feature film

55
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,660
Which was just called old yeah, and in this one

56
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:14,220
And that's I guess kind of to tie back into the intro of the podcast welcome to M night Shyamalans old, too

57
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,820
This but it's slower this time. Yeah, it's slow. We age one day for every day. Yeah

58
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,720
So instead of a child walk on a beach turn to a grandpa

59
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,220
It's like a 22 year old becomes a 35 year old over the course of 12 years

60
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,940
I just remember when I worked at a movie theater

61
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,140
I remember watching people come up and these people still to this day befuddle me people who come to the theater

62
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,780
And then stand before the posters and pick out which movie they're going to watch at that moment

63
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:49,620
And I remember people walking up to the Ewan McGregor film the island and deciding

64
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,020
Impulsively knowing nothing about this film. Yeah, that's what they were in the mood to watch that day. I like his face. Oh, yeah

65
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,180
Yeah, okay, and you escape sounds good. Let's do it and now I think if we can enter into an age of singular

66
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:11,840
Non-specific nouns. Yeah, it's just like what what's this movie's whole deal. It's mostly about a plane. Yeah, okay

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,140
I like planes

68
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,020
We could see plane or we could say boat or elevator

69
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,140
Which I want to watch or old or old back feet for feet

70
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,660
Oh before for with Justin long gotta get there for feet for long feet long feet

71
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,980
Justin long feet. They thought they could break me

72
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,060
They didn't know I was long feet

73
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:40,700
He ties the bandana around his head. Yeah, it's a short film cool. I saw Justin long one time. Yeah

74
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
I did too and we were at that thing

75
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,060
We were at the entertainment weekly thing and man, I wanted to go say hi to Justin long so bad

76
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:53,660
Yeah, my connection to Justin long is so tenuous. It is like it's too hot. It's two Hodgman's removed

77
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,460
it's like Audrey I know current Hodgman and

78
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:02,540
Hodgman of today new PC Hodgman and if you knew that Hodgman, that's

79
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,620
The moment I texted Hodgman I said we're in the same room as Justin long and Justin wants to go introduce himself based slowly on

80
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,720
The fact that they're both named Justin and he wrote back. He should do it

81
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,720
Oh

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,600
For all you know, that's Justin long's favorite thing in the world is to meet other justice. He's never met another one

83
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,720
Oh, yeah, like he knows about Bieber, but they're fans never met him

84
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,900
Yeah, and if you're wondering why I'm not better connected or more successful

85
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,080
I think you have a pretty succinct wrap-up in that little anecdote

86
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,560
I'm just saying if Travis Barker was at the same place. I was oh would you now Travis? No, maybe Travis Pastrana?

87
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,760
We have no way of knowing which Travis's but those are the only three or the band Travis Justin take us to another segment

88
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,460
We're just well, I'm happy to I was trying to look we were

89
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Recording late, so I'm trying to find other areas. Thanks Trav. Thanks for these questions, buddy

90
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,260
Hey, you're welcome. Travis actually writes all the questions

91
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,740
We don't we haven't gotten an email in our inbox in like two and a half years probably because we don't mention it anymore

92
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,600
The hardest part is thinking of different cities and stuff that people can be from yeah

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,400
There's only so many cities and if you use one twice people are gonna be on to the other grift

94
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,920
Before we ask a question. Yeah, and I do want to do this. Yeah the question

95
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,800
Yeah, of course. Can I can we talk about the elf on the shelf for a second?

96
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,260
Yeah, is that like a way of saying like the elephant in the room? No, no, that would be that

97
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
TNT

98
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,100
Can I say that we did a face or a

99
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,340
Face time so our kids could play Pokemon together over the weekend

100
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,220
Which was delightful and Henry had never seen elf on the shelf before and when Charlie showed it to him

101
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,420
She was like yeah, he's pretty creepy. So like who's it for Justin?

102
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,740
Yeah, BB asked me if we could do up on the shelf this year and I said no

103
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,220
Alpha the shelf is just designed to horrify you into being good

104
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,760
And she goes, but Charlie has one.

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,660
And I was like, well, I can't speak to Justin's mind.

106
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,620
I don't know how it happened.

107
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,760
I think Mary got one first and the kids loved it.

108
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,260
So then we got one.

109
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,480
And the elf on the shelf, if you don't know,

110
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,840
the elf on the shelf is a toy that you buy

111
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,180
and you put him up on, or him,

112
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,220
they got all kinds of different ones, him or her.

113
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,300
Oh, woke culture, am I right?

114
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,460
Okay, so you hide the elf on the shelf

115
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,060
and the elf watches the kids

116
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
and then reports back to Santa every night.

117
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,900
Yeah, sure.

118
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,540
If the kids touch the elf, this is so important.

119
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,900
If the kids touch the elf, it loses its magic.

120
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,740
And dies?

121
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
And dies.

122
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,620
I mean.

123
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,300
It goes from being a magical fairy tale creature

124
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,820
that can teleport all over your house

125
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
and report on you to the government, definitely.

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,020
Or a lifeless, a corpse.

127
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,840
I mean, it is what it is.

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Yeah, a corpse.

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,520
Basically a corpse.

130
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,100
Just like in Toy Story, they die all the time.

131
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,940
Yeah.

132
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,780
Humans are around.

133
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,620
Yeah, sure.

134
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,340
Justin, would you say that elf on the shelf

135
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,840
is the most commercially successful haunted doll

136
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,780
on the market today?

137
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,740
Wow, that's, wow, Trav.

138
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,580
That's a good question.

139
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,980
That's huge, actually.

140
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
That's huge for our brand.

141
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,740
But, and also, the other key thing about it is,

142
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,080
after it reports back to Santa,

143
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,020
it returns to a different spot in your house.

144
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,940
Homework.

145
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,920
As a parent, right, or guardian,

146
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,900
you now are the one, you have to.

147
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,540
Or home intruder.

148
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,380
Or home intruder, thank you.

149
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,420
Let me just, I know the kids can't touch this,

150
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,340
let me just zoop.

151
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,340
It's hard enough to keep the whole Santa thing going.

152
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,340
And that's like very ephemeral, right?

153
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,980
It's like, you know, Santa, everybody has a different.

154
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,540
This is like concrete evidence, proof of life.

155
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,580
This is magic that's happening every day.

156
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,540
And if you forget that, what I'm saying is,

157
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,660
I don't know why we had to increase the difficulty

158
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,620
of Santa faith with this like hard, concrete,

159
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,180
like complex mythology.

160
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,220
Because if the bottom falls out from the elf,

161
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
it's not a long walk to be like,

162
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,500
okay, so the Santa thing, tooth fairy, all of that stuff.

163
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,160
I don't understand why it had to be that way.

164
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,540
Yesterday, the elf on the shelf,

165
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,760
I had it hanging off a light fixture.

166
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,420
And then right in front of the kids.

167
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,760
You can't see, Justin, but it's so important to note,

168
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,180
he's hanging by his hands.

169
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,100
Important to note, he's hanging by his hands.

170
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,060
It's got Velcro on his hand.

171
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,520
I put Velcro on this thing's hands

172
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,920
so I can make it do all kinds of wild stuff.

173
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,340
Yeah.

174
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,980
So you do, you're complaining for the bit,

175
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
but you love it, right?

176
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,200
When I remember it, it's good.

177
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,940
When I don't remember, when it's 530 in the morning,

178
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,300
and I sit up and I'm like, fuck!

179
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,140
Then it's bad.

180
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,020
You just throw them in the washing machine.

181
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,980
Today, I jammed it behind the air fryer.

182
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,760
It took the kids 15 minutes.

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,740
That's awesome.

184
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,100
But yesterday, this doll fuckin' falls

185
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,440
right in front of the kids, onto the ground.

186
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,020
So now I'm looking at it like, well, fuck me.

187
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,140
And they're like, you can't touch it.

188
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,600
Like, I know I can't touch it.

189
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,140
And then the cat instantly is like, hell yeah,

190
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,580
I've been wanting to fuck you up for years.

191
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,380
This is my day.

193
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,220
I'm gonna own this to you.

194
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,900
This is your day, bud, it's coming.

195
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,500
The cat's about to pounce.

196
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,300
And I'm like, I think, I get some,

197
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,360
I start looking for rubber gloves,

198
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,260
because I feel like I could maybe sell that.

199
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,100
Yeah.

200
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,300
But then Charlie's like, get the tongs.

201
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,620
Like, okay, tongs, that's even better.

202
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,700
So I get tongs and I pick up this.

203
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,540
Like a bird that has been dragged into the house.

204
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,380
Yep.

205
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,380
And I put it face down on a serving tray

206
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,540
up on top of the fridge.

207
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
And it's just lying there like,

208
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,260
we'll let her rest there.

209
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,340
It's fine.

210
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,920
I'm sure she'll get her magic back.

211
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm sure the tongs were okay.

212
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,420
Last night, as I mentioned,

213
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,080
we forgot to move the elf,

214
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,060
because it was very out of sight, out of mind.

215
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,300
It was lying on top of a serving tray.

216
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,100
And Sydney's like, text me while I'm just out of the shower.

217
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,580
She's like, quick, I've got Charlie distracted.

218
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,960
You've got to move the elf.

219
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,800
Like, okay.

220
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,220
Okay, so I run.

221
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,460
And then I had this really brief moment where I was like,

222
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,620
I don't know what we're teaching our kids with the elf,

223
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,060
but this could be a teachable moment

224
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,660
that gets me having to do the elf forever.

225
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,860
So it's basically just like, that's a tough break, kids.

226
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,260
But that's what life is like sometimes, right?

227
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,060
That's like that sometimes.

228
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,180
So what did you do?

229
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,100
He air fried it.

230
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,740
I stuffed it behind the air fryer.

231
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,520
I stuffed it behind the air fryer.

232
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,660
Didn't use the tongs, used my bare hands.

233
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,260
Well, you broke the magic.

234
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,020
Could you not have sold like,

235
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,740
the elf spirit is still in there.

236
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,800
But if we scale the thing out,

237
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,540
he had, she had like an eight-story fall yesterday

238
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,660
onto her, onto her.

239
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,420
She has a long road to recovery ahead of her.

240
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,320
She's gonna be laid up on the fridge for a while,

241
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,300
which honestly, kids, is a bad behavior pass for you

242
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,140
for as long as they are convalescing.

243
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,060
You can do whatever you want and Clarice can't report.

244
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,380
Well, there's an animated series, it's absolute horseshit.

245
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,780
It's like a 22-minute movie of garbage.

246
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,300
And this one kid's like, I don't believe in this idiot.

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,460
He knocks it off a shelf.

248
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,860
And they do even increase the mythology

249
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,900
to now where he has to be flown by other elves

250
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,140
back to the North Pole and get bed rest.

251
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,580
To get resuscitated.

252
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,420
Wow.

253
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,260
It's so heinous.

254
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,340
We got that dog,

255
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,260
because I think somebody, some family member sent us

256
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,140
the dog, elf on a shelf has a dog too.

257
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,620
And it's a St. Bernard with a little keg around its neck,

258
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,580
but the keg contains Christmas cheer.

259
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,420
Sure.

260
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,780
And on Christmas Eve, a beam of light shoots out

261
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,020
of the dog's keg that has a heart on it.

262
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,220
And that goes to the North Pole to make Christmas happen.

263
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,300
Christmas would die.

264
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,540
Christmas would fade from the earth

265
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,580
if we stopped believing in it.

266
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,780
Which is cool, because then on Christmas Eve,

267
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,180
my son stays up to watch his stuffed animal dog

268
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
that comes with the book.

269
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,260
And it's like, a beam hasn't come out yet.

270
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,580
I'm pretty worried that Christmas

271
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,980
is not gonna come this year.

272
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,140
And it's like, man, what's the game?

273
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,300
Unless you have some sort of beam laser technology

274
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,620
that you can put inside of your dog dolls,

275
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,220
maybe don't build that into the mythos.

276
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,060
Dad tried to introduce-

277
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,580
But think about how much Hanukkah

278
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,100
could get to shine that year.

279
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,940
Oh wow.

280
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,900
If your house didn't come, Hanukkah would be

281
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,140
in your house, it could finally get center stage.

282
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,380
Dad tried to introduce elf on a shelf into our home

283
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,940
by getting my kids each one Bengals themed.

284
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,540
Oh, we got one of the, holy shit,

285
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,380
we got one of these too.

286
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,620
Thank you, we got it too.

287
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,820
And all I can think is like,

288
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,300
it's already a complicated enough mythos

289
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,180
without introducing, and also they love football.

290
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,420
They love one team, they have a preference.

291
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,980
Mine, the one that dad sent us,

292
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,100
ended up being the elf on the shelf in aisle five

293
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,300
of Goodwill, because that's where he went,

294
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,820
because no thank you, dad.

295
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,300
I don't wanna have to explain that.

296
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,500
Nope, no thank you.

297
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I'm just saying I really pray that there is no magic

298
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,940
in the dolls, because I never remove them

299
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,260
from what must now be their coffins.

300
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,100
Except for me, if the doll is alive,

301
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,540
I've done the most kick-ass job ever hiding it

302
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,300
from my child, he'll never see it.

303
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,660
That's some other family's problem.

304
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,620
Okay, we're not gonna do one of those.

305
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,820
They can touch him all he wants.

306
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,300
I stuck a note on him that says,

307
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,140
this is my cross to bear, you touch this guy, go nuts,

308
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,980
I said.

309
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,540
I just discovered a large spider web in my hotel room.

310
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,420
It's too high to reach it by jumping,

311
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,580
and also I don't like killing spiders.

312
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,780
Would it be crossing some social boundary

313
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,860
to ask the front desk to send someone to kill it for me?

314
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,460
I'm staying here for a whole month,

315
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,100
and I think it's moving closer.

316
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,260
Help, brothers, big bad bug in Blythe.

317
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,020
Listen.

318
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,460
I don't know how spiders run in Blythe.

319
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,300
Like this.

320
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,340
Chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

321
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,300
Yeah, they make a fun sound like that.

322
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,100
You shouldn't kill spiders is what I'm supposed to say.

323
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,940
Whoa.

324
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,300
But they can be poisonous and very, very scary,

325
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,660
and we are so much bigger than they are.

326
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,140
It seems like if you would goosh it,

327
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,940
that stuff would come out.

328
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,820
That's my usual boundary for,

329
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,940
okay, you are big enough to deserve

330
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,100
some sort of primal dignity,

331
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,860
and I will usher you outside in a solo cup.

332
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,180
But if they don't goosh out when they explode,

333
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,860
is that even really alive?

334
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,060
Does it have feelings?

335
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,860
Griffin, I've both seen and read Charlotte's web.

336
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,380
They've got feelings.

337
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,900
Well, but Charlotte is big enough.

338
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Charlotte's big enough that if you squished her,

339
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,940
stuff would come out.

340
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,860
So yes, that's a living creature right there,

341
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,940
and we have to respect that.

342
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,340
Look, can I ask you guys a judgment call?

343
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,180
Yeah.

344
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,420
Which of these do you think is more acceptable?

345
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,820
Calling the front desk and asking them to send someone up,

346
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,340
or going down to the front desk and saying like,

347
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,180
hey, there's a spider in my room,

348
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,660
if someone could go take care of that?

349
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,020
Neither one of those is great.

350
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,460
I think the best case scenario,

351
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,780
and the one that sort of gets you off scot-free,

352
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,140
is you call the front desk and say,

353
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,020
hello, it's me again.

354
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,460
I know I've called about a lot of bugs today,

355
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,700
but this one's a doozer.

356
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,860
I have a spider in my room, and that is scary to me.

357
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,380
What happens next, I'm your customer.

358
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,380
You tell me.

359
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,700
I'm scared of the spider in my room.

360
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,820
Yes.

361
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,060
Whatever happens, maybe you do something about it,

362
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,980
maybe you don't, but I'm an active Yelp power user.

363
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,780
I am always ready to burn your shit down.

364
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:56,660
Okay, I think it can't be the sole focus of the call.

365
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,220
Like if you said like, oh, could I get an extra pillow

366
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,220
and a couple of towels, and while they're in here,

367
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,780
there's a big scary spider, if they have time.

368
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,100
If they have time.

369
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,620
Just get it on a magazine and chuck it in the hallway.

370
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't kill spiders, I don't kill a spider.

371
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,180
No, any one of them could create Spider-Man,

372
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,860
and I don't wanna take that away from the world.

373
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,700
May I?

374
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,860
You don't kill spiders, it's bad luck.

375
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,100
I don't extend this courtesy

376
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,900
to all living things, obviously.

377
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,420
If I see a stink bug in my house,

378
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,180
which I do every year for a couple months.

379
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,460
The same one?

380
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,700
No, oh no, certainly not,

381
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,620
because I'll smush those dead.

382
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,820
That makes the stink come out, Justin.

383
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,660
I love the stink.

384
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,820
That means one less stink bug.

385
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,820
I hate these guys, okay?

386
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,700
Wait, hold on, that doesn't,

387
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,980
the worst thing about the stink bug

388
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,940
is the stink they make.

389
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,500
You make the stink come out, and you're like,

390
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,900
ah, now it can't stink.

391
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,060
I'm actually, I'm with Justin on this one.

392
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,580
The worst part of the stink bug is their presence.

393
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,140
Yeah, it's the being a bug in the house.

394
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,660
Now, normally I'll try to chuck them outside,

395
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,500
because the kids don't like it,

396
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,780
but if I see one of the kids around,

397
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,140
they're big, tough guardians, I will send them to hell.

398
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,340
I won't do that for a spider.

399
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,980
Spider, that's part of the fun of spiders.

400
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,500
You gotta get it on a napkin, or a paper towel,

401
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
or something, and gotta get it outside.

402
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,020
Before it get on your hand.

403
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,740
If this helps you,

404
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,060
there's five or six other spiders in your room, guaranteed.

405
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,020
Not just one.

406
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,060
If this makes you feel any better,

407
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,100
and it probably shouldn't,

408
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,460
there are probably six or seven,

409
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,660
or eight or nine, or a dozen spiders in your room.

410
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,500
For sure.

411
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,260
That's just the life that you live.

412
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,980
The spider you can see, that's a good one.

413
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,340
Good, I got tabs on that one.

414
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,540
Don't worry about that spider.

415
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,180
He's out there, he's like, are we, is this okay?

416
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,620
I'm here, I know you can see me.

417
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,460
This is fine, right?

418
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,380
That's polite.

419
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,220
That's polite.

420
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,820
The other spiders, oh, they're nasty dogs.

421
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,660
They're everywhere.

422
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,020
They're underneath your bed, they're everywhere.

423
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,060
But the spider you can see, you don't need to kill him.

424
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,700
He's going about his business, he's fine.

425
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,700
Providing a service, as well.

426
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,540
Listen, I don't like them.

427
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,620
Famously, I do not care for spiders.

428
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,420
However, we need them.

429
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,780
They're good, they're good spiders.

430
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,620
They kill the genie mosquitoes.

431
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,020
So just move rooms.

432
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,100
That's the spider's room.

433
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
You walked in, somebody was already in that room,

434
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,980
and it's a spider.

435
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,340
You're in the wrong room.

436
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,300
Yeah, it's a spider.

437
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,420
The spider has to admit.

438
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,700
I wouldn't call somebody,

439
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,100
because they might not handle it ethically.

440
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah.

441
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,700
They would probably kill the spider.

442
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,060
They're probably not gonna go through the work

443
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,580
of scooping up the spider and then walking it

444
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,420
to the elevator.

445
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,260
No.

446
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,460
They won't apologize to the spider and say,

447
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,220
I know you were here first, I'm sorry about this.

448
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,820
What you gotta hope for, the best you can hope for,

449
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,060
is that they have one of those old-timey mail shoots.

450
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:34,700
Have an incredible adventure, Jason Schwartzman-voiced spider.

452
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,940
Have a wonderful adventure.

453
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,660
Oh, he would do so good.

454
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,500
It looks like I've got mail.

455
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,580
And then Dunstan just picks him up and fucking eats him.

456
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,180
And then the baby's day out, eats Dunstan.

457
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,860
What a perfect film.

458
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,220
What an amazing, what an amazing idea.

459
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,820
And so culturally relevant.

460
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,460
It's not, but it's like,

461
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,900
what if a monkey got loose in a hotel mail room?

462
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:02,180
Yeah.

463
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,020
Rights itself, baby.

464
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Sure, yeah.

465
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,980
And also Jason Alexander's there and he's befuddled.

466
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,940
He could not be more confused.

467
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,780
Hey, can we go to the wizard?

468
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,620
Yeah, I'd love that.

469
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,460
I wish we would.

470
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,580
Let's bow our heads in prayer.

471
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,180
This was sent in by Siobhan.

472
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,540
Thank you, Siobhan.

473
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,700
It is written by a bunch of authors, it seems like.

474
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,700
Wow, this one only has a 39% out of 100% of goodness.

475
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:29,700
So this may not be some of the wizard's best work.

476
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,420
38 co-authors, few too many cooks in the kitchen

477
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,460
on how to trash talk on Xbox Live.

478
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,460
I suppose this would work for PlayStation Live,

479
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,060
Nintendo Live.

480
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,180
No, Sony cronies respond to things differently.

481
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Oh, is that true?

482
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,020
Yeah.

483
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,840
They're built different.

484
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,680
Yeah, built different.

485
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,780
Yeah, they probably don't call themselves Sony cronies

486
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,620
when they talk about how cool they are.

487
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,900
No, we do.

488
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,220
Oh, okay, you've taken that.

489
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,580
They prefer Sony cronies.

490
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,420
Yeah.

491
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,980
Well, it depends on if we're into

492
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,540
the Friendship is Magic universe or not.

493
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

494
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,700
This is gonna flay the flesh off our bones.

495
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,040
Being good at a game is a sure way to own mad noobs.

496
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,880
Yep.

497
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,700
But if you didn't do so good or you just like to argue,

498
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,100
then trash talking can make the match funnier.

499
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,040
Well, I don't know about funnier.

500
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,580
Step, well, step zero.

501
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,420
Keep your grades up.

502
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,860
If your grades go too bad,

503
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,340
your parents will cancel your Xbox Live account

504
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,840
and then you can kiss Master Chief

505
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,300
on his helmet mouth goodbye.

506
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,940
He's never coming back.

507
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,540
Justin, did you put glasses on?

508
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,380
I was looking at another window in Chrome

509
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,620
and then when I looked back, you had glasses on.

510
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,260
Oh, I think I've always been there.

511
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,400
I think I've always had glasses.

512
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,660
No, these are my blue blockers.

513
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,780
I'm starting to feel a little bit of eye strain set in.

514
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm old.

515
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,380
I'm starting to feel a little bit of co-opting

516
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,500
the glasses brand.

517
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,020
Yeah, man.

518
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,460
And the beer brand.

519
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,580
You know that for a while I was the glasses one

520
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,260
and Travis was the beards one and you were the nothing.

521
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,460
You had nothing on your face.

522
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,380
You were the nothing.

523
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,860
You consumed all of Neverending Story.

524
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,060
But now you have both of them.

525
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,980
So now it's glasses, beards guy, glasses, beards guy,

526
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,100
glasses, not Scruff.

527
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,940
Scruff.

528
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,620
Maybe the bad guy is you for not.

529
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,020
Having a beard?

530
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,540
Having a beard?

531
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,780
Okay, well, it looks weird and bad when I do it.

532
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,940
So I guess I didn't get those jeans.

533
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,140
But anyway, just something to think about.

534
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,780
Step one, be brave.

535
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,020
Who cares that you came in last place?

536
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,740
Yeah, trash talking after owning everyone in the room

537
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,780
gives you a clear advantage, but so what?

538
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,300
Brag about your kill death ratio

539
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,500
or point out someone for camping the whole time.

540
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,340
Cool.

541
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,240
Yeah, there you go.

542
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,080
Good work, you fucking scrubs.

543
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,820
No one's ever said kill death ratio

544
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,060
and you're not allowed to say that.

545
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah, you're not allowed to spell the whole thing out.

546
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,860
Nice work capturing the flag, you fucking idiots.

547
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,700
Yeah, you died 100 times.

548
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,280
You lost 15 points.

549
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,280
Like, yeah, I know, but you died a couple times too, idiot.

550
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,140
In the history of video games,

551
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,380
the best trash talking comes from a place of whining, right?

552
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,900
Of like, well, my controller's glitched.

553
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,860
You were using the turbo button.

554
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,460
I said no odd job.

555
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,280
That kind of thing.

556
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,020
My parents were yelling like so loud.

557
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,060
So loud I couldn't hear the sound of the gun

558
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,180
going bang, bang, bang.

559
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,060
The ratatouille that was piloting me

560
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,260
wasn't very good at this match.

561
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,180
Yeah, a lot of things.

562
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,820
I think this article also submits in

563
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,880
that most good online trash talking

564
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,700
comes from a place of real courage.

565
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,160
Be brave, who cares?

566
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,100
Don't be too loud.

567
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,740
Just because you want to tell someone how much they suck

568
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,880
doesn't mean you have to hog the sound waves.

569
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,380
That's a really powerful term for people in our profession.

570
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,580
Is this what Alien did this?

571
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,900
What is, who wrote this?

572
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,300
There's only so many sound waves

573
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,380
that the human ear can detect at any time.

574
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,460
That's the secret of music mixing,

575
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,060
mastering, production, all that stuff.

576
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:55,900
Don't use too much.

577
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,260
So you don't want to use too many of them

578
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,220
just by being like, you died twice, bleh!

579
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,740
And then making that long, sustained sort of

580
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,580
sick noise. You ever wonder

581
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,760
why we stopped at eight track?

582
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,740
That's it. That's all the tracks we got.

583
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,040
I would go one step further and say

584
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,540
if you really want to fuck with someone,

585
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,180
trash talking ASMR.

586
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,180
I think that would really fuck.

587
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,500
Oh, that's good.

588
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,580
I just want to let you know, psst, psst, psst,

589
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:18,340
that you're kind of a fucking noob.

590
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,780
And I'm just going to squat on your face

591
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,040
and squat and squat and squat and squat.

592
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,220
Fucked your dad.

593
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,340
And this is-

594
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,260
Griffin, I don't think he's ever watched an ASMR video.

595
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,580
He thinks it's Jimmy Stewart insulting-

596
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,900
Oh, well, I fucked your dad.

597
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm going to cut your hair on this side.

598
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,380
That's the worst-

599
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,140
Master Chief is my best friend.

600
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,620
That was, that was among the worst Jimmy Stewart impressions

601
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,420
that have been done.

602
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,460
Don't hog the sound waves.

603
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,140
Let other people make their lame comeback

604
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,700
so you can spike it at them showing your true ownage.

605
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,580
Yeah, man.

606
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,420
Yeah.

607
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,240
Fuck yeah.

608
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,080
Point out someone.

609
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,620
If someone sat around and camped the whole time,

610
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,760
say something.

611
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,420
Most people, other people,

612
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,580
most likely other people are going to back you up

613
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,620
if they were really doing something wrong.

614
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,300
So this is an interesting form of trash talk.

615
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,980
Try to like,

616
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,180
hey, I know you're tempted to trash talk me,

617
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,780
but let's talk about Dylan.

618
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,740
Yeah.

619
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,860
You're a scrub and an idiot and I fucked your dad,

620
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,940
but I'm going to take a sort of moral position here.

621
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,780
Mom?

622
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,300
Say that,

623
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,540
say that Charter was kicking it behind his bush

624
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,380
this whole time.

625
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,100
He stayed in one place for like big portions of the game.

626
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,980
It's capture the flag.

627
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,700
Yeah, but he was, well, I don't know what you mean.

628
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,900
Well, he was just in the zones.

629
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,260
He had to capture the zones and then defend the zones.

630
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,500
Yeah, but he wasn't like running around like I was.

631
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,900
You died 700 times.

632
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,540
So do it for the laughs.

633
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,460
You could invent other jobs that you were doing

634
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,740
while they were doing the fighting

635
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,820
because the military is not just the shooting people.

636
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,100
That's interesting.

637
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,900
You could be like, I had KP.

638
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,420
I had to kill potatoes.

639
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,980
I couldn't help you today.

640
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,420
My KP ratio is off the charts.

641
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:06,020
If the commercials for army and Navy

642
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,740
and Marines recruitment have taught me anything,

643
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,740
the jobs in military are shooting ones, drones ones,

644
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,980
which they make seem like flying like a cool hobby plane,

645
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,460
which I appreciate.

646
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,540
And then the other one is you can build bridges

647
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,620
because they need bridges for industry

648
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,140
and for us to get those cool big drones up somewhere

649
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,620
to a takeoff pad.

650
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,460
I think there's also a job where like four people

651
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,100
look at a radar and then point at a bigger radar.

652
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,940
That's us.

653
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,780
That's us.

654
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,620
Don't get confused.

655
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,660
Now look, it's up there now.

656
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,100
I moved it up to the big screen.

657
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,140
Pretty cool, huh?

658
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,180
Where's our dot finder?

659
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,540
Right here, sir.

660
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,500
This is us right here.

661
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
That's us.

662
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,260
I'm gonna put a little arrow there so we don't forget.

663
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,820
Blow up every other dot.

664
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,660
Oh no.

665
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,900
Do it for the laughs.

666
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,380
As much as you wanna dominate someone,

667
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,860
make it funny because everyone likes

668
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,660
that one hilarious kid in the lobby.

669
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,740
That's true.

670
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,180
Everyone really likes when a bunch of ones are fighting

671
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,980
for that incredible honor is the best part

672
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,220
because then it's like I'm on Last Comic Standing

673
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,460
every day, every time I play COD and Halo

674
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,780
with my best friends.

675
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,340
Don't be obnoxious.

676
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,180
Don't be-

677
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,020
Sorry?

678
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,540
Don't be agnostic.

679
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,340
Don't be agnostic.

680
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,140
Christ is gonna get you there or he won't.

681
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,020
But don't fall in the middle.

682
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,100
Make a fucking choice.

683
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,380
You gotta decide.

684
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
If you're alone-

685
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,220
If there's one thing game lobbies love,

686
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,300
it's strong religious beliefs.

687
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,660
One way or the other.

688
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,700
One way or the other.

689
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,340
Either God's gonna help you get the Battle Royale

690
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,820
and take the crown in this big Fortnite match

691
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,900
or we're all alone and it's you

692
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,900
and it all comes down to you.

693
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,420
And one of those two extremes is the way you gotta go.

694
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,180
Avoid being obnoxious.

695
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,820
Don't whine and be annoying

696
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,740
because chances are you're the one

697
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,500
that's gonna get dominated.

698
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,300
This article's all over the fucking place, man.

699
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,340
This is what happens when you have like 28 different authors.

700
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,980
There's one author who's like, be obnoxious.

701
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,860
It's like, all right, no, don't, hey,

702
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,700
don't listen to what he said.

703
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,620
Don't actually listen to that one.

704
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,540
Make friends.

705
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,260
You don't have to friend request them,

706
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,780
but making some lobby friends is always good,

707
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,740
especially if a lobby fight breaks out.

708
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,580
You want them to have your back.

709
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,980
Lobby fight!

710
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,540
Oh shit, why is your collarbone broken?

711
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,740
Yeah, man, you know how it is, lobby fight.

712
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,700
Lobby fight.

713
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,900
Not friends on there.

714
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,980
I don't friend people.

715
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,140
It's serendipity.

716
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,420
I let them go.

717
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
I blow, I say, thanks for the teamwork.

718
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,580
Send them back into the breeze

719
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,740
if our paths cross again, it was meant to be.

720
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,940
What about, hey, guys, what about instead of trash talk,

721
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,420
we focus on some treasure talk and just say like,

722
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,020
hey, everybody did really good this match

723
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
and I appreciate it.

724
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,300
I've never gotten a compliment

725
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,380
while playing an online video game.

726
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,220
That would be huge for me.

727
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,940
Yes, I have also experienced that, Justin, as well.

728
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,700
Nice, nice kill, J, man.

729
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,380
But you want to hear the most effect,

730
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,820
I've only been affected by trash talk

731
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,980
once in my entire illustrious gaming career.

732
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,660
I was playing Gears of War online

733
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,100
and in Gears of War, to finish, this is gross.

734
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,900
This is yucky stuff, guys.

735
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:22,900
That iteration of it, you had to stomp on the enemy's head

736
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,960
to finish the fight.

737
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,380
They'd be downed, but then it's like in Fortnite,

738
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,580
somebody gets downed like this,

739
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,960
except you run over to them and have to smash their head.

740
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,340
But whoever smashes the head gets credit for the kill.

741
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,860
So this guy next to me, he shoots someone really dead,

742
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,660
but he doesn't run over as fast as I do

743
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,620
because I was close to the bite.

744
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,100
So I run over there and I squish his head.

745
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,620
And this guy says to me in the most disappointed

746
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,580
parent voice possible, you have to get your own kills, man.

747
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,260
Oh, no. Devastating.

748
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,180
And man, I did feel like trash.

749
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,900
That was some good trash talk.

750
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,580
I remember it 10 years later.

751
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,420
Yeah, man.

752
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,660
I felt like trash.

753
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,940
Wow.

754
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,180
It was, it was-

755
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,020
Did you leave?

756
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,180
Did you just turn, did you turn the Xbox off immediately?

757
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,300
I don't think I could have hung in the rest of the match.

758
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,140
I don't think I kept playing.

759
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,240
Like, I was like so, I think I probably shut it off.

760
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,660
But like, I remember that.

761
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,540
That's trash talk.

762
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
I mean, that's like-

763
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,200
Yeah.

764
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,420
That works out, that's deep.

765
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,880
That's going deep for trash talk

766
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,040
that I will still recount 10 years later.

767
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,460
Know when it's appropriate.

768
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,020
If no one is talking when you enter a lobby,

769
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,900
it's probably not a good idea to trash talk, okay?

770
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,940
It's my experience.

771
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,060
Someone's gotta start it.

772
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,620
Yeah, be careful what you say.

773
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,460
There are people who report trash talkers

774
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,220
if you use overly swear-filled language.

775
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,700
So trash talk all you want.

776
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,440
Just lay off the F bombs.

777
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,940
Yeah, use like really archaic-

778
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,700
I don't think that's, I don't think that's true.

779
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,380
I don't think they're policing that.

780
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,220
I don't.

781
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,740
I do not believe that fucking Master Chief

782
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,660
is like listening in like, he said fuck once.

783
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,340
That one is okay.

784
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,700
It's PG-13 rules.

785
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,700
That's PG-13 rules.

786
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,980
They can show all booth.

787
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
Be funny.

788
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,940
You don't have to trash on other people.

789
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,180
Didn't they already say be funny?

790
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
In most cases, you will find that the subject matter

791
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,600
is far away from video games.

792
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,760
In general, just don't talk about racist

793
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,220
or controversial subjects unless you are

794
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,740
in that sort of company.

795
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,140
Wow.

796
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,960
Hey, WikiHow.

797
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,800
Wow.

798
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,920
WikiHow.

799
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
WikiHow.

800
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,000
Holy shit, guys.

801
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,060
Read the room for bigotry

802
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,020
and then dive right in.

803
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,060
Listen, man, if everyone's being racist,

804
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:34,100
if everyone's having a racist old time,

805
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,740
you don't want to stand out as the not racist in the room.

806
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,780
Holy shit.

807
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,220
WikiHow.

808
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,060
WikiHow.

809
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,820
They will single you out for your unwillingness

810
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,780
to participate in the bigotry.

811
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,340
Do you think that this article

812
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,880
or this subsection of the article

813
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,660
will still be active by the next time we record?

814
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,980
Or will one of the 38 original authors be like,

815
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,620
I do not want my username on this one.

816
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,460
Boop.

817
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,300
Oh, boy.

818
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,460
One Q&A, why is my friend acting

819
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,380
like she does not want to be my friend anymore?

820
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,340
That is not your main to the subject.

821
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,260
What you did has certainly had nothing to do

822
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,220
with this article.

823
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,900
You fucked up IRL.

824
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,900
These are clinically proven ways to just have a funny time

825
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,060
on a Xbox Live platform.

826
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,340
And what's wrong with that?

827
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,180
A lot.

828
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,020
Yeah.

829
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,860
Ha ha!

830
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,860
It's better, it's better with you.

831
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,060
Hey, do you have an exciting idea for a website?

832
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,780
An idea that you want to share with your brothers

833
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:44,340
but then they make you wait on that idea

834
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,540
until after the break?

835
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,700
And you're so excited to share it

836
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,020
and then they're like, well, we gotta go make money first

837
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,220
so you have to wait.

838
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,300
Well, you don't have, I'd love to hear your idea

839
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,700
because I did promise that I'd listen to it,

840
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,580
but first, can I take just one more second

841
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,780
just to tell you about Squarespace first?

842
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,900
Completely underwired as note,

843
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,420
Squarespace is a website creation tool

844
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,820
and it's so much more than that,

845
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,940
but really you can use Squarespace

846
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,200
and all their incredible resources to make a website

847
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,500
even if you don't know anything about making a website.

848
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,340
And you know, like Travis, for example,

849
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,540
he's got this great idea he's gonna share with us soon.

850
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,940
You know my idea is so much as it's just like

851
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,060
a reinvigoration of our brand maybe.

852
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,900
And we'll get there, we'll get there for sure.

853
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,300
We'll get there, we'll get there, we'll get there,

854
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,620
but you know, it's not gonna take long

855
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,540
to make this website, Travis,

856
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,820
so you don't even need to worry about it

857
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,860
because they've got all these incredible templates

858
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,580
that are created by the best designers in the biz.

859
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,620
You pull these in and-

860
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,700
Did they get, wait, they got Jerry website?

861
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,260
They got Jerry website, the man for whom-

862
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,340
This dude definitely knows how to cyber.

863
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,180
Yeah.

864
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,000
And you can sell products.

865
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,940
Okay.

866
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,700
You can sell products with the Squarespace website

867
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,100
and they've got blogging tools.

868
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,740
You can share your photos, videos, recommendations.

869
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,820
Like it is a very powerful tool.

870
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,740
I've used it to make websites and now you can too,

871
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,700
even if you like me haven't edited since the WYSIWYG days.

872
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,080
Can I use it to share my Grinch fan art?

873
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
Is that your website idea?

874
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,820
It actually says, I'm looking at the Squarespace

875
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,780
terms of conditions and it says here that's forbidden,

876
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,740
only from Travis.

877
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,300
But it's only implied erotica.

878
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,900
Yeah, no, they said they hate it.

879
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,100
They said they hate it in the terms of condition.

880
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,620
They went explicit?

881
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,460
Yeah.

882
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,020
Oh, I don't know if I could do that

883
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,260
to my hero of the Grinch.

888
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,300
Sometimes we cross the finish line of an advertisement

889
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,820
and one of us is just sort of dragging the like

890
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,580
sort of whole riddled sack of the ad copy behind us

891
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,060
as it sort of just tumbles out the back.

892
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,860
Well, it's just like, imagine if you were watching

893
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,260
like a relay race and between like racer three and four

894
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,540
instead of a baton, they just handed them a dildo

895
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,540
and then they were like, oh, okay.

896
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,100
They just had to carry that across the finish line.

897
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,960
This is what they gave me, man, I don't know.

898
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,300
The grocery bags are torn and I'm just picking

899
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,220
the cans of peas up from the parking lot.

900
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,180
Yeah, and Justin's like, Justin's like,

901
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,380
don't worry guys, I got it.

902
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,380
And me and Travis are just leg wrestling in the grass.

903
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,300
You probably already have a favorite animal.

904
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,180
Maybe it's a powerful apex predator like the tiger

905
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,900
or a cute and cuddly panda.

906
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,820
And those are great, but have you considered something

907
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,300
a little more unconventional?

908
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,620
Could I perhaps interest you in the Greenland shark,

909
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,980
which can live for nearly 400 years

910
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,100
or maybe the jewel wasp who performs brain surgery

911
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,620
on cockroaches to control their minds.

912
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,820
On Just the Zoo of Us, we review animals

913
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,220
by giving them ratings out of 10

914
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,540
in the categories of effectiveness, ingenuity

915
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,660
and aesthetics.

916
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,980
Listen with friends and family of all ages

917
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,740
to find your new favorite animal with Just the Zoo of Us

918
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,580
on maximumfun.org or wherever you get podcasts.

919
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,580
Hello, I'm a stuffy Dowager Countess.

920
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,740
Travis?

921
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,260
I'm judging everybody's manners.

922
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,100
Oh no.

923
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,020
Schmaners isn't judgy, it's about teaching you

924
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,860
to be your best self and be a little more confident

925
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,420
when you enter social situations that you don't understand

926
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,060
and maybe also teach you a little bit about history

927
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,340
you didn't know or give you interesting things

928
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,540
to talk about at parties.

929
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,860
Yeah, like the secret life of Emily Post.

930
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,380
Or like why wristwatches are the way that they are.

931
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,580
We can talk about table manners from the Victorian era.

932
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,180
Sure, or what it's like to attend a Regency ball.

933
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,020
Yeah.

934
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,940
You can find all that and more

935
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,820
if you listen to Schmaners on Maximum Fun

936
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:48,220
or wherever your podcasts come from, I guess.

937
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,500
Manner Schmaners, get it?

938
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,940
Now, Travis, I believe that before we were so rudely

939
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,860
interrupted by this capitalist hellscape,

940
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,540
which we are in prison,

941
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,460
that you were about to play along at home.

942
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,020
I was about to play along at home,

943
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,140
but what I've done, and I worked really hard on that,

944
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,500
I took some time away from my family

945
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,300
during the holiday season.

946
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Have you polished up this bit?

947
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,900
I love a lot of your bits, I can admit now,

948
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,580
because of lots of therapy.

949
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,420
Thank you.

950
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,460
But this one, I still don't know if it's there yet.

951
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,300
I have-

952
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
I think what's so energizing about this show-

953
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,340
I have two sets of questions.

954
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,020
We're able to workshop things as we do them.

955
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,540
I have two sets of questions.

956
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,380
Okay.

957
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,820
One set of questions is about Disneyland

958
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,300
or Disney theme parks.

959
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,140
Right.

960
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,460
One set of questions is about Pokemon.

961
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,300
We've done-

962
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,140
Griffin-

963
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:39,960
I think we've done this exactly-

964
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,900
Yes, I know, but this time I've carefully balanced it.

965
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,420
I've gone through, I focus tested these

966
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,500
to make sure they were balanced.

967
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,580
Griffin, I'll be asking you the Disney questions.

968
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,300
Justin, I'll be asking you the Pokemon questions.

969
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,060
We should call this the chuckle lab.

970
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
Okay, you ready?

971
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,740
When Travis has a bit, we'll call it the chuckle lab

972
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,980
and it's the experiment and we're all in it.

973
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,060
You're in it if you're listening.

974
00:39:59,060 --> 00:39:59,900
We're all in it.

975
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,020
We're all scientists.

976
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,420
Griffin, in 2006, Disney regained the rights

977
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,700
to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit by trading NBC what?

978
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,940
One of the Huey, Dewey, Louie duck nephews.

979
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,780
No, I'm sorry.

980
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,900
They used to be Huey, Dewey, and Greg.

981
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,540
Yeah, got rid of him, checked him out

982
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,380
because he didn't rhyme.

983
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,140
It was the services of sports commentator, Owl Michaels.

984
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,580
Okay, that's wild.

985
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,980
That's really cool that they were able to do that.

986
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:33,820
Yes.

987
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,860
Who is that good for?

988
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,880
Who's ego does that boost?

989
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,580
I have to know.

990
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,300
Cause like on the one hand, it seems like, wow,

991
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,720
that's to trade a whole IP just for this one guy.

992
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,000
But then from Owl Michael's perspective, it's like,

993
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,140
I'm who?

994
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,180
I'm equal to what now?

995
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,020
Apparently Bob Iger-

996
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm moving my beautiful family.

997
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:56,980
I'm moving my beautiful wife and three children

998
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,460
to Santa Clara, California, across the country.

999
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,540
So you could have Oswald the Lucky Rabbit

1000
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,320
and put him in Epic Mickey?

1001
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,980
Apparently the dude from ESPN, when they wanted Owl Michael,

1002
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,620
called and it was like, hey, it's me from ABC.

1003
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,980
We would like, Owl Michael's his contacts going.

1004
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,860
And Bob Iger was like, cool, you got it.

1005
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,540
But we want Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

1006
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,580
And the dude from ESPN was like, who is that?

1007
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,480
And Bob Iger said, time for you to do some research.

1008
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,460
Awesome.

1009
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:27,900
They probably could have just done it

1010
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,980
and no one would have been like, hey, do we own that?

1011
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,840
Justin, in the original Pokemon game,

1012
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,680
the three-

1013
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,500
Can I see the other ones?

1014
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,180
The three starters to choose from were Trimander,

1015
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:40,580
Bulbasaur, and what squirting turtle?

1016
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,860
Fuck off Travis.

1017
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,900
Squirtle.

1018
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,440
Okay, that's one for Justin.

1019
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,840
That's dog shit.

1020
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,300
Okay, Griffin, Disney parks have been home

1021
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,140
to a lot of famous rides.

1022
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,420
These rides include Space Mountain, Haunted Mansion,

1023
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,740
and a swashbuckling dark ride.

1024
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:58,300
What was the name of the miniature railroad

1025
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,700
in Walt Disney's backyard?

1026
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,580
The Zephyr.

1027
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,220
No, I'm sorry, it was Carrollwood Pacific Railroad.

1028
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,780
He had a miniature railroad in his backyard.

1029
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,620
Okay.

1030
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,660
You think we're gonna be able to ride the train

1031
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,700
at Disney World again soon?

1032
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,740
It feels like it's coming up.

1033
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,460
They finished the tunnel through Tron.

1034
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,500
Justin, in the animated series, Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum

1035
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,640
was accompanied by his buddy Pikachu.

1036
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,220
What was Pikachu's catchphrase on the show?

1037
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,100
Pika P?

1038
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
We'll accept that.

1039
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,580
It was Pikachu, but we'll take it.

1040
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,420
Yeah, okay.

1041
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,240
I think that this sucks.

1042
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,420
I think it sucks for a lot of reasons.

1043
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,180
Griffin, arguably the most creative Disney Imagineer,

1044
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,860
visionary Tony Baxter was born on what day?

1045
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,960
Christmas.

1046
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,420
No, I'm sorry, he was February 1st, 1947.

1047
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,420
He had a hand in the creation of Star Tours,

1048
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,500
Big Thunder Mountain.

1049
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Really Griffin?

1050
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,700
The journey into imagination and many others,

1051
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,260
including what would have been a Jules Verne themed land

1052
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,900
called Discovery Land or Discovery Bay.

1053
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,420
That's interesting, that's interesting.

1054
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,900
Justin, name a Pokemon.

1055
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:05,740
God.

1056
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,500
You can do this.

1057
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,580
Mr. Mime?

1058
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,840
We'll accept that, yes, Mr. Mime.

1059
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,260
That's three for three, Justin.

1060
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,620
You kicked Griffin's ass.

1061
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,620
Woo!

1062
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,580
You don't have any more for me?

1063
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,500
Because I feel like now I'm all out.

1064
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,900
Justin, you sure know a lot about Pokemon.

1065
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,940
I feel like I'm kind of a renaissance dude.

1066
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,540
Like I know Pokemon and Disney, you know what I mean?

1067
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,460
Griffin, you don't know shit.

1068
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,660
That's like unnecessarily cruel.

1069
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,460
I was trying to trash talk.

1070
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,540
Here's the thing, here's the thing what sucks.

1071
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,620
That Justin's questions were a lot easier than mine.

1072
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,460
No, I worked very carefully to balance them out.

1073
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,100
They were objectively much easier.

1074
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,300
And last time we did it,

1075
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,740
I feel like my questions were easier

1076
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,540
and Justin's was harder.

1077
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,540
And I'm wondering if maybe we need a fourth party

1078
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,340
who can step in and do a little game balance

1079
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,540
before the next time we do the segment.

1080
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,620
Well, we don't have a fourth brother.

1081
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,820
So I don't know how that would work.

1082
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,100
Yeah, no, but dad just did just text us literally

1083
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,180
this exact moment.

1084
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,420
Does anybody want to learn Yooker?

1085
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:18,860
I already fucking know Yooker.

1086
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,180
We all already know Yooker, but regardless,

1087
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,660
I think dad's our fourth brother.

1088
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,140
Just from the text messages.

1089
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,140
Sometimes we get texts from Dan

1090
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,020
and it feels like we haven't spoken to him in six years.

1091
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,020
No, okay, he is referencing the fact

1092
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,660
that we were chatting about Marvel Snap.

1093
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,820
It was a good goof.

1094
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,660
Oh yeah, that is a great goof.

1095
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,420
We're talking about Marvel Snap in that chat.

1096
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,260
I'm actually quite good at Yooker already, fuck.

1097
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,060
Dad plays a lot of Marvel Snap, y'all.

1098
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,820
Travis plays a lot, dad plays a lot.

1099
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,180
I play just a regular amount.

1100
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:52,180
And I go on card dates with the babes.

1101
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,340
Whoa, that's a big thing to admit,

1102
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,100
you're philandering and you're cheating on your wife.

1103
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,140
Oh babe, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1104
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,660
No, not me.

1105
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,140
They're gonna find out about my babe-based card dates.

1106
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:07,180
Griffin, turn off your camera.

1107
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:08,020
Okay, okay.

1108
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,540
And be quiet.

1109
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,700
Hey guys, it's Justin and Travis

1110
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,900
from the McElroy brothers.

1111
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,460
God, I never thought we'd have to do this one.

1112
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,300
It's so hard.

1113
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,140
As you know, No Dude Wife guy, Griffin McElroy,

1114
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,900
and our former brother has been,

1115
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,340
Trav, how would you say it, I mean?

1116
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,900
Revealed, has been unmasked.

1117
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,100
Unmasked, unmasked.

1118
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,060
God.

1119
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,180
It's a real piece of shit.

1120
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,180
He's been going on card dates with babes.

1121
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,980
With babes, multiple babes.

1122
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,820
Multiple babes.

1123
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,820
Multiple card dates.

1124
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,860
Probably multiple cards.

1125
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,100
Oh, he's on one right now.

1126
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,140
He's on right.

1127
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,940
Hey guys, I just got, hold on guys.

1128
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,380
I just drove my car into my third story window

1129
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,860
and parked it.

1130
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,540
Were you talking something about me?

1131
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,940
I'm just doing normal shit.

1132
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,180
Grocery store shit.

1133
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,500
Griffin, Griffin, you still have a whole card date

1134
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,380
with babe vibe around you.

1135
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,020
I'm not on a card date with six babes right now.

1136
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,820
Stop it.

1137
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,420
Hey, it's multiple babes at the same time, Griffin?

1138
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,980
That's not even fair to the babes.

1139
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,740
Do they know about each other?

1140
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,140
Even this bit makes me hugely,

1141
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:20,660
deeply uncomfortable, hugely.

1142
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:21,660
Take the glasses off.

1143
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,780
Yeah, you did a costume change for this bit.

1144
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,860
He did a costume change.

1145
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,340
I mean, it's a great, don't get me wrong, man.

1146
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,220
I don't regret the bit,

1147
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,060
because I think it's pretty-

1148
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,580
You look like Blue Beetle from DC Comics.

1149
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,780
I think it's pretty funny.

1150
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,020
I thought it was a pretty, post-game,

1151
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,620
I thought it was a pretty funny bit.

1152
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,060
It made me feel deeply uncomfortable while doing it.

1153
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,740
You're still wearing the sunglasses.

1154
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,540
They're prescriptions, so they're fine.

1155
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,380
It's fine.

1156
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,180
Hey.

1157
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,700
I wanna munch.

1158
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,260
Squad.

1159
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,780
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1160
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,780
I want to munch.

1161
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,700
Squad.

1162
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,420
Welcome to Munch Squad,

1163
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,420
Podcast within podcast,

1164
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:08,820
profiling latest, greatest brand eating

1165
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,100
at two, two, two, two scoops of news for you today.

1166
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,540
One is KFC is giving the gift of $5 famous bowls

1167
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,380
and limited edition holiday buckets.

1168
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,380
Sorry, Starbucks, but the Colonel has his own thing.

1169
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,100
It's chicken time for the holiday season.

1170
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,380
KFC is debuting, I always get confused about it.

1171
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,220
Debuting?

1172
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,220
Debuting.

1173
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,060
Debuting.

1174
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,880
Debuting.

1175
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,720
New bargains and buckets

1176
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,220
to make it easier to enjoy all of your celebrations.

1177
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,940
Whether you're looking to sneak away

1178
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,020
for a quick bite to fuel your holiday shopping.

1179
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,860
Hell yeah.

1180
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,720
Sneak away from your family?

1181
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,560
Is that what you mean?

1182
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,400
You need a whole bucket of KFC.

1183
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,240
You need a whole bucket of KFC.

1184
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,380
They say sneak away from your family.

1185
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,420
For a bucket of chicken.

1186
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,660
To eat a bucket of chicken by yourself in private.

1187
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,500
Yeah.

1188
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,960
Just silent nodding to the other patrons like,

1189
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,340
yeah, me too, buddy.

1190
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,420
Yeah, I think that there was another box of decorations

1191
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,700
in the garage and I missed it.

1192
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,580
I gotta go look.

1193
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,420
What are you talking about?

1194
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,020
It's December 22nd.

1195
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,580
I gotta just, I'll be back in about 15 minutes.

1196
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,860
Hey, when I drove the kids to school this morning,

1197
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,620
it smelled like, and there was a big empty bucket

1198
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,020
of Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1199
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:23,320
Did you maybe eat a whole one of those

1200
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,380
while sitting idling in the car

1201
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,700
in the Target parking lot yesterday?

1202
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,020
Raccoon must've gotten in the car again.

1203
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:31,620
Raccoons, damn, they bring chicken into cars

1204
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,980
and eat it and leave it.

1205
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,860
Three-time Grammy-nominated rap superstar Jack Harlow

1206
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,860
teams up with acclaimed comedian and entrepreneur Drewski

1207
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,540
to promote the $5 deal.

1208
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:46,360
Okay.

1209
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,100
Based on a childhood memory of being in his dad's truck

1210
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,580
and picking up a KFC in the drive-through,

1211
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,100
the press release says picking up a KFC in the drive-through.

1212
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:03,100
So I don't, he's got some serious towing capacity.

1213
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,900
It's gotta be a Ram 1500, maybe even a 25.

1214
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,180
It's got a Hemi.

1215
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,260
This one's got a Hemi.

1216
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,740
Picking up KFC in the drive-through,

1217
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,100
Harlow's nostalgia for the famous bowl

1218
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,380
transports him to an animated world of memories

1219
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,460
of enjoying the iconic bowl.

1220
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,340
How old is Jack Harlow?

1221
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:22,460
Is this the, this is what I'm,

1222
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,740
this kind of threw me, right?

1223
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,880
Because has the famous bowl been a goof for long enough

1224
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,020
that it went around?

1225
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay, Jack Harlow is only 24 years old.

1226
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,980
So I can believe that he has nostalgia,

1227
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,380
but how do you have nostalgia

1228
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,980
for a thing that still exists?

1229
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,140
I'm confused about that.

1230
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,260
And is gross.

1231
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,100
Also that.

1232
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,780
Bigger question.

1233
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,620
I just wanna point out,

1234
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,560
Young Gravy is older than Jack Harlow.

1235
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,180
So a little bit of mislabeling, more like Old Gravy.

1236
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,180
My favorite part of the famous bowl

1237
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,740
is the thick and gelatinous layer of Young Gravy.

1238
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:58,580
Exactly.

1239
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,580
Sprinkle on top of it.

1240
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,540
Let's see if there's anything.

1241
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:08,560
They have a new sharing is caring themed holiday bucket.

1242
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,540
Here's the quote.

1243
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,140
The holidays in KFC go hand in hand.

1244
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,260
There's no better way to satisfy a craving

1245
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,860
for comfort and connection

1246
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,340
than by sharing a bucket of KFC

1247
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,220
with family and friends.

1248
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,380
There's no better way.

1249
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,220
That's it.

1250
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,040
Pinnacle.

1251
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,300
Our holiday bucket with free cookies

1252
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,740
and $5 famous bowls are two gifts

1253
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,260
that are sure to feed the joyful moments

1254
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,560
that surrounds this season.

1255
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,300
The other thing I wanted to mention to you guys,

1256
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,140
as long as I have you here,

1257
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,220
if I could borrow a moment,

1258
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,420
one more moment of your time is Panera Bakery Shakes.

1259
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,580
And I'm gonna hold off on showing you the picture of these

1260
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,860
because the picture is really important here

1261
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,620
and maybe we'll upload it somewhere, certainly.

1262
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:48,100
Or we won't.

1263
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,100
They could see a national rollout in 2023

1264
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,500
and the chain began to test them in Texas.

1265
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,180
They're leveraging, Panera is leveraging core bakery items

1266
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,100
and transforming its existing offerings

1267
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,100
to capture younger audiences, drive visitation

1268
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,080
and strengthen attachment across day parts.

1269
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,920
Yeah, for sure.

1270
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,340
Says the robot currently running Panera Bread.

1271
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,260
Day parts?

1272
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,680
On November 16th, Panera launched a test

1273
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,900
in its Texas market of its first bakery shakes.

1274
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,560
And then it says in parenthetical,

1275
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,460
think frozen blended shakes.

1276
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:19,300
Yeah.

1277
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:20,140
That was.

1278
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:25,140
Yeah, man, like a shake, like a shakery,

1279
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:25,980
be a better name.

1280
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:27,820
Panera may roll out this beverage item nationwide

1281
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,500
during the warmer months of 2023.

1282
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,060
This new frozen blended beverage platform

1283
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,960
is the latest example of Panera expanding

1284
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,340
into new menu offerings

1285
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:37,380
after launching grain bowls in 2019

1286
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,540
and flatbread pizzas in 2020.

1287
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,160
And then I guess taking three years off

1288
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,420
to pat themselves on the back

1289
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,600
for how good things are going at Panera.

1290
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,700
Now, this is the actual reason

1291
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,460
I wanted to draw your attention here.

1292
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,340
And let me see if I can.

1293
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,180
Yeah, here we go.

1294
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,220
I'm gonna zoom this in a little bit

1295
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,660
so you have a better view.

1296
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,380
So, huh.

1297
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,700
So look at this for a second, guys.

1298
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,180
Oh, it's a bit.

1299
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,420
What you see, no, it's not a.

1300
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:05,800
Well, but I mean, it's a bit.

1301
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,100
Like when you go, like, you remember that time

1302
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,420
we went to Junior's Cheesecake Place in New York

1303
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:15,220
and it was like, this is a New York style milkshake.

1304
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,820
And it had, much like the one on the right there,

1305
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,740
a whole hunk of cheesecake on top.

1306
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:24,200
But, yeah, but.

1307
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,540
So if you're not looking at these right now,

1308
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,500
it's a chocolate milkshake,

1309
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,060
like a blended cookie milkshake, a strawberry milkshake.

1310
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:32,860
Then stacked on top of the chocolate one

1311
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,340
is two brownies with whipped cream.

1312
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,420
And then there's another one that's two cookies

1313
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:42,020
with pretzels in between them with whipped cream.

1314
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,180
And then there's a third one that's strawberry.

1315
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,460
But these are created.

1316
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,300
Strawberry and cheesecake.

1317
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,420
Strawberry cheesecake.

1318
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,900
These are entirely created in Photoshop.

1319
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,540
Look at the strawberry one.

1320
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:52,980
There is a strawberry balancing

1321
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:54,980
on top of another strawberry.

1322
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,340
They've never done this.

1323
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,340
They've never constructed one of these ever.

1324
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:00,180
Now, Justin.

1325
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,060
They have not made these.

1326
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:01,900
Never.

1327
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,060
This is a joke.

1328
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,220
They have not made them.

1329
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,180
Is it clear in the press release

1330
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,100
whether or not the drinks actually come balanced

1331
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:10,500
with these things on top?

1332
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,660
Or is this just a representation?

1333
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,620
You know what's so confusing to me, Trav?

1334
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,100
If it's a representation,

1335
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,420
then this art is like hugely misleading.

1336
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,540
I mean, the art is not meant to say like, it's like this.

1337
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,820
It's meant to say this will come on top of it.

1338
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,660
For sure.

1339
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:27,460
But it is also so clumsy and precarious

1340
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,620
that this can't be it.

1341
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,460
Also Photoshopped on here,

1342
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,180
the Panera Bread labels on the cup.

1343
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,020
About to point that out.

1344
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:36,260
You guys didn't have those?

1345
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,100
Yeah.

1346
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,540
Andy?

1347
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,540
I am scared to think of what any of these would look like.

1348
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,500
What is going to slide across the counter to me

1349
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:52,500
when I order one of these for me and each of my children is-

1350
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,460
So you want me to moosh the cookies right in there?

1351
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,300
You want me to moosh?

1352
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,140
I know.

1353
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:56,980
Careful.

1354
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:57,820
Here's your drinks.

1355
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:59,220
Oop, all six cookies fell down.

1356
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,140
Like, yeah, man.

1357
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:00,980
For sure.

1358
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,380
Sometimes when we moosh them in there,

1359
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,220
the drink tends to slurp right onto the counter

1360
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,660
and the whole drink slurps out.

1361
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,940
It's just messy cookies.

1362
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:09,140
And then I got fired.

1363
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,860
It's easier this way.

1364
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,420
Take the milkshake in this hand

1365
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,500
and hold out the other hand.

1366
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,420
I'm just going to put the whole slice of cheesecake

1367
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,260
right in there, pal.

1368
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,660
Have fun.

1369
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,460
Squish them together at the table

1370
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,620
like you're making a guacamole.

1371
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,020
It'll be $13.

1372
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,620
Thank you.

1373
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,660
This is good though.

1374
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
Thanks, Panera.

1375
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,860
You're always keeping it real.

1376
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,700
Keeping it real.

1377
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,740
We got time for another question or what's up?

1378
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,700
Yeah, let's do it.

1379
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,900
All right.

1380
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,020
My friend just became a high school theater teacher

1381
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,980
and we just went to the place

1382
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,140
she directed with her students.

1383
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:39,980
It was good.

1384
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:41,300
And I told her I liked it,

1385
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,500
but I feel like she was looking for more feedback,

1386
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,420
but I still don't really know what the director does.

1387
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,340
Even after she's explained it multiple times.

1388
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,140
I know some of it is managing the kids.

1389
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,220
So the best compliment I could come up with was

1390
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,620
it seems like everyone was doing

1391
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:56,140
what they were supposed to be doing.

1392
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,260
Great.

1393
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,060
What does a high school play director do

1394
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,260
and how do I compliment them?

1395
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,980
Okay, so hearing it.

1396
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,820
Can I say as somebody who has directed multiple plays

1397
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,180
with kids in it, you're not entirely wrong.

1398
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,020
You're very close actually.

1399
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,300
Have we all directed plays with children in them?

1400
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,140
No.

1401
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,340
Why would I ever?

1402
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,380
Why would I ever?

1403
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,500
I forgot Griffin hates the theater.

1404
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:25,100
I would say that there's an equal chance

1405
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:27,820
that they want a compliment, sure.

1406
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:32,780
But also a chance to complain about the entire process

1407
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,820
with another adult.

1408
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,820
They want a chance to justify the failings

1409
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,900
and blame it on the children.

1410
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,420
I think you would actually be better served

1411
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,020
if you could pick out who was the real stinker of there

1412
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,980
and just be like, but can we talk about

1413
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,900
newsy number three or whatever?

1414
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,340
Cause that kid was fucking phoning it.

1415
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,060
Guarantee they'd be like, thank you.

1416
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,300
Yes, thank you.

1417
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,940
The worst, worst kid.

1418
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,460
A bad adult, I will ghost that far.

1419
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,420
They will be a bad adult when they get older.

1420
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,180
They're the worst.

1421
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,420
That I think is like, hey, it seems like everyone was doing

1422
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,900
what they're supposed to be doing.

1423
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,220
Kids were having fun up there.

1424
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:07,300
The story made sense.

1425
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,060
That's a triumph when you have children delivering lines.

1426
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:10,940
All good.

1427
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,460
But a chance to be like, did you see her pirouette

1428
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:16,460
in the second act?

1429
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,620
That was the best I could get out of her.

1430
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,820
I know.

1431
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:22,980
Why would a director be in charge of that?

1432
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,060
Because it's a high school production Griffin

1433
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:27,460
and not fucking Broadway.

1434
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,700
You don't think they have a choreographer?

1435
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,980
Well, it might end up being like our high school productions

1436
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,860
where there was like five different adults

1437
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,500
all claiming to be equal parts in charge.

1438
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,660
Which made for some real solid continuity

1439
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,940
to the entire show.

1440
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,740
Man, every children's theater show we ever did

1441
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,700
felt pretty strict in terms of you can't just make shit up

1442
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,260
and change the play whenever you want.

1443
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,900
But all the high school shows we did were like,

1444
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,220
have fucking fun, man.

1445
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,740
I was just thinking about the other day,

1446
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,740
our high school put on a production of Great Expectations

1447
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,300
and the director, who I will not name,

1448
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:11,380
the director of the show thought it would be a badass idea

1449
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,620
if the main character of Great Expectations

1450
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:16,700
after the show ends, and I think there's like a fire

1451
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,260
and maybe the old lady dies, Miss Havisham, I don't know,

1452
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,860
but thought it'd be badass

1453
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,020
if before the main character walked off the stage,

1454
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,420
before curtains drew,

1455
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,420
looked at the audience and went, great expectations.

1456
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:36,020
Just like toss that shit right there on the end.

1457
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,100
In that way, great expectations.

1458
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,860
Just like they do it in the book, though.

1459
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,100
Have you read the book?

1460
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,700
Well, because at first, the expectations, they're great.

1461
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:48,820
And your expectations, they go down.

1462
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,740
Realize in the middle of saying the title of the play

1463
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,660
that you are now sad because of the events that unfolded.

1464
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,900
That's a kick-ass note.

1465
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,180
Thanks, director.

1466
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,380
And that's double cool

1467
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,780
because that director had that idea and then stuck to it.

1468
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,980
And it's like, they heard the kid say it that way

1469
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,940
and went, yes, control S, save.

1470
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:11,540
To his credit, that the guy who was playing that role

1471
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,780
didn't deliver that, did deliver the line

1472
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,020
more in a mumbly way and every night got the same note

1473
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,780
of like, hey, you're doing great

1474
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,220
and it's a heavy load that you carry up there,

1475
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,620
but do remember at the end,

1476
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,500
that light is supposed to be delivered.

1477
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,780
Great expectations.

1478
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,220

1479
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,060

We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1481
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,100
Trav, what's all the stuff we gotta tell people?

1482
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,020
Oh, thank you so much for asking, Justin.

00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,100

in San Jose and Denver.

1508
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:37,380
April 27th, we're gonna be in San Jose

1509
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,780
doing TAZ with Aabria Iyengar.

00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:57,820
Correct.

1517
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:58,700
That felt good.

1518
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,540
It felt right.

1519
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,700
Mask and proof of full vaccination

1520
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,080
or negative COVID test within 72 hours of event start

1521
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:03,920
will be required.

1522
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:04,740
Did I already say that?

1523
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:08,260
I don't remember, but now I've done and said it twice,

1524
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:09,580
if so.

1525
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,220
Thanks to Montaigne for the Use of Our Theme Song.

1526
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,860
My life is better with you.

1527
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,980
It's a jammer and a slammer,

1528
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:19,700
and you should get the album making it

1529
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,660
because it's one of my favorites of the whole dang year.

1530
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,100
And also, the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

1533
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:36,100
Listen, that was a lot of stuff.

1534
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:37,800
It is a lot of stuff.

1535
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,540
I think, who is it gonna be this time?

1536
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,060
We gotta come up with something.

1537
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,260
Yeah, I think Justin,

1538
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,540
I feel like Justin has something important

1539
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:47,860
to say to the audience.

1540
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:48,980
It felt like it.

1541
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,500
That was mine.

1542
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,780
We gotta come up with something?

1543
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,740
Gotta come up with something.

1544
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:57,460
Is that a sort of general, like for everyone?

1545
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,100
Just everybody like, we gotta come up with something.

1546
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,180
So just like a general blue sky opportunity for humanity

1547
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,020
to come up with something.

1548
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,700
We gotta come up with something.

1549
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,540
Yeah.

1550
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,360
What does that mean to you?

1551
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,340
That's the power of it, right?

1552
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:11,700
It can mean anything.

1553
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,260
No, it means probably one of two things.

1554
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:15,040
I don't think there's that many interpretations

1555
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,140
of what you just said.

1556
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,180
Yeah, okay.

1557
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,260
Agree to disagree.

1558
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:23,580

This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me,

1562
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,700
and we gotta come up with something.

1563
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,140
Hey, get your dad's gargoyles.

1564
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:49,140
It's better with you.

1565
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,140
Is it true?

1566
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:53,140
It's better.

1567
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,140
It's better with you.

1568
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,140
