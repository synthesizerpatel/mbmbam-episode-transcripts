1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show from the modern

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,480
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,520
And boy, it's an exciting day. The tingles on this end are just, it's electric.

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,240
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel for the first time.

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,480
Yeah, it's like I'm sitting on a bumblebee.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,400
So off mic, we had a conversation, it's been going for months now, that it seems like there's

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,920
a trend in celebrities like throwing their weight and like all their investment and money and stuff

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,240
behind a brand. You know, you have like Kanye West and like his line of clothes and shoes and stuff,

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,880
and like Kim K, she's got a lot of money tied up in things. There's Goop, whatever that is.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,160
No one's quite sure what it is.

16
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,280
No one knows what that is. And so we've been looking for what's our product.

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,880
I mean, let's do like a bit of a reveal, right? Like let's put a little bit of that apple stink

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:55,840
on it. So folks, close your eyes. And we're going to start saying some words and we want

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,760
you to start thinking about the void in your life that these words could fill.

20
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,680
I'll start with high end.

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,600
Luxury.

22
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,740
Youth.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Morning time.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,860
Hot.

25
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,500
What? Wake up. Wake up. Oh, wake up and smell the future.

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,980
Grind up the day.

27
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,780
Grind up the day with, can we say it at the same time or?

28
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,220
I don't know if Skype will allow for that, but we'll see.

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,100
Let's just start whispering it over and over again.

30
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,660
Bean juice. Bean juice. Bean juice. Bean juice.

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,500
I'm just now realizing when we say it that, hold on, I'll edit this out because we got

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,580
to really, we can't like fuck this up because we have just, I have so much money invested

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,780
in this, but I just realized that when you say bean juice a lot in a row, it does sound

34
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,220
a lot like Beetlejuice and I don't want to scare the people.

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,820
Bean juice.

36
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,660
Hey Griffin, you're still cutting this out, right?

37
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,700
Yes, yes, yes.

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,060
Okay, good. As long as you're still editing because I'm so fucking scared about this.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,380
I know.

40
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,100
It seemed like a really good idea, but like, bean juice, saying it is tough, right?

41
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,340
Yeah.

42
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,940
Okay, now back to the pitch, back to the pitch.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,540
All right, hold on, let me do some claps.

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,220
Bean juice. Bean juice.

45
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,780
Oh, what is it? Oh, you're probably sitting there thinking like, is it, I don't know,

46
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,180
that you know when you open a can of beans and there's some juice?

47
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,380
No, it's not that.

48
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,860
What is that?

49
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,420
Can we stop that? I'll edit this out again.

50
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:34,100
That's kind of where I go and again, it's not super good or appetizing.

51
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,100
I don't want to drink that because that is, when I Googled bean juice,

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,700
that is like the first result and I don't know how we're going to beat that.

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,060
Griffin, we talked about this, we have to be fucking committed or nobody's going to buy it.

54
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,700
Okay, you're right.

55
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,340
Cut back, cut back, put it, clap it in.

56
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,300
No, it's not the juice from a bean can. Who would think of that?

57
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,420
You might think, is it like coffee?

58
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,860
And yes.

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,060
And yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,660
You got it in too. It is a, well, not a coffee.

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,260
Griffin, can you edit this out?

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,900
Yeah.

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,660
Okay, I think maybe it does sound like it should have been coffee.

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,020
We should be doing coffee and not just a coffee mug.

65
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,500
Because if we just say that, is there any way we can get ahead of this and do just

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,820
more than a coffee mug because I feel like then it's going to be very transparent.

67
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,260
Right, it's going to be very transparent that we paid for all these mugs that say bean juice on

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,300
them and then we try to justify it by then retro-

69
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,620
Oh wait, okay, wait, edit, edit, edit me back in.

70
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,180
Are you ready?

71
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,220
No, everybody's got coffee.

72
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,700
But the question is, where do you put it?

73
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,500
In that old gross mug that you've had since like high school that's all gross?

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,460
No, in our high-end VIP mug.

75
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,300
It's revolutionary.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,460
How are you going to know where to pour this luxury brown sauce?

77
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,780
This high, this high-end, hot, this hot bean juice.

78
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,980
This hot bean juice.

79
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,860
Wait, we're not selling the hot bean juice part.

80
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,580
No, no, no, no, no.

81
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,140
Okay.

82
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,540
But like, where do you even know where to and how to put it?

83
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,180
Here's a mug that tells you.

84
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,980
It's made of ceramic or something.

85
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,540
We didn't sign off on that or any part of the design.

86
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,740
There's a design on it that says bean juice.

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,300
And it's one word modern.

88
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,020
And you can find it today.

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,100
And can I cut the, can we, can I cut it?

90
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,860
I don't know, guys.

92
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,260
I don't know.

93
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,020
We probably should, we should make it sound like there's only a couple

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,260
instead of like the tens of thousands.

95
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,020
They're going to see right the fuck through that.

96
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,380
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

97
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,420
Yes, yes.

98
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,940
And we can do it like a contest.

99
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,460
Okay, cut it back in, cut it back in.

100
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,740
So we have a contest to announce alongside.

101
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,260
And it's that one, there's two cups.

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,980
There's only two mugs and to get them, you have to give us 100.

103
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,140
How much did we, how much?

104
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,740
Okay, 100 is too much.

105
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,780
Justin, what was our overhead?

106
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,500
Oh, per cup?

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,860
It's a pay what you can.

108
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,180
Is that, that was bad for a mug, right?

109
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,740
Yeah, that's no good.

110
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,180
Because there are fixed costs.

111
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:21,300
This is a great opportunity for you to enter a contest where you could win one of two coffee cups.

112
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,580
By buying them.

113
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,100
And shit, I said coffee cups.

114
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,780
We said this mug is sexier.

115
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,060
And it can be anything.

116
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,020
And it's bean juice.

117
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,460
You have to say bean juice mug, Griffin.

118
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,420
You can't say coffee.

119
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,700
We can also just say like that it's these, what makes a bean juice mug different?

120
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,980
It makes the coffee taste better.

121
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,540
And also you can't break it no matter how hard you try.

122
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,780
And if you do break it, we will replace it.

123
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,580
Oh, okay.

124
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,020
We will replace it at the exact additional cost.

125
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,580
Shit, that's not, none of that, that doesn't work.

126
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,340
That doesn't, that doesn't work.

127
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,620
No, for the same cost, well.

128
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,980
Please buy mugs.

129
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,780
Please just buy mugs.

130
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,740
Please, okay, listen.

131
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,540
We have four kids at this point between the three of us.

132
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,940
And we put all of their college funds into bean juice.

133
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,860
It's all our brains on this, guys.

134
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,260
We just, we thought maybe bean juice.

135
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,580
I just got a fucking whole pallet of these fucking mugs, guys.

136
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,020
I don't even know where I keep them.

137
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,180
Rachel's gonna be so fucking TO'd.

138
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Guys, real quick, we forgot to,

139
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,820
we forgot to get a URL for the mugs.

140
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,660
Where should I put, what should I get?

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,340
Beanjuice.xxx?

142
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,940
I can't get beanjuice.com.

143
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,820
I can't get beanjuice.xxx.

144
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,620
Oh, no.

145
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:30,120
Oh, no.

146
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,780
That's so bad.

147
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,980
That's so bad.

148
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,260
Beanjuice Brothers?

149
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,740
Beanjuice Brothers is so much more to type.

150
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,300
I can get beanjuice.horse, that's nothing.

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,740
What about Brother Juice?

152
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,460
I get a no.

153
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,700
I get an IP address.

154
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,940
No, our lawyer who sits in the corner

155
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,100
when we record is looking at me shaking his head.

156
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,140
I typed in, whoa, I can get brotherjuice.com,

157
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,380
which I may just pick up as long as I'm shopping.

158
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,660
Just think you have it.

159
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,980
Just as like an impulse buy by the register.

160
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm just gonna add that to the cart real quick.

161
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,380
How about beanjuicemugsforsale.com?

162
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,860
Perfect.

163
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,460
That works for me.

164
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
I like how brief it is.

165
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,340
Number four or spelled out?

166
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,860
Beanjuice Mugs, the number four seems easy.

167
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,740
That's quicker to type.

168
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,540
Shorter, yeah.

169
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,940
So you can just try that link.

170
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,300
It'll take you right to the mugs.

171
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,180
It's a new brand.

172
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,340
A new, oh, fuck.

173
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,500
What's our first question?

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
Here's my first question.

175
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,420
What did we do?

176
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,980
My wife thinks I'm bad at napkins.

177
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,460
She claims this because whenever I go out to eat

178
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,180
at a place where you have to get your own napkins, I do not.

179
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,740
The reason I don't is because someone always gets napkins

180
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,740
and they inevitably grab more than they need.

181
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,940
Then I swoop the unused napkins as needed and life goes on.

182
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,860
She maintains this is rude behavior.

183
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,860
I maintain it is napkin efficient.

184
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,980
Who is right in this?

185
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,340
And that's from nipping napkins.

186
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,460
Wow, that's actually, hmm.

187
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,260
This is a good one.

188
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,900
This is a good one.

189
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,460
I never, I never grab napkins.

190
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,300
I'm just sitting here thinking about that,

191
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,820
unless I'm dining alone.

192
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,020
I never grab napkins because I assume my wife got napkins.

193
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,060
I am the opposite.

194
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,900
Where I, when said like get however many,

195
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,820
I don't know, ketchup packets or straws

196
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,900
or napkins you need on your own.

197
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,980
I suddenly am just like, I have no concept.

198
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Like I'll get three straws for one drink.

199
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,980
And now inevitably it does always pan out

200
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,940
because someone at the table didn't grab straws.

201
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,300
And it does, it is, someone has to be the grasshopper

202
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,660
and someone has to be the aunt.

203
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,620
That's just it.

204
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,780
I feel like without your services,

205
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,380
there's gonna be a lot of napkins

206
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,500
just getting thrown in the Fazzoli's garbage can.

207
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,980
The world needs big, beautiful napkin boats,

208
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,620
but it needs those napkin barnacles too.

209
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,820
Feeding off the underbelly

210
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,380
of the more responsible clean-handed parties among us.

211
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,940
Because I'm with you and Rachel always does.

212
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,100
And then it's a zero-sum game.

213
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,780
You know what?

214
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,060
I would say, I like when I grab ketchup packets

215
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,140
and it's like, oh no, too many ketchup packets.

216
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,860
They're still in individual containers that I take with me.

217
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,940
Maybe from now on, if I get too many napkins,

218
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,780
I just take those napkins with me

219
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,140
and I use them again later.

220
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,260
Those are some free napkins.

221
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,940
This is a life hack from me to you.

222
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,780
Don't wanna buy your own napkins for home?

223
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,780
Good news, go to Fazzoli's.

224
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,300
Get some napkins from Fazzoli's.

225
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,820
They got you.

226
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,700
They got you.

227
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,620
They say take as many as you want.

228
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,300
Just take the whole container.

229
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,180
Can I talk about it?

230
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,660
This has led me to a serious situation

231
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,620
regarding Panera Bread that I wanted to hit you guys with.

232
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,180
This is a big problem for me and I wanna talk you guys through it.

233
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,900
I go to Panera Bread at the mall, right?

234
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,700
You know the one.

235
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,300
You know the Panera Bread up there.

236
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,140
Justin's Place, I call it.

237
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,940
Justin's Place.

238
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,140
So two times ago, time before last, I went into Panera Bread.

239
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,580
Go in with my family, my family.

240
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,020
We walk into Panera Bread.

241
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,700
We are in the back of the line.

242
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,060
At this point, a gentleman walks up to us

243
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,180
and asks where we'd like to sit at Panera Bread.

244
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,860
And then asks if we'll need a high chair

245
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,900
and says he'll find a spot for us and put a high chair there.

246
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,300
That's problem one because I would like to pick

247
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,980
where I'm going to sit at Panera Bread.

248
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,100
You have taken that from me.

249
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,380
You've taken my agency and this is extremely problematic.

250
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,260
I've also never encountered a host at Panera Bread.

251
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,540
Second, yes, exactly Travis.

252
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:27,300
Second thing that comes is I go up and order my food.

253
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,060
I go back to the table with my pager

254
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,140
that's supposed to buzz when my salad

255
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,340
and my family's food, which is two grilled cheese sandwiches

256
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,580
for my daughters and a salad for my wife.

257
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,300
When the food is done, I'm to be buzzed.

258
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,180
This same gentleman who we'll call Dave

259
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,900
rolls up to the table and takes my pager away from me

260
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,500
and says he'll let me know when it's ready.

261
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,540
Huh, huh, Justin.

262
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
Right, huh, huh.

263
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,820
And then I'm like, okay, well this sucks.

264
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,220
He brings the food back,

265
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,620
asks if I need any salt, pepper or butter.

266
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,420
No, I don't.

267
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I don't need butter, Daniel.

268
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,900
Secondly-

269
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,860
It was Dave.

270
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,380
Dave, sorry, Dave was his name.

271
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,420
You're breaking the fiction.

272
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,700
Secondly, thirdly, his hands are very dirty.

273
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,260
Now Justin, he gets guacamole all over my damn plate.

274
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,340
Was he dressed in any such manner

275
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,900
that would make you think he worked at Panera Bread?

276
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,060
None of it, none of it.

277
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,380
It's yes, okay, yes, but his actions were so off the grid

278
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,420
that it made me feel like he's gone rogue state or something.

279
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,380
Like he has become a bad actor.

280
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,900
Dave, there hasn't been a Dave here in over 50 years.

281
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,660
Yeah, you got ghost served.

282
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,740
I mean, we did suggest, I believe,

283
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,500
either last or two episodes ago

284
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,500
that people do take the art of restaurant serving

285
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,620
into their own hands.

286
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,540
So this could be a fan, this could be a fan.

287
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,260
It could be a listener.

288
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,460
He was there the last time we went to Panera too.

289
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,820
And it has gotten to the point

290
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,420
where my agency has been so removed.

291
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,740
I feel like a prisoner in this Panera.

292
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,940
I got up to get a fork for my family

293
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,260
because we needed another one.

294
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,740
And he intercepted me and asked what I needed

295
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
and said he would get it for me.

296
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,300
I want to get my own fork, Dave.

297
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,340
Justin, I'm going to ask you the most important question

298
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,700
about this entire scenario.

299
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:32,980
Yeah.

300
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,740
Did you tip Dave in any way?

301
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,900
Oh, isn't this interesting?

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Now we've gotten to the real crux of the matter, isn't it?

303
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,980
This is interesting because that was every fiber of my body

304
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,140
said you have to tip this person now

305
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,180
who's kept you prisoner at the local Panera Bread.

306
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,860
You have to tip this person.

307
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,300
But I bust my own table at Panera Bread.

308
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,340
There's a system.

309
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,100
I bust my own table, right?

310
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,140
Like I was supposed to find my own family table.

311
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,740
I bust my own table.

312
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,380
So if I do that, then I've just left some dollars on a table.

313
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,860
Like there's nothing, there's nowhere in the system

314
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,100
where he's going to latch onto this money.

315
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,220
So it would be me going to him and just handing him like,

316
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,820
thanks for taking such good care of me.

317
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,940
Please continue these actions for the foreseeable future.

318
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,780
Hi, my name is Justin McElroy.

319
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,540
I wanted to reinforce your behavior at this Panera Bread.

320
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
So now I can't go to this Panera Bread

321
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,060
because this guy is running it like it's his own private opium

322
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,700
den where he's just like catering to everybody's wants

323
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,380
when I just want to enjoy an independent excursion

324
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,180
with my family.

325
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,580
You don't want a Panera Bread concierge.

326
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,780
No, I don't need another layer of interaction here.

327
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,380
I just want to go up and order my food

328
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,220
and then you hand me this great buzzer,

329
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,180
which I love this.

330
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,140
I love the buzzer.

331
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,780
It's fun.

332
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,300
Oh, it's a sexy little device.

333
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,500
This is good tech.

334
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,780
I don't have an iPhone anymore.

335
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,220
I just have one of those buzzers

336
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,380
that I stole from an Outback Steakhouse.

337
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,980
It still buzzes sometimes

338
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,060
and I think somewhere my steak's ready.

339
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,420
It buzzes and that's how I know

340
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,820
that I have to pick up my son from daycare

341
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,100
because he has a sickness.

342
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,660
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

343
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,380
Yes, please.

344
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,340
I'm sorry for your loss, Justin.

345
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,620
I love to go with that Panera Bread

346
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,820
and there's not another one close.

347
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,540
Also, another important announcement earlier.

348
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,780
I laughed hard at your story

349
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,620
and the sound waves I made in Audacity

350
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,620
looked exactly like a fish skeleton.

351
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,060
It was so cool.

352
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,740
This is a Yahoo that was sent in by Amy.

353
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,220
Thanks, Amy.

354
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,340
It's Yahoo Answers user.

355
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,140
Oh, RonPaul2012 who asks,

356
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,260
Oh, okay.

357
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,780
Do I still have fraud protection

358
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,180
if I post pics of my credit cards on Facebook?

359
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,380
Oh my God.

360
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,260
Did you say fraud protection or frond protection?

361
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:52,900
Do you remember?

362
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,860
Update, my friends show off their PS4 flat screen TV in cars.

363
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,180
I want them to think I am rich with credit cards.

364
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,500
Update two, and this is what update two says word for word.

365
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,620
I have life locks so even if someone steals my identity,

366
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,220
I'm confused.

367
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:12,980
Okay.

368
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,860
That sentence still works.

369
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,980
That sentence still functions as a sentence.

370
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,140
But you want all your friends to think

371
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,980
you're rich with credit cards.

372
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,420
And so you post pics of all these hot little plastic guys.

373
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,740
And I mean, here's the thing.

374
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,540
My Facebook group is pretty,

375
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,940
my friend group is pretty tight at this point.

376
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,460
So I'm almost kind of like the idea

377
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,580
of posting one of my credit cards on Facebook

378
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,420
and then seeing who my true friends are.

379
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,860
Yeah, like a honey trap.

380
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,100
Yeah.

381
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,140
I will say to this question asker,

382
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,100
when your friends post pictures of their big screen TVs

383
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,940
and their cars,

384
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,220
they're not saying,

385
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,100
think about all the things I could buy with these cars.

386
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,580
They are saying I used my money to buy these cars.

387
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,420
So if you show your credit card, that's nothing.

388
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,620
That's nothing.

389
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,580
Well, hold on though,

390
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,980
because if you do have a picture of you

391
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,540
with a lot of money that you're rubbing

392
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,660
and touching and throwing.

393
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,380
Justin had credit cards when he was like 15.

394
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,820
Yeah, I got a credit card to get a Reds baseball cap.

395
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,340
It ruined me.

396
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,580
That story ends with me going to a debt consolidation mafia dude.

397
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,220
Getting that wide take.

398
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,340
You still got the hat?

399
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,460
Yeah, I still got the hat.

400
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,420
Give me the hat.

401
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,900
Okay.

402
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,300
Give me the hat.

403
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,180
The hat's mine now.

404
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,780
Unless you get a credit card that has written on it,

405
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,340
like there's a lot of money on this signed Mr. American Express.

406
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,580
Well, there's gotta be still like that Jerry Seinfeld shit, right?

407
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,260
There's still gotta be that black AMX with like,

408
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,260
with a big gold chain around it

409
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,180
that you have to keep attached to your wrist at all times.

410
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,220
Like one of those big, big boys.

411
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,300
One of those, I hear Jerry carries his around

412
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,660
in a big block of ice

413
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,380
and he swings it around on the chain like a mace

414
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,980
and he smashes people who gets in the way

415
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,420
of his big cars and coffee.

416
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,620
Do you think that there's somebody who has

417
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,340
that like super high level credit card

418
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,300
but doesn't have a car to take a picture with

419
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,340
or like a big screen TV to take a picture with?

420
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,820
Not Jerry, because I know he's got cars.

421
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,660
He's got the cars and I bet his TV is at least medium large.

422
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,340
I bet he's got, I mean, it's gotta be 35, 36 inches on this one.

423
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,460
What else is he gonna watch old episodes of his TV show on?

424
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,100
It's actually, he's got a pretty, like it's a 24 inch,

425
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,180
but it's CRT because he can't have any latency

426
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:55,700
when he's trying to get down on some street fighter.

427
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,460
He's a big fucking counter strike head

428
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,540
and you can't just fucking, you can't give him

429
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,420
the kind of delay.

430
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,020
I think there's a cool way to do this.

431
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,540
These pixels are so blurry.

432
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,100
I think there's a cool way to do this.

433
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,060
I think, do you think Jerry Seinfeld still plays Smash Brothers Melee

434
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,180
and he doesn't like anything that, anyway, I could go on.

435
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,780
You could post your credit card

436
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,340
but cover the last number with your thumb.

437
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,540
Perfect.

438
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
And then it's like, yeah, you might get it,

439
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,820
but do you wanna go to the trouble

440
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,060
of typing in 10 different numbers?

441
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:33,620
No.

442
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,500
Of course not.

443
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,580
No, no one's gonna steal that.

444
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,500
Yeah, I think this is a cool thing to do

445
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,540
and I think you should have fraud protection still

446
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,940
because I think they've gotta be ready for this.

447
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
If banks are doing one thing for us,

448
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
let it be this one thing.

449
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,820
Don't let it be thinking that somebody has stolen

450
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,780
my debit card every time I spend more than $8 online

451
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,580
on the internet.

452
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,500
That's not a good service.

453
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,460
This is a good service.

454
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
Protect my man.

455
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,300
I am pretty certain that the thing I'm about to say

456
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,900
is 100% true.

457
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,860
Didn't the person who was on the commercials for LifeLock

458
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,340
and said, this is my social security number

459
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,540
driving around this car,

460
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,780
he got major league identity.

461
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,100
Oh, he got completely shad racked.

462
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,980
Yes.

463
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,820
I thought that was true.

464
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,940
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

465
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,660
Just checking.

466
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,100
Yeah, no, he got demolished his whole life.

467
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,620
His whole life is fucked.

468
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,300
I'm pretty sure the police are there

469
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,220
to stop people from breaking into my house,

470
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,140
but I'm pretty sure if I went somewhere and said,

471
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,660
hey, are you all criminals?

472
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,340
Here's some keys to my house.

473
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,180
Here's when I won't be there.

474
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,580
And also, here's my security system code.

475
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,780
And then if they broke in,

476
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,540
I don't think I could then call the police and be like,

477
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,420
yeah, I did that.

478
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,740
But also, you're the police.

479
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,420
I can't believe we're about to talk about it again,

480
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
but that could be the plot of Home Alone 6

481
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,380
where the sticky bandits have long since died

482
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,420
on one of their capers.

483
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,780
And so Kevin's lonely

484
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,940
and he needs somebody to do his traps on.

485
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,340
And so he goes out and he does a commercial

486
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,780
for local public access.

487
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,980
Here's where my address is.

488
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,340
I'll leave the door unlocked

489
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,820
and I'll leave valuables scattered all throughout the house.

490
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,340
I guarantee people are doing this on Craigslist, right?

491
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,460
Please break into my house.

492
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,620
Sure, people are home aloning.

493
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,420
Home Alone RP.

494
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,060
Uh, yowza.

495
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,140
Hey, should we go to money zone?

496
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,060
I'd love to head on over there.

497
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,300
Because God knows I'll cut this out,

498
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,020
but boy howdy, I could use some liquid assets right now.

499
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,980
We need that money.

500
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,900
Just spraying up a little bit of cash

501
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,500
would be so good for me right now.

502
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,780
Because they didn't warn us on edit

503
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,300
that's out our business money, people.

504
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,180
Didn't tell us that we wouldn't be able

505
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,300
to just get the cut money back whenever we needed it.

506
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,060
I didn't know that we'd have to be sort of

507
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,820
alchemized into sales of the bean juice product.

508
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,140
Our first sponsor this week is stamps.com.

509
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,340
Oh, I love them.

510
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah, I love them too.

511
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,260
I love to go to the post office

512
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,820
and everybody there is so nice and helpful,

513
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,900
but sometimes I don't have the time for it.

514
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,340
I'm a busy parent who's got,

515
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,940
you know, I got taekwondo class,

516
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,620
I gotta bake muffins for the glee club or whatever,

517
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,820
you know, other parent stuff.

518
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,180
And I don't always have time.

519
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,780
But luckily stamps.com is there.

520
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,180
It lets me use my computer to print

521
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,820
official US postage 24-7 for any letter,

522
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,740
any package, any class of mail,

523
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,740

50,000 hypothetical mugs, that really adds up.

529
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,820
That adds up.

530
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,500
That adds up fast.

531
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,540
It adds up.

532
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,580
Right now our listeners can get a special offer

533
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,940

and a digital scale without any long-term commitment.

535
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,660
Now let us save you one thing.

536
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,940
A mug does weigh 10.4 ounces.

537
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,980
So if you need to check that out, 10.4 ounces.

538
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,380
If you have a scale and you're really looking

539
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,300
for like an old balance scale,

540
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,060
you could get a mug on one side,

541
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,300
say a bean juice mug on one side,

542
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,060
then anything that balances that,

543
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
you'll know it's 10.4.

544
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,540
I'm saying these mugs are good for just,

545
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,220
more than just drinking out of.

546
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,060
Yeah, you could use them as counterweights.

547
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,560
Yeah.

548
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,840
Yeah, so right now go to stamps.com,

549
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,640
click on the microphone at the top of the homepage

550

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,480
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

552
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,400
All one word, my brother.

553
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,320
So Squarespace is another service

554
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,760
that has sponsored us this week

555
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
because they want everybody to know

556
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,520
about how great their website making platform is.

557
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,600
So if you need to make yourself up a website,

558
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,480
just whip one up real fast, no sweat.

559
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,640
They can do that if it's a website

560
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,440
that you want to use to show off your great work

561
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,080
or promote your physical or online business

562
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,680
or announce an upcoming event or special project or more.

563
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,080
If there's more things that you want to do with a website,

564
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,000
Squarespace does it for you.

565
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,240
They got beautiful customizable templates

566
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,160
created by world-class designers.

567
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,200
I'm talking about Megan Coolsites did one and-

568
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,920
What, they got a Coolsites design?

569
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,360
Stefan Hyperlinksman had made one

570
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,280
and so they also have powerful

571
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,040
e-commerce functionality as well.

572
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,080
And that's so good for certain people's business

573
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,760
that they need help with.

574
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,960
And everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

575
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,080
So you can just do it

576
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,040
and then people will be able to get it on their phones.

577
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,400

578
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,160

584
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,200
Wow, this is weird.

585
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
It says here we have a Jumbotron

586
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,000
even though I thought we were done with it.

587
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,680
But this is, let me see here.

588
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,400
Oh, it's by Chrissy Teigen.

589
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,160
Oh, shit.

590
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,040
Chrissy Teigen wants to talk about bean juice mugs,

591
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,200
which apparently she loves them.

592
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,760
She says it's the best her coffee's ever tasted.

593
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,840
And she recommends everybody gets one

594
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,640
and goes to beanjuicemugs4, the number four, sale.com.

595
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
Huh, wow.

596
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,560
Thank you, Chrissy.

597
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,000
Wow, that's so-

598
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,720
So sick.

599
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,040
So kind.

600
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,680
And here's a picture of Chrissy and John

601
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,680
and they're sipping each other's-

602
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll cut this out.

603
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,720
That's not allowed.

604
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,000
I don't think we can,

605
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,600
I literally think it's a crime.

606
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,200
I literally think what we're doing is a crime.

607
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,200
Thanks so much to the over 28,000 members

608
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,560

00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,480

and to all of our monthly members.

611
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,000
To celebrate hitting our goal this year,

612
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,800
we're putting the 2019 Max Fund Drive pins

613

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,120
As in past years,

00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,400
you'll be able to get some pins

616
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,880
and support a great cause at the same time.

617
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,320
The proceeds from this year's sale

618
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,000
will support the National Court Appointed

619
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,080
Special Advocates Association.

620
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,960
National CASA does amazing work for children and youth

621
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,480
through a national network of 950 member programs.

622
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,720
We're proud to be able to support them.

623
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,000

And once again,

629
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,720
thank you.

630
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,080
I would like to take this opportunity

631
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,600
to announce a new segment

632
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,040
on my brother, my brother and me.

633
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,840
I know it's always very hotly anticipated.

634
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,640
You guys ready?

635
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,200
Yes.

636
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,160
We're off to see the lizard.

637
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,640
Now this is a segment where we talk about

638
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,520
Jimmy Buffett selling weed.

639
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,160
And anytime Jimmy Buffett sells weed

640
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,440
or weed-related products,

641
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,400
we're going to feature it

642
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,680
and off to see the lizard.

643
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,520
This new segment.

644
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,960
Is the lizard him?

645
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,520
In this scenario?

646
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,960
Listen, what am I, a music professor?

647
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,400
Listen, I'm just a simple man

648
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,640
who's reading a simple press release

649
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,120
that is headlined, titled, sorry,

650
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,320
Jimmy Buffett and Soterra Wellness

651
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,840
Launch Cannabis Brand.

652
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,280
And I'm going to read it to you.

653
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,680
Soterra Wellness Launch Cannabis Brand,

654
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,720
Coral Reefer.

655
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,760
Oh, good.

656
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,920
I like that, that's good branding.

657
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,880
Now Coral Reefer,

658
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,320
now that has been

659
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,920
Jimmy Buffett's backing band

660
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,000
since the 70s, the Coral Reefer band.

661
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,600
It's hilarious, agreed.

662
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,360
But this is an ancillary product,

663
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,720
complimentary product.

664
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,920
A range of,

665
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,960
they say wellness-focused cannabis products.

666
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,880
And lifestyle merchandise that's launching.

667
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,920
Well, it just launched this week,

668
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,200
actually, oh, last week.

669
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,680
This highly anticipated Coral Reefer brand

670
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,120
will be exclusively distributed

671
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,160
through more than 20 Soterra Wellness Centers

672
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,200
located in most major cities throughout Florida.

673
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,320
And dark web, I bet.

674
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,880
And probably through the dark web,

675
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,240
James said, it never dawned on me

676
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,080
that Coral Reefer would be anything other

677
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,320
than a cool name for a tropical band

678
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,920
born out of the Key West lifestyle

679
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,880
of the mid-70s.

680
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,640
I can smell salt,

681
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,520
like as you're saying that,

682
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,120
I smell salt water.

683
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,000
Yes, but life is supposed to be about having fun

684
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,840
and staying healthy enough to enjoy it.

685
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,800
And I think Coral Reefer

686
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,160
will help a lot of folks do that.

687
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,680
Thank you, Jimmy.

688
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,360
I think you're probably right.

689
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,480
Probably my favorite

690
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,040
is the uniquely designed vape pen

691
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
called the Tide Rider

692
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,120
that embodies the spirit of the brand

693
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,280
with a sleek surfboard design,

694
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,680
variable temperature controls,

695
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,760
and advanced ceramic coil technology

696
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,640
for a clean and consistent vaping experience.

697
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,600
That's right, folks.

698
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,480
Thanks.

699
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,560
Jimmy Buffett is now providing you

700
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,280
a clean and consistent vaping experience.

701
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,320
And they got distinctive tropical design

702
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
and Key West-inspired colors.

703
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,840
So, we have four different formulations

704
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,120
available.

705
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,200
They tinker this shit up

706
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,440
and did he Heisenberg this shit himself,

707
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,160
these juices?

708
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,520
Yeah, I gotta, I assume some testing.

709
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,600
Judging from the interactions

710
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,120
that I've had with Mr. Buffett,

711
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,920
I think some testing was involved

712
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,240
with the product.

713
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,440
The press release goes on.

714
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,800
Jimmy says, I actually,

715
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,840
I'm gonna try one right now.

716
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,520
And then the next paragraph is just like

717
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,360
H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H.

718
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,800
There are four different

719
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,680
CBD to THC ratios

720
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,560
that range from mild to high intensity

721
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,480
or as they have it labeled here,

722
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,760
low tide, mid tide, high tide and tsunami.

723
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,120
Ooh, all right.

724
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,880
There's C's, S E A S.

725
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,520
The Day, which is a CBD dominant blend

726
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
that offers a gentle calming effect

727
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,560
to help you breathe in, breathe out,

728
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
and move on from the tension of your day.

729
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,600
No thanks, I'll stick with a fast food hamburger

730
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,720
for that one.

731
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
Cabana Daydreamin' is a fresh evening breeze

732
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,520
that delivers a balanced blend of CBD and THC

733
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,480
for full body relaxation.

734
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Yes, oh, a fresh evening breeze.

735
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,580
It's a fresh evening breeze.

736
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,440
Stories We Could Tell is a relaxing THC rich blend

737
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,640
to help you manage pain without drowsiness.

738
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,480
That's me.

739
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,240
So you can be present with friends and family.

740
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,680
That me right there.

741
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,280
I will always, I want to treasure my time with you boys

742
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,400
so much more, and my friend, Jommie, has got me going.

743
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,240
Yeah.

744
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
And then last formulation we have here

745
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,040
is surfing in a hurricane.

746
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,000
I've been assuming this one just fucks you up, right?

747
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Just kinda, just kinda demolishes you.

748
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,760
Leaves scorched earth behind.

749
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,720
It just, it actually says, partner, this one here

750
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,520
is gonna fuck your whole project.

751
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,400
Everyone just says, enjoy your Friday, see ya Monday.

752
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,120
Mr. Margaritaville takes a ball peen hammer

753
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,400
to what you call a life and leaves only rubble in his way.

754
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,640
Puts you back together piece by piece in his own image.

755
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,800
When asked about this last product,

756
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,240
Mr. Buffett said, this shit right here?

757
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,760
15 times in a row.

758
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,040
Oh man, oh man.

759
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,040
I assume that if there are formulations on here

760
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,240
that share a name with the Margaritaville menu items

761
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,540
that were also named after Jimmy Buffett songs,

762
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,320
those are some good pairings right there.

763
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,160
Absolutely.

764
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,680
Absolutely good.

765
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,680
Like a fine wine and a rich steak.

766
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
How about a Yahoo?

767
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Yeah, absolutely.

768
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,200
Here's one from Freddie, thanks Freddie.

769
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,200
It's from Yahoo Answers user AJ14872001 who asks.

770
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,040
Cyborg.

771
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,520
Do the contestants actually die

772
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,860
on Ellen's Game of Games in the final round?

773
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,900
Probably.

774
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,960
I don't think that this person is wondering this.

775
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,760
I don't believe that this person

776
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
is still thinking about this.

777
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,760
At the end of the final round,

778
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,360
if you do bad at her malevolent games,

779
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,120
then the hole opens up behind under you

780
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,120
and you fall through it and they don't show you again,

781
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,960
as far as I know.

782
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,800
And I think they did this,

783
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,360
what was the other one, The Weakest Link?

784
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,080
Didn't they do that on Weakest Link?

785
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,720
They also did it, I don't know if this is a deep cut,

786
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,360
but I believe it was remote control on MTV or VH1

787
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,320
where everybody sat in armchairs

788
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,880
and then if you got knocked out,

789
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
they played hit the road jack, I believe,

790
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,580
and pulled your chair backward through a wall

791
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,400
which then closed around you.

792
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,200
And I remember watching that as a child

793
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,680
and I was like, that person's dead.

794
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,440
Maybe also in Legends of the Hidden Temple

795
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,880
when a temple guard grabs you,

796
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,600
you might also have been dead then, I'm still not sure.

797
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,900
If you have a life pendant, you're okay for the first one,

798
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,480
but then the second one, yeah.

799
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,640
You're dead.

800
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,240
Now you are the next temple guard for the next run.

801
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,080
I think we all can agree.

802
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,120
I always felt in Legends of the Hidden Temple

803
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
if you only had half a pendant when you got

804
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,320
to that final round, you should be able to give that to them

805
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,200
and they don't take you, but they do, I don't know,

806
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,080
maybe take your helmet and your elbow pads and put it up.

807
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,080
I always said if you have only half a pendant

808
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,080
when you get to the final round,

809
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,200
you should be able to try and use it like a weapon

810
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,240
to cut or stab the temple guards.

811
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,200
You should be able to attack the temple guards.

812
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,760
There had to be some bloops of that, right?

813
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,800
There had to be some temple guard injury bloops.

814
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,160
Have to be, have to be.

815
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,280
Because if I was running through the spider's web

816
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
or like the shrine of the silver monkey

817
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,520
and like a temple guard came out to grab me,

818
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,560
I would be just throwing bows left and right.

819
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,360
A temple guard would lose an eye.

820
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,300
Oh yeah, I'd drop them.

821
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,920
Yeah, I'd drop them right in Olmec's mouth

822
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,800
and get them crunched up.

823
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,520
I'd beat the shit out of them.

824
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
I also think you should be able to try and trick Ellen

825
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,320
to standing over the trap door and then you drop her in.

826
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,320
That's the only way to defeat her.

827
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,240
You're the host.

828
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,200
Oh, Ellen, can I do a funny sketch?

829
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,960
Ellen, I know you love those

830
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,980
and I'll talk a little bit about Kristen Bell

831
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,120
and Dax Shepard while I do so.

832
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,240
Yeah, sure, what do you want me?

833
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,300
Right here, Ellen.

834
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,560
And then you steal her staff

835
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,160
and you press the secret button embedded in the skull.

836
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,920
That's kind of playing off how the last Saw movie ended

837
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,820
with someone tricking Jigsaw into walking over a hole

838
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,220
that they'd covered with leaves and branches.

839
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,480
Which I always thought was just the funniest ending

840
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,720
to that franchise ever.

841
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,480
Where they're like, over here, over here, over here.

842
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,800
Crash, oh no, I've been wasted by my own prince.

843
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,420
The only way out of this one is,

844
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,840
I didn't think about it ahead of time,

845
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,360
but I didn't need to eat your own butt cheeks.

846
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,240
If you eat them all up good and say how yummy they are

847
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,740
and you love treasured your life.

848
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,480
And leave a Yelp review about your butt cheeks.

849
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,780
Do you think Jigsaw was watching

850
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:19,800
the puzzle escape room craze and just like, um, hello?

851
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,480
Hello, can I get a cut or a taste or something?

852
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,200
So do the contestants actually get liquified

853
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
on Ellen's Game of Games in the final round?

854
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,440
Is the question.

855
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,780
And I think we can all agree, probably not.

856
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,040
But I think it would probably be good practice

857
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,880
for these shows where adults and children

858
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,360
drop through holes and are never seen from again.

859
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:44,360
If immediately the camera cuts to them

860
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,440
coming out the bottom of the slide

861
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,680
and stays with them until they leave the building

862
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,400
and get in their car to go drive home.

863
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,560
I just didn't, just for my,

864
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,640
just so I know that they're all right.

865
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,440
Yeah, I bet that when you slide through

866
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,280
like one of those holes and you land at the bottom,

867
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,200
there's a producer there who's like, listen,

868
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,560
you're not dead, but you could have been.

869
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,280
Why did you come on this game?

870
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,360
You didn't know what you're gonna do.

871
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,680
Life is unpredictable.

872
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,560
Why would you say yes to this?

873
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,880
Let this be a lesson to you.

874
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,620
Rob Lowe's doing one.

875
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,760
Were you just about to talk about the Rob Lowe show?

876
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,880
No, I wasn't.

877
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,160
I was about to talk about the show, Who Done It?

878
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,140
So you go ahead.

879
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,040
Oh yeah, well in the Rob Lowe show,

880
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,800
it's called Dizzy Trivia?

881
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,280
No, Mental Samurai.

882
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,480
That's even better.

883
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,300
And then you're in this orb and trying to answer questions,

884
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,320
but they're spinning you around very fast.

885
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,780
But then if you miss too many questions,

886
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,860
they spin it around, let's say extremely fast.

887
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,040
And let's say the ball gets a little bit smaller as it goes.

888
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,880
So you do the math on what happens

889
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,960
to the human body inside of it, so.

890
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,620
I wish I was there when Rob Lowe created this series

891
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,280
and pitched it to the network with his own beautiful

892
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,780
creation.

893
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,120
Here's the thing, Grindr didn't work out too good,

894
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:01,360
but I'd love to turn humans into candle wax using the globe.

895
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,040
I think it did well enough that I can still

896
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,160
liquify people with my incredible globe

897
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,520
that I've been building in my garage.

898
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
We can make the questions wicked easy,

899
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,680
and therefore it can be a kind of population control thing.

900
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,960
I'm Rob Lowe, and Dr. Vegas didn't do great,

901
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,880
but I think it did well enough that I

902
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,800
could create these murder spheres for your network.

903
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,320
If they wouldn't let me do a show called The Grindr,

904
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,560
then I'll create a Grindr for souls.

905
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,960
There was a show called Whodunit that tragically only aired

906
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,400
for nine episodes in the Halcyon Summer of 2013.

907
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,280
And on this show is a murder mystery show,

908
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,440
and one of the contestants would get killed

909
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,800
at the end of every episode.

910
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,280
And in the credits, they always had the person who got killed

911
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,220
appear in a post-show interview while still

912
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,040
in their murdered makeup.

913
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,760
And you could tell that that was done

914
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,320
so some tiny fraction of the audience wouldn't be like,

915
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,320
uh, hello, a person has died, excuse me?

916
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,460
9-1-1, what's your emergency?

917
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,540
Okay, so this is wild.

918
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,720
After The Grindr on Fox, there's this show

919
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,440
where I saw a person straight up get fucking whacked,

920
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,920
and then they're not even making a big deal out of it.

921
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,600
Nobody's talking about it.

922
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,960
They didn't even show them in the credits

923
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,000
to let me know they're okay.

924
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Could you go check on them, please?

925
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,040
Hello, I was just watching a television show

926
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,000
called Game of Thrones, and a lot of people

927
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,160
appeared to be murdered.

928
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,960
Somebody needs to get over there and check it out.

929
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,680
It's in Westeros?

930
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,160
There was a bad wedding, and I need like FBI

931
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,000
or somebody to go check this out.

932
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,760
Somebody needs to follow up on this.

933
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,320
Who's ready for another question?

934
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Our next question is, I work at a VA that is fairly busy.

935
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,000
The other day, I was leaving to get some lunch

936
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,640
and walk down the main stairway.

937
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,200
I said hello to some people as I got to the bottom,

938
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,440
turned around, and proceeded to check my pants

939
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,000
for my wallet.

940
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,600
I've grown accustomed to smacking my phone,

941
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,440
wallet, and keys when I leave places.

942
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,480
However, I'm fairly certain I just walked down some stairs

943
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,920
and drew attention to myself by saying hello,

944
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,880
then turned around and smacked my right butt cheek

945
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,260
in a lobby full of people.

946
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,960
How do I face these coworkers, or am I just done?

947
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,920
Do I pack up and leave?

948
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,280
That's from Mortified Butt Smack.

949
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,400
You know who I would love to weigh in on this?

950
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
Who's that?

951
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,120
You know Griffin Newman?

952
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,760
He plays Arthur on The Tick?

953
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,600
Oh, sure.

954
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,440
Amazon?

955
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,260
Yeah.

956
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,100
Let me see if I can call him.

957
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,940
How could we get Griffin Newman on our show so last minute?

958
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,320
He's been on the call.

959
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,160
Oh, what?

960
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,000
The entire time.

961
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
Griffin, are you still?

962
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,000
Yeah, hey, what's going on, guys?

963
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,760
Thank you for letting me listen in to the live recording.

964
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,680
Matt, Griffin, other Griffin.

965
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,520
Newman.

966
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,200
Yeah, Griffin too, we can do Griffin too.

967
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,160
Or Newman, yeah, we can go by Newman.

968
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,280
I would like actually for me,

969
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,240
for the remainder of this whole bit, this sketch,

970
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,800
if I could just be called Shades.

971
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,960
If you guys could give me that.

972
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,800
Shades, okay.

973
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,240
You can have Griffin for a little bit.

974
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Okay, and I just wanna say I now feel less cool

975
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,840
because other Griffin has upgraded to Shades,

976
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,600
so I prefer if you call me Downtown Griffin Nooms.

977
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,440
You got it.

978
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,260
Okay.

979
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,100
I just don't want there to be

980
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,800
sort of like a disproportionate coolness factor

981
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,140
between the two Griffs.

982
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,600
Just to clarify, can we just say Downtown then?

983
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,640
Just call you Downtown?

984
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,920
Or do we have to say Downtown Griffin Noom every time?

985
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,440
Nooms with a Z.

986
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,920
It's very important if you say the full thing

987
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,760
that it ends with a Z.

988
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Nooms, sorry, excuse me.

989
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,760
Otherwise, you can definitely call me Downtown

990
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,880
or you can call me DTGN.

991
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,600
Okay, hold on, now hold on.

992
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,880
Because if Griffin you got to do that,

993
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,560
I feel like I should have a chance to respond

994
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,480
if we're doing proper debate format.

995
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,520
A rebuttal, yeah, yeah.

996
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,780
Right, and Shades sounds a little short now.

997
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,000
You might wanna stretch out your nickname.

998
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,280
Yeah, I need you to step it up to,

999
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,480
mine up to, if you could just call me

1000
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,200
Morpheus from the Matrix.

1001
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,280
Cool.

1002
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,520
Or Matrix Morpheus if you wanna keep it short.

1003
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,800
I mean, MFTM is pretty clean.

1004
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,640
Yeah.

1005
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,140
Okay, all right, so we got Shades.

1006
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,920
We've got Morpheus from the Matrix.

1007
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
No, Shades is out.

1008
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,240
I'm Shades now.

1009
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,680
I'm Don't Big Justin.

1010
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,600
And my name's Griffin Newman.

1011
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,440
Okay, all right.

1012
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,400
So Downtown has paid the, let's just say,

1013
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,300
let's just say five digits to take the masterclass

1014
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,680
that we offer for podcasting where you can just kind of

1015
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,500
sit in and watch the sausage be made.

1016
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,440
He's been here for the entire five hour recording

1017
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,080
of this hour long episode.

1018
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,440
I unlocked a tier, yeah.

1019
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,700
Right, so you heard the question

1020
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,460
because you've been listening, you know,

1021
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,640
obviously to the entire thing.

1022
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,520
Of course, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1023
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,260
Is this a, are you a butt smack kind of person?

1024
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,320
Is this, is this a-

1025
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,120
What does that mean, Justin?

1026
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,040
Are you someone who smacks their butt to look for items?

1027
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,200
Well, okay.

1028
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,300
Oh man, that's a good question.

1029
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,140
I-

1030
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,880
Thank you, thank you.

1031
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,040
It felt bad as I was saying it,

1032
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
so it's such a relief to know it was good.

1033
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,960
It felt good getting it.

1034
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,120
Hearing it felt unbelievable.

1035
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,040
On the opposite side of the coin,

1036
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,960
I don't like having things in my back pockets

1037
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,060
because that feels bad to me.

1038
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,680
Because when I sit on it, it hurts my butt cheeks.

1039
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,100
So I am almost exclusively a front pocket guy

1040
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:19,100
and a items in the little pocket of my backpack guy.

1041
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,000
So like-

1042
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,840
Okay, okay.

1043
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,760
So my wallet, too big for the front pocket,

1044
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,320
constantly have it in the little backpack pocket.

1045
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,840
Cool, so you've just made yourself incredibly easy

1046
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,160
to steal from for everybody-

1047
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,080
100%, everyone knows, I'll run down again.

1048
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,260
Keys, little backpack pocket.

1049
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,040
Chapstick, left front pocket.

1050
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
If you kill Griffin in Crime Alley,

1051
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,300
you don't wanna waste a bunch of time searching everything.

1052
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,720
So make sure you just go straight for the good stuff.

1053
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,560
Now I have a-

1054
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:49,380
Are people getting pickpocketed

1055
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,880
for their chapstick all that often?

1056
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,200
This is, is there like-

1057
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,720
Nope, that's why I feel safe putting it in that pocket.

1058
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,320
That's why, because I just go like,

1059
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,560
I hope, you know, that's all they reach for.

1060
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,440
And then they, they're so dismayed that they put it back.

1061
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,920
You know, other items just to educate your listeners.

1062
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,140
Non-drivers New York State ID is in my wallet,

1063
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,220
which as mentioned previously is in the backpack pocket.

1064
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,120
Also my backpack pocket, my passport.

1065
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,040
I carry around with me at all times

1066
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,800
because I'm an erotic mess.

1067
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,840
So yeah, so if someone's trying to pickpocket me

1068
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,840
or backpack pocket me, backpack pickpocket me,

1069
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,620
it is very easy to steal my entire identity.

1070
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,460
Perfect.

1071
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,940
Do you carry your passport with you

1072
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,140
just in case of emergencies,

1073
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,220
in case you like accidentally fly to Tokyo, Narita,

1074
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,620
or like what's-

1075
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,480
Yes, nope, nope, exactly.

1076
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,640
I'm impressed that you nailed the specific emergency

1077
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,980
that I always have in the back of my mind.

1078
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,780
We're big proponents on this show, Griffin,

1079
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,180
of the idea that other people

1080
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,620
are not ever paying as close attention to you

1081
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,700
as you are to yourself.

1082
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,540
100%.

1083
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,100
Do you feel like there is anyone still thinking

1084
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:04,040
about this just very prominent butt smack?

1085
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,180
Yes, yes.

1086
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,500
Now here's- I agree.

1087
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,660
Now I wanna respond to this question

1088
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:12,380
with a question of my own,

1089
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,860
and I pose it to you fine gentlemen.

1090
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,760
Is there anything wrong with mortified butt smacks,

1091
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:22,660
coworkers thinking that they deliberately

1092
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,900
smacked their right butt cheek?

1093
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,260
That they were just kinda feeling they're sexy?

1094
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,100
Wow.

1095
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:28,920
And just like-

1096
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,320
Or it's like a sports motivation for yourself.

1097
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,700
It's been a long day at the VA.

1098
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
I imagine that job can get kind of exhausting

1099
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,300
depending on like what your role is there.

1100
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:39,100
And so, you know, it's obviously not appropriate.

1101
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,300
It's not a football team.

1102
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,380
And even then it's probably not even super appropriate

1103
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,220
for you to get a butt smack that lets you know like,

1104
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,820
okay, next play we're gonna do a Hail Mary and catch it.

1105
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,620
I think it's an exact combination of those two things.

1106
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,460
Yes.

1107
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,980
Maybe, I think it would depend on the kind of flair

1108
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,360
with which you did it,

1109
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,280
because there's definitely a sort of flair

1110
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,860
that would make it seem inappropriate.

1111
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,100
But I think you could do a flair that was just like,

1112
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,620
what a fun affectation.

1113
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,980
Yeah, and I think the idea of like this person,

1114
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,260
really their heads in the game,

1115
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,380
they're holding themselves to high standards.

1116
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,720
Maybe it's after lunch, other people are getting groggy,

1117
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,880
and you just look at them and you go like, wow,

1118
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,180
this person is making sure that their head

1119
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,580
is still in the game by smacking their hand on their butt.

1120
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,580
We rarely talk about geometry on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

1121
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:31,780
but this does seem to be a case where the response

1122
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:34,940
and your sort of following actions

1123
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,780
are completely dependent on the exact angle

1124
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,820
that your arm was at when this situation occurred.

1125
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,460
Now, if you could visualize with me,

1126
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,500
if your arm is at a kind of a crook

1127
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,740
and you just kind of reached down there

1128
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,800
and gave yourself a quick smack-a-roony,

1129
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,020
this is probably not something

1130
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,580
you need to continue to address.

1131
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:57,580
If we had a 180, sort of a straight line windmill action,

1132
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,460
where you sort of like, like around,

1133
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,660
you had like follow through, you had a windup.

1134
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:07,420
Sort of like a Fosse style, you know, flourish,

1135
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,140
leading to the butt smack, that seems critical.

1136
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,140
If you were leaning to the side a little bit,

1137
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,800
like you're a little teapot, right?

1138
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,400
And maybe if you did like an ah afterwards,

1139
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,240
that's probably bad.

1140
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,180
I think that would be a game changer,

1141
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,860
if there's any sort of ah at the end of it.

1142
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:27,180
I think another question is, it says here,

1143
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,580
I just want to litigate the writing here.

1144
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,700
Said hello, turned around,

1145
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,460
and smacked my right butt cheek in a lobby.

1146
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,100
It's huge, that's huge.

1147
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,940
You have found the sort of encyclopedia brown

1148
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,540
hidden clue here that this person

1149
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,060
did spin around to give him a great view.

1150
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,940
It makes it seem targeted, doesn't it?

1151
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,820
It seems so targeted.

1152
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,580
I wanted to make sure you had the best seat in the house.

1153
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,740
I want to make sure you got the clean

1154
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,780
bird's eye view of this thing.

1155
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,880
But here's the one question, if it's a clean turnaround,

1156
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,140
and the butt smack happens,

1157
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,460
and then they proceed to walk away,

1158
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,040
that feels to me like a power move, like a confidence move.

1159
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,100
I know this person's a real player.

1160
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,940
They showed up to win, you know?

1161
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,140
Like confidence is the only currency

1162
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,100
we still have in this bankrupt world.

1163
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,900
I would feel encouraged about their commitment to the job.

1164
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,180
Now here's the potential fly in the ointment.

1165
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:26,780
If in the embarrassment of doing that,

1166
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,420
at any point before, after, or during

1167
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,980
the immediate vicinity of the butt smack,

1168
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,260
they did a little sort of whoomy

1169
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,000
head turn over the shoulder and made eye contact.

1170
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,620
If you did sort of what I would call

1171
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,780
the copper tone kid, right?

1172
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,540
Butt towards the audience, but also your locked eyes

1173
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,060
in this sort of embarrassed look,

1174
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,460
then I think you've blown it.

1175
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,500
Quit the job, retire, move out of the country.

1176
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,860
Now you're a little rascal.

1177
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,780
You went from being a confident player to a little rascal.

1178
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,100
You become a little stinker.

1179
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:01,940
Yeah, most definitely.

1180
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,700
That feels completely authoritative.

1181
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,780
I'm glad we could help so much.

1182
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,180
Real quick, I want to get a hand on the ball

1183
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,820
and just say, when I do this, I like to do

1184
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,860
the testicle spectacles wallet and watch bit

1185
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,700
from Austin Powers.

1186
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,340
People fucking love it, and it's been so long,

1187
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,900
they forgot, and they think it's my thing,

1188
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,460
and people love it.

1189
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,420
Griffin, you've got a TV show.

1190
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,780
The second season is out right now.

1191
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,860
Can you tell people about it?

1192
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,900
It's not a TV show.

1193
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,820
It is a web series.

1194
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,100
It's a long form web series.

1195
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,980
It's on Amazon Prime.

1196
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,760
No, everything's a TV show now.

1197
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,380
Please don't take it from us,

1198
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:35,340
because we call ours a TV show,

1199
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,340
and that streaming service doesn't even exist anymore.

1200
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,180
We need this legitimacy, please.

1201
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:42,500
Okay, okay, fine. Please, downtown grippy nooms.

1202
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,400
Fine, I am on a prestige television series.

1203
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,240
Thank you.

1204
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,920
Produced by the Amazon company of the Americas.

1205
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,180
It's called The Tick.

1206
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,880
This show is based off of Funny Books,

1207
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,380
which is a comic book in the 80s

1208
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,820
that's a satire of superheroes created by Ben Edlund,

1209
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:06,260
and was revived into a, or vived.

1210
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,260
It wasn't revived, it was vived for the first time

1211
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:10,900
into a cartoon show in the 90s,

1212
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,900
and then a sitcom in 2001,

1213
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,900
and then now a more serialized, higher budget,

1214
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,020
very difficult to produce Amazon series.

1215
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,760
I adore this show.

1216
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,620
I think that it really,

1217
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:29,700
I think satire almost doesn't feel right to me.

1218
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,140
It feels like a real genuine examination

1219
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:36,020
of where superheroes would fit in our world,

1220
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,180
and what we still need them for,

1221
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:41,300
and what that means in a way that's like,

1222
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,620
I think a lot more thought provoking

1223
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:47,580
than I sort of expected from The Tick.

1224
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,380
Yeah, I think that's what we're trying to do.

1225
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:53,260
The previous versions of the show have been great,

1226
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:57,100
but they have been more like straightforward sort of parody,

1227
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,300
and I think now that we're in

1228
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,900
like such a superhero excess culture,

1229
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,420
Ben has been trying to make a show

1230
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,260
that's really examining why we're so obsessed

1231
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,460
with superheroes.

1232
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,620
And people can see this now, is that right?

1233
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,220
Is currently on Amazon?

1234
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,940
Yes, no staggered release.

1235
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:16,400
All 10 episodes season two on Amazon Prime.

1236
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,900
All 12 episodes of season one on Amazon Prime.

1237
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,680
People say, oh, I have Amazon,

1238
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,580
but I don't have the video thing.

1239
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,740
I think you're wrong.

1240
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,040
If you got Prime, if you got that free shipping,

1241
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,460
you got the video.

1242
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,500
And I also believe there are a lot of free

1243
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,220
sort of one month trial offers that are going on right now,

1244
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:40,300
where you can sign up, watch our 22 episodes,

1245
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,880
and then bail if you want.

1246
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,540
Don't tell Daddy Bezos that I said that,

1247
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,020
but I'm telling you that you can.

1248
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,260
It is your right.

1249
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,580
Folks, listen, don't hesitate.

1250
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,980
If our experience has taught us anything,

1251
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,700
it's that streaming services can collapse overnight.

1252
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,780
You never know, tomorrow is not promised to you.

1253
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,940
So spend today watching all of The Tick on Amazon Prime.

1254
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:03,700
I think Amazon's having money problems

1255
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:04,740
because they keep on telling me

1256
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,420
they don't have the budget to do certain things.

1257
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,660
So I'm a little worried about how liquid they are.

1258
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,020
Every time I pitch them something,

1259
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,700
they go, I don't know if we have it in the budget.

1260
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:18,660
So I think they might be a little tight on cash these days.

1261
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:21,440
Now you have another podcast as well, right?

1262
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,940
Yeah, I count this as my first podcast, of course.

1263
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,660
I tell people that this is one of my podcasts

1264
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,500
because I do listen in to every episode live.

1265
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,900
But then I have a podcast called Blank Check

1266
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:32,180
with Griffin and David.

1267
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,820
You saw that as sort of an invitation

1268
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,340
to plug your other podcast.

1269
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,660
Okay, I hear you to be more clear.

1270
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,220
I felt like that was a door being opened.

1271
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,820
Yeah, did I greatly misread that situation?

1272
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,140
I could see where the disconnect happened, for sure.

1273
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:44,940
Right, right, that was not your intent.

1274
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,620
You wanted to just sort of declare war against my podcast?

1275
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:50,100
Was that what that was?

1276
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:50,940
Were you trying to big dog me?

1277
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,020
Just trying to dismantle your brand, I guess.

1278
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,980
You were trying to big dog, okay, okay.

1279
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,780
Fantastic, well, Griffin, thank you so much.

1280
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,580
Oh, sorry, downtown.

1281
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,820
Thank you so much for joining us.

1282
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,900
We really appreciate you.

1283
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,980
Please, such a pleasure.

1284
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,740
And I'll, I mean, I won't speak to you guys soon,

1285
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,740
but I will listen to you guys soon

1286
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,780
the next time you record.

1287
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:11,780
And I just silently sit here and absorb.

1288
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,340
Speaking of absorb, let me go ahead

1289
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,860
and just absorb you back into my body.

1290
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,900
So come real close.

1291
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,740
Oh, cool.

1292
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,220
All right.

1293
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,860
Let's go.

1294
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,980
Thank you so much to downtown for his contribution.

1295
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:29,860
Please go watch The Tick.

1296
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:32,860
I adore this show, and I think that you really will too

1297
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:36,220
if you like our show and have excellent tastes

1298
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,580
as that would demonstrate.

1299
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,980
That's not a paid promotion, by the way.

1300
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,220
I know there's some people out there.

1301
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:42,540
We just, we like Griffin in the show.

1302
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,740
We just enjoy it.

1303
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,540
So check that totally out.

1304
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,700
We're coming to Cincinnati and Cleveland soon.

1305
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,980
We'll be Cleveland May 15th and Cincinnati May 16th.

1306
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,540
If you haven't gotten your tickets yet,

1307
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,060
as well as all of our other tour dates,

1308
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,500
you can find the other tour dates

1309
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,900
and get tickets at McElroy.family and click on tours.

1310
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,140
We have tours that are listed through November.

1311
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,740
So those are already starting to sell out.

1312
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,660
I would say at this point, like one quarter

1313
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,460
to a third of the dates are already sold out.

1314
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,340
So don't wait.

1315
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,820
Go get those now, McElroy.family.

1316
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:17,900
We also have merch, and there will be new merch

1317
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,380
on May 1st at McElroymerch.com.

1318
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,100
And man, if you, oh boy, you really can't go wrong

1319
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,540
with a bean juice mug.

1320
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,620
Good for any occasions, birthdays, holidays.

1321
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,620
Put a chain through the handle, now it's a cool necklace.

1322
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,580
There's so much, I can think of 10 ways

1323
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,020
to accessorize with bean juice.

1324
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,860
Maybe with like a really cool, like chill cat.

1325
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,380
It could be like a hat for them.

1326
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,820
Sure, sure.

1327
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,860
I wanna thank John Roderick, who's a big bean juice fan.

1328
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,760
He told me yesterday in the long winters

1329
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,640
for the use of our theme song.

1330
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,580
It's a departure off the album,

1331
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,420
Putting the Days to Bed.

1332
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,500
You can find a link to that.

1333
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
I mean, that's not what I say on this show,

1334
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,620
but you can find a link to that pretty much anywhere.

1335
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,900
And it's a good song, great tune, great oldies.

1336
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,580
104.6, my brother, my brother, and me.

1337
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,300
Do you guys want the final yahoo?

1338
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,140
Yes, please.

1339
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,900
This final yahoo is sent in by Michelle, who asks,

1340
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,460
how bad is Cheesecake Factory for my body?

1341
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,540
My name is Justin McElroy.

1342
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,660
I'm Travis McElroy.

1343
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,140
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1344
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,740
It's been my brother, my brother, me, damn.

1345
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,180
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1346
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,820
Kiss your dad, squirt on the lips.

1347
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,780
Hey, Griffin Girls, do you wanna just say that I wanna?

1348
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,720
Maximumfun.org.

1349
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:47,780
Comedy and culture.

1350
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,820
Artist-owned.

1351
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,040
Listener-supported.

1352
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,260
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

1353
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,100
film craft, and female filmmakers.

1354
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,020
So if you love all those things,

1355
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,620
then by transitive property,

1356
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,860
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

1357
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,420
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolf.

1358
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:04,820
Every week, I have a conversation

1359
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,180
with a different female filmmaker

1360
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,540
about their favorite genre film.

1361
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,620
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

1362
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,860
working in the film industry,

1363
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,820
and just like general geeking out about awesome movies.

1364
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,860
I've had such great guests

1365
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,620
like the big sick writer, Emily Gordon.

1366
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,420
To me, indie movies, as of late,

1367
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,220
have come to be a catch-all term

1368
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,560
for a movie that kind of defies genre.

1369
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,980
Billy Madison and half-fake director, Tamra Davis.

1370
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,540
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

1371
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,860
they're just there to be funny,

1372
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,420
and we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

1373
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,060
Horror industry veteran and actor, Barbara Crampton.

1374
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,960
That's where real drama lies for me.

1375
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,500
What's between you and I speaking right now?

1376
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,140
Where are we meeting?

1377
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,380
And what's the energy that we create between us?

1378
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,680
And so many others.

1379
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,740
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday

1380
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:52,740
