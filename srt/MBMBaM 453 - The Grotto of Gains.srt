00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,960
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
And I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy. Hey Griff, what's wrong? Why are you being so

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,880
quiet? It's gonna it's gonna be a skit. Oh I didn't oh I didn't want to worry you guys and

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,440
I'll cut this out but it's gonna be a sketch. I know it's a sketch. I'm playing along. We're

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,360
trying to lead into the- No and I'll cut this part out but I didn't want the two of you guys

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,120
to be afraid. Okay let me I'll get back in now. Well I'm just I'm so scared of um listen listen

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:30,160
I'll cut that out too. Listen the PGA Tour has made is marched on Austin and taken over the town and

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:38,240
there's- PGA? Yeah professional golfers all right and they've made their way to Austin. All the

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,520
weirdos from South By just left and in the void they left all these rich jocks showed up and

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,320
started just golfing wherever the fuck they wanted. I don't know if the PGA Tour has ever been in the

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,160
city where you live but it's just like my house is covered in holes from their powerful drives

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,760
that they just blast right through. Are they doing like and one street golf? They're doing and one

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,200
street golf extreme street golf. I saw Rory McIlroy first of all he's been tormenting me

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
because he says he he keeps saying I want it back and that's what he sounds that's what he sounds

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,600
like as he yells at me and my family through the windows of my house and while he's blasting me with

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,920
balls um but then I see- Once what back? The name I guess even though it's spelled different I told

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,280
him that but then a ball hit me in the head and I went to sleep for an hour um but I did see him

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,280
playing some extreme street golf with the other big golfers of today. Name three other ones. Yeah

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,040
sure Rory McIlroy is one. Well you already said that one three other ones. One and and you know

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,240
three other ones that don't have your name let's just like go for it. Okay can I do Tiger? Yeah

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:54,160
yeah yeah. Tigers? Tiger? Yes. Jack Nicklaus. Golden Bear. Golden Bear and I think there's one

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
named Buddy. Anyway he's I saw Rory McIlroy take a golf ball and run and slam dunk it into a hole

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,040
that he made in the street that's a pothole now my son's gonna trip in um it's real tough stuff

29
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,960
it's real tough I would think after we got rich from the max fun drive that I would start liking

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,760
golf more but it's the way they're doing it is very riotous it's very destructive. Uh yeah just

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,240
a quick side note thank you everyone who donated we're recording this on the Wednesday uh previous

32
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,760
so I have to assume we just ended up at like 60,000 new and upgrading. I assume we're extremely

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,880
wealthy Travis pass me one of those kahibas that I purchased prematurely and will eventually regret

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,680
I'm sure. Griffin have you thought about getting super good at it yourself to like well if you

35
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,640
can't beat them join them and then beat them? Uh I mean I've been thinking about it slide me one

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,560
of those stinky smoke logs too while you're at it Travy. Yeah of course of course. It's just

37
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,640
let me light it with this other stinky. It's just for looks I don't light it um I and so

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:04,560
I thought about getting good at golf Travis but you know my my elbow. Yeah so I'm sorry I forgot

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,680
about that Griffin. I forgot about the hinge and the flaps in there. If you hear a loud smash and

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,200
then uh you know or maybe a four and then a smash uh it's because the PGA Tour has uh is doing it

41
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:28,320
in Austin. The end. Okay. Oh Griffin look out behind you a golf ball's coming your way. Uh oh.

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,160
That was supposed to be my glass breaking noise. Fuck. Fuck me Justin. God damn it. You know what

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,920
what's weird what's weird is I have Seinfeld glass uh in every window of my house and it's great

44
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,520
because it's insular which is great because it keeps the AC in in the hot summer and but the

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,240
only bad thing is when it smashes like when Michael Richards jumps through it it doesn't

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,040
make the traditional noise it does make the boogie ball wow wow. Should I have a Michael

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,920
Richards more Michael Richards representation on the soundboard? No. I think the only sort of

48
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,200
clip that he's known for would not work very well on our show because of our format. Yeah how

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,880
horrible it is and he is and all that jazz. Well this is an advice show that is funded by you

50
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,080
the listeners and uh we do appreciate you just not to harp on it but it's like

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,360
and we have a lot of fun here but it really means a lot to us so thank you so much for your

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
eternal support. Um did I not mention it was an eternal pledge you're making? Yeah this is forever.

53
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah this is forever. Uh let's get into the advice. I work in wildlife rehabilitation.

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,400
One week into this job I was cleaning one of the owls enclosures. Justin did you use your new

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,200
found max fund wealth to buy a new narrator voice? Yeah it's nice it sounds like you've got four or

56
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,840
five Cohibas going in there. Do you know what's irritating? Why? One of the reasons I really don't

57
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,680
enjoy you guys and wow this is much more professional it's more of a professional

58
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
relationship at this point than a familiar one yeah is because I was in my head thinking like

59
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,560
this is sounding good. I was already congratulating myself for how well I was reading it and not

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,320
stumbling or messing it up at all and then you fucking dill wheat. It was nice it was good.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah it was like I just wanted to finish it with like my streak. All right try again. I work in

62
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,360
wildlife rehabilitation. One week into this job I was cleaning one of the owls enclosures and when

63
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,920
I turned to leave she attacked the back of my head. She didn't draw blood but I definitely felt

64
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,080
her talons graze my scalp. It was startling as fuck and since then the owl and I have had a

65
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,200
strained relationship. I feel like she hates me. How do I learn to trust this animal again? And

66
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,800
that's from living in fear in Louisiana. Sounds like you need to get the animal to trust you

67
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,720
first and foremost. And with owls that that's a tough one. That's a tough one with owls. They're

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,360
a tricky they're a tricky one because um of the ill omens and all that yeah sure you could throw

69
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,240
up a you know field mouse for them to catch and play a big game with that but then you know the

70
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,920
field mouse certainly is not going to trust you at that point. You can you can try to do something

71
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,760
behind an owl's back but it's just going to turn right the fuck around and see it with that crazy

72
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:17,600
head they have. That weird head. When you were attacked did you snitch on them? Did you go tell

73
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,400
like the head of the wildlife or maybe the owl was testing to see if you could keep your mouth shut?

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,560
That's amazing. When I was in elementary school uh I my my my friend well we were more acquaintances

75
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,720
John cut in front of me he had about a foot and a half on me and he cut in front of me in the

76
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
four square line I said hey you just cut in front of me and he slapped he slapped me on the face

77
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,120
and I guess somebody reported it and we got sent to the principal's office and I didn't fucking

78
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,840
snitch and me and John were so tight from that point on so that's one way to do it is to just

79
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,560
keep your cool about this owl and you know maybe they'll apologize no blood drawn which first of

80
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,160
all good scalp you got there holy shit tough one yeah if this but like if this owl had wanted to

81
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,600
fuck you up oh yeah you'd be fucked up yeah this was this is the owl sending a message here's where

82
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,200
you've already ruined it you've already botched this as bad as you possibly can if an owl does

83
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:23,360
this you have to owl tax your scalp spin around in one smooth motion and punch it in the face

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,000
and then it's like dominance respect hey yeah it'll give you this kind of like okay look all

85
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,560
right get it I see what's happening you and I respect and then you fight and if you beat it

86
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,880
it's not ready to go out into it is not rehabilitated yet that is a good it's a good

87
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,640
question like wildlife rehabilitation it doesn't mention rehabilitation for what

88
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,680
so maybe this is always a bad seed counter owl and it's just acting out it's a behavioral

89
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,480
rehabilitation yes it's got a problem with authority it's got dissociative personality

90
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,480
disorder it's got some antisocial tendencies and it just uh it just doesn't like people that much

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,840
let's just say like hey I'm not fine I may seem fine I put on a brave face I'm still kind of

92
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,840
kind of messed up I need to chill here for a little bit longer listen can I tell you something

93
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:21,760
question asker owl attacked human that seems pretty normal to me actually yeah that's it

94
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,000
I think it'll be weirder if you walked in there and like the owl like waved at you happy to see

95
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,280
you the owl's not ready to go back out there like that owl attacks you that owl is ready to be on

96
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,080
its own that you should go back in like hey the owl attacked me and they'd be like oh that's good

97
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,960
news that's so cool hey that owl's fucking fine yeah let it go it's fine it's doing what owls do

98
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,800
I think the Japanese owl cafes got all the nice owls already and there's none left for the rest

99
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,200
of us let's make room for a timid bird sure um I've got a yahoo here can I read it yeah please

100
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,280
uh this one was sent in by level 9000 yahoo drew drew davenport thank you drew

101
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:05,680
it's from yahoo answers user they're anonymous i'm gonna call them um uh no no no asks

102
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,400
why don't scientists make military armor from bug shells yes bugs have hard shells that scientists

103
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,680
can backwards engineer manufacture in their laboratories if you take a bug and you make

104
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,240
the bug as large as a human or even bigger no gun would penetrate the shell also shells from

105
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,360
bugs can be regenerated imagine having armor that can regenerate itself wait what say again

106
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,280
shells there question asker shells from bugs can be regenerated imagine having armor that

107
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,320
can regenerate itself okay so you went you went some ways that I used them to make material okay

108
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,440
great engineer a bug as big as a human wait yeah wait whoa whoa whoa whoa this is a little old

109
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,360
lady who swallowed a flycatcher the enemy army is beating us because their their new cool guns

110
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,120
get through our get through our armor well I'm gonna take this uh this goliath beetle I'm gonna

111
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,120
make it uh like way bigger than us and then I guess I'll try and take its skin and wear that

112
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,480
yeah sounds like a good plan to me boop boop boop boop I've been gored by the goliath beetle

113
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:25,600
and now it covered three minutes three minutes elapsed it was really bad you know I also I don't

114
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,480
know listen I'm not a bug expert that should surprise no one but I'm pretty sure if you like

115
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,440
peel bug armor off of it it's not like oh totally cool I'll just regrow that I'm pretty sure what

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,960
you're talking about is like it's skin maybe I mean I can get skin back when it falls off sometimes

117
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,320
so who knows how bugs do it um they're littler than me so I assume they can't they don't have

118
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,480
all of my remarkable human powers um they can't drive but I can't but at the same time if I shoot

119
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,520
a ladybug bullet bounce right off because it's very very powerful chitin and I guess what I'm

120
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,360
wondering is how can I wear a big ladybug or why not just get a bunch of ladybugs and wear them

121
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,240
all at the same time and now it's good yeah I'm alone three ladybug lady um hey that was the plot

122
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,440
of the Rodney Dangerfield movie ladybugs yes what what human power would you trade away for chitin

123
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:40,880
for chitinous plates hmm um you know maybe empathy wow yes good yes yes yes my my brother

124
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:49,680
my brother and gyver this is a chitinous cyborg free of emotion um I would say jumping

125
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,600
I just wouldn't be able to great point great point underused hardly using it for anything

126
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,520
anymore if you think about it guys I I'm trying let me stop and think about the last time I

127
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:11,680
jumped let me think about the last time that I I had cause to jump uh you think about that in like

128
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,640
in like a lot of uh something like the heart like the from software games like the hardcore action

129
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,240
games it's always note of it is made like you can't even jump like well so what yeah who still

130
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,000
jumps I'm god guys I swear I'm trying to think of the last big jump I did and I just I have I have

131
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,320
nothing I have nothing it must have been to get over a rock or something or to you know get the

132
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,720
health potion I don't fucking remember the last time I jumped it may have been the last time I

133
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,880
played basketball which is a long time ago just what about you what human power would you give away

134
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:58,880
they're all so great they're all good gift I think it would be regrowing hair oh I think

135
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:05,680
I would be okay with I to roll the dice I know I can't get any frosted tips that I later regret

136
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,000
uh I guess I gotta always die it but no I get this one hair and that's it this is all the hair

137
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,920
I have but I do have this incredible bulletproof chitin it lets me clean up the streets of Chicago

138
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,960
you know what along now you've made me think because you said this one hair which made me

139
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:28,960
think that instead of individual hairs you just have one adorable baby huey no but just more like

140
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,160
your entire head of hair was one solid piece a coiled rope yes and I thought here's what I would

141
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,440
go with um I would be willing to give up the space between my individual teeth to get bug

142
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
armor I would have just one big top tooth and one big bottom tooth one horseshoe shaped tooth

143
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,520
and I think I know amazing that actually might be more powerful than individual teeth now that I

144
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:04,000
think about it violated the spirit of the game then yeah I was at my coworker's birthday we're

145
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,280
not super close but it's civil holy shit okay I uh want to stab them quite bad yeah I'd like to

146
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,840
stab them but don't that's what civil means if it weren't for your human laws yes I gave her

147
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,040
a birthday card I keep in my glove box for emergencies that's some next level shit I hope

148
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,640
you mean emergency birthdays not just like oh no flat tire use it use it to stop the bleeding

149
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,320
it had love you lots on the front and gold letters I didn't think it was weird I just thought the

150
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,280
design was pretty when she read the front she said whoa I didn't know you felt that way really

151
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,960
stepping up this relationship how do I live in this atmosphere I've created that's from

152
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,080
platonic proposal in Chicago well congrats on realizing that this is completely your fuck up

153
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,920
this is completely your fuck up yeah this is like if you're gonna get an emergency card it

154
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,000
needs to say something like celebrate like just like I don't even think you want to go specific

155
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,400
as birthday now it's like celebrate and the side it's like this is a day yes or it just says

156
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:25,200
occasion exclamation point it's now the time is now for this day sorry thank you and congratulations

157
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:33,360
this day is here and you are here too you've made it to this day maybe more it could also

158
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,080
just be a sort of innocuous compliment like a picture of a dinosaur and on the inside it says

159
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,520
like I think you're a dino might and then they open that and read it and they're like oh it's

160
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,560
cool that's too much oh okay do you know how many times I've been at somebody's birthday and

161
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
I realized like oh I didn't get them anything I really should get through anything and then I'll

162
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,360
like sit there on my phone and send them an iTunes gift card from my phone yeah and then get the eye

163
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,520
contact from across the like I don't mean for it to happen right then but they'll get the

164
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,960
notification like bing bing oh hold on I got a text from Justin it's right this second it just

165
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:13,840
says I'm inconsiderate that's weird but it says it says I'm inconsiderate please enjoy the new

166
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:21,920
Drake album on me wow seven dollars Justin thanks so much I'll be able to enjoy half an album it's

167
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,320
a problem with gift cards right it's a problem with gift cards is you are saying here is exactly

168
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,440
what you're worth to me yeah here's the exact dollar value that you are that I value you this

169
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
is that could have gone 20 listen to technology today there should be an option when you purchase

170
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,360
like a gift card online for someone to backdate it like they'll just wedge it in in their gmail

171
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,720
like five days ago and it's like oh yeah we'll date it like you said it on Monday don't worry

172
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,360
about it we got that is that is psychotic what you just said Travis that is if we if Tim Cook's

173
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,720
listening you're welcome yeah but if we do that what the fuck are we all doing here on earth as

174
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:08,240
part of this one sort of beautiful consciousness if we can trick each other with time time traveling

175
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:15,680
birthday cards I'm sorry I got rid of my empathy in exchange for this shit and you got me that

176
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,840
you got me that empathy polish and I got you that chitin polish but I don't know how ironic

177
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,400
well I can use the chitin polish I just can't uh jump to get it where you put it on the high

178
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,880
shelf put it on the high shelf that was my fault it was I uh uh I'm recording this on

179
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,640
Sydney's birthday and Charlie asked uh my my four-year-old daughter asked uh what I got

180
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,160
Sydney so I showed her this gift certificate that I got and it was really more of a this is like one

181
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:52,560
of the things they email you I got her as I sponsored a um a baby incubator for like a

182
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,560
nation in crisis where they don't have access to medical care and I thought well that would be a

183
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,800
lovely gift my wife would really appreciate that and I'm I'm showing this it's got a picture of

184
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,560
the baby incubator and everything on the thing I'm showing this on the chair and explaining it to her

185
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,480
and I finished this whole explanation and she took like three beats and said

186
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:17,680
why would she want this like well sweetie she doesn't she doesn't she she's not gonna she said

187
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,480
mommy doesn't even have a baby she won't like this like okay but it's a gift but it's her birthday

188
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,240
I know okay fine sorry you didn't even have to finish that story I could have told you

189
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,440
how it panned out when you explained to your four-year-old I got mommy a something she won't

190
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,320
be able to touch and bright something she won't use like cool that sucks dad yeah it sucks check

191
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,440
out this this uh this ceramic jimmy buffett parrot that I got her at hallmark this is a gift

192
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,440
I got her this bag of slime that I made her yeah um so this is the longest we've ever gone without

193
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
actually talking about the question because I think that that is the that is the severity of

194
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,640
this mistake you've made um terrible mistake terrible mistake but mistake feels the term

195
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,800
mistake almost feels like it um suggests an accident happened you can't look at the card that

196
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:20,880
says uh I what was it love you lots and thank you lots you know what that you know love is subjective

197
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,320
yes but we all sort of have a kind of agreement on what it means and then lots lots as a modifier

198
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,120
as if to say a great deal of love I possess for you and you gave this to somebody who is not true

199
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,400
for I will argue though that it's not like this the the front of the card said I must tell you

200
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,160
about my deep and very real feelings for you it's said in gold letters love you lots a thing one

201
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:52,960
might write in somebody's yearbook so no no no no I would say that maybe like us love you like a

202
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,440
sister that's exactly that one's to be forgotten yes yeah I would say that have a course on this

203
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,320
blame yes part of this blame does fall on the co-worker who looked at a greeting card since

204
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,440
we purchased at a store that you handed them and thought this is a declaration of true emotion

205
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,440
I think no one should ever think when they look at a greeting card what's anything greeting cards

206
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,640
are man can we just talk about them for a second I hope you've got your finger on that fucking

207
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,560
Seinfeld button yeah light them up just light them up dude get this to get this uh get this

208
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,280
whole industry that's existed for thousands of years and it's definitely been the the butt of

209
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,680
many many stand-up routines they're the worst and I always get them because it feels like we

210
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,800
have to and sometimes they're nice but it just seems like hey you're right let's go to fucking

211
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:51,200
a hack hit it no okay you're right I earned this now sit in that stew in that shit stew in it and

212
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,480
think about what you've done sorry you're right that's both for the question asker and for Justin

213
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:04,480
yeah we all we've all made some mistakes here yeah um you want another yahoo okay no we didn't

214
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,200
give any sort of help like I want to send them get them on a card the next day that just says

215
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:17,920
like no I don't no I don't I think you I think you need to okay you said it's been civil with

216
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:25,360
this person you're not really close fine I think you need to the relationship is now at a different

217
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,120
level right it's obviously been escalated to a different kind of relationship I think you need

218
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,320
to see how long you can sort of maintain that level of relationship and maybe the like uh

219
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,000
nothing gold can stay perhaps the relationship will fade in time and you'll revert to this sort

220
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
of like civil thing the but the but possibly a dear friend has been made this is the moment

221
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,240
some sliding doors have a dear friend walk yes walk through the sliding doors thank you Travis

222
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,040
yes that is my official TM advice is I think give it a whirl just see if you can maintain it

223
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:08,240
you didn't plan to be here but now you're here it's like you know you got on the wrong home alone

224
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,840
plane and you ended up in New York instead of uh Florida or whatever and you know what maybe have

225
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,840
some fun in Florida remind you though that isn't what happened this person got on a plane that was

226
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,400
labeled get on this plane to go to Paris without your son Kevin and then they were like that

227
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,360
sounds good I'll try it and then they got on the plane and landed and was like Kevin it's like well

228
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:36,560
no you remember you saw the planes but it was labeled what what then what you are suggesting

229
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:41,040
Justin is they have arrived and said oh wait right Kevin's my son and I left him at home

230
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:47,760
oh well I better have somebody pay as well I can yeah that's fair yeah mine's mine not that hopefully

231
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,240
your scenario Justin makes it sound like Kevin McAllister is the victim in the home alone films

232
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,600
when I would argue that that is true of everyone else in his family but not Kevin McAllister

233
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,720
yes that's how that yes I want to die on that hill that's how you feel I just decided Kevin's

234
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,600
not the victim here it is the rest of the family not not the eight-year-old boy left home alone

235
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,240
because his family hated him and forgot about him well hate is a strong word don't you think

236
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,640
he's just uh being a little pervert uh to his uncle and so he doesn't get woken up for this

237
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,240
plane ride it's I think a lot of it is perspective we showed Charlie that movie for the first time

238
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,160
about a year ago and she was I mean for her it's a horror movie right for a year for for months

239
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,520
afterwards she talked about they left him alone which is the name of the film from her perspective

240
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
was they left him alone with the name of that film yeah but me I'm a father too watching this

241
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,920
is as a 38 year old father of two people I watch it from Catherine Harris perspective and think

242
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,840
yeah I get it you know I get it you just want to relax your kid has zero chill you just want to

243
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,240
relax in Paris for a little while you know they don't talk about all the time that Catherine

244
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:10,400
Harris gets to sit in fucking silence you know a day like at least a good 24 hours I'll just be

245
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,840
able to sit in fucking silence flight there and like a 14-hour flight back where yes she must have

246
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,720
gotten on the plane right on the return and be like I feel so terrible but you can only maintain

247
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,760
that feeling for so long before then they bring you like the warm nuts and like yeah okay I

248
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,600
actually haven't seen a movie in three years do you have movies on this flight I mean I do feel

249
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,400
terrible but I've been meaning to see if Greatest Showman was a hit or miss miss my boy I hope the

250
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:47,200
sticky men aren't gonna get him but um can I take a airplane wine nap now please oh the seats are

251
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:54,080
clawing all the way well that's nice Kevin would want me to check that out all right yeah that's

252
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:59,680
that we're the polka boys that's nice anyone holding is anybody holding I haven't smoked weed

253
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,120
since 1977 so this is probably fine yeah that's the only unrealistic thing is this motherfucker

254
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,600
started playing tuba and she doesn't bury a shiv in one of their throats like please this is my

255
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,600
moment just let me be why do we talk about home alone so much it's a touchstone apparently a

256
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,200
cultural touchstone I would say we do talk about it a lot um okay I have a yahoo here can we talk

257
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
about it okay it's sent by a few yeah we'll talk about that half as much as we talk about home

258
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,760
alone yes thank you uh everybody who sent this one and it's yahoo answers user fritz who asks

259
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,440
how did king triton get so buff yeah right he lived underwater where there's no resistance

260
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,960
how could he get so buff I'm not sure that your terminology is right here because I think water

261
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,760
is all resistance if that's the logic that you're using then uh mer folks who live in the water

262
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,000
would be getting jacked from all the swimming that they do because that's exercise false that's just

263
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
exercise I would say probably first heavy diet of plankton okay so he yeah okay so he has a sort

264
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,040
of he has a webbing in his mouth and we don't see that but when he does extend his jaws wide open

265
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:13,920
you see the webbing get in there and he does swallow up a million things and you know they're

266
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:20,880
trying to play the the xylophone or whatever and then they did get eaten that would be rad if she

267
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,840
walked on land for the first time with her human legs and she just collapsed like oh my bones my

268
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,400
terrible weakened bones oh she just collapsed because her gills were dried out she's like I

269
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:37,440
don't have lungs um but how to get so jacked up though he's very strong I don't know if you guys

270
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,880
remember the movie but he has a very strong upper body I mean probably magic right like

271
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:54,000
it's a very magical culture well that's true I feel like that's kind of a bullshit answer though

272
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,320
trav like just magic that doesn't really okay he works out 24 seven he's spotted by sebastian is

273
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,640
that what you want to hear swimming around is gonna get you a good tail yeah like everyone's

274
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,240
gonna have a good tail I know you've but like usually their arms are just like gracefully

275
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:17,200
behind them as they zip along you don't see a lot of like ripped jack huge chested dolphins

276
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,320
yeah exactly well what you just said is wrong they're all the fucking muscle man the dolphins

277
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,720
are all fuck muscle I do not know if you ever touched one of these bad boys but it is basically

278
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,360
yes but they don't have definition griffin yes they've got the muscle mass yeah where's the

279
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,160
definition the dolphin doesn't have a six-pack maybe anytime king trends on the screen he's

280

378
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,040

381
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,680
has launched peeps coffee and a peeps donut for spring okay peep flavor is starting to get into

382
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,800
get into things there's peeps creamer now i got and peeps cereal and peeps don't have a flavor

383
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,080
folks it's marshmallows with sugar on it folks and marshmallow really is puffed sugar so we're just

384
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,080
kind of talking about sugar mostly folks yeah you're telling me that you've made sugar flavored

385
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:47,440
creamer that's right and it doesn't taste like anything except sugar and now that's in a coffee

386
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,320
and a donut it's peeps marshmallow flavor coffee and espresso drinks and the peeps donut is topped

387
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,520
with an iconic yellow chick that's right folks they just put a chick on the donut one right on

388
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,880
there and the shelf life of these bad boys after you remove them from the packaging is about nine

389
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:12,160
seconds before they turn crunchy and inedible so are they doing these things to order because that

390
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,120
would be kind of wild uh yeah they're they're just slapped they're opening up a discrete package

391
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:28,080
uh as you as you uh pull up and uh slapping it on there so you can just enjoy a donut with a peep

392
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:34,480
on it um now because i did pick this so quickly there's not really anything funny about this one

393
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,640
because i was just trying to get you to stop talking about the dirty stuff so there's not

394
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,040
really anything good well hold on let's find let's find the i had a joke earlier i didn't

395
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,960
really have time to do but maybe it could make it funny when you just say that like a sugar

396
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,160
flavored creamer again so they did that oh so they made sugar flavored creamer sugar creamer

397
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,120
okay all right sugar and then you put it in the creamer okay carls here that was a much quad jr

398
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,400
then carls jr and i have one hold on hold on okay did you have one you want to do you want to get

399
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,640

400
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,480
justin okay please see where i'm going with this sugar creamer more like sugar creamer

sugar sugar creamer i hardly sugar new know her

402
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,440

403
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,640
truffle burger and a bacon truffle cheese fries this image is not gonna drive me anywhere except

404
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,240
out of my fucking mind this is this is a horrid thing that you should seek out and see for yourself

405
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,600
i'm gonna link you guys just so you can see in the chat there you can see the image of the burger

406
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,480
that's a tall one that is it's just layers upon layers of horrid and it's a menu innovation they

407
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,080
call it here with no trace of irony it features a decadent truffle infused white cheddar sauce

408
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:13,520
which has a deep rich and savory flavor including notes of garlic toasted onion and egg parmesan

409
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,640
the burger includes a charbroiled 100 black angus beef patty topped with premium white

410
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:28,240
cheddar truffle sauce two slices of applewood smoked bacon crispy onion straws swiss cheese

411
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,240
caramelized onions fucking they made this they made that they made that okay and then at the end

412
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:41,760
they were like and mayonnaise and then yes mayonnaise good on this thing here's a quote

413
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,960
about this crime the launch of our new bacon truffle angus burger connects back to our dedication

414
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:56,320
to introducing bold craveable and unexpected flavors to our menu in interesting ways this guy

415
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:00,880
had to come up with it i think they like ran into his office like we already started recording

416
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,160
quick say something about the black angus truffle burger it um connects back to our dedication

417
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,840
to introducing bold craveable and unexpected flavors in interesting ways you already said

418
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:17,120
unexpected yeah i know but i'm just making it up as a go truffle is traditionally viewed as a rare

419
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:25,120
indulgence and we're bringing it to the everyday dining experience do you do you trust us hardies

420

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,560

432
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,240
agro crag that i have to climb and eat from the top down this is a big big mound of it's a

433
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,600
challenging challenging fight challenging sandwich a challenging burger anyway that's all there is

434
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,040
to know about that that carl's junior now it doesn't mention specifically hardies so i don't

435
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,560
know if they're leaving hardies out in the cold on this one this may just be a carl junior ridge

436
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,400
our hardies would never serve a burger like this how about another question please i recently

437
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,760
started working in an office setting i only work there three days a week and i am a graduate student

438
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,440
so i'm not close with the full-time staff there's a small basket of candy that sits near the

439
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,720
secretary and i pass it every day on my way in i grab a few pieces throughout the day my question

440
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:41,280
is how many pieces is too many i feel bad taking too many as i'm not full-time staff and also as a

441
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,640
grad student it's hard to pass on free candy do i cut back on the candy do i just sneakily take

442
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,520
more at one time do i create a diversion to draw the secretary's attention so they at least know

443
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,640
it's not me depleting the resources and that's morgan i mean when you get to the point where

444
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,680
you're doing a little heist every time you get the candy i think you know it's too much candy

445
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:10,640
at that point am i wrong in my feeling about the candy at the front desk that's for visitors right

446
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,800
is that isn't that visitor candy as a way of saying like welcome here this isn't for the staff

447
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,000
this is for you our visitor please enjoy a tootsie roll i always thought if somebody puts out a bowl

448
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,480
of candy that's like the basic human way of signaling like i'm someone who likes interaction

449
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,680
this reminds me of the funny office uh the office episode american version of course

450
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:45,360
yes the original um and it the the scene where pam puts out all the candy uh and then dwight walks

451
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:51,520
up and he's gonna have a piece of candy and he puts his hand in the bowl and he starts to unwrap

452
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:58,400
it and then uh jim jumps up from behind the plant and gives him a good scare and he swallows it and

453
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:06,400
chokes on it no no he gets it out no but yeah i'm like it it's fine all right but he does pee himself

454
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:14,960
yeah so did we help i think let me let me i will uh take this way off your shoulders the like that

455
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,760
you're taking too many because you're not full time i think that's okay i think i don't think

456
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,280
anyone's like hey you only work 20 hours a week that's worth two pieces of candy the president

457
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,560
and the company doesn't walk in and just up in the bowl into their mouth and then say i earned this

458
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,600
this is mine this is my put in the hours and became the the the bar so this one listen to

459
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:43,440
the real answer and i hate to give real advice here it feels weird but you could offer to buy

460
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,080
the next bag of candy you could just do that but that would defeat the purpose if this person knew

461
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:54,560
how to buy candy we wouldn't be in this mess right okay have you heard of stores listen people put

462
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:00,480
out candy on their desks at work so for conversation starters i think it's a it's a it's the water

463
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:07,280
cooler come talk to me about lost still because it's all i think about and uh that's why i put

464
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:16,160
this thing on and oh uh tuesday's right with mori have you read it book club this week on tuesday

465
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,840

466
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,360
nobody read the book again i see um but i do notice that the worthers are gone um that is

467
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:33,600

471
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,320
do another one yes okay dear brothers i recently started working in a pasta factory on the ravioli

472
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,360
line this job would be perfect for me except for one thing i can't stop thinking about eating the

473
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:10,960
uncooked raviolis as they as they move past me the worst is but i have to stand there on the

474
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,280
the worst is but i have to stand there on the line and make sure no defective one gets passed i've

475
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:22,400
come so close to stuffing my pockets and getting the hell out of that sinner's paradise i can't

476
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,440
see goodbye arrow shortly because please tell me how to sedate the ravioli monster inside of me or

477
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:45,040
fill that's from randy for ravioli thank you so much it's on it's i just i want to just hit one

478
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:51,200
thing that it's an uncooked but i do understand that after a certain point of watching them roll

479
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,160
by that probably like fades to the back of your mind and you're just like but now i just want to

480
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,480
like yeah i know it's not gonna be good i just want to eat what i wanted to compulsion doesn't

481
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,320
have to make complete logical sense in fact oftentimes it does not although i will say

482
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,560
as somebody who recently learned that they had been um horribly maligned by his two older brothers

483
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:20,240
who he trusted very much into eating uncooked uh fettuccine every time we went to olive garden

484
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,200
i do hope that i would have had the good sense not to eat uncooked ravioli because there's a lot of

485
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,160
other sort of matter a lot of other sort of material floating around in that in that one

486
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,720
the problem is if you eat it and anyone sees you won't i don't even know that you'd so much get in

487
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,560
trouble for eating the product so much as everyone around you would be like what are you doing what

488
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,680
are you doing that's not cooked it's not cooked the other problem would be if i am working on

489
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:55,840
this line across from you and i saw you finally break and within one deft maneuver just shove

490
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:02,560
even like a defective one into your mouth i am my first assumption will not be oh i'm i'm sure

491
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,440
that's the first time they've done that it will be they have done this 400 times a day across from

492
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,400
me and this is the first time i have ever noticed or worse what if you do it and everyone's like oh

493
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:19,600
thank god someone did it first and then just the whole floor just to grab and go everyone's going

494
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:25,200
crazy shoving those little circles in their mouths this is the new foot loose this is foot

495
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,680
loose too but there's not any dancing and you're just just bowels loose you're the jeans wearing

496
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:36,800
rebel who comes in and shows everybody it's okay to eat this uncooked ravioli we're supposed to be

497
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,920
packaging wait but what do you do with the defective ones why can't you eat those here's

498
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:48,000
how i would do when you get a defective one be like just yell lala like oh god no and then

499
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,120
pick it up and throw it across the room but throw it in the same place every time and then at the

500
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:59,360
end of the day go get a ziploc baggie and scoop up all your dirty floor all your dirty defective

501
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:06,080
floor ravioli go have yourself a treat at home or oh hey bring a bag of uncooked ravioli from home

502
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,080
have them put a sticker on it or something when you come in and when you get that craving just

503
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:16,240
pop one of your own in there what if you went to your boss and you're like listen i have this

504
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,280
problem and you describe the problem and it's like i would i don't want to steal things but i do want

505
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:29,120
to eat the raviolis they're all pastry can i just keep a tally of the ones i've eaten and and just

506
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:35,760
deducted my paycheck at the end or alternately i will pay you a hundred dollars now and we'll

507
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,880
have a kind of budget that i can give into whatever i want it's like a gas station you're like i i

508
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,200
have this problem i want to eat it and he's like just puts a finger to his lips and then goes up

509
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,160
and like closes the blinds he's like come with me and opens and there's just like there's just a

510
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,400
room full of uncooked ravioli like whenever you need to you can come in here and satiate your

511
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,320
dark passenger wear this maybe they're waiting for some maybe the the boss is waiting for somebody to

512
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,920
be like hey listen i can't do this anymore i fucking love these pillowy bad boys too much

513
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,360
i can't work this job this close to him not even he and he's like finally i found special boy i'm

514
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,640
going to give my factory to someone who loves to eat these delicious little bastards as much as i

515
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:26,480
do the man who ate all the uncooked ravioli he wanted he shit himself it's not cooked it was

516
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,280
really really quite yucky don't don't do that but here are the keys um to the building anyway

517
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:38,320
get in this uh death box we're gonna fly up it's gonna be cool is there somebody you hate at work

518
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,320
where you could like eat them and then if you get caught just like actually i saw jared jared was

519
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:49,440
doing it and he i thought it was fine because jared is beloved here and i thought it was kind

520
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,800
of a fine company policy to eat them for everyone i've eaten yeah it's true smell is nasty ricotta

521
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,480
mouth and and like they open his locker and you've stuffed a bunch of uncooked ravioli do it

522
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,520
it's really i mean i was just thinking why can't you just buy a box of this uncooked ravioli but

523
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,480
it's not the same right like you want it you want it fresh out of mama's kitchen yeah but what you

524
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,160
can do what you can do is while you're on the assembly line you have brought a box of say 16

525
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,920
uncooked raviolis and then you dump them out onto the line and you real quick run further down the

526
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:31,360
belt and scoop up 16 fresh from mama's kitchen ones and then no one is the wiser except for the

527
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:36,560
fact this would be a very conspicuous thing to do maybe just whenever you go on break for lunch just

528
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,560
say like okay i'm on break and once you clock out just lay down at the end of the conveyor

529
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,680
belt and let them fall in your mouth you're on break they can't fire you no could you they can

530
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:53,440
only arrest could you suggest to your bosses that you open the factory to the public and start doing

531
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:01,920
tours and one of the the perks of the tour is at the end you get to pop of one of the sweet raviolis

532
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:09,760
in your mouth no problem no questions asked uncooked and then when the tours open you take

533
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:18,560
the day off show up in a fake mustache and go and you just keep doing disguises you do disguises

534
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,880
where you can show up and take like hello my name is jim posterson and i have heard good things

535
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:29,760
that's my favorite part of the louisville slugger tour is at the end where you get the unfinished

536
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:35,440
bat and you're just allowed to smash it on the ground just blast it everybody gets one

537
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,200
justin you mentioned disguises you don't even have to set up this whole plot about the tour

538
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:46,480
you could just dress up in a big hairy suit and run in and start eating all the ravioli right off

539
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,840
the belt and then everybody else there be like oh no the beast the beast is back the beast is back

540
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,600
and they have to lock themselves in the safety room and start lighting the torches

541
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:02,320
you might have to do a little groundwork beforehand and say like hey guys i was just

542
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:07,840
outside uh getting something for my car and i saw a beast running around and that might take weeks

543
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,520
to really establish the myth that you couldn't do it same day you couldn't like the morning

544
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,560
i'll say the beast and come in the afternoon you'd have to spot it when no one else did just like hey

545
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,440
did you guys see the i saw the beast okay but you're gonna have to you're gonna have to clear

546
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,320
this with your boss first so go into your boss and he said um excuse me uh hello can i can i come in

547
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:36,960
yes come in it's it's uh it's me fert um i had an idea for one thing that might make it good

548
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,520
to work here make it make it better finally yes please i've been waiting for some kind of suggestion

549
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:49,120
on what would make it good to work here please tell me it would be um citing if sometimes a

550
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:56,080
werewolf showed up not a werewolf not a werewolf the beast please the beast oh thank you thank you

551
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,640
other boss that's a much better suggestion i can see we're on the same page here please do not

552
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:09,440
treat him with the same level of respect you can tell from my big diaper so um it might be a good

553
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,240
thing sometimes it might make it fun exciting uh-huh um and now what would these bees do would

554
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,280
he come in and do maybe a funny dance or wave some pom-poms around yeah sure whatever and then he

555
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:27,920
would probably eat some of the ravioli like like coming with a big steaming plate of it that he had

556
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:37,760
made at home boiling water that the baby boss that's the ball that's a great question no he

557
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,480
would just come in and um he would just kind of he would just kind of eat him raw he just kind of

558
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:48,240
