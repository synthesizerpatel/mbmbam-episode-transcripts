1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better, it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's better, it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
It's better, it's better with you

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,460
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era

9
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,020
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,860
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy. I'm a sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,380
Oh my god guys guys guys, but what what is it trap?

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,260
I listen if there's one thing I know about the two of you

13
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,780
It's that you're always looking for a good investment

14
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:38,940
And I hope you guys are ready to get in on the ground floor because I've got a really exciting opportunity for you guys

15
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,860
So much money and I want to make I want to turn it into more money by doing no work

16
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,580
I don't know. Hey, yeah, so happy to hear that. So I

17
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,420
Was approached by some scientists and they're looking for investors

18
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,020
They are going to open up what kind of scientists? Oh

19
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:04,860
Like really really smart. They have like lab coats and what's their like, but what's their like field? Uh, let's say genetics

20
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,140
very

21
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,060
promising very promising they're planning to open up a

22
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,540
a

23
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,540
experience park and

24
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,820
They will be

25
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,380
Bringing back and you guys aren't gonna believe this

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,460
dinosaurs

27
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,020
Dinosaurs and they are looking for investors to help fund this park and this thing. Oh my god guys

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,460
It's gonna be a huge hit. Yeah, the return on investment is all but guaranteed

29
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,500
So can I can they will they name a stegosaurus after me if I give them like a hundred bucks?

30
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,340
They are looking for a little bit more than that. I

31
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,060
They're looking in the range of like mmm, and this is this is gonna pucker you up a bit, but like five million dollars

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,620
Okay, the five million be going towards yeah

33
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,420
Making dinosaurs and feeding the dinosaurs and building walls for the dinosaurs

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,340
I could probably make you a dinosaur for like ten ten large

35
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,180
Well ten G's, I mean maybe split it three ways, but listen guys listen

36
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,500
I know I know that that kind of number is very big

37
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,700
But once this park opens and everybody starts going to it, we're gonna make so much money back. Okay

38
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,020
I'm gonna I hate to put you on the spot. Okay, but you are now the official representative

39
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:39,220
Representative of the park understandable. Yeah, okay. Um, the what if we bring them back

40
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,980
They're a danger and I missus and this is my question. Okay, if we bring them back, is there not a danger?

41
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,460
That they will sort of run. I

42
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,380
Mean, I don't want to be offensive. I know PC culture, but kind of run wild on humanity

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,820
Oh, well, oh, did you miss where I said we'd be building walls? There would be big kick-ass walls

44
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:11,460
We'd have walls. That's and the other thing juice is the reason the caveman's got pwned is they didn't have our

45
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,380
bazookas, yeah, okay our

46
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,800
Electricity weapons

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,340
Dinosaurs hate those so I'm not worried so much about that. I'm more worried about that. Dinosaurs are not sexy

48
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,180
so I guess could we could we give them like big boobies big jugs and

49
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
wieners

50
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,100
That's already part. Yeah, that's definitely a little in our audience

51
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,520
No, no, I don't think so. I think because we'll have we'll have a little bit of something for everyone

52
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,280
Yeah

53
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,240
Not all that not all the dinosaurs are gonna have big juicy jugs and like we can't do that to a terror

54
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,140
Pterodactyl because it would fall out of the sky. You got to balance that but like and so it's like some t-rex

55
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,260
Yes, we'll have being juicy drinks

56
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,220
Big big beautiful

57
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,140
Jugs or what? Yeah, let's let's so up. What depends on how much we invest. Let's pivot. That's true

58
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,820
Here's me at the dinosaur park. Where's the t-rex over there? Oh, yeah, that's pretty cool. Wow. Damn. That's a good t-rex

59
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,980
Well time to go home. How are you gonna make it sticky?

60
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,940
Right, right, right

61
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,900
Well, we're planning to have a couple restaurants that will then serve chopped up dinosaurs

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,760
Okay, yeah, but they will have dinosaur steaks so you can find out what the dinosaurs tasted like, you know what I mean?

63
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,940
that's actually if I'm gonna be honest, that's kind of the primary focus of

64
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,260
The park at this point. Yeah, we will be churning these dinosaurs out at a rate

65
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,740
that to keep up with a hunger base

66
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,940
Yeah, okay, and that can be like our NFTs, which is which is new food

67
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,660
pterodactyl

68
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,980
exactly

69
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
also

70
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:03,260
At this this this one's kind of important. We're gonna make the dinosaurs bigger and bigger and bigger but also

71
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:09,220
Yeah, and this is my innovation that I kind of gave to them some of them smaller and smaller and smaller

72
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,960
That could be cool. What if we made this small dinosaurs big and the big dinosaurs small and then like let everybody see them

73
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,220
Get revenge on like a tiny little t-rex that they could just kind of stomp around

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,220
You know we you touched on this briefly trap

75
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,020
But I do think the possibilities of eating the dinosaurs is massive. Thank you

76
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Um, I think that if we're breeding them already we're creating them with you know, big beautiful juicy jugs

77
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,580
that's already I'm actually gonna put a I'm gonna put a

78
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Limit on that I'm talking about that and it the limit was two times ago

79
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,620
Okay, so that's off the table, but we are still talking about eating these gorgeous

80
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,660
Well, yeah, and I'll tell you this guys these geneticists have made some serious breakthrough

81
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,720
They said that they can breed these dinosaurs with inherent teriyaki flavor. Okay

82
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,360
It's just right in their blood right in their DNA. Well, is there a worry is there dino DNA, please?

83
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,880
It is there a worry is there a concern that that will make them too delicious to their compatriots now if I'm struggling

84
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:21,840
I'm waiting for my next bucket of sheep slop and I am and Craig start smelling real good

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,760
A lot of umami loft enough. Yeah. Yeah, I might have to go in for a taste now Justin

86
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm thank you for asking the scientists did say

87
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,000
that it will not make them more violent towards each other but

88
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,400
The teriyaki does get in their brains and just make them more violent in general more aggressive

89
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,960
So there will be a they will be delicious and angry, but I we don't see that as a problem

90
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Also, it will increase their vertical leap tenfold. Yeah

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,600
How would they know that they could jump that high right like they won't know

92
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,360
Are you telling me the secret is that they have to believe in themselves?

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,240
Well, Justin, I mean that's not scientific. But yes, we'll have a tinder dactyl. We'll have a stegosaurus

94
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,360
There's a lot of opportunities here that I'm really try tip ceratops

95
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
There's another great option for one very good cut cut up and eat these. Yeah, perfect

96
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
and

97
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,120
Scene, thank you so much for joining us T-bone Rex

98
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
on this

99
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,620
Sponsored episode. I don't know if you guys are excited but all two hours and 26 minutes of Jurassic World Dominion

100
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Is coming my way

101
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,920
This evening at the local multi

102
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,640
Excited to get a seat for this this this ride

103
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,240
I I will say Justin the thing that was in the movie what they resurrect dinosaurs

104
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,040
But what the movie resurrects in my heart is hope and let me tell you why Justin and maybe

105
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
resurrects not the right word because it doesn't make it seem like some kind of dinosaur Jesus, but

106
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,600
For me Justin. Yeah, I just can't wait to see how they once again are surprised that dinosaurs are running amok

107
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,840
Right, you think after a while after six of these ding-dang things, right?

108
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,340
We get to the point where they'd be like, oh, what's that die? Yeah, we're fucked man. Yeah

109
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,420
I should have invented some sort of dinosaur poison certainly at this. Thank you

110
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:31,640
They are animals and what do humans excel at if not poisoning the animals?

111
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:37,900
Yeah, unlike other I was inspired to take on another sponsored episode because I was listening to our

112
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,660
McElroy family fun hour sure sponsored by two teams don't need to say the name of the brand can see don't well

113
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,220
They already I mean they're a dear friend a dear friend of the brand of our brand

114
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,820
It's a brand partnership and I really miss doing those but people aren't exactly the line

115
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,260
I know there's a lot of other podcasts out there. Yeah these days

116
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:02,080
So this one is kind of on spec in the ass. I feel like Universal should just donate whatever

117
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,820
They feel is fair to us. Oh

118
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Interesting. Yeah, so like we'll do the we'll do the episode right and then hope that they hear it

119
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,980
I guess that I don't know how to reach them. Yeah

120
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,860
Yeah, and then they'll sort of like pay us whatever they think is fair for this branded content. It's on spec

121
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,700
Well when we're done if you guys want I can like put this onto like a CD or disk and like send it to Sam Neil

122
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,980
I'm so can you get this to somebody? It's so cool that you know how to do that. Yeah. Thank you. I

123
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,280
Tried I can't get my computer to do it

124
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,660
I put CDs in my computer and it just starts playing the songs on them. Oh, no, no, no, you got to have a burner

125
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,940
I can't tell you guys something. I'm great. What?

126
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,780
This is great is I want to keep it on Jurassic Park just for a little bit Jurassic World Justin, please

127
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,140
Jurassic World Dominion huge opening

128
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,460
Is what we're trying to get them going that long people heard this flick listen

129
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,460
People are sick of dinosaurs, but we're gonna bring it back. You're welcome

130
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,840
Just like they brought back the dinosaurs got a story from the Hollywood Reporter here for you

131
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,840
Um, you know Sam Neal's back for this one. Oh, yeah my buddy

132
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah, your buddy Sam Neal is back for this one get not the team back Alan Grant Ellie Sattler. Sure the whole team

133
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,400
Skronk you remember you guys remember skronk the big one the caveman they resurrected to help them kill all the dinosaurs and I think it was

134
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,280
Three that was a three. Yeah

135
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:39,940
three because that guy parachuted into the pterodactyl enclosure and saw a frozen caveman in the wall and then he like

136
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,600
Landed over there and then he like held the lighter up to the ice for a while

137
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,320
It was Vince Vaughn and he was getting pecked apart by the pterodactyls

138
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,800
But then skronk broke out of the ice and he was like, I'm your granddad

139
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:57,240
No, actually, I believe Vince Vaughn played skronk in this one because I call dibs. Oh, sorry

140
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,800
Oh, sorry. Okay. So you guys remember in the first Jurassic Park one of the first ones they see is that Brachiosaurus and they're like

141
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,720
Yeah, I'm nutting over like yeah, they've been losing

142
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,360
His pants he's like, you know, he's like so classic that I thought by the way

143
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
I thought the sound effect they used was a little over-the-top but go on

144
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,960
Yeah, so Hollywood Reporter is interviewing Sam Neal press junket for this film

145
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:27,960
in 20 and this is the story says in 2018 Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom the fifth installment in the Jurassic franchise the

146
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,920
beloved Brachiosaurus from the 1993 film

147
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Perished as a result of a volcanic eruption on ice and nublar and Neal

148
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,280
until now

149
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,960
Meaning in the interview was unaware that it was the same

150
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,320
Brachiosaurus that had bowled Grant and Sadler over in 1993. So here's the

151
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,180
Quote from Sam. I didn't know it was the same one. Well, that is heartbreaking

152
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Such a sweet creature

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
You tender-hearted

154
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,680
Dear man, why? Wait, hold on stop the interview. Stop the interview. What what it was the same one

155
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
What are you talking about?

156
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,080
No, someone would have told me I got I I've hold on I've got to call somebody about this. I need confirmation

157
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:33,160
Oh Sam also, I didn't know is it how are we supposed to know that he has somebody he has a tattoo. Oh

158
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,160
And it's kind of like play but he did have a Dino tattoo from Flintstones, yeah

159
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,860
Oh my god. Hey, did you guys ever put it together that Dino is also like spelled like Dino?

160
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:53,040
Don't insult my intelligence and the intelligence of our many listeners cuz it's like is it so I can't wait

161
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,240
To see this one. I did miss the last one of them and the one before that and so I wondering if I if there will

162
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:07,360
Be certain things. Yeah that I will. Okay. Well my only exposure is that sometimes we go to the dinosaur park here in

163
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Austin and it is a purely

164
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,760
These things are dead as disco. These are decorative dinos only

165
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Um, but they do have toys there from the JP franchise and it's like watch as he shares a psychic link

166
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,660
Via Bluetooth connection with blue the velociraptor and it's like whoa

167
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,320
There's definitely some plot losing. I would say in the first and second where um, there is okay guys

168
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,680
There's a moment in the first one

169
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Where what they've done here and I find this quite interesting as a choice is they've said

170
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,360
People are getting fucking bored with that. They've seen dinosaurs

171
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,800
So what we're gonna do is invent our own dice are gonna make a different dinosaur

172
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,440
Okay

173
00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:00,720
And it it what it does is invents a world in which after like a decade or so everyone's like dinosaurs fucking seen them

174
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,680
Yeah, dude, I get it it doesn't invent that world Travis it observes the current world because if you don't think that would happen

175
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,320
You're not paying attention, man. Yes

176
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:20,760
Man, and you know what? Nobody else is either. So let's do some advice question. Okay. Yeah, I think that that's what America needs right now

177
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,600
Now we didn't plan this spec episode by the way in time to request

178
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,320
Dinosaur themed questions. So I just pulled the questions that I thought

179
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,940
We could maybe we could somehow tie it in. Yeah, that's part. That's so tasteful

180
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,580
Thank you. Yeah, a lot of people are so sweaty in these in these sponsored things

181
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,780
They're like so desperate to like say the brand over and over again. Yeah, and we may as well

182
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:52,620
We may not mention we might not mention it again, right? This year. I'm gonna be working at a camp for most of the summer

183
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,660
I'm super excited and this be fine. Except my birthday is also in the summer. I will be turning 17 if you were curious

184
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,700
I was I am NOT a big birthday person in general preferring to do something smaller with my friends

185
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,900
And I do not want to celebrate my birthday with people. I don't know. Well, the issue is I have some friends

186
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,620
They're also working there. I'm not sure if they know when my birthday is

187
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,700
I don't want to tell them the other staff, but I also don't ask them directly in

188
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Case they don't know and then slip up later, but brothers, what should I do?

189
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,900
Hmm, yeah

190
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,780
Or you guys see the catch here, right? You guys see the problem, right? Distill it for me. Dr

191
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,900
Grant if you go to your friends and say like hey

192
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,820
Do you are you guys like do you know when my birthday is right? Like so loaded? Absolutely

193
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,180
Do not that's what I'm saying that to any human being ever in your life. You cannot cannot be done

194
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,900
Because just by introducing that

195
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,180
Right, there is no like if they're like no

196
00:16:52,180 --> 00:17:01,680
No, why and you're like don't worry about it. Oh god, that would be so brutal. Oh, oh

197
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Right, this one is actually tough a lot of these are easy

198
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,620
But this one's tough cuz what if they like what if you walk in to the egg hall?

199
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
And they have all of the

200
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,080
kids with

201
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:24,540
Special powers. I'm assuming that's the kind of camp it is. Yeah. Why else would anyone go to camp talents and gifts that they have to be

202
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,840
Honing like what if you go into the egg hall and they're like

203
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,560
Singing you're like they they're like here they are and then they sing happy birthday to you

204
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:42,380
Or you're like right in the middle of like running like, you know a training exercise in the danger room

205
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:49,120
And then they're like, what's this? Oh, no, it's the birthday cake monster. And you're like, oh no, man

206
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,820
This is so embarrassing and in front of Wolverine. Oh

207
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,560
Well, yeah, I don't think it's X-Men. That's a that's a comic. That's like a cartoon

208
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Well, it's also a good point Griffin because it's a school and not a camp

209
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,360
Yeah, that's a good point because like they're not working. Yes. You have do you think?

210
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,440
Do you think professor Charles Xavier's school for gifted children?

211
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
You think they had like?

212
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,960
Field trips to Heinrichs like oh, yeah got to go to cosine and do all the things like did they get to go to Kings

213
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,500
Island and today we're gonna go to the dairy farm to figure out how you milk cows. Exactly

214
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,480
I can shoot like spikes out of my hands

215
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
While we're milking the cows, it'll make all the milk come out

216
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,720
Think that a professor Charles Xavier school for gifted children did they have like algebra? I

217
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
mean interesting like

218
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,280
Wait, I don't you have to cut something. Yeah to have time for the danger room

219
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,960
It's got to be home economics though, like, you know those kids, you know

220
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,280
Ice man walks out with his fucking diploma and they're like, okay, that'll be

221
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,680
$1,500 for the diploma and your robes and we will take a check and he's like I do not know

222
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,680
how to

223
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,360
Do a check

224
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,920
But this one is like that. There's a teacher there

225
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,800
It gets a small rip in this costume you see I just

226
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Yeah, I don't know what to do

227
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Done for it. I'm sorry. I need a new where do you get more of these? But that implies that there's nothing to be done

228
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:35,220
There's a moment as a teacher's lounge right where it's just like here's you know Emma Frost and she's like yesterday

229
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,440
We taught the students how to you know, fight the Sentinels or whatever and then like there's like, you know

230
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Teacher, mr. Like Stevens who's like, yeah, and I got this kid. He's not doing great in math

231
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,960
Or but what did you say about Sentinels? What's your class? Yeah, that sounds good

232
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,680
Do you think it's just sitting in the audience at Hamilton like this is fucking what kind of twisted mind thought up?

233
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
all these crazy characters

234
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm pretty sure I said jubilee. I don't think I said

235
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,880
Save your school for gifted children. Thank you. Did they get like Christmas break?

236
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,280
I'm like summer break and shit

237
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,320
No, that wouldn't make any sense that your parents a lot of those kids didn't come from great environments

238
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,040
They don't want to go home for Christmas. Yeah, buddy

239
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,500
But like if my kids like oh, yeah BB has powers and she can like, you know make machines do her better

240
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,240
I'm like awesome. Oh, yeah. She's got to go to this special school. Cool. Cool. When do I get to see her? Oh

241
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,320
She's gotta fight the Sentinels excuse me my kid my kids gotta fight the fucking Sentinels. Yeah

242
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,920
Well, that's how else do you want him to learn how to make it in this crate this cuckoo all of ours

243
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:56,080
And you guys are also gonna teach stuff about like taxes and like how a bill becomes a law and stuff, right?

244
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,760
Well for sure sort of yeah, actually very close to that on Friday's the teachers get a half day

245
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,420
Uh-huh to go kill Magneto. So they're gonna watch mr. Holland's opus

246
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,280
So it's kind of that I guess

247
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,680
Okay, one of those fucking fighting Magneto Magneto is like what's that terrible smell and it's like oh I have us

248
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:21,040
I have this weird hot stink that comes out of my

249
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,560
armpit hair I

250
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,120
have a hot stink that comes out of my armpit hair and

251
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,680
Yeah, and it's why it's like crazy man. It's like so

252
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:38,760
That kid like he get he goes to senior year and then he's the all everyone's like

253
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,420
So here's your costumes with big exes on them and then this to Jake is like, so where's they're like, here you go

254
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,040
Jake is what's this is your diploma you graduated. See you later. There's gotta be good luck

255
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,900
There's got to be someone who just discusses in a comic book, but I've never thought about it before that

256
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:03,080
There's like when they graduate. It's like hey, listen, you didn't make the team and you're also

257
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:09,040
Not even Alpha Flight Canada. You're not like cut out to be like a teacher here. So

258
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,840
You're you you're done. I was like, what do I do?

259
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,360
What do I do now? Well, my suggestion my first would be to get your GED because you do not have a comparable

260
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:25,080
Not accredited you've basically been

261
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,760
Legally truant the last eight years. So there's gonna be some issues here

262
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,240
Also, we will be sending a bill to your parents because like we kind of fed you and did stuff for you for like eight

263
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
Years and now like you're not

264
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Part of the team or whatever. So

265
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,480
So tired of giving away all these great free ideas

266
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,360
I know and I also worry that we're getting a little too like like into the nerdy stuff. Yeah

267
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,360
Let's get back to the dinosaur stuff, right? Yeah, these big beautiful beat now. Here's another question

268
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:02,320
Oh Griffin, you got something speaking of nerds. Here comes a wizard and I can call him that cuz we're friends cool

269
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm glad you guys have grown so close by the way

270
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:11,360
Yeah, we're like real road road boys. So Adrian cowl sent this in

271
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,760
Thank you, Adrian. Nice to have you back in the fold. It's how to act like a Furby. Oh

272
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:25,560
Furbies a fun toy for kids and well and is fun to act like they change their whole outlook on life often and are always

273
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,440
Hungry, if you're a huge Furby fan acting like a Furby can be a lot of fun. Oh

274
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:37,520
Yeah, we're of an age to remember the the Furby craze our Furbys fun

275
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Sure. Yeah, how in what way? I talk to each other. They do

276
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,760
How's that fun? Like why are you being so judge here? No, I'm thinking about this. I'm not trying to be judgy

277
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm trying to think about there are toys that do I I just bought BB and dot a marble run

278
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,440
Fucking fun for days, right a

279
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,480
Furby, I'm just not sure what service is providing as far as fun goes listen to you

280
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,120
yeah, I say that sentence out loud again and then think about what how you're saying it about this the service that the fun child's

281
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
toy that talks and sounds like a

282
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
You're ruining the fucking mood

283
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,800
Wow, okay, please go on. I'm willing to open my mind up to the fact that

284
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,640
Maybe a Furby is in some way

285
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:35,000
Fun. Yeah. Okay. All right. Creep. All right. Thank you. Sorry such a gosh dang. So sorry

286
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,640
I'm just saying guys. I just don't see what it does. Okay, it's fine

287
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,280
What does it have to do? What is a marble run to do?

288
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,880
Marbles in it and I want you to do things a Furby demands my attention

289
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,840
It's not gonna fucking rub my feet at the end of the day. So it's a shitty toy

290
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:57,960
Oh, yeah, it's not a cookie. It's not gonna cook me my my ham at the end of the day

291
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,560
So what's the fucking point of it? It's not making me money. That's for sure. Just I'm so sorry about all this Griffin

292
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,040
Can you just go try to did to carry on? I don't know that I fucking can

293
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,960
Looking the part decide what color Furby you are they vary in color from white black orange pink blue and even yellow

294
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,660
Choose the color you like best cool. I think I'm gonna go yellow. Okay, you don't even like them

295
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,200
You don't like you don't get to say that you don't even get to do pretends. Oh my god

296
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,080
Justin's I'm just saying that a Furby is an

297
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,920
Electronic version of a bag of flour given to a kid in health class to learn about responsibility

298
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,880
Okay

299
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,240
Marbles just rocks and ramps. Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome, dude

300
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,680
We're just listen to cool things where furry clothing according to the color you picked for example

301
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,440
If you are a blue Furby where blue furry clothing with no texture designs on it

302
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
Wow

303
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,580
Sanication go barefoot Furby's dread shoes. So when I can't Furby's dread shoes

304
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,880
so whenever you

305
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,840
Go barefoot whenever you can in the summer wear flip-flops a lot. Um

306
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Okay, but you just said

307
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,340
Here's here's another thing. Don't wear makeup and jewelry a Furby would never wear these things Furby baby

308
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,920
I like you just natural you don't have to try like the other take your makeup off

309
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,200
Take your shoes off put some makeup off your Furby now

310
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,820
But do wear a realistic pair of ears that are the color of your Furby

311
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,400
Purchase a realistic has some text. That's busted

312
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,000
Purchase a realistic tail to wear them every day. Do not sleep in them

313
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,600
Wait, don't sleep in her Furby can't take off his fur. We can't rip off its ears and tail

314
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Catch your sleep

315
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,600
They'll grow back

316
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
They always do

317
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,040
Free me

318
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,120
Change your personality according to what is happening in life pretty sure

319
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,720
We're all doing that all the time. That's automatic. Actually. Yeah, that's actually how

320
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:11,600
Being works. Yeah, how do we know Furby's don't like makeup and jewelry is that maybe we've just never offered that

321
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,140
Maybe we've never tried to doll up

322
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,080
Tart up boy

323
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,800
Tart up one of these for turn up these beautiful boys

324
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,680
Sorry, my Furby tart this Furby for me, please if everything is going well with your family and friends and life is great

325
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Be social kind and caring if someone angers you or makes you mad or life is pretty sad for you

326
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
Be grouchy if you're away from crowds

327
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,200
Check check checks across the board. Yeah, I've got this covered actually. I'm actually already being a Furby all the time

328
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,280
What's this copied and pasted from maybe a different wiki how article? Yeah, I can just use that here

329
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,080
It's applicable when someone pulls their steps on your tail do something according to your personality

330
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,700
If you are in the loving one gig if you are in the loving one

331
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,280
Giggle if you are in the grouchy one glare if you are the dancer girl boy go out

332
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,520
Dude, if you are the sassy type roll your eyes

333
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:13,680
That is what happens when someone pulls my butt now just as a human some pulls my butt and if I'm in a loving mood

334
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
I'm like

335
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:21,440
And when I'm in a dancer girl or guy mood, I guess sure. Yeah, I was on the street dancing the other day

336
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,760
So we grabbed both cheeks and pulled as hard as they could. Oh, man. I'm sorry, and I I was my mistake

337
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,960
So I was like, hey, I didn't say how dude cuz I was in dancer mode

338
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,480
And so if I I'm not allowed to be a Furby anymore eat a lot

339
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,680
Furbies get hungry frequently. Don't stuff yourself. Never overeat or put yourself at risk for diabetes

340
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
What?

341
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,120
Thanks took a strange turn. Thanks wiki how article

342
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,560
Just eat whenever you feel hungry and eat a variety of anything. You like love desserts and sweet treats eat dessert a lot

343
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,440
What?

344
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,280
Wait, this is part of being a Furby. Yeah, man. Eat a lot, but don't eat a lot

345
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,520
It's hey Jeremy. I was looking at your first draft of this wiki how article you wrote about how to be a Furby

346
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
What do you think?

347
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,840
Sir, I'm sorry, sir. Yeah, I only I only wrote in

348
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,880
30 or 40 pages of nutritional. This is mainly an article about nutrition that I've briefly mentioned the Furby's at the beginning

349
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,680
Are you yeah? Yeah

350
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:22,920
No

351
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:29,520
I'm thinking maybe expand to the Furby aspect of this and maybe include something about how to react when someone's mean to you

352
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,200
Might be useful to I mean just a general reader, right?

353
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:41,160
Through the focus groups and we definitely need way less nutrition stuff way more stuff about how if someone pulls your butt you go

354
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,800
Ow, dude

355
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,320
Yeah

356
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,800
And maybe change the title from like how to eat healthy and like have the energy you need to accomplish things throughout the day

357
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,240
Maybe change that to be like how to be a Furby. I

358
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:58,000
Don't actually know I've never actually seen a Furby. Is that a problem or no, I've pulled up

359
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,920
Several tabs on my computer just like all the time just in case you had asked about it

360
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,520
Your computer's smoking. Is that it's a lot of tabs

361
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,840
So if you want to come check them out, they've been up for a while. So there's some burn-in on the screen

362
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,160
You gotta hold it because that's the sacrifice you make for Furby's now, let me pull your ears and tail off

363
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,680
That's weird. They won't come off. I'll just pull harder

364
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Ah, okay now go back and write and don't let this happen again. Oh, no, my wife's probably gonna come downstairs now

365
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,920
I'm gonna say that I cut my finger off over the mitre. Yeah, that's fair

366
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
Sleep a lot

367
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,480
I'm doing again. I'm

368
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,960
Life, huh?

369
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,840
Furbies get tired easily take one or two naps during the day and have an earlier bedtime than others sleep in as long as you

370
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,920
Like there is what sleep in as long as you like as long as there is no school if it is a school day

371
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,280
Wake up on time. Yes. No, did you add that? No, no, it says that

372
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,760
It doesn't say keep your grades up, but I think it's implied there it's implied

373
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Hey, check this out. Love music

374
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,840
Okay

375
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,520
Love music dance to music and have fun. Don't forget to change into a dancer's girl slash boy. What music is okay guys

376
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:21,920
Here's what I'm starting to learn that I was wrong at the beginning because apparently a Furby is very useful to teach us how

377
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
To be more human

378
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,600
Right. He's teaching us like what someone makes you mad

379
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,280
It's okay to be mad and when you're hungry, you should eat don't get nine beauties and like you're tired

380
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,160
You should sleep man. And when music comes on fucking dance like nobody's watching

381
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:44,360
It's so wild that they felt they had to clarify you should not eat to a point where it's detrimental to your health

382
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:51,840
Why did we have to clarify that for this? I'm not sure I trust the wiki how Furby article to

383
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,320
Set those kinds of parameters. Yes for

384
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
Anyone anyone at all?

385
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,040
Have some confidence in your convictions when you're like sleeping as much as you want

386
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,560
That's what Furby would do unless you have school. Well, which one is it? Yeah

387
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah, it should go whole hog. It should be like kiss a Furby. Just like a Furby's whole hog. Yeah

388
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,880
Get your Furby whole hog out sing if you like singing sing frequently and always hum pretend to think no one is listening when you

389
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,360
sing wait

390
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
pretend to think

391
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,660
Holy that just sent an existential chill up my spine. What if that's all I'm ever doing. Holy shit Furby article

392
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
Oh no

393
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:47,360
Oh, no, no happy learn furbish. No, I can only pretend to think

394
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,120
And so am I only pretending to exist? What would they can't say?

395
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,400
Oh, no, I've ceased to exist. I'm de-realizing

396
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,240
You can't get a Furby and read the instructions

397
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,640
It comes with a guide to speaking furbish memorize all you can download the Furby app

398
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,840
Look in the Furbish dictionary and learn to speak it fluently

399
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,200
Do not go overboard with Furbish. Make sure others can still understand it. Fuck you wikiHow article

400
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm gonna make edits to this right now

401
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,920
Yes, change it Griffin. Go for it. Let's go to the money's on life. Hold on. I got a Furby's dictionary here

402
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I'm gonna do the money zone in Furbish

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,040

Oh, I can't actually do this to score space. They've been it's not an e day way to do this

409
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:10,200
This article a wonderful friend to us as a as a podcast and I can't do this to him

Right, you know, I don't I actually don't want to do it anymore. I felt myself slipping away

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,280
Okay

424
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,560

Let me tell you about Bombas's mission

434
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
Justin can you give me some mission music? They're mission

435
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
Oh

436
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,960
No, that's not it. Can you give me something else? That's the only music I have. Okay. Well just any sounds there

437
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:02,800
They got a mission. No, I made it quieter. No, give me something more intense. You're making intense doesn't have to be music

438
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Sure

439
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Their mission

440
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,800
Okay, their mission is to make the most comfortable clothes ever and match every item sold with an equal item donated

441
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,560
So when you buy Bombas you are also giving to someone in need

442
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,640
Pretty cool

443
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,400
Pretty cool

444
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,000
If you ask me plus they've designed their socks shirts and underwear to be the clothes

445
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,640
You can't wait to put on every day. That is true. I just bought myself. That's right

446
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,800
But I didn't wait for Bombas to send me so I bought it underpants and I love them

447
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
They're comfortable and they make my junk look great

448
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:49,280
Come on that business load Lulu. It does make Lulu down there

449
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,880
Everything they make it soft seamless tagless and has a cozy feel and clothesless

450
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:05,200
Yeah, it's like wearing nothing and everyone's like hey, I love I can't participate in this scam anymore Bombas since you

451
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,200
Sorry, you gotta find out like this and there's a note card and it says looking good, baby

452
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,000
And it's like Bombas. You don't know me like that when they sell no-show socks. They literally literally

453
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
They don't show up in the box

454
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,600
I can't believe but all this is the thing all the clothes they sell get donated even the stuff

455
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
You're like, but I was gonna wear that

456
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,960
Tough should we say now that these are jokes?

457
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,920
These are these are jokes. They do send you things for you to put on your body

458
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,040
We know Griffin you can't wink you can't win

459
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,960
All right, cuz I'm kind of undermined. Okay good thing. They really think clothes

460
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Serious

461
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
They really

462
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,580
That's still bad don't they definitely don't not send clothes

463
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:07,360
All right. Yeah, I've had enough fun. Okay. Yeah, the socks are not real though for real Griffin

00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,540
Hey, it's John Moe join me on depression mode for conversations on how mental health shapes our life this week

469
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:47,580
David Sedaris with stories of his late father that he's finally willing to tell I think there's a

470
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,340
Difference between you know a good person and a good character like he was a good character

471
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,700
My boyfriend here and my father was another one of those people. He was a really good character

472
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,980
But he wasn't a good person

473
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:04,980
Depressed mode with John Moe wherever you get your podcasts

474
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Can we please do the second question

475
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,960
Oh

476
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,200
Hey, welcome to our new segment building a mystery. Oh, okay. All right

477
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,520
You guys are gonna love this as children. We were all raised on encyclopedia brown books

478
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,720
This is a book if you're not familiar

479
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,200
This is about a young boy and his friend Sally and how they solve mysteries together

480
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,720
And it's like he's a genius to the point where the cops often consult like an 11 year old child in a crime in Ida Ville

481
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,520
For over a year. This is where encyclopedia brown lives

482
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,200
So we were raised on these books and I've been getting my daughter Charlie into the books as well

483
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,460
It's fun. You listen to them and then you try to solve the mystery

484
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,000
You know at the end just like encyclopedia does it's fun. It's good problem-solving. They're great

485
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,760
I assume they're available at scholastic book fair still you can find them anywhere fine books are sold

486
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,280
There are however, I have to say Donald J. Sobel the author of this franchise wrote a lot of these

487
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,440
Oh, yeah, and he had let's call it a gift for metaphor. Sure. And

488
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:28,260
What I what we're gonna be doing in this brand new segment is we're gonna be checking out some of mr. Sobel's

489
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,280
absolutely bananas

490
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,080
Metaphors and you are gonna try to guess this is a quiz show. Oh, okay

491
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,900
You are gonna try to guess how these these absolute bangers

492
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,120
Complete so I'm gonna give you the first half. Okay, and then you have to guess the second half

493
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,960
Are you ready, please?

494
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,920
We're going to begin with encyclopedia Brown saves the day not the first book chronologically, but it was the one that we were listening to

495
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,120
When when I thought of this series and in fact

496
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:06,360
It was this first question that prompted me down this rabbit hole that was so much deeper than I thought it would be

497
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,920
Here we go Bugs Meanie. That's the bully of I mean this guy's a master

498
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,960
This he's real fucked up. He's so fucked up. He's like twist. He's basically the joke

499
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Yeah, yeah, thank you Travis vector the Joker up unless it's bugs bugs Meanie was the leader of a gang of wild

500
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,480
Older boys, they called them. I would actually be really good doing audiobooks for encyclopedia

501
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,760
Oh, I thought you're gonna say as a gang of wild other boys

502
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,420
Justin you would slot into a gang of wild older boys like a like a key into a lock

503
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
This is this is our neighborhood's toughest gang. They're called the Tigers

504
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,560
It's Bugs Meanie a bunch of other kids and a 41 year old man in a Hawaiian shirt

505
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:56,480
He does a lot of the driving around and purchase buying beer. Yeah. Yeah, but he's not the leader. He isn't

506
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:04,160
He answers to that he answers to that preteen Bugs Meanie, okay, he's kind of the vizier

507
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,960
Bugs

508
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,480
He is helping him and started at 529 to raise money for college with this cool

509
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,440
Please please a Fendi. Let me bend your ear

510
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
Please my little birds

511
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,360
Bugs Meanie was the leader of a gang of wild older boys. They called themselves the tiger, huh?

512
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,940
They should have called themselves the weatherman

513
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Why why?

514
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,060
Because why complete the metaphor? Why should they have called Emily?

515
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,340
I don't Kim. Why should they have called the time? It's I mean, it's a joke

516
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,540
It sounds like the setup for a joke. Why should they were gonna have to tell me after I'm done

517
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:55,640
Be why should they have called themselves the weatherman because they were always raining on everyone's parade

518
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:03,580
Okay, fascinating Griffin. Why should they have called this gang of boy because they they are thunder because they

519
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220
are

520
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,660
destructive as a

521
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:14,340
Hurricane or a tornado they should have called themselves the weathermen. They never stole anything until the coast was clear, huh?

522
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:18,620
More say one more

523
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:23,540
Should have called themselves the weathermen. They never stole anything until the coast was clear

524
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:30,900
You know how a weatherman is always looking at the horizon from the ocean and he's just like there's a storm rolling in

525
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:37,160
Donald are you okay, bud? Okay. Give me another you've had your turn growled bugs

526
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,620
he jerked a thumb over his shoulder now make like a pair of headlights and

527
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,020
make like a pair of headlights and

528
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Go and

529
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:55,500
And I don't did and damn and swerve and hit

530
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:02,080
Hit the road switch off switch off click hit the road hit hit the road Travis. It's hit the road

531
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:08,640
Yeah, they don't good job headlights. Don't tip it. The car hits that that's yeah, well the car hits the road

532
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,880
No, no now now hold on to mr. Sowell's defense the light shines on the road. So you can see that's fine

533
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,420
Benny was a good friend standing up as soon as he laid down

534
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,500
He went to sleep and became a threat to the nation's forests

535
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Why

536
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,620
Because he snored like a buzzsaw

537
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:35,220
His snoring shook branches loose for half a mile around. All right, Donald Travis gets half a point for that

538
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:42,660
Yeah, he gets half. But also I Donald mine was better. Why did you reach so far as

539
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,620
Encyclopedia bite past the empty lot on Rock Garden Lane

540
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,660
He saw Nathan Winslow swinging a pickaxe at top speed what the boy detective break to a halt. Hey Nathan

541
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,820
He called what are you doing? What does it look like said Nathan? I'm digging now. Leave me alone

542
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,860
Now, how does he now?

543
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,500
Complete this line

544
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
Now leave me alone

545
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:15,580
Mm-hmm. I have to practice. What are the grunts there? What does he say? What? What could he possibly be saying there? Leave me alone? And

546
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:23,860
It's like a turn of phrase yeah, it's like a turn afraid like a classic turn of phrase leave me alone

547
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,740
You

548
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,980
Rack a muffin we were looking for go wash an elephant or something

549
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,980
Oh

550
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,620
Okay, what are these books what are these books from

551
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,980
18

552
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:46,380
No, like the 1960s. Okay, so maybe that's just how kids talk back then

553
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:54,600
We don't know go wash an elephant or something or something. Okay, we have one more from encyclopedia Brown saves the day

554
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:00,220
Forget it said encyclopedia. The shine of gold can be worse than a close shave. Oh

555
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Oh

556
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,460
The shine of gold can be worse than a close shave

557
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,380
Because you can you can cut yourself on

558
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,820
The

559
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,620
My brain is not capable of the kind of lateral thinking

560
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:26,260
That is that this that come on Travis demand use that broken brain

561
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,020
Yeah, I know right a shine of gold can be worse than a close shave

562
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,700
Smooth I guys made a lot of people lose their heads. Oh

563
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:47,140
I don't think a lot of people have cut their whole fucking softball shape. John Donald Sobel also wrote a Sweeney Todd

564
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,840
Two more quick ones. These are from encyclopedia Brown keeps the peace in every book

565
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:01,800
They do one of these about the Tigers and then there's something mean that bugs mean he says to encyclopedia Brown this happens in every book

566
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:08,140
Yeah, bugs was the leader of a gang of tough older boys who called themselves the Tigers. They should have called themselves the tea bags

567
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:16,160
They should have called themselves the tea bags because they were always stirring things up

568
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,920
Because there was always something brewing

569
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:27,920
Oh damn it Travis is to Travis's leagues better at this game than I am like he's in a whole nother echelon

570
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,720
But he didn't guess it oh I didn't

571
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,360
Cuz they love to spoon cuz they always found themselves in hot water they were always getting in the hall

572
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,120
Griffin really nice

573
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:48,360
Last one bugs to this is bugs to encyclopedia get off the earth

574
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,360
Wow

575
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,160
Get off the earth

576
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,720
He snarled upon seeing the boy detective or I'll twist your nose so far around you'll

577
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,760
What you'll stand on the ceiling you'll smell your brain?

578
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:08,200
You'll part your hair every time you sneeze

579
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,600
That's good anyway

580
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,760
Absolutely Justin my first crush was the young woman who played Sally Kimball

581
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,040
Oh, yeah, dude in the encyclopedia Brown HBO show so tough

582
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,280
She was so tough embrace

583
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,800
Hey, so when I asked you during the ad break to play some mysterious music brother anything you're like this

584
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,880
Yeah, I know trap. It was the button was right there. You fucking lied to me

585
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,360
That's really no, but if I had burned that early then it would be like you just had that lying around

586
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:53,280
Specials also, I don't want Sarah to come after me. Yeah, yeah

587
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,280
Puppies you don't have any love for the G man

588
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,840
publicly

589
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:05,240
Here we have a second please Christ. I've been waiting my partner and I recently purchased our first home in a small rural town

590
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:13,100
One of the bedrooms in our house has two very large murals of monster trucks floor to ceiling and the word

591
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:19,180
Bigfoot painted on the wall. Yeah, every single one of our new neighbors has joyfully brought up these monster trucks in conversation

592
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,160
The problem is we're not monster truck folks

593
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,720
I and you not know who or what monster truck Bigfoot is if you don't out point of order

594
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:33,920
Yeah, if you don't know who Bigfoot is you do not know who literally any monster truck. Yeah, right?

595
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,920
Yeah, that is the I mean

596
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,560
You might know

597
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,880
But that's not even a monster. No, it's a robot that needs a showpiece somewhere than anything

598
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,360
It is not it does not participate in the event

599
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:52,200
It's also you have you have large pictures of monster trucks painted on the wall

600
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,720
And you know that Bigfoot is a monster truck. You cannot say you don't know who or what?

601
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,960
Bigfoot is it's a big monster truck called Bigfoot. It doesn't have

602
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,200
personality traits that

603
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,840
Differentiate it from other monster trucks. It's the first monster truck. I'm looking here

604
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,520
It was it it was a 1974 Ford f250 pickup those modified by its owner

605
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,120
Bob Chandler beginning in 1975 by 1979 the modifications were so extensive

606
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,020
The truck came to be regarded as the first monster truck

607
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:37,540
Bigfoot Bigfoot Bigfoot had like a cartoon show like Bigfoot's Bigfoot's the blue one on the wall that you have

608
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,980
Okay, so anyway this person this question asker

609
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,400
How do we respond to all these Bigfoot compliments from our new neighbors?

610
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,320
Are we allowed to paint over these regional treasure murals in our new home? Do we lean into the monster truck honorific?

611
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:55,120
That's from rurally remarkable in Cumberland, Canada

612
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,180
Yeah, I mean, I'll never forget like do what you want. I'll never forgive you

613
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,200
Do you know what? I mean? Like you can paint over the word Bigfoot. That's fine. That's just it's this we have pictures here

614
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,520
it's a small like font treatment whatever paint over that right because it's not even close to the two pictures of the

615
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,520
Fucking yeah, it's like

616
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,680
By a window to write so it could just be like unrelated like this is actually about the monster Bigfoot

617
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,580
I love him his big in cat in cast cradle Kurt Vonnegut writes as Boccanon says

618
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,640
peculiar travel suggestions are dancing listens from God Wow, I would extend that

619
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,600
To Bigfoot's on your wall. This is the universe

620
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,200
Trying to show you

621
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:46,360
That this is part of your life now like you you this is part of your life. These floors by the way are

622
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:53,320
Fucking divine. Yeah, I would not risk painting these walls just because I want to ruin these beautiful floors. Holy crap

623
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,360
Yeah, these murals by the way, these are not big heads. You may end your home be thinking. These are fat

624
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,560
These are painted these are painted by somebody tasteful and there's like a perspective. Oh, yeah

625
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:09,080
Yeah, there's one where like Bigfoot is leaping. It's that one by the way

626
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,040
looks

627
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,200
Three-dimensional the detail in it is incredible

628
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,600
Now what I will say I can see where that front view monster truck is a little much

629
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,120
It's that one's almost if I could say weirdly it's kind of it is kind of suggest

630
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,640
Yeah, and the room just looking at the dimensions it I would say maybe 10 by 10

631
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,760
there is a lot of there's a lot of mural in this space I

632
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,800
would grant you that I think I

633
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:49,760
Think the text of Bigfoot is a sticker. I think you think I don't think that that's actually yeah

634
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,280
You can get that off don't you could take that off you could paint over that

635
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,560
I don't think that would be a crime against humanity if you did anything. Oh, wait a minute

636
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:05,420
Okay, enhance enhance a man Victoria zoom in. I think I can make out an artist's name Victoria enhance, please

637
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,540

00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:17,060
Are you able to make it out where is it in the in the corner under the wheel under the wheel on the left wheel?

639
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:19,420
near the outlet

640
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,700
real

641
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,860
You know the outlet. Oh god. Yes. I

642
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,060
I don't see it, but I'm seeing them mark. Look right look below the outlet. Oh, yes

00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,860
Yes, okay over there on the one on the wall. Okay. Hold on

644
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,860
I believe I don't know that is

645
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,940
Marky mama toto

646
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:44,180
It does seem like those letters are in there. Marky. It's Marky mama toto. I

647
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:49,620
Don't think mama popo Marky mama popo. It could be it look

648
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:54,820
I'm people are thinking we're having a laugh here if this looks like any name. It's Marky mama toto

649
00:53:54,820 --> 00:54:02,320
I'm a popo. I'm more mama popo. I'm our popo. Anyway, I would anyway, you can't know you

650
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,260
Absolutely can in no reality

651
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,220
Or any other paint over these big beautiful big?

652
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:17,620
Let's rank them right you can paint over the word. That's solid. Yeah, I can see where you can justify

653
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:22,140
Painting over the red truck at the front of the rim. Yes. Here's the justification

654
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:29,180
I'm a monster and I have you can see where it's like it's bearing down on you and friends now

655
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,700
You could also that can make position a hell of an entertainment center there. Yeah, it's a tone

656
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,900
or a

657
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:40,020
Headboard for your bed because then you could be like who's in like for like sexual stuff

658
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:45,220
You could be like, yeah, who's in but then I would want it the bed facing that but it's not important

659
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:51,220
but the Bigfoot on the wall the ramping jumping beauty if you

660
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:57,260
Touch it with your fingers, right? You're gonna get oils on it that are gonna it belongs in

661
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:01,980
Belongs it belongs in a museum. You're gonna which means that you have to make your house a museum

662
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,460
And I'm sorry this part of your home doesn't belong to you anymore

663
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,460
It belongs to all of us and I hate to do like imminent domain

664
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,140
Yeah, but I do think that I'm doing I'm oh my gosh

665
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:19,020
I never thought I'd be able to do this on a podcast but in my powers as a notary public. I am

666
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,020
Declaring this room of your home on the register of historic. Oh, wow in Cumberland. That's amazing

667
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:29,220
So yeah, I and I'm I got my stamp right here

668
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,220
Okay, this is official folks and I would never abuse this power. I take

669
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:41,220
Stamps as good for Canada on it. Yeah, it says also good for one Canada Wow

670
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,060
I don't know. You're gonna need to get a plaque first and foremost

671
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:49,940
Yeah, and I'm not just talking about for the wall. You're gonna need to get a sign outside too, right Robin Mars

672
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,220
If you're listening

673
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:58,020
Any advice you can get on how the process of getting those but like home of the painting of Bigfoot?

674
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,100
That's really good is my like suggestion, but you wouldn't

675
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:07,580
Another option because this is clearly not you you don't appreciate this in the way it needs to be appreciated

676
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:13,980
so you can't just take that door out and sort of drywall over the door and then in like

677
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:18,900
150 years when someone else owns the house and like one of their kids throws a

678
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:25,100
Hammer or something and it like smashes into the drywall and they'll be like, hold on a second. Wait a minute

679
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,500
I think there's a

680
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:31,340
Room past there or maybe they're just looking at the house from the outside and be like there's a window there

681
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,500
But there's no room and so they get in there and they're like what treasures are we going to find and they find two big

682
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,120
beautiful fucking badass Bigfoot boys up there on the walls

683
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:46,660
That's gonna be like a real national treasure moment for them and you can if you're gonna do that though

684
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:53,220
I think you got to go one step further and leave like in the dead center of the room like one like forward key. Oh

685
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,100
They're like what?

686
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:01,220
And a note that just says find it. Yeah, find me here find me

687
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:06,300
I need to hear from you know, I'm gonna reach out to Justin McElroy in Canada in Canada

688
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,260
Canadian Justin McElroy, I feel like would be my best point of contact here

689
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,100
I'm also gonna reach out to the village of Cumberland itself

690
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:16,340
Yeah to see the process of getting a house added to the historic registry

691
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:21,200
Yeah, and let me cuz I will do I question asker. Thank you so much for your support. I will do anything

692
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,940
Yeah, I

693
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:30,540
Will swear no expense spread no expense. Hey, I will also say this Justin. I'm actually willing to go one step further

694
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,740
Um, I not only do I want this room registered and protected for all of time

695
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:40,340
I think you have been gifted the opportunity to this is a hobby now, right?

696
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:44,820
Because sometimes you're like is it too late in life to start a collection? Is it too late in life?

697
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,100
Do I care enough about this thing to like spend my time doing it?

698
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:55,420
This decision has been made for you. You chose to buy a house with a Bigfoot room in it. You knew it was there

699
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,300
It's not like they cleverly

700
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,700
Hid that from you as they showed you this room, you know, it's there

701
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:07,560
So now it's time to start buying up all of the historical Bigfoot merchandise. You can find one last thing question asker

702
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:13,460
If you can zero in on who that artist I would love to have the if it's if it's working mama popo

703
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,860
That would be a real vindication for me

704
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:22,100
I also would like to address the fact that the owners of this house probably walked into this room like this is fucking funny

705
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:27,060
We got us in this into our favorite podcast. So he took some pictures sent this question and like did you send the pictures?

706
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,340
Yeah, I did. Okay now we can paint and then they painted over all of it and now they're listening

707
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:38,100
And now they're listening to the episode and they are very panicked like can we find marquee mama popo to recreate this work?

708
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,140
Can we try and draw our own badass monster trucks on the wall?

709
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:46,220
We're gonna roll up to this thing with the you know governor or whatever

710
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,220
Ready to just sort of like take take it over and find some real

711
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,620
Let's call it what it is shoddy shoddy craftsmanship of some busted

712
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:03,140
Monster trucks that will recognize with our keen eye not the original work the brushstrokes. The brushstrokes are we're gonna need a preference, right?

713
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,980
We're gonna need a proof of life

714
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,140
Hold up today's newspaper next to this and take another photo, please

715
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:13,220
And then just proceed to do that every day until we die

716
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:16,940
I don't if you have not already regretted sending this question in your mouth

717
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:21,580
Boundaries are so important and we are really cognizant of that and we have tried

718
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:28,700
You know, we have really endeavored to establish those healthy boundaries between us and our audience, but this is hard fucking room now

719

This is our room long this belongs to us now. Thank you. I thank you so much for listening to our podcast
