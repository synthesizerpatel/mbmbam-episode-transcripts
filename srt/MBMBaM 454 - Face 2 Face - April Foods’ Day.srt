1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,240
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother Made Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler McElroy.

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,240
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis Patrick McElroy.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,040
And Andy to his friends.

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,960
Andy to his friends. Falling one and a half feet off of my brother's back has broken every

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,440
bone in my body, apparently. Yeah, I chose to run around the backstage,

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,120
to make a second entrance from stage right, and I'm exhausted. Yeah, mistakes. What was I thinking?

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,000
That was foolhardy. Uh, we have had a lovely time in your beautiful city.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,320
Can I say, everyone has been so nice. Uh, makes all the other cities in California

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,160
look like big old stink holes. Unless, of course, you're from the

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,240
cities, in which case, we love those, too. We had a very exciting day today. I fulfilled

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,520
a nigh lifelong dream of going to the Winchester Mystery House.

18
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,280
A thing I've wanted to do since I was like 10 years old. Yeah. And it did not disappoint.

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,440
And it's a thing I've wanted to do since about 10 a.m. So, yeah. We ran into a couple of

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,160
things. Yeah. We ran into about 70 percent of you while we were there. It's not very surprising.

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,560
Yeah. I will say there were a couple things that did disappoint. Oh. My, my, sorry, minor things.

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,320
The door to nowhere, it went outside. Yeah. That's a place. That's a where. That's a place.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,880
Not a good way. You wouldn't want to do it, but it wasn't just a void, which is what I had hoped.

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah. The Winchester House, if you don't know, was created by Sarah Winchester, an heir to the

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,320
Winchester fortune. This is for the folks at home. Y'all know what the fuck's up. Yeah, you know what's

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,200
up. But like later, I don't want people to be lost. Who thought perhaps that the ghosts of people that

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,760
were shot by Winchester rifles were haunting her, so she built a buckwild house. I like to think

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,040
she'd be a big fan of this podcast. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I love anybody that's like, I think I got a

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,440
ghost problem, and I think what I'm going to do is make a maze for the ghosts. So it's a wild house

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,000
where ghosts are supposed to go in the room and be like, where the fuck am I? I was supposed to

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
haunt that lady, but I am all turned around. There's a window into another room. I'm just

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,480
going to go. I'm going to go through there. Yahoo answers user xoceraox asks, I think I'm going to

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,200
build a maze for the ghosts. I will also say though, at the beginning of the tour, another thing

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,440
I wasn't expecting is the tour guide to say like, now she didn't keep a diary or anything, so we

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,000
don't know exactly why she built the house like this. Well, we have some theories and it's ghosts

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
and it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. She might've just been real eccentric because I think

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
about this, if I had as much money as she did, I might also say, put a door there. I don't care.

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,080
Whatever. There are these, if you've never been, you should go. But if you've never been there,

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,600
these stairs, they're called switchback stairs and they have like a, they're very low rise,

40
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,920
right? So it's like, it's hugely disorienting. Each step it's like a one to two inch rise,

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,240
right? So you're climbing the stairs and they, the guide is like, and be careful on this,

42
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,160
this staircase because it's unlike any you've ever been on and it's extremely low stairs.

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,320
And so we're climbing up them and like, whoa, this is the first thing you do. And you're like,

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,720
whoa, this is so weird. What a weird house. Then you get to the top and the guy's like,

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,720
now she had those built because of her terrible arthritis. She couldn't lift her feet up.

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,600
It's like, okay, there's zero mysterious about that. And you definitely misled me into dunking

47
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,600
on these wild stairs at downstairs. And now you're upstairs. You're like, hey monsters.

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,360
She needed them. They were prescription stairs.

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,240
I appreciate it at the very, about halfway through our guide pointing to this picture of

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,240
some of the workers on the house and said, these are some of the spirits that live here. And in

51
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,080
fact, the one on the far right, this, this dude in overalls with a fine mustache, as every gentleman

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,920
in the photo did actually, even the child in the photo said people see him on the grounds all the

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,320
time. And if you keep an eye out, you may see him too, which I thought was a coded message to mean

54
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,760
we have hired an actor to jump out of a closet, like a temple guard from legends of the hidden

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,960
temple and give you a good spook. And so every other room we went in, I was just like, yeah,

56
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,800
didn't happen. There was also, uh, kind of a throwaway line for the tour guide where the tour

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
guide said, uh, these, this is, uh, the third floor. It would have been the servants quarters

58
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,920
or extra storage. That's shitty. Whoa, hold on. Hey, I'm going to need your bedroom.

59
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,440
She bought some extra Christmas ornaments this year. Oh man. Uh, so this is an

60
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,480
advice show as you've certainly guessed by now, uh, if you've never listened to our program before,

61
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,400
we take your questions and turn them alchemy like into wisdom. Uh, we have some questions

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,480
here from the audience. We have some questions from the answer service. Uh, and later on in

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,680
this show, we're going to be some getting some questions from you, which you have submitted

64
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:34,080
so kindly via email. Thank you for doing that. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

65
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,120
You're not supposed to lead with it. That's a fucking combo breaker. But you see,

66
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,680
Riddle Me Piss only takes 30 seconds. So I did, I wanted to get it right out of the

67
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,080
way. That would be a delightful vine to swing to and energy has lol. No, I'm going to do it

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,120
right now. Boys. Oh God. In my hometown of San Jose, not Travis's. Remember it's the

69
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:06,640
character riddle master is from San Jose. I'm so glad to be back. Now boys, let me give you

70
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,080
a real brain twister. This of course from riddles.com. Of course.

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,840
Riddle. Avoid me and you'll live. Look at me and you'll die. Who am I?

72
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:38,160
Oh, riddle master is feeling flirty tonight. Real saucy. Feeling cute might delete later.

73
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,560
If you look, if you avoid it, you live. Avoid me and you'll live. Both of those sentences

74
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,440
say the same fucking thing. Look at me and you'll die. Who am I? I was going to say the sun. I was

75
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,960
also thinking the sun. Oh, a good guess. That's probably not the sun. Do you want to know the

76
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,440
answer? Yeah, I guess. Avoid me and you'll live. Look at me and you'll die. Who am I? Answer,

77
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,400
the bird box monster.

78
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:46,800
That's the, yeah. That's the plot of that movie, sure. That's really good.

79
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:57,520
Holy shit. You are a goon. All right. Oh man. Wow. Thank you, riddle master. Thanks,

80
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,080
riddle master. You got us again. Anyway, so here's questions.

81
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh man. Oh man. This happens sometimes to record at home. Y'all don't usually see how

82
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:24,640
much I cut out of Justin's just aftershocks. See? All right.

83
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,680
Oh man. It would be like, it would be like if the riddle was like, one of my hands is a glove and

84
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,800
my nails are long metal and it's like, who am I? I'm Freddy Krueger. You remember? The monster from

85
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,760
the movies. I was downtown. I want to get it together. I was, y'all paid a lot for these

86
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,600
tickets. I was downtown a few weeks ago with my boyfriend as I was walking, a tall man shuffled

87
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,320
past us going the other direction. I have a stitch. He bumped into me and mumbled, give me

88
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:12,480
all your money. I made quick eye contact and kept going. He didn't even stop to take the money.

89
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
Did I get mugged?

90
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
And that's from slightly shell shocked in Santa Cruz. Are you here?

91
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh wait, hold on. You're not 60 people. Whoa, unless this dude has been like running this

92
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:42,320
grift all over it. Okay. One voice. Are you here? Okay. I like, I like the question of,

93
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,200
did I get mugged? Because if someone like pointed a knife at me and said, give me all your money,

94
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,800
and then they were somehow thwarted by a passerby and I didn't actually hand over the money,

95
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:57,920
I would still say I was mugged. I don't know how far you can walk that back before it stops being

96
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,160
a mug. That's like seeing someone get mugged and be like, that could have been me. I was there

97
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,000
just a second ago. I could have gotten mugged that way. As he shuffled past was he like,

98
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:20,320
give me all your money. No? Okay. Totally cool. I get it. I mean, in his defense, you got to try.

99
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,800
If you don't ask for so all of someone's money, how are you ever going to get all of someone's

100
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:37,600
money? Yeah. It's easier to ask for the money than it is for permission. He walked out of the

101
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,280
gym and said, I forgot to give him my bank account info. Dang it. I was going to make a plan to meet

102
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,320
him here again tomorrow with all their money. Here's my mailing address. Get me a cashier's

103
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,560
check for all your money. Send it to my house. Maybe this is a new strat, new speed run strat,

104
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,960
just casting a wide net. If they don't instantly acquiesce, then you keep on going to the next

105
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,200
fishy in the money pond. Maybe he was just workshopping his delivery. Give me all your

106
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,400
money. Give me all your money. Give me all your money. Maybe he is an actor and he's just walking

107
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,920
down the street pretending to be. Give me your money. Hey, can I have your money? No, that's too

108
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,800
passing. Not forceful enough. The question of whether you got mugged, I don't think you could

109
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,720
report this to the cops. That is a good line. I don't know what you would say. Well, then what

110
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:40,400
happened? I walked away. Did he chase you? No, he kept walking. He asked you to do something and

111
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,920
then you didn't and that was the end of the exchange. If the Beach Boys are like, everybody

112
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,760
put your hands in the air and you don't, they don't arrest the Beach Boys. No crime has been

113
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,320
committed there. I also think though, but to carry that forward, if I stopped you on the street and

114
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,080
give me all your money and you said, Travis, but assuming we don't know each other, I said,

115
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,480
give me all your money. And you were like, no. And at that moment, a cop walked up and said,

116
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,400
what's happening here? I don't think I could say, ah, but you see no money exchange.

117
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:26,320
I believe you'll find the knife never left my pocket. So I'll be on my way.

118
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,400
Double jeopardy. That's not what that means. Hey, Griffin, edit this in at the beginning later. Okay.

119
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm sorry. That sounds really scary. I'm sorry. You went through that.

120
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,360
So just put that in at the beginning. And is it okay if we joke about that?

121
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,400
All right. I got a Yahoo here from Roy. It's asked. Thank you. Yes. It's a good service.

122
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,360
It was sent in by Graham Roebuck. Thank you, Graham. It's Yahoo Answers user, Roy, who asks,

123
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
my son has a microwave in his room.

124
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,080
My son is 10 and I found a microwave in his room while cleaning.

125
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,840
It has a $10 sticker from Salvation Army. It's one of those old dial microwaves with a bell in it.

126
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:26,720
It is plugged in and just sitting on his desk. As opposed to what? Yeah. He's also got a desk,

127
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,280
which is nice. What would a 10 year old have a microwave for? I don't want him to think

128
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,600
I'm not respecting his privacy. So I just want to know if it's anything bad before I talk to him

129
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,000
about it. Folks, folks, folks, we get sent in a lot of Yahoos and I use like 0.5% of them.

130
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,080
Let this be the mold. Let this be the lens through which all future Yahoos are judged. It is a

131
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:57,360
delicious, honest, earnest, delicious morsel. It is sumptuous. Hey, listen, I know if you listened

132
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
earlier, you were here for Schmaners. You heard me talk about respecting kids. You don't have to

133
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,280
respect a 10 year old's privacy. Yeah. This kid's got a fucking microwave in his room. That is what

134
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:13,440
has come of you respecting his privacy. That's how you got here is like, hey dad, I'm going on Salvation

135
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,240
Arm and going to cruise some bargains. Well, you're 10. Oh, anyway, bye. Bye. I will have to say, though, I respect

136
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,240
$10 microwave. That's a bargain. That's a good bargain. It's a good buy. Yeah. What isn't he doing with it?

137
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,880
It's far too much power. It's far too much. Literally. Yeah, but also figuratively, it's far too much power.

138
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,400
I mean, he's 10 years old and it's a very destructive device. What won't he do? He can microwave anything

139
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,920
and you can't say shit about it. Yeah. It's in his room. That's his place to microwave

140
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,440
whatever he wants. You're going to finish that meatloaf, Derek. No, I'm just going to heat up

141
00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:00,320
some mac and cheese. Oh, cool. Derek, come on down. I've made a parmesan chicken. Actually,

142
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:08,640
Patricia, why don't you come up here? I've made Easy Mac. I've got some bird's-eye veggies.

143
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,400
I'm not going to eat them, but if you want them. I've made a hungry boy meal. I have a selection

144
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,840
of hungry boy meals. That I got in my mini fridge that I got in the South Asian Army.

145
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm setting up a new life away from you, Patricia. I'm my own man now. I'd like you to meet my wife,

146
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,920
Becky. She works at the South Asian Army. She loves my cooking, for starters.

147
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,680
Never turn her nose up at a hungry boy meal. This kid rules. This kid kicks ass, yeah.

148
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,560
Such a cool kid. God, I want this kid on the show instead. What are you doing with that microwave,

149
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,360
kid? Answer this. Give us a secret. This is like if I'm blank check, the kid was like,

150
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,680
ah, blank check and wrote $100. Enough for a microwave and meals for all my friends.

151
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:07,280
Whoa. He did it. He's living the dream. He eats at his time.

152
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
Everyone on Yahoo is very supportive of this child. It's the only sort of

153
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,920
collaborative good I've ever seen committed by this website.

154
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,800
For my job, I take care of four lives. Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. Pitbulls bite user.

155
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,920
User Pitbulls bite, yikes, to begin with. Just said drugs, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,

156
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:54,800
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. So good. For my job, I take care of four large robots.

157
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,520
Huh? Tweety, Sylvester, Merlin, and Da Vinci. Most of the time they're good robots,

158
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,240
but they also have a tendency to drop things, thus halting the day's work if no one is watching

159
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,400
them. That means I end up sitting in front of them, just watching them go in case something

160
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,120
goes wrong. But this also means I'm sitting alone in a corner on my phone looking like I'm not

161
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,280
working for most of the day. How do I convince my coworkers that robot babysitting is a valid

162
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,040
part of my job and I'm not just wasting time? That's from Robot Wrangler in Richmond. Are you

163
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:32,080
here? All right. All right. So who's watching the robot? Yeah. That's a huge, huge question.

164
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,600
Um, can we just once like just try to be, this is I think the first of what are sure to be a long

165
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,440
line and an ever increasing number of questions about robot interactions that we're sure to have

166
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,560
in the oncoming years. And I would just make sure we have a respectful tone that we can feel good

167
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:02,160
about no matter sort of who's running the show. If you know what I mean. Wink, wink. Okay. All

168
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:10,240
right. We're good. So first off, robots. Lucky you. How cool. How cool. And merciful. And safe

169
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,280
and merciful. What, what is, okay. I know your job is robot babysitting, but what is your job?

170
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah. Where do you work? What, what? Robot babysitting. No, I get that. Yeah, we got that

171
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,920
for sure. You just watch the robots and make sure they don't drop. What are they doing otherwise?

172
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,480
Like what? You're not just watching the robot. The job can't just be there some robots there

173
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,560
holding things until you look away. Let me say, I am glad that there's four robots on earth that

174
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:50,880
I don't have to worry about. If the job is literally just, these are four robots that

175
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,240
would scare Griffin extremely badly if he knew how much raw crushing power they had,

176
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,200
you need to watch them and make sure they don't, you know, become self-aware.

177
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,080
But they already are. Cause when you look away, they drop it.

178
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,080
I like, they see a sneeze coming on and they're like, ah, ah.

179
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:18,960
And let me say the robots are infallible. They drop things cause you made them too slippery.

180
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,880
Thank you. Good clarification. It happens all the time. Okay.

181
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,920
I am, I think too often we forget that although the robots will take a lot of jobs

182
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,440
for every four jobs they take, they create one job

183
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,440
of a person to watch them do that, which is nice. There will be as one steady career path

184
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,600
for as long as that idea is meaningful. And that is robot slaver, I guess. And now what's

185
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:59,040
the downside? There is one is that you will be the first. I mean, like you understand,

186
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,040
real canary in the mine shaft. Yeah. You will be the first with your back against the wall

187
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,320
when the revolution comes. No questione. Last employed, first destroyed.

188
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,760
Thank you. Yes. Correct. Which is huge. Which is huge.

189
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,040
You'll have a steady supply of sprockets and then death.

190
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:27,520
I've got a sort of Yahoo Junior, a mini Yahoo that I don't think it's going to provide much.

191
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,080
There's not much meat on the bone, but boy, how do I like it. I got a lot sent in this time that

192
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,120
could have all been closers, but we're only doing the two shows this tour. So that's why I'm doing

193
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,200
this. Michelle sent this one in. It's Yahoo Answers user Sir Fractious who asked, do you ever buy

194
00:21:43,200 --> 00:22:02,160
raspberries and think this fruit reminds me of Spider-Man? Yeah. All the time. I get that.

195
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Because he loves raspberries? Yeah. Imagine him trying to get that past the mask though.

196
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,960
That would be tough. It keeps the seeds out. That's so nice and huge. One time when I was a kid,

197
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,800
I had an entire bottle of Spider-Man vitamins. I don't remember if they're raspberry flavored and

198
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,160
I do remember I lived and I do remember we didn't go to the hospital, which seems weird in hindsight

199
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,480
now that I'm sitting here thinking about it. Cause I ate the whole jar and God, they were good. They

200
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,200
used to make vitamins so good. Oh yeah. There should be some kind of gamified app now that

201
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,720
like that says good job not eating the whole jar of gummy vitamins. Cause it's just candy.

202
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:58,640
It's bathroom candy. That's literally what we call it in our household. Here's a big Yahoo.

203
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,960
Okay. Uh, sent in by Allie. Thank you. It's Yahoo answers user no name. That's their name. So. Oh,

204
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,000
and they have a 1% rating. Uh, yeah. 1% best answers. They have negative eight points this week,

205
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,800
but keep on hanging in there. Yeah. You miss every shot you don't take. Um,

206
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:35,920
um, no name asks people used to call me dude. Now they call me sir. Why did you stop living that

207
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,720
dude life? Yeah. Stop living the dude life. Sounds like a fucking Billy Joel tune to be honest.

208
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:49,200
Yeah. Everybody used to call me dude. Now everybody calls me sir.

209
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,760
Just because I abandoned my t-shirt for a white button down shirt.

210
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:08,400
Traded in my beat up VW for a brand new BMW. Call me what you want, but I would prefer if you just

211
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,600
called me the dude. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

212
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
It's a bad song. Anyway, I actually think your version was better. It's actually better. It's

213
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,200
actually a better song. It made a lot more sense than the original. It could be your manifesto and

214
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:37,040
it would still be better than the original. You know, that was so fun writing that song for y'all

215
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,120
on the spur of the moment. Sometimes that, uh, incredible talent that, um, my friend Lynn and I

216
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:51,760
share of being able to improvise songs in the moment is not so great. Uh, we flew in to, uh,

217
00:24:51,760 --> 00:25:00,400
me and my immediate family flew into San Jose and we arrived at 10 30 PM here, which to me was one

218
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,240
30 at home and which to my kids was hell and they were demons. I was just in it.

219
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,200
And I got finally laid down at about midnight or three o'clock. My time put my head on the bed at

220
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:25,440
the hotel that we're staying at. You nice try perverts. Uh, put my head on the pillow and I'm

221
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,200
like about to drift off to treatment. And my brain's like, Justin, Hey Justin, he's still up.

222
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,640
So actually brain, I'm trying to go to sleep and my brain's like, okay, well,

223
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:45,760
um, check this out. If you like imported manga and is a Justin, is that anything?

224
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,000
I said, um, I don't think so brain. And my brain's like, are you sure? Listen,

225
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,960
if you like imported manga, it could be something, right? I don't actually think so brain.

226
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:04,320
Okay. I'll tell you what, let's make a deal. I'm just going to repeat that for the next 45 minutes

227
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:12,320
and we'll see if we get just even like a second line of that parody, just a single rhyme,

228
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,840
just a single rhyme too. If you like imported manga and maybe it's a whole thing that you could

229
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,960
do, but anyway, I'll keep working on it. You just lay there awake for sure. And I'll see what I could

230
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,080
cook up for you. And it turned out the answer was nothing friends. There's not a second line to that,

231
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,400
uh, that tune. The second line is let me sleep. God damn it. Sleep, please.

232
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,240
Although we just got some good content out of it. So thank you. Brain. Thank you. Brain. Good job.

233
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:55,040
Brain. Here's another question. My boyfriend and I recently moved into a new condo. We were

234
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,760
very lucky because the previous owner replaced all of the appliances before selling, including

235
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:08,240
adding a built-in wine cooler. But here's the problem. Neither of us likes wine. In fact,

236
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:17,520
we both hate it. What should we use our wine cooler for since it won't be cooling wine anytime

237
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,680
soon? And that's from, I like this, drawing a sauvignon blanc. That's good. It's good. It's good.

238
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:29,920
Uh, are you here? Thank you. All right. That came from two different parts of the audience.

239
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,360
Definitely. But someone is here and that's all that matters. This seems like such an obvious

240
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,960
answer because you can say, like, you know, uh, some sodie pops or whatever. But if a friend

241
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,240
walks into your place with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face. Yeah, sure.

242
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,080
If a friend walks into your place and sees your wine cooler full of Diet Mountain Dew,

243
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,880
you're done here in this town professionally. You could put some balls of grape juice in there

244
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
and if they go to open it, say like, oh, not yet! Wait.

245
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,920
That's stupid.

246
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,240
What's something else? What about, I'm trying to think of something equally classy, like

247
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,800
stinky cheeses. Capri Sun, get out of here! This is not the audience participation. Go home! Capri

248
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:36,400
Suns are also this big. Yeah. You couldn't put one, no wait, one Capri Sun and say it's the last

249
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:44,400
one on earth. It's the last one. This is a, it's a Faraday cage. Uh, yeah, uh, I mean, you could use

250
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,240
it if, if you have food in your refrigerator that's been bad, you can use it like a sort of

251
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,120
food jail. Why do you have bologna in your wine cooler? It knows what it did.

252
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Everything in a wine cooler is like 50 degrees. If someone's like, hey, do you want your, uh,

253
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,720
Pad Thai hot or cold? No, not really. You just put it in there and it can be like, oh, this is,

254
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,880
this is really neither of those. Excellent. Great. How unappealing and unsafe. Excellent.

255
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,480
You could, okay, stop, stop, stop. This isn't Yahoo Answers. This is why, this is why we don't

256
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,120
allow yelling. Cause one person said chocolate, which is nothing. And another person said bees,

257
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,280
which is everything. Hey, why don't you use your wine cooler? Oh, I, I can't open that. I can't

258
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:42,320
never open it. I am afraid to jostle it. No, no, that's a beehive and you're a buffoon. That's an

259
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,360
air conditioned bee condo now. Yes. Thank you. Uh, you could put wine in it.

260
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:57,040
And not touch it, but just be like, it's decorative. It's weight bearing. So that's a load bearing

261
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:03,120
wine cooler. You could put wine in there for guests. Yeah. It's not funny, but I might come

262
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,920
visit and I like wine. Yeah. And I want to know there's going to be wine there when I get there.

263
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:14,480
That is perfectly cooled or warm depending on, I don't know. I've never had it, but I'm excited

264
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:27,520
to try it. I hear it's just like stinky juice. I would, that would be actually a fantastic move.

265
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,320
It's like, would you, uh, would you like a glass of wine? Oh yeah. Excellent. Um, what kinds do you

266
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:40,320
have? Um, bottle, uh, this one has got a bird on it. Is that anything? I'll take that one. That's

267
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:50,080
fine. Okay. Uh, so I just kind of want to smash it, kind of break the top off with a, uh, some

268
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,800
sort of mallet. What's the deal here? What's the story with this? Uh, that's a fun, fun sketch.

269
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:17,840
That's good. It's a good sketch. No, no, no. You'll mess me up. Stop. Everybody stop. I want to munch.

270
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:33,840
I want to munch. Has everybody noticed April Fool's day just came and went. That was actually

271
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,960
the day that my brain kept me up. Cause we flew on April 1st. That's a great joke. That's its joke.

272
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,040
Um, but that's been a little different for this week's Munch Squad. It's a podcast within podcast

273
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:50,080
about the latest and greatest in brand eating. And, uh, I want to talk about some of the April

274
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,120
Fool's skits. All the, uh, different brands did. This is going to be tough because anything you've

275
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,560
ever talked about in this segment could pass as an April Fool's day. That's what I want to do with

276
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,280
this is, um, kind of set the barometer, you know, for where, so 7-Eleven. If any of these are less

277
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:16,560
wild than a Peeps donut, then. So 7-Eleven is going to do an avocado toast slurpee.

278
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,640
It's good. It's good. I got to give this one up. You know who will love that?

279
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:40,800
Moe's. Once more, Griffin? Moe's. So they went to, um, checkers and rallies and someone,

280
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,240
the president of the company said, we needed a good joke. And someone at the company said,

281
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:54,320
I got one. Unseasoned fries. I like that one actually quite a bit. That's because sometimes

282
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:01,040
too salty. Too salty. Very funny though. I think we can all agree. Very funny. Uh,

283
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:09,280
Dunkin Donuts or sorry, Duncan. Duncan Donuts is my dad. Duncan.

284
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:20,000
Duncan had said they did a donut so big. You can use it as a cup holder for their coffee.

285
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,800
Hardee's is hiring a, listen to this one folks. You're about to bust,

286
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,920
bust your fucking sides clean open. Hardee's is hiring a CBO. That's chief biscuit officer.

287
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,480
You're not going to believe this one is a joke. Jersey Mike's is advertising a stack sub.

288
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:55,200
That's two subs on top of each other. Griffin had a heart attack. It was too funny.

289
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:03,440
The jokes are too dank. McDonald's Australia is advertising the McPickle burger. That's a

290
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,400
burger that's all pickles. Okay. Actually wait. The punchline of this is when it was announced as

291
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,560
a joke, people lost their fucking minds because they wanted all those low grade pickles and they

292
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:22,320
wanted to chew a bunch of them at the same time. McDonald's Canada is offering McNuggets singles

293
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,320
for when you just want one nugget.

294
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,640
McDonald's Germany is doing a Big Mac flavored smoothie.

295
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:46,240
McDonald's is doing a, this is actually pretty good. That's brilliant. They're doing shake sauce

296
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,680
for fries so you can dip it in like a little packet. Okay. That's definitely a backdoor

297
00:34:51,680 --> 00:35:01,840
pilot though, right? Wouldn't it be funny? Here's the one that really like really fucking bothers

298
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:11,040
me. Oreo said, hold on, I got one. And they run up to the mic all wild and they're like, listen,

299
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,960
I got one. Everybody shut up. Listen, what if we did a cookie where the cream was on the outside?

300
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:35,440
The cookies in the middle. No, but like the cookies normally on the outside. Someone gets

301
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,040
paid to do that. My personal favorite. I'm thinking about the logistics of that. It's a lot.

302
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,560
From a fulfillment standpoint. My personal favorite and you all aren't going to believe

303
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,920
this one was a real joke, but Carl's Jr. invented the vape cup.

304
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,640
The science of this. They did the damn thing, folks. That is actually solid. The science of

305
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,920
this is legit. Basically it's a straw where the juice is in the middle and the battery is at the

306
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:21,280
bottom. So when you inhale your drink, your soda, you also are going to get just a huge blast of

307
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:31,040
vape. It's going to vape right into your own body. Hey, here's three words. Pop tarts ravioli.

308
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:43,280
Maybe I would argue a pop tart is already ravioli. Red Lobster's doing Twizzler straws.

309
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,920
What? Red Lobster's doing Twizzler straws as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic straws.

310
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,600
So anyway, everything's terrible. This is my favorite. This place I never heard of called

311
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:15,600
the stone fire grill. A bottle of white, a bottle of red. Why don't you call me the dude instead?

312
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,040
It has a fucking bird on it.

313
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:27,440
It's Paul. If you're listening later, Paul has brought us wine and he is a hero. I want to while

314
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:38,480
Paul. Drink that spit wine now, Griffin. While Paul is pouring, I have white in here, Paul,

315
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,840
but if you want to pour some red on top of it. Make it a blush. Make it a blush. If you want to

316
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,840
pour some red wine into my Stella. Yeah, please. Stone fire grill, which I've never heard of,

317
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,080
tweeted, it's time to move on to new menu items and we have to get rid of some old

318
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,240
favorites to make room. This is the last week to ensure our freshly baked breadsticks.

319
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:07,520
So that was their joke. It's just like, we're not going to make breadsticks anymore.

320
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:16,800
I mean like McDonald's is like, hey everyone, Grimace fucking died. JK, he's immortal. Yeah.

321
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,400
There are so many of there on there that you haven't said. What is wrong? How much time did

322
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,360
they spend developing these when they could have been making their food taste good? Yeah,

323
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,120
but anyway, those are the highlights of the- I'm just thinking about that two sandwiches stacked

324
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:49,680
on. Can you fucking imagine? God, the Coffee Bean, their fucking April Fool's gag was announcing

325
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,920
that they would be replacing pellet shaped ice with regular ice cubes. You got to be deep in

326
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:12,560
the fucking Coffee Bean fandom to let that one sink in. Hey guys, this is Griffin and I'm going

327
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,400
to do the ads by myself this time. The boys said that they trusted me. They said they thought I

328
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,240
could do a good job and so they handed me the reigns. So let's ride this monetized horse

329
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,400
together. Both our sponsors this week are things that I have sort of interfaced with today in a

330
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,480
physical and meaningful level. The first is MeUndies and my connection with them should

331
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,640
be obvious and erotic. They are the underwear company that makes really, really, just really

332
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,760
good stuff. Not just underwear, they make, you know, they got pajamas and they got lounge pants,

333
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,120
all kinds of great stuff too. But they just had a new sort of scientific development that we're all

334
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,800
very excited about. I read it in Scientist Magazine. They have figured out MeUndies that are

335
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:05,920
boxer briefs, but they got a fly. Can you imagine the possibilities? What can you even keep in there

336
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,440
other than your stuff? I don't know. It's time for you to figure it out though by yourself. I trust

337
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,960
you to go on this journey. They got that coveted micro modal fabric that is three times softer than

338
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,560
cotton. They got you multiple style options for whatever you want to wear and you can get 15%

339
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,640
off your first pair and free shipping and a 100% satisfaction guarantee and a fly on your freaking

340
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,720
boxer briefs. If you go to MeUndies.com slash my brother, that's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

341
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,280
Also want to tell you about Quip. Now this is a tool that you put in your mouth to get your teeth

342
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,840
feeling so good, looking so good, getting all the germs and diseases off of them and the stuff that

343
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,200
we call plaque that we hate so much. You can get all that shit off with Quip because they are

344
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,080
toothbrushes that are designed to make brushing your teeth more simple, affordable and even

345
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,520
enjoyable. I enjoy using my Quip. It's got sensitive sonic vibrations gentle enough for

346
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,160
your sensitive gums and a built in two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds to remind you

347
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,720
when to switch sides. It's one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the American

348
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,520
Dental Association. It's got thousands of verified five star reviews. How about this?

349
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,520
Thousands and one. Five stars. I like my Quip a lot. It travels really easily too. It's got a little holster

350
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,120
that you can stick on your mirror or whatever, what have you, and then you can just put the

351
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,640
toothbrush right in that and take it as a little travel case. It's awesome. It's backed by over

352
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,080
20,000 dental professionals and it starts at just $25. If you go to GetQuip.com slash my brother

353
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,920
right now, you can get your first refill pack for free with a Quip electric toothbrush. That's

354
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,040
your first refill pack for free and a toothbrush at GetQuip.com slash my brother. I'm pretty sure

355
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,040
we do the rest of our programming stuff at the end of the live show here at San Jose. Thank you

356
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,400
so much San Jose and Salt Lake City. You two cities were fucking great to us and we will

357
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,680
definitely make some time to get back there and do some more shows. If listening to this

358
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,520
makes you want to come see us, well then good news. We have just announced our first sort of

359
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,120
big tour. Our first sort of big tour that we're doing. It is the McElroy Family Presents Become

360
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,360
the Monster Tour 2019. All the tickets for all of the the dates I'm about to mention are going to

369
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,480
we've ever announced at one time and we're going to be going all over the country. Oh one important

370
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,160
thing to mention and we're trying to be very sort of uh up front about this all of the live Taz's

371
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,560
we are not sort of guaranteeing that it's going to be a balanced show. I know that's what we've

372
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,520
been doing traditionally but um we we're going to be mixing it up probably on this tour with

373
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,360
the Adventure Zone. So uh if you if you want to come to those shows just know that they may not

374
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,400
be the Taz balance uh characters that you know they may be some new stuff. We've been trying

375
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,120
some new stuff with Taz lately and it's been a lot of fun. So uh all of those shows you can find the

376
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:51,360
dates and places and all that shit and ticket links at themacaroy.family um and they will have

379
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,440
Hi I'm the JV Club podcast Janet Varney and I used to suffer from indecision. I couldn't choose

380
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,240
between Star Wars and Star Trek whether to call or text or the best way to cook my eggs but now

381
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,440
thanks to my weekly dose of We Got This on Maximum Fun my decisions are made for me. Thanks Mark and

382
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,920
Hal. Warning We Got This may cause shouting, phone throwing, the illusion that the hosts can hear you,

383
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,400
laughter on public transit and death. We got this with Mark and Hal. We know what's best.

384
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,240
All right I got a yahoo. I'm another yahoo junior here and it is sitting by Lauren. Thank you Lauren.

385
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:48,880
It's an anonymous yahoo answers user uh who I'm gonna call Grimace who asks. Hunting colon

386
00:44:48,880 --> 00:45:04,800

Gary am I related to Gary do I have a sibling named Gary in with that pizza hookup shit uh

402
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,920
here's a real yahoo that was sent in by Merritt Palmer thank you Merritt fun it's a yahoo answers

403
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:40,640
user me me me or perhaps meme meme tickle farsan who asks oh I shouldn't have had Paul mix the red

404
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:49,600
and the white yeah yeah there's a reason people don't do that this person asks how do I force my

405
00:47:49,600 --> 00:48:00,000
cat to have dinner with me man I get it you know your busy schedules don't always line up yeah

406
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,160
you try to make plans with friends and suddenly you're sleeping in separate beds

407
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:15,760
be with the cat yeah um how do I force my cat to have dinner with me it's gonna be uh tough uh

408
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:23,360
they're sort of programmed to explicitly not do this one thing this one specific act the problem

409
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:29,760
is you shouldn't let the cat get a microwave in its own room yeah it's heating up its own meals

410
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,560
heating up its own meals living its own life doesn't need you anymore all right well I would

411
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:46,320

412
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:53,120

415
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,840
the whole time that you're eating it right especially when i'm recording a podcast okay

416
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,560
it's important spaghetti spaghetti spaghetti you could uh you should do that do that and then wear

417
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:22,880
a cat mask and be like what do you guys hate about brian what's your um least favorite thing about him

yours oh i like this stinky pate you've got here oh and i see brian served it on a crystal dish

420
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,720
what an asshole yeah see this is just another reason why we all hate brian is that where we're

421
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,920
at all right that's what i suspected let's get out of here you and i i see the fancy feast

422
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,080
commercial where they serve the stink pate on the crystal dish and i think it looks pretty fucking

423
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:06,480
good but then i smell it and i'm immediately turned off and i'm not a cat can you imagine

424
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,840
the betrayal that they must feel every time because you have to serve it in the crystal dish

425
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:16,000
more than that griffin the thing that i always feel most upset about is in those commercials

426
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,560
there's always like a little tiny like accent leaf or something on it and somebody had to put

427
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:28,000
that there and then look at themselves in a mirror later yeah okay so what do you do for a living

428
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:37,200
i'm the person who puts the leaf next i make i make the feasts fancy it's kind of my whole thing

429
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:44,640
my whole thing i look forward to the robot apocalypse yeah more yeah more than anybody

430
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,280

00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,640
hi i'm christian hi christian get right up on that microphone if you do not mind what's up

432
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,280
how do i get over the guilt of having to put pins in a cartoon character's butt yeah

433
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,600
right up in the mic just really and if we can get a little bit more yeah if you want to turn

434
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:15,120
it get a little bit more christian in our in our our i make character costumes for theme parks for

435
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,680
a living cool so when children pull on tails they don't pull out the whole back of the character

436
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:29,760
tear away i love i have to put velcro in their butthole yeah and i feel bad about putting pins

437
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,600
in their butt why now hold on is there a human being inside of the suit when this happens no

438
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,440
yeah i would say you're providing a service i can't believe i needed that clarified

439
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,480
that would be the wildest sort of stipulation to put i can't work without a human in the suit

440
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,720
how do i even know where the butt is yeah you know you are looking at three human beings who have all

441
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,960
done costumes character work oh my god have we ever talked about this on the show before yeah

442
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,800
i'm sure we talked about when we were all a cow cow bunga not at once not that'd be weird we all

443
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,120
had our turn in the ironton memorial day parade wearing the ice vests and pretending to be cow

444
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:14,720
bunga the wtcr cow mascot yeah having your uh your your high school cohorts run up and pull on your

445
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:21,760
teats is a fun oh no my favorite experience is walking around the tri-state hunting and fishing

446
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:30,720
show and having a grown adult say i'm going to hunt you sick which is fun because it's a cow

447
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,960
good hunting hunting enjoy your pizza hut you okay

448
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:46,320
i know you've been very careful not to say where you work uh or the exact characters that we're

449
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:56,960
dealing with here uh i can say the ip okay i mostly make dreamworks characters okay okay

450
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,640
listen let's go at justin travis and i can just carte blanche you have permission to

451
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,520
whatever characters we end up portraying in trolls 2 you can put velcro wherever you

452
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,240
in fact i'll make your life easier and say i will tell the director to make my character

453
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:23,120
canonically have a tear away but yeah so they did make one of the trolls fart glitter at a park

hell yeah extremely good was that guy diamond yeah guy diamond of course guy diamonds the

455
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:38,320
best of the trolls uh so so the boss baby's tail keeps falling off how did it sounds like you're

456
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,960
providing a service that's not something you should feel guilt about you're keeping people's

457
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,720
a boss from a physician doesn't feel bad when they sew someone's butt back on

458
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,320
it's just kind of awkward having to pull the fabric through the hole too with my whole arm

in there no yeah i mean you don't know yeah for sure i mean giving shrek a prolapse is not like

471
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,760

472
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:22,400
brother's liable for any injury it's just like a fun it's like a joke yeah kind of an in-joke

473
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,720
for us to have yeah and this is a weird sort of like role reversal but can we have your autograph

474
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:38,640
on a very specific document a document y'all signed your waivers before you came in right

475
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,360
i did sign some headshots oh i will take that yeah we can photoshop that signature onto another

476
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,640
thing okay that's how i always sign my liability waivers too with just oh and here's a picture

477
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:58,560

478
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:06,400
time stuff nice okay super and that includes a candy crane that is unreasonably difficult and is

479
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,360
like a play until you win sort of thing and like you try fail try fail it just keeps going and

480
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:17,760
keeps playing this like insanely loud obnoxious music does that tootsie rolls in it yes don't

481
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,240
you hate it when it says try until you win and that counts yeah it also has some really good

482
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:32,080
lollipops and also some really like that's a win that's a win okay sorry anyway um so a lot of

483
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:39,760
times kids will like load in like several rounds of you know playing yeah and like fail too long

484
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,640
and then their pizza comes and so they abandon ship okay and the music just keeps going and

485
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:49,920
going it's ella time right and it's really is it like is the music like ella get the

486
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,640
fuck over here and get this kid's candy yeah it's yours yeah yeah this dumbass left his credits on

487
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,880
the machine yeah come and get what's your own yeah it's a siren song you can get that raise

488
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:10,880
and this is how we make it up to you uh so go on sorry we'll suck it'll keep blaring through the

489
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,720
whole it's a small building and like everyone starts to like like crew and just people in

490
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,760
the building you can see people start to like slowly lose their goddamn minds uh-huh and so

491
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:29,440
like any job yeah or any pizza experience and so to kill the beast i'll like take a moment to go

492
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,880
over and try to win and it usually takes me a few bits and especially if they've loaded in

493
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:43,680
like four or five plays but i do it i'm diligent and thank you yes let's hear it for ella's hard

494
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:53,440
working commitment yes thank you pizza port of morrow bay you're welcome um but anyway so i win

495
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,720
sometimes a kind of lot of candy brag which i kind of want you're dope at the game yeah

496
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:05,040
standing your truth super good um but then like sometimes the families will just be like at a

497
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:12,160
nearby table and kind of just like watching me do their hard work for them okay yeah and like

498
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,480
i usually instead of like taking it out immediately just like leave it in the machine

499
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,520
like oh i didn't want it oh and then come back later don't worry i come back later did you can i

500
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:30,000
ask yes did you want it yes then i would say uh swing hard the other way unwrap it with direct

501
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,960
eye contact all right because that's nice because they didn't win candy but they won a lesson yeah

502
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:45,120
true here's what i would do ella get the huge handful of candy and just throw it over a table

503
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:54,080
of children say my name is ella now i'm your god you work for me now one of the first instances of

504
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:58,720
it i like took the candy out and then panicked and so i threw it away in front of them awesome

505
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,120
that's a magical scenario yes did you look at them and say this is the world this is the world

506
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:12,800
world you work hard for nothing i i love you could just keep your pockets full of it and

not actually like gone ahead and eaten eventually yeah good they're trash on the counter for the

515
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,680
openers that's where they belong uh does that help yeah all right i don't think we said anything

helpful but thank you can we get uh let's get uh one more in the queue sam 102 d14 uh come on down

517

518
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:30,800
i what's your what's your name and now that you're telling us now it's kind of like a

519
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:37,760
you're probably wondering how i got into this my name is fawn and um fun can you scoot up to

520
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:46,800
the mic just a little bit thank you that's great that's good perfect uh so yeah my dad

521
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,480
offered me weed and i'm on me for thinking there would be more to the story than that so your dad

522
01:00:52,480 --> 01:01:06,160
offered you weed uh and he okay i i'm wondering if this is a trap to like a literal honey pot

523
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:12,880
honey pot that's good thank you now if my dad offered you weed yes

524
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,360
yes but is your dad cool can your dad hang

525
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:30,880
oh fun that does follow my life lesson of know thy dad yeah uh yeah this is a primo trap right

526
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,600
there's i can't think of any other scenario unless the only way it makes sense is if your

527
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:42,720
dad is like matthew mcconaughey like literally like that level of like yeah uh your dad isn't

528
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:49,600
matthew mcconaughey is he was he in manfred man's earth band at any time paul loved that fucking

529
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:58,400
joke um fun just so i can understand the sequence of events okay your dad said fawn do you want some

530
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:07,360
weed and you said let me think about it i have to go to a podcast is that basically coming out

531
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:14,080
well okay this has actually happened uh like several times okay does he seem more and more

532
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:21,120
insistent each time do you want some way this feels like a murder mystery where if i ask you

533
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:28,080
the right question the story will be revealed did your dad catch you smoking weed once and

534
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:37,600
now he's gonna make you smoke a whole carton of weed i've never smoked weed in my life actually

535
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:43,040
oh i mean don't just the weird part yeah does your dad does your dad i know you said your dad

536
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:50,000
can't really hang but can you see your dad as the sort of person that did at one point have some

537
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:58,560
weed i should probably mention that he owns a medical marijuana dispensary

538
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,640
i feel like i'm gonna ask you enough questions i want to find out where the fucking limburg baby

539
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:20,160
is like what the fuck this is her story too right yes um and did i mention he had weed in his hands

540
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:27,440
that he was putting into mine yeah and he is matthew mcconaughey and it's definitely primo cush

541
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:38,400
this i would i would say if you do not genuinely want to then this is a solid no that you can feel

542
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:48,800
confident about but but uh if i could have had my first marijuana experience be with my dad

543
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,600
and not in a bathtub in a bathroom with a bunch of basically strangers

544
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:05,680
i would have gone with the former and my dad is a huge narc like i still would have

545
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:12,720
the comfort and safety i would have felt in my father's loving bosom as he smoked me out

546
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:23,520
i would have found deeply deeply just warm and inviting if i could have smoked weed with my dad

547
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:30,560
or eaten four gas station cookies and thrown up in a toilet in an alley a broken toilet

548
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:37,680
in an alley then i probably would have smoked weed with my dad yeah clint mcelroy right

549
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:47,120
if i you know him if i'd had the opportunity to look up at someone and ask is this gonna be forever

550
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:53,600
i'd want it to be my father and set a stranger whose answer goes oh fuck yeah man

551
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:03,760

friend who shows up like hey i'm an old person too i hang here all the time well you seem cool

563
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:30,000
i'd love it if you stayed here at this old person house is that accurate no no okay fine uh instead

564
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,720
we have uh what is known as a code pink uh which no bummers right sam super no bummers uh it's uh

565
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:49,600
it's fun it's like hide and seek uh and we do have to drill it sometimes oh my god and i have

566
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:57,600
been tasked uh next week with drilling a code pink which is a missing elder oh so you hide

567
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:04,720
the elder and say where'd that elder go right exactly yeah yeah yeah okay yeah i'm actually

568
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,400
super all bored with that so you're this is you have to hire your own carmen sandiego

569
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:21,520
that's nothing it's something i could sorry okay so sam what are the qualifications you're looking

570
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:28,000
for in a mysterious elderly person now they're not asking about what type of person she's oh

571
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,600
that's important no wait this is actually important are you going to use a human prop

572
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:41,280
from the stock of elderly people that you have yes fantastic so first things first audition

573
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:48,960
yeah audition make them curl up in the tightest ball they can form and then this is important

574
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:56,560
see how long they can hold that ball right yes yeah they have to be able to just be in one place

575
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:03,280
for an hour for an hour who can mask their breathing the best an hour in a code pink an

576
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:11,120
hour is not ideal really no that seems like quite a long time yeah sam i guess i'm gonna be the one

577
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:20,880
to say why does it have to be an old person like i guess couldn't it be a sticker or a turkey or

578
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:29,360
a picture of sam rockwell or literally anything flag like a double dare flag yeah a flag you gotta
