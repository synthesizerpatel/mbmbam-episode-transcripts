1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,080
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother My Brother,

6
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,400
a media advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm your baby-est baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,120
Start spreading the news.

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh, that's good, that's good.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm leaving today.

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,640
This is Travis down in the corner of your screen.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
You've probably noticed Justin sounds a little bit different, and he's singing.

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,360
Well, Justin has made his way to New York City, the Big Apple.

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,360
The Big Snapple, even.

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,720
The Big Snapple.

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,640
The stars, they're in his eyes.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,080
His dreams are finally coming through, and he's decided to pursue his dreams of stardom.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,880
Of joining the great white way.

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
He wants to be the whitest person on the white way.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
It's up to you.

22
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
If anyone can do it.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
Justin, Justin, let me stop you right there, it sounds good.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,120
Don't use it all up, use it all up.

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,760
I gotta know, have you prepared a tight two?

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Yeah, I have a monologue, I have a comedic, and I have-

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,080
I'm not asking about your monologues, I wanna know if you've prepared a tight two for me.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,960
If not, turn on your heels, do a plie on your heels, and get the fuck out of here.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,160
I have two contrasting monologues, one is comedic, one is dramatic.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
I didn't ask you about your monologues, do you have two?

31
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,720
I wanna hear you sing two notes.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,520
Oh, two notes?

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,960
Uh, tight two notes, and I- you bet, you only got two, so blow me.

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
Okay, okay.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,240
Sarah, me.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
There, no, that's it, that was perfect.

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,040
Thank you.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
Now we can move on to the monologue phase of the audition.

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
Hold on one second before we move on to the monologue phase of the audition.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,040
Jeffrey, Steven, get out of here, you're done.

41
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,600
You're done, get out of here.

42
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,960
Your twos were too loose.

43
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,600
You got loose twos.

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,080
You got loose twos, get the hell out of here.

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
Michael, get them out of here.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,240
Michael Cerveris, get them out.

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,560
I had to get Michael Cerveris to throw them the hell out of here,

48
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,640
right on their ear, right onto the Great White Way,

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,960
and it's made out of gravel, so it's gonna hurt their ears.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,200
Huntington, West Virginia's own Michael Cerveris, our favorite son,

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,640
our favorite Broadway star, who's also the observer.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
He's here, and he's here to give you some encouragement.

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Do it for us, Justin.

54
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,360
Mark McVay, I should mention, is also a Huntington beloved.

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Yeah, I'm here too.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
It's me, Mark McVay, Justin.

57
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,560
Mark McVay.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,200
And I'm your sister, Beth McVay.

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh boy, and let me just tell you,

60
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
you got the tightest two I've experienced ever.

61
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,520
You've been working out to get your two that tight?

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,120
Yeah, tight ass twos.

63
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,480
None of this is right.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,720
None of these character voices are correct.

65
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,040
All right, Justin, hit me with those monos, my boy.

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Okay, I have prepared three monologues, a comedic, a dramatic, and a...

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,840
I love it.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,400
I love it.

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
I love your voice, I love your style, I love your tight little body.

70
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,680
And a classical monologue.

71
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:03,920
So my dramatic monologue is from a really super duper serious part

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,640
of 10 Things I Hate About You.

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:06,960
Okay.

74
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,520
My comedic monologue is from a sort of a funnier part

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,600
in 10 Things I Hate About You.

76
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,720
And my classic monologue is, of course, from 10 Things I Hate About You,

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,640
which is based on Tammy of the Shrew.

78
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,080
So I have sort of all the range of...

79
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,200
Perfect, perfect film, perfect trio, perfect triad.

80
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,800
I tell you what though, I only want to hear your favorite of the three

81
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,640
because we've only got an hour.

82
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,560
So this is the scene, of course, when Julia Stiles is talking to-

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,120
I love her.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
I found her.

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,440
I picked her from the briar patch, put her up on that great white way.

86
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,720
I adopted her and I raised her.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
She was sick.

88
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
She had two broken arms and legs, four broken limbs total,

89
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
and I nursed her back to health from my breast.

90
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,960
I've prepared just a short selection from one scene

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,760
when Julia Stiles is talking to, as Cat Stratford is talking to Cameron James,

92
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,200
played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which I would- Breastfed him too.

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,680
Go on.

94
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
Breastfed him too.

95
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,360
Okay.

96
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,840
I'd just like to jump into the scene from 10 Things I Hate About You right now.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,760
It's a short scene, but hopefully you're going to enjoy it.

98
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,720
Spin it up, baby.

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,220
Okay.

100
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,200
Number seven, the way you order at restaurants.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,120
Number eight, your stupid hair.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,840
Yes, of course.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,160
Sorry.

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,960
I want to tell you 10 things I loved about that.

105
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:33,920
Everything.

106
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,520
That's one.

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
Now, Justin, I got to tell you, you got the perfect look for the part we're casting today,

108
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,400
which is, of course, Jeff-ya on a new musical that we've written together.

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Me and Travis have written together called Fiddler on the Ground.

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,120
We had a lot of insurance issues.

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,840
We did.

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,000
He was really super high up there.

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,520
Listen, I'm going to be honest with you because I feel like honesty is the most important part

114
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
in a director-actor relationship.

115
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
We've lost a few Jeff-yas.

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,240
They've fallen.

117
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
They have done plump fell right the fuck off that roof right onto the-

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,720
Why were they on a roof?

119
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Why is there a roof in your sequel, Fiddler on the Ground?

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
No, that's what I'm saying.

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,160
We've adapted.

122
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,880
I'm going to be honest.

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,640
It's note for note, word for word, exactly the same, except for all references to roofs

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,600
have been struck from the record, and it's a much more terrestrial production.

125
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,200
This is sort of like when they changed Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark to Underwear Man,

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,320
the punching genius, so they got rid of all the swinging, and it was just a man in his

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,120
underwear, in his long underwear, punching people, and he was great at it.

128
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
Exactly.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,480
Now, Justin, real quick, before we give you the part, and I am right on the edge.

130
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,720
Right on the edge.

131
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
We got a lot more people to see.

132
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,800
I want to ask you the same question I ask every Jeff-ya in Fiddler on the Roof, and

133
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,600
that is this.

134
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
Sorry, Fiddler on the Ground.

135
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,520
He is on the ground.

136
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Fiddler on the Ground, can you shake it?

137
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,720
Yeah, my problem is trying not to break it.

138
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
That's my problem is I could shake it, shake it, but then when I try not to break it-

139
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Well, we have had insurance issues, so we do need you to guarantee that you will not

140
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,320
break it.

141
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,640
I have to tell you that it's actually very disappointing, Justin, because all of the

142
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:30,720
Jeff-yas we've had so far have exhibited proclivity toward breaking it, it being everything.

143
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
I do have experience with this sort of Broadway production.

144
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,040
I don't know if you saw, it was a very limited run called Into the Weeds because the trees

145
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,280
kept falling on people, so they got rid of those, and it was just tall grass where people

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,200
learn things about fairy tales and life.

147
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:57,040
We did a production of Who's Afraid of Virginia Puppy because the wolves, we had a really

148
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,000
hard time controlling the wolf on stage.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
So we just replaced-

150
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,960
I was in a production called Some Things Goes because we had a lot of problem with some

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,840
substance abuse and a lot of pregnancies, and then we had to say, okay, not anything

152
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
goes.

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,600
Some Things Goes.

154
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,280
Hey, hey, the subtitle, Some Things Goes, hey, hey, keep your dick in your pants.

155
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I produced the Spider-Man musical.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Travis produced the Spider-Man musical, but back in the original days when it was good,

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,920
when it was risky, when it was brave, when it was deadly.

158
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,360
When it starred the Flying Walensky brothers.

159
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,880
Oh, that was a thrilling production, I bet.

160
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,920
Is that who that is?

161
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,520
Who are those people?

162
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,120
Listen, I just want to get out of here and I want to say, you got the job, but unfortunately

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,160
theater is dead.

164
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,880
Theater is dead.

165
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,280
No, a theater can't be dead.

166
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,880
Just died.

167
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,360
Just died.

168
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Well, it died along with the third Spider-Man.

169
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,320
Oh no, we lost another one?

170
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,080
Well, we lost 16, but after the third one is when we really had to rein it in.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,480
I was in a production called Singing in the Fog because there's a lot of slipping and

172
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
a lot of people were falling and that was-

173
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,760
I remember I was there.

174
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,280
I was in the third row.

175
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
I got really great seats for opening night.

176
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
Couldn't see a thing.

177
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,640
Right.

178
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,680
I loved it.

179
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,040
I loved it though.

180
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
It's very conceptual, very sexual.

181
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,680
It was the sexiest production since Some Things Go.

182
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,520
It was very conceptual.

183
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,880
It was conceptual, I would say.

184
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,960
There was also, there was one other I was in.

185
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,240
There had a lot of issues with shootings on stage.

186
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,520
It was Annie Get Your Nerf Crossbow.

187
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Yeah, sure.

188
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,560
And that was not, that was soundly, critically drubbed, I would say.

189
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,560
And Tom Lopat.

190
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,840
Now, I saw one called, it was called Paint Your Wagon, but hey, watch it with the lead

191
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,960
based stuff, partner.

192
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,440
Yeah, sure.

193
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,960
Because they did have a lot of-

194
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,360
Paint Your Wagon bright yellow so we can see it coming so no one gets run over anymore.

195
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,400
Right.

196
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Okay, so I guess we should start the podcast.

197
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,440
This is, as you've certainly gathered-

198
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,000
I saw one.

199
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,520
I saw one.

200
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,160
No, hold on.

201
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,440
I saw one and it was just called Juliet because the catalyst for that whole thing was their

202
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,000
romance.

203
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,440
Just take that out of the equation and it's just nice play about some family stuff.

204
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
A lot of parents were complaining about the fan of being too spooky so I mounted the guy

205
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,080
in the sheet in the opera.

206
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
Under the sheet, though.

207
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
Under the sheet, horribly burned.

208
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Oh my god, head to dick.

209
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,000
Just burned all the way up.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
All right, so are we ready to-

211
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,520
Like a tempura eggplant, just completely burned.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,960
That's really bad, okay.

213
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,720
My girlfriend and I are about to embark on a cross-country move, Washington, D.C. to

214
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,440
Seattle.

215
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
We're excited about the trip but the prospect of 50 hours in the car is a daunting one.

216
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,120
What are some things we can do while we drive to keep ourselves from going totally bonkers?

217
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,480
That's from trapped in a Toyota.

218
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
Now, Travis, I would guess you probably have the most experience of the three of us with

219
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,000
like super long hauls.

220
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah, I mean, real talk, the best thing I can advise is like make yourself stop for

221
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,520
like meals.

222
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,360
Teresa and I got into a bad habit of like kind of going, oh, we'll stop the next place

223
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,920
we see.

224
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,120
Oh, are you really hungry?

225
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,040
And then pretty soon like we'd miss lunch and it'd be like three o'clock and that

226
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,160
just makes you really crabby and makes you like really like, eh.

227
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,920
So like eat at regular times and also at a certain point, I'm the type of person who

228
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
always likes to make good time on a drive, but at a certain point if you're driving,

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,080
you know, 50 collective hours, schedule in breaks.

230
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,680
Like say like, you know, every two and a half hours we're going to get out and stretch our

231
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,560
legs or something.

232
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,680
Because man, sitting in the car even for like six hours knowing you have like another four

233
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,960
or five hours in the day and then another 40 after that, it can get pretty mind numbing.

234
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,320
I kind of love taking trips like in a plane or in a car, as long as I'm not driving.

235
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Driving is kind of a bummer.

236
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,160
Then like the only thing you can do is listen to podcasts and guess what?

237
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,520
Dummy already doing that.

238
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,120
Um, but if you're not driving, I mean, that is why God made Pokemon like that.

239
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,800
Like I get psyched to get on a plane and like, oh shit, time to fire up, fire up the Game

240
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,280
Boy.

241
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,960
I say Game Boy there is like sort of a catch all for all handheld gaming consoles.

242
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,760
Sure, sure.

243
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
Have you heard of Pokemon?

244
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,680
Because it's going to change you on the road.

245
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,560
You think what this person needs is Pokemon.

246
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah, it's hard to know where to start.

247
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,040
I really like X and Y.

248
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Um, no, you got to start old school.

249
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,520
You got to start red and blue.

250
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,240
Well, that's what I'm saying.

251
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,080
I think X and Y did a pretty good job of including maybe the people who haven't played it before.

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,960
It's a pretty good entry point, for being honest.

253
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,240
Uh, you, I mean, you probably don't want to, uh, you probably don't want to do this if

254
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,040
you're driving though.

255
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,440
I mean, I, I think that that's kind of a crummy move in a two person long haul.

256
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,360
If one person fires up the Game Boy, I think you take turns, you take turns driving and

257
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,120
then it's like, what move should I use?

258
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,600
Yeah.

259
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,320
What do you want me to use?

260
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,800
Razor Leaf?

261
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,920
No, don't use Razor Leaf.

262
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
No, don't use Razor Leaf, you're fighting a Charizard.

263
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,200
Idiot.

264
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,760
Idiot.

265
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,720
Get out of the car.

266
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
I'm going alone now.

267
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,960
I knew I should have gone alone this whole, leave the 3DS though.

268
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
Leave the 3DS.

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,080
Start to set it on the dashboard.

270
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Set it on the dashboard.

271
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,480
We're three badges deep, Debra.

272
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,440
Get the hell out of here.

273
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,560
Uh, I'm assuming if you're going to Seattle, you're basically just driving to see our live

274
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,440
show there.

275
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,320
Uh, bit.ly forward slash n-b-n-b-a-m Seattle, uh, for tickets.

276
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
Still plenty of great seats available.

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,040
Next week.

278
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,360
That's inadvis- oh my god, don't put it like that.

279
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
Hahaha, it's next week, what's up?

280
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,760
God, you suck.

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,960
Um, that's not because I'm not looking forward to it.

282
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,360
I think it's going to be off the chain and off the hook.

283
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Um, maybe, maybe, uh, enjoy the scenery as you drive across this great land of ours.

284
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
You're going to see a lot of stuff.

285
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,080
A lot of deserts, maybe mountains, maybe Grand Canyon or you could miss the Grand Canyon

286
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,640
like I did.

287
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,320
Or you could stop at every Cracker Barrel you see, even if you're not hungry.

288
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,800
Even if you just stopped at a Cracker Barrel two hours before and buy a licorice candy

289
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,280
in every Cracker Barrel in the United States.

290
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, that's fun.

291
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
And then you could maybe get, like, a, um, book on tape.

292
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,720
I recommend the Q continuum.

293
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,880
It was a great one our dad made us listen to a couple times based in the Star Trek universe.

294
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,480
All from the point of view of Q.

295
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
Dad seemed to get that from every Cracker Barrel, we stopped at.

296
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Hey, you know, it's where, you know, we haven't listened to in a while.

297
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,840
What's Q up to, I wonder?

298
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's check in with our old buddy Q.

299
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,840
The best thing is you get it from one Cracker Barrel.

300
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,200
You can turn it back in at a different Cracker Barrel that you'll stop at two hours later.

301
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,880
Dad was, that was essentially a Q Continuum delivery man.

302
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,960
He was a Q, he was a Q courier.

303
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,880
There was one in Cincinnati, Ohio and they, the people working there were like, why the

304
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,440
hell do we have 415 copies of the Q Continuum audiobook and no other Cracker Barrel in the

305
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,320
country has any.

306
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
Well, I'll tell you why.

307
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,320
Mack McElroy.

308
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,520
He had to catch them all.

309
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,400
He caught them all.

310
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,000
He caught every single one of them.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,320
You could, you could spend the entire trip writing an album of parody songs.

312
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,200
Then really like get deep into them and spend so much time on them that you think that they're

313
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,000
really good.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,160
And then when you get to Seattle, just play it for the first person you find and look,

315
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,800
and look them dead in the eye and just say, is this anything?

316
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,600
Is this something?

317
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,840
I haven't, like, is this something?

318
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,920
Are we, it's like, did we make anything?

319
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,200
And maybe, maybe it won't work out this car trip and maybe it won't on the next car trip,

320
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,360
but the third car trip, it'll definitely work out.

321
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,640
That's how Weird Al Yankovic did it.

322
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,160
That song, Biggest Ballets Wind in Minnesota, he wrote that on, on one of his trip, his

323
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,640
third trip.

324
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,320
He was like, wait a minute, I've got it.

325
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,680
You really hone it down by the third trip.

326
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

327
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,080
And that would be great, Griffin.

328
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,560
Thank you.

329
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
This Yahoo was sent in by Colin Bailey.

330
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,880
Thank you, Colin.

331
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dorian G who asks.

332
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,960
Now, Griffin, are you sure?

333
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,040
Because Colin Bailey does not sound like any of the three people we normally get our Yahoos

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,360
from.

335
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,160
No, I know.

336
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,880
I know.

337
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm very confused and I'm scared.

338
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,120
This is proof.

339
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,080
I read all the Yahoos.

340
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,320
It's not laziness.

341
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,520
I'm not neglecting everyone.

342
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,720
It's just, they're that good.

343
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,520
Colin Bailey, though, managed to worm his way in here.

344
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
Congratulations, Colin.

345
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dorian G.

346
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,440
I already said that.

347
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,080
A little drunk.

348
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,080
Me too.

349
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,560
Me too.

350
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,360
I'm drinking an Austin Eastiders original.

351
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
That's why we don't do evening.

352
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm drinking a giant Omagong Abbey Ale, 8.2%.

353
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,920
It's the best they had at the Duane Reade.

354
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
You guys are doing great.

355
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,440
Yeah.

356
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,960
I want whiskey, but I couldn't find a liquor store in New York.

357
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,080
There aren't any.

358
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,720
Yeah.

359
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,080
Completely dry city.

360
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Clean living.

361
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,240
Thanks, Bloomberg.

362
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,720
Dorian G asks, handshakes.

363
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,560
Should we just get rid of it?

364
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,680
Maybe there is something to shaking hands when you have to make a deal.

365
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,360
For me, at any rate, shaking hands with a stranger is just awkward.

366
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
I especially hate the idea that you have to give an especially firm handshake.

367
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,600
It can be painful.

368
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,120
What's your view of handshakes?

369
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,600
Update.

370
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
Anyone else hate shaking hands with people?

371
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,640
We've talked about handshaking like technique a lot.

372
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Yeah.

373
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,200
So I don't want to get into like how to give a good handshake because I don't want to repeat.

374
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,840
But handshakes, should we just get rid of it?

375
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,080
No.

376
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
And I'll tell you why, Griffin.

377
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,080
If we're going to do a little point counterpoint here, I'll be pro handshake.

378
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,160
When you meet a new person, right?

379
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
You have a conversation with them.

380
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
I'm the type of person, I always want to go in for the hug, right?

381
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,440
But you never know how the other person is going to react to that.

382
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,080
But if we abolish handshakes though, then you're seeing it wrong.

383
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,000
Hugging is now the only option.

384
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,640
No, Griffin.

385
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,560
Because you throw that hand out there and then they go, uh, and hug you.

386
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,920
Or they shake your hand.

387
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,160
You've made some kind of physical contact.

388
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,200
You've established like, I enjoy your presence too.

389
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
And then the next time you see him, you hug.

390
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,760
But the handshake is like a really great like, I like you before you say I love you.

391
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,480
It's, it's an RSVP to a future hug.

392
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,120
Exactly.

393
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:42,400
I love this order.

394
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,040
Without that, everybody's just hugging left and right.

395
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,840
First time I met-

396
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,720
Save the hug.

397
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,280
First time I met my father-in-law, shook his hand, firm.

398
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Looked him right in the eye and I said, save the hug.

399
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,560
Next time I flew in, saw me at the airport, dropped my bag, ran in, jumped into his arms,

400
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,080
embraced him for two and a half minutes.

401
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,360
And, and he, we, we left the embrace and he looked at me and he's like, I'm glad you prepared me.

402
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,320
Glad you warned me about that.

403
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
I was like, yeah, man.

404
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,960
You got a few months to prepare.

405
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,760
He's like, I needed them.

406
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,480
I was really ready for it.

407
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,640
I did some, I did some CrossFit to get ready for that hug.

408
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,520
I was like, good.

409
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,800
Yeah, I noticed the belts.

410
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,280
For sure.

411
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,280
Sure.

412
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,440
Handshakes, handshakes, should we just get rid of it?

413
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,080
I like that.

414
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,400
You sell your drum set to somebody on Craigslist and it's like, well, bye.

415
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,080
Right.

416
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
There's nothing, there's nothing in between.

417
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,040
The void will be filled.

418
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,320
By what?

419
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,520
If you abolish handshakes, it's going to become like you kick each other's feet, right?

420
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
Or like you just rub your shoulder blades together.

421
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
Something will establish like-

422
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,680
You rub your big bald cone-shaped heads together.

423
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
Only applicable to cone heads.

424
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
Hashtag only applicable to cone heads.

425
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,760
Hashtag cone heads only, please.

426
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,480
Gotta get some new hashtags going.

427
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,800
We gotta get that heat built back up.

428
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,680
That cone head heat.

429
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,600
I like the idea of doing foot stuff.

430
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,880
That's a great quote.

431
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,280
That's a wonderful pull quote for this episode.

432
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,680
No, I like it because we don't, I don't have any kind of fetish,

433
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,240
but I like the idea of, what's it called in Cat's Cradle?

434
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,360
The Bokonons, they touch their feet together.

435
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,640
Yeah, that's nice.

436
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
That always seemed real nice to me.

437
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:23,840
Yeah, for sure.

438
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,800
We don't do enough, we don't do enough touching of each other's feet.

439
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,640
I'm not saying I want to like kiss them or smell them

440
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,720
or squeeze them together or something like that.

441
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,600
I just touch my foot to your foot.

442
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,120
You know what the nice thing is about that?

443
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
When someone shakes your hand and they squeeze too hard,

444
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,040
there's no visible evidence.

445
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,600
There's no one watching going, hey, he squeezed too hard.

446
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,040
But if you're swinging your foot, people can watch and go,

447
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,480
oh, he was trying to dominate with that.

448
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,760
Did you see how hard he swung his foot?

449
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,680
And also, here's the situation.

450
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,520
I come up to you, Travis, we've just met.

451
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,080
I go in for the handshake, but you see my arm extend out just one degree too much

452
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,000
and you think it's a hug and you go in for the hug.

453
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
Oh shit, that's the worst moment of both of our lives.

454
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,440
If I come at you foot extended, no confusion at all.

455
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,120
No confusion at all.

456
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,560
Well, but there's awkward hopping.

457
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,160
Yeah, there's awkward hopping,

458
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:15,600
but you're not going to confuse a Bokonon foot touch, a foot kiss, with a hug.

459
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
It's just not going to happen.

460
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,120
Where does this start?

461
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,440
How do you light?

462
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
How do you become the one small candle in the darkness

463
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,760
that ignites the inferno of people touching their feet together?

464
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,400
As far as I know-

465
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,320
We're going to have to pay Viners.

466
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,680
Yeah, I don't even think it's Viners.

467
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,560
I think I write one guest post on BuzzFeed and then all of a sudden it's a thing.

468
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
Did you know that people who write shit for BuzzFeed,

469
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
it doesn't have to be real things.

470
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,520
You can breathe things into existence.

471
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,880
It is a fusion device that you can just think into and things manifest.

472
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
It's a will engine.

473
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,000
It's a fucking matter compiler.

474
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,400
You just think into it and it manifests in real life.

475
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,680
I get a job at BuzzFeed tomorrow, I write a post,

476
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,720
things you'll never believe, kiss your feet to other people's feet.

477
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,520
Make your feet kiss.

478
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
And then it's the whole craze.

479
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,080
Especially when Justin Wong's doing it.

480
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,160
Give a celebrity endorsement.

481
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,240
You'll never believe how good Kim K and Beyonce touched feet

482
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
at the premiere of Paul Blart 3.

483
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,040
Even Steve Buscemi's touching feet.

484
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah, even old Buscemi.

485
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
He said he would never touch feet with another foot.

486
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,560
But look at him now.

487
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,640
Yeah, I just, I like it.

488
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,400
And then you got that Buscemi bump.

489
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:32,880
Feels good.

490
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,720
I'm a guy that a lot of people try to hug.

491
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
And then there's no confusion now.

492
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,200
Come here, give me a foot kiss.

493
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,000
You think foot kiss?

494
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,280
That's better than touching feet.

495
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,560
Because if you say in a headline,

496
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,160
Steve Buscemi loves to touch feet,

497
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,520
that guy doesn't need that press.

498
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,640
He's a hero.

499
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,680
He's a good, good actor.

500
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
He's a good actor that was also,

501
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,160
when he heard that 9-11 happened,

502
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
he didn't rush away from the disaster.

503
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,360
He got his gear and went down to the site and got busy.

504
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,720
Got really heavy all of a sudden.

505
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,440
That sounds like a joke, I'm saying.

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah, especially my appreciation level

507
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,960
for fucking national hero, hero actor, Steve Buscemi.

508
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
And he did not want any press about it.

509
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,480
He didn't make a big deal about it.

510
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
He just did because it was his duty.

511
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,640
Yeah.

512
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,320
A lot of people don't know this.

513
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,240
You've been pronouncing his name wrong your whole life.

514
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,280
It's actually Buccemi.

515
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,760
A lot of people don't miss some things about Steve Buscemi.

516
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,440
Welcome to Buscemi, bros.

517
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,640
No, Buccemi.

518
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,480
Buccemi, bros.

519
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,440
Nope, you're still doing it wrong.

520
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:33,840
I'm sorry, one more time.

521
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,280
There's a brief, there's a coda in there, a TSL coda.

522
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,240
Buccemi.

523
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,960
You gotta really-

524
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,440
Buccemi.

525
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,160
Yeah, there you go.

526
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
Oh, like I started to say a word

527
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,560
and then halfway through changed it to a different word.

528
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,920
Yeah, Buccemi.

529
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,960
And if you gotta swallow the U, Buccemi.

530
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,760
B- I did it too hard.

531
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,200
Sorry, I did it too hard.

532
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
By the way, Steve, anytime you wanna come on the podcast,

533
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,000
have your people talk to our people.

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
We don't have to talk about your heroic work.

535
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,160
We can talk about Tree's Lounge.

536
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,720
I don't care.

537
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,640
We're here, Steve.

538
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,040
We're here.

539
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,800
We've always been here.

540
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,920
I would say hit us up on Twitter,

541
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,080
but there's no way you fucking use Twitter.

542
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
You're the coolest dude ever.

543
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,240
Read this next question.

544
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,720
How do I get my friends to play Dungeons and Dragons with me?

545
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,880
I've asked them if they wanted to play D&D before.

546
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,320
I bought the handbook and dice.

547
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,280
They all said yes.

548
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,160
I bought the stuff.

549
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,280
When I tried to arrange a session,

550
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,440
they keep coming up with excuses.

551
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,320
That's from Kieran.

552
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,200
I think it's obvious.

553
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,760
You start a D&D podcast with them?

554
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,920
No, you need to spring it on them.

555
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,120
You don't need to ambush them with good times.

556
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,640
You're saying a full-blown to catch a Dungeon Master?

557
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm saying that if you sit there and go,

558
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,440
let's play some D&D and they're like,

559
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
oh, well, I can't.

560
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,280
But if you're like, I'm going to throw a five-person party rager at my house.

561
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,240
But if they walk in their house with a bottle of Arbor Mist

562
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,360
and you say, why don't you have a seat?

563
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,280
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

564
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Have you thought about a name for your halfling cleric?

565
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,120
And they're like, I don't know what you're talking about.

566
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm just here to party.

567
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,560
You know, a lot of people don't know this,

568
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,920
but the movie The Game is actually about Sean Penn

569
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,080
trying like an elaborate plan to get his brother Michael Douglas

570
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,760
to play D&D with him.

571
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,920
At the end of the movie, there's a deleted scene

572
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,360
where he whispers in his ear like,

573
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,240
you just LARPed.

574
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,080
I just made you LARP.

575
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
This whole thing's been LARPing.

576
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
And Michael Douglas is like,

577
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,560
oh, shit, if I LARPed, I can definitely play D&D.

578
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,320
If I've crossed that threshold, roll me up a sheet, bruh.

579
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
So I had a lot of friends in Cincinnati

580
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,680
who were not necessarily like into the idea at first,

581
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,040
but then when like I got them into character creation,

582
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,320
which is for me the most fun part of D&D,

583
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
like then all they wanted to do was play.

584
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,200
You know what I mean?

585
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,080
It's harder now though,

586
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,520
because they don't have that awesome app

587
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
that just like makes the shit for you.

588
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,320
Yeah, I do miss that.

589
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,200
I miss that shit.

590
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Like joking aside, like that's how you do it.

591
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
That's how we got going.

592
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,080
That's how we got people going.

593
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,600
Like it's, that's the hook for D&D.

594
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
As soon as you get somebody to make a character,

595
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,480
that's it, they'll want to play it.

596
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
Because they really get invested in that character.

597
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,120
Right.

598
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,800
Oh, I put a lot of thought and time

599
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,040
into like their name and background and shit.

600
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,600
Like I guess maybe you could like make it for them a little bit,

601
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
but leave it open for them to change it.

602
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
Just be like, hey, I made this thing

603
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,040
because I think it'd be like what you would want to do.

604
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,120
Do you like this?

605
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,960
I drew you a guy.

606
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,680
You could be that guy.

607
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,280
If you wanted to be that guy, you could be anything.

608
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,080
The problem is it can be really intimidating

609
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,960
for first time people

610
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
because it seems like there's so much shit to learn.

611
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,120
But really like you say,

612
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,280
I want to do blank and roll a dice.

613
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,080
But like until you actually get them to sit down and do that,

614
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,800
it seems like really intimidating

615
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,960
because of all the chick tracks that tell them

616
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,760
it's of the devil.

617
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,920
I don't think that's what's scaring people off.

618
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,440
That's what's scaring people off.

619
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
I think it's that Tom Hanks movie.

620
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,240
It's probably that Tom Hanks movie.

621
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,280
That shit's fucked up.

622
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm talking about Captain Phillips.

623
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,120
This is the best way to describe D&D to people.

624
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,360
You remember pretending as a child?

625
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,080
Well, imagine one guy there had the ability to say,

626
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,960
oh, no, you don't.

627
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,120
Hey, you can't pretend that.

628
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,920
Don't pretend that.

629
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,400
How dare you?

630
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,000
Let me check my pretend book.

631
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,880
Oh, sorry, you have to roll a 10 pretend or better.

632
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Can you pretend different?

633
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,040
Can you pretend a different thing?

634
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Can you imagine better?

635
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,280
There's nothing else to pretend in this room.

636
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,640
It's time to move on.

637
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,520
Oh, no, you don't.

638
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,000
Not so fast.

639
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,960
How could you swim that?

640
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,080
You couldn't do that.

641
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
I'm going to train Charlie when she's pretending with her friends.

642
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,600
Like if one of them like swings her foam sword and is like,

643
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,320
I blasted you with my laser, my lightsaber.

644
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
I don't want to train her and just be like, no, you didn't.

645
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,160
Let me check the book.

646
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,400
Let me check the book real quick.

647
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,040
No, you didn't.

648
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,360
I just checked.

649
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
Oh, you're negative one in charisma.

650
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,560
You didn't do shit, Steve.

651
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,600
You didn't convince me anything.

652
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
That's not lava.

653
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,520
Look at it.

654
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,800
It's absolutely not lava.

655
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,840
That is definitely carpet.

656
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,120
Listen, if it was lava, yeah, I would be right there with you.

657
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah, absolutely.

658
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,640
It's not lava, though.

659
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,760
Pretend something else, please.

660
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,600
We can pretend it's hardwood.

661
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,240
It's carpet.

662
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,120
Like I could stretch.

663
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,360
I can meet you halfway.

664
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:16,160
Let's go to Mike's book.

665
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,720
Let's talk about the internet and websites.

666
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
I hate it and I wish it never existed.

667
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
What if it was easier and better and you liked it?

668
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,520
Like if all the people on it, if I could control and choose each individual person,

669
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,840
I could be like, Mark, yeah, you can be on the internet.

670
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,360
What if you could control like one itty bitty tiny corner of it?

671
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
That was all yours that only Griffin could live in.

672
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,160
That just sounds like a book.

673
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,640
But it's a book that other people can look at from all across the world.

674
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,200
AOL.

675
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay, what have we done?

676
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
Harness the power of keywords.

677
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,400
I was trying to get to Squarespace.

678
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,520
Okay, get there better.

679
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
Why do I have to be the guy who says the thing?

680
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,560
You guys say it.

681
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,520
Imagine better.

682
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,720
Imagine if you could make a page, but not just any page, a web page that people can see and click on.

683
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,920
Do you have a mouse you're trying to break in?

684
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,520
Well, if we got something to click on for you, it's called Squarespace.

685
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,920
It's an all-in-one clicking hub where people can click anywhere on it and it takes them to goods

686
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,160
and services and perhaps some entertainment.

687
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,760
This page has everything.

688
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,720
Click anywhere you want.

689
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,600
Clickity click.

Click it until you've destroyed your mouse with your clicking.

694
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,080
Click the clicking right out of your mouse, clicker.

695
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,840
Noise making device.

696
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,120
Hey, Mother Clicker.

697
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,480
Hey, Mother Clicker.

698
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,400

705
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,800
And it is beautiful.

706
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,760
Some beautiful sites I've seen from the Squarespace engine.

707
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,640
Highly clickable.

708
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,680
Highly clickable.

709
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,720
Highly clickable.

710
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,520
All the clicks.

711
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,680
Now what if you're trying to get a bunch of people to click all at the same time?

712
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,920
Three, two, nope.

713
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,160
Mark.

714
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,520
This episode I feel like has been half me yelling at imaginary people.

715
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,760
Those are my favorite episodes.

716
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,080
Okay.

717
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,400
What if I did want to get a bunch of clicks going at the same time, Travis?

718
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,520
Well, if you want to get a bunch of clicks, let me recommend Basecamp.

719
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,480
A lot of times I feel like clicking something and I don't know where to click.

720
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,840
I don't know what to click.

721
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,960
I just go to Yahoo and just start clicking anything that will have me.

722
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,800
But that's a mistake, Justin.

723
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,760
Any port in a store.

724
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,320
That's me.

725
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,320
You click on Grey's Anatomy Recap and it's like, no, I'm busy.

726
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,600
Don't click me right now, Justin.

727
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm busy.

728
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,160
I'll tell you what, Meredith and company are up to in a bit, but I'm busy right now.

729
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,240
I have to check my webmail.

730
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, Basecamp is a service that allows you to coordinate with people wherever they are.

731
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,280
That way you can all work towards a common objective, common goal.

732
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,400
No matter what your role is, no matter what your responsibilities are,

733
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,800
it lets you finish the project together easier.

734
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,600
Too often in this world you're working with people that are spread out,

735
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
not only throughout the country, but even throughout the world.

736
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,440
But Basecamp runs on the cloud and has secure servers,

737
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,480
and you don't have to mess around with anything that's too confusing.

738
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
Because let's face it, I don't know how the cloud works,

739
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,760
but Basecamp makes it easy so you don't have to worry about it.

740
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,840
And because you're a listener of My Brother and My Brother and Me,

741
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,120
you can try Basecamp absolutely free for two months.

742
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,240
And that's plenty of time to get all of your clicks out before you head off to college.

743
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
So go to basecamp.com slash my brother.

744
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,960
Also, if you go to that web address, you'll find some custom art

745
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,760
featuring a beloved My Brother and My Brother and Me character

746
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,000
and the little guy from Basecamp.

747
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,720
It's very cute.

748
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,440
It's really, really beautiful and also haunting.

749
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,520
I got a message here for Morgan Harpster, and it's from Chicago, the city that never sins.

750
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,400
For Gibbs.

751
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,040
Oh, I like yours better.

752
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
Chicago says to Morgan Harpster,

753
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,400
I know that this year has been crazy and not always in a good way,

754
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,320
but not only is the weather getting nicer,

755
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,520
but you have that great new milk addiction to spend your time on.

756
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,160
You're a great friend and a Better My Bim Bam fan,

757
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,880
and I'm sure hearing the brothers talk about you will make your day.

758
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,680
Boy, that'd be a sad state of affairs, huh?

759
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,440
Hearing us three chumps.

760
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,440
As you sip on room temperature milk.

761
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,080
Just sip on room temperature milk and you hear three chumps just whisper your name into the darkness.

762
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,720
And you feel a shiver of joy for the first time in months.

763
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,160
Do you guys-

764
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,520
Get a hot rod.

765
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,560
Do you guys ever get deep into milk?

766
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,920
You ever go for a glass of milk, maybe you don't have anything else in the fridge,

767
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,360
you have a glass of milk and you remember like, wow, this is good.

768
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,880
No, for me, I get a tall glass of that sweet cow juice

769
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,920
and I sip it down, cool, and then I say, what am I doing?

770
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,160
This is gonna make me shit my brains out later.

771
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,000
I open the fridge and look at the milk and think,

772
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,440
well, surely I didn't buy that in a reasonable amount of time from now.

773
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,960
And I always assume milk is bad.

774
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
God, you think, damn, you should pass Travis.

775
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,240
Why couldn't you have enjoyed this sweet milk?

776
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,880
Yes, why did you forget about milk until this moment?

777
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
Got a message here from Matt.

778
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,560
You know what my favorite thing about milk is?

779
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,560
When people call it moo juice and they're trying to be cool.

780
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,720
Like, you're already talking about milk.

781
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,920
You can't be cool.

782
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,760
There's nothing cool to say about milk.

783
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,120
Well, round robin it.

784
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Round robin it, we can find it.

785
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,440
Start with whoever just feels the spirit move them

786
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,080
and we each get one, another name for milk.

787
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,440
Uh, tit liquid.

788
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,120
Okay.

789
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,520
Wait, can I change it to tit squeezens?

790
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,000
No, sorry, that is better, but I'm afraid that you submitted tit liquid.

791
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,320
Hi everybody.

792
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,880
I'm tit liquid running for Republican primary.

793
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
My name is tit liquid.

794
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,160
Listen, friends, I've had a lot of great hits over the years.

795
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,920
You remember of you probably singing to your baby at night as they go off to sleep.

796
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,880
I'm tit liquid.

797
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,480
Do you like clicking on things?

798
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,360
Sure, we all do.

799
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Hey, I'm tit liquid.

800
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,840
You know, that RV of yours is looking pretty broken down.

801
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,120
Why don't you bring it on in to tit liquid's RV repair.

802
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Hey baby, I'll tell you what, tit liquid will just sing right in the tailpipe.

803
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,680
That thing be good as new.

804
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,880
When you want molasses based candies, where do you turn to?

805
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,960
Well, you go to your friend tit liquid.

806
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,360
Tit liquid has the best of molasses and sassafras and whorehound based candies

807
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,720
of this side of the Mississippi.

808
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,360
Come on down.

809
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,960
Sorry about everything.

810
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:57,920
When you need an assassin to take out a loved one, you need absolute confidentiality.

811
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,800
Who do you turn to?

812
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,320
Well, there's one name in the phone book.

813
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,360
If you look under professional assassins, that one name's tit liquid.

814
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,600
Y'all know me by my sinister calling card, which is I put a little piece of whorehound

815
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,720
candy over each of their eyeballs so they can have something to suck on

816
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,080
while they cross the river sticks.

817
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,120
It's me tit liquid.

818
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll kill your wife.

819
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,320
Please remember that if you do ask me tit liquid to kill your wife

820
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,840
and you change your mind, I am unstoppable and unreachable.

821
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,800
I am the Japanese bullet trains of assassins.

822
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,760
There is no impediment that you can put in front of me that will keep me

823
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,800
from my dark goals.

824
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,240
I'm tit liquid.

825
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,080
I'm tit liquid.

826
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,120
I'll do it for free.

827
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:35,520
Come on.

828
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I just need to quiet the darkness within.

829
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,280
Anything to feel at one emotion, no matter how fleeting.

830
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,640
Tit liquid.

831
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,280
This world is beating me down.

832
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,200
The eternal life that tit liquid has suffered is too much for me to bear

833
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,800
without the joy of killing.

834
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,160
I just need stigma to get me through this eternal bleak existence.

835
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,280
As the world's only living vampire, I tit liquid crave death

836
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,680
that I can only visit in all others and I cannot experience the sweet release

837
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,040
of that myself.

838
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,080
So if you want a vampire to kill your wife or maybe just sexually tempt her

839
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,640
in a way that she's become accustomed to from hit series,

840
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,400
such as True Blood and Forever Night, then tit liquid is your man.

841
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,000
Just be careful though.

842
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,520
Down on I-95.

843
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
Come on down on I-95.

844
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,120
Only problem is when I turn into a mist or fog or any kind of spectral form.

845
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,800
Well, I'll be damned if I don't drop all my whore around candy right there

846
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,280
on the floor.

847
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,160
Passes right through.

848
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,840
I'm tit liquid and I approve this message.

849
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,760
Got a message.

850
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,120
One more message for Matt.

851
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,320
Yeah.

852
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,080
From Cody and Lee and they say, so I bet you thought you weren't getting

853
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,560
anything.

854
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,880
We weren't going to give you anything for your birthday.

855
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Surprise.

856
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,320
We spent 100 George Washingtons to get these chuckle heads to tell the

857
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,360
literally billions of people listening how awesome you are.

858
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,600
Thanks for introducing us to NBNBAM on that Rushmore trip and enjoy listening

859
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,800
to Justin pronounce.

860
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,080
Oh, I'm going to let Justin do it.

861
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,720
Copacastance.

862
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Nope.

863
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,920
One more time.

864
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,720
Copacastance.

865
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,400
Okay.

866
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,240
Do you mean capacitance?

867
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,200
Copacastance.

868
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,560
Are you still doing your tit liquid?

869
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Okay.

870
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
My name is Tit Liquid.

871
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,480
If you and your wife have mastered the art of tango and other forbidden

872
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,560
dances, why not turn to Copacastance?

873
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,480
It's the latest craze from the Middle East and it is just burning up the

874
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
dance floors here in Alpaca.

875
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,520
Have you guys tried hummus?

876
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,200
Hi, it's me, Tit Liquid.

877
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,880
The finest purveyor of hummus this side of the Mississippi.

878
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,840
It's just some sort of crazy kind of bean gravy.

879
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,880
As your tzatziki sauce losses its zeek, as your

880
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,400
tandoori tit liquid purveyor of fine exotic sauces.

881
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,360
I can't make tits nor ass of this weird exotic goo, but I'll be damned if I

882
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,000
don't like eating it on my food.

883
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,760
Sometimes when I'm in my weaker moments, I'll dip a hot dog bun right in

884
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,840
there and just eat it clean off.

885
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,720
I don't care.

886
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,360
Tit Liquid.

887
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,560
Can we stop the episode now?

888
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,200
Can this be a 40-minute installment?

889
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,960
About Tit Liquid?

890
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,400
Are your kids having problems with math?

891
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,640
Hi.

892
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,520
I got a 700 on my SATs just in the math section.

893
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,400
Do it okay on the English too, but that's not what this commercial is about.

894
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
Hey, it's me, Tit Liquid.

895
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,600
Are you still afraid of dogs?

896
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,680
You see what I can do about that?

897
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,280
I got two real crazy ones here.

898
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,960
Hey, it's Tit Liquid.

899
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,920
I talked to Deborah.

900
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
She forgave you.

901
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,720
So we're all cool here.

902
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,080
You guys don't have to be awkward around each other anymore.

903
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,280
Thanks so much.

904
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,080
Try the hummus.

905
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,920
Are you in need of professional looking headshots for your toddler performer

906
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,000
to make her make it on the Great White Way?

907
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
Well, turn to Tit Liquid.

908
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I'm the world's leading purveyor of children photography, specifically for performers

909
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,960
trying to make it on the Great White Way.

910
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,240
You want the next Matilda?

911
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,040
You turn to Tit.

912
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,480
I'm also an amateur ghost hunter.

913
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,320
I will do it for free to maintain my amateur status.

914
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,080
I'll tell you what's a bummer, guys.

915
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,160
The name of this episode is obviously going to be Tit Liquid.

916
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,640
And people are going to see that and go, I think I'm going to skip this one.

917
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,800
They're not going to know what we've done.

918
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,840
This beloved, beloved character.

919
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,080
Right.

920
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,360
And then we're going to have Tit Liquid shirts.

921
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,120
Universal spokesman, Tit Liquid.

922
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,640
We're going to have Tit Liquid shirts out there.

923
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
And people are going to be like, I don't remember that.

924
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,040
God, I should probably just stop listening to that show.

925
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
We got to title it, like, Tit Liquid.

926
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,320
No, but really, listen to this one.

927
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,320
This is an OK one.

928
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,000
This is Biz.

929
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,880
And I'm Teresa.

930
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,280
And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

931
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Not a parenting podcast.

932
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,160
Guess what?

933
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,760
We both just had babies.

934
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Again.

935
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,520
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike on iTunes or maximumfun.org.

936
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,600
Do you guys want a yahoo?

937
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,120
Of course.

938
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:25,200
This yahoo was sent in by gamerecognizedgame, Rachel Sperling.

939
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Thank you, Rachel.

940
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,720
It's by Nicolina, who asks, how to forget a major spoiler?

941
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,200
I just waited five years of my life just to know who A is.

942
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,400
But no, I had to learn it from Facebook.

943
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,720
And just now I saw a spoiler of Prison Break.

944
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,960
And I'm just at season two.

945
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,320
A major spoiler.

946
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,480
I need to forget it.

947
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,800
I am going crazy.

948
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,560
Clearly.

949
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,800
That is, of course, referencing Pretty Little Liars.

950
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,080
And I only know that because I also got that shit spoiler for me on Facebook, which I appreciate.

951
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm never going to watch Pretty Little Liars.

952
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,480
But it's nice to possess information in case there's like a pub quiz or something.

953
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,520
Pretty Little Pub Quiz.

954
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:14,960
Now, the one thing you have to know about Pretty Little Liars is that there were some

955
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,040
spoilers circulating, but they ended up being fake.

956
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,920
They were BS.

957
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Like, they were like half true.

958
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,960
I know, I know.

959
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,240
So it was kind of a hoax.

960
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,680
So you can keep telling yourself that and see if you're right.

961
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,880
Obviously, Eternal Sunshine and the Spotless Mind, that was a sci-fi movie.

962
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,920
A sci-fi thriller.

963
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,800
I thought it was more of a romantic comedy myself.

964
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,720
Well, how can you forget?

965
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,520
If you see, you're flipping through Facebook and you see Pretty Little Liars, the A has

966
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,000
been crag this whole time.

967
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,040
Ah, no.

968
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,880
If you just look at like eight other things really quickly, will it push it out of your

969
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,120
short term?

970
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,840
This is what I'm saying.

971
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,880
You can't remove it.

972
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,120
So what you have to do is dilute it.

973
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,440
You need to just begin consuming information at a voracious, unsustainable rate.

974
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah.

975
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,880
Pretty Little Liars centric information?

976
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
No, no, you got to get away from that.

977
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,200
Get away from it.

978
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,400
I'm saying as far away from that.

979
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,000
Like go pick up a Big John's bathroom reader and just start slamming it.

980
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Just start cramming it like you're-

981
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,840
Almost to a point where like you're not even like taking it in consciously anymore.

982
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,160
Like you've got a test on Big John's bathroom reader in a half hour and you got to cram

983
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,960
it right now.

984
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,080
So that later when someone's like, who is A in Pretty Little Liars?

985
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,960
And you're just like, Abraham Lincoln had 11 toes and you can't even remember because

986
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,560
you have so much static going on.

987
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
He did have 11 toes, by the way.

988
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,560
That's why he was so honest.

989
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:44,960
Is that-

990
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,520
Well, those two don't seem related.

991
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,560
And I know this is one of those things that you're lying about.

992
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,080
But are you lying about this?

993
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,880
No, I'm not.

994
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,440
Are you sure?

995
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,400
I am definitely lying about this.

996
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,520
You are the worst.

997
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,520
You really have me going.

998
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,240
How to forget a major sp-

999
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,760
Like I've heard some-

1000
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,960
We've all heard some stuff and it's a bummer for me now.

1001
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,360
We're watching Old Seasons Survivor and I feel like I know all the winners.

1002
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,560
And I don't even know how.

1003
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,640
It's just I think I got it through osmosis.

1004
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:15,600
Yeah.

1005
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,040
There's a lot of that.

1006
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,360
I call it cultural osmosis because there's lots of movies that I've never seen before.

1007
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,240
But I know exactly what happens in that movie.

1008
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,600
You know what I mean?

1009
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,120
Like I only recently watched Terminator 1 for the first time like two months ago.

1010
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,960
But I knew everything that happened in that movie because it's been referenced in everything

1011
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,400
and talked about on everything.

1012
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:36,640
I-

1013
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,360
What's the-

1014
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,640
What's the statute of limit?

1015
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,680
Not to turn the question on its ear, but what's the statute of limitations?

1016
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,120
Like can I talk about Lost now in an open and honest way?

1017
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,440
Well, according to the internet, it's like 35 seconds.

1018
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,680
Like Game of Thrones.

1019
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,280
Gollum died.

1020
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,880
Get it out there quick!

1021
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,360
Publish it!

1022
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,840
Get it out there!

1023
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,960
Get it out there quick!

1024
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,840
Every second we spend not writing about how Gollum just died on Game of Thrones is-

1025
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,200
We're gonna be last!

1026
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,240
We're gonna be last!

1027
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:06,880
Get it up!

1028
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:07,760
Get it up!

1029
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,320
But seriously, no Game of Thrones spoilers.

1030
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,000
I- I'm- I just started.

1031
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,360
I'm on episode two.

1032
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:13,680
Oh.

1033
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,440
Don't say anything.

1034
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,320
Well, Gandalf?

1035
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,080
You know Ga- You know Gandalf?

1036
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,680
Yeah, he's my favorite character.

1037
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,560
Yeah, guess what?

1038
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,440
What?

1039
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,800
He's actually a big pile of rocks.

1040
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,840
And do you know about Zelda?

1041
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:32,880
Yeah?

1042
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,400
She's Gandalf.

1043
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,560
Oh, twist!

1044
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,720
Are you enjoying the character of Arthax?

1045
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,840
The horse?

1046
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,320
Well, sorry, he's gonna sink into the Swarm of Sadness as the trio looks on.

1047
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,680
What?

1048
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,080
Sorry.

1049
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,600
But Jedd Stark?

1050
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:52,880
Uh-huh.

1051
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,160
He's actually Ned Stark.

1052
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,320
He's actually alive.

1053
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,560
You've been mishearing his name the entire time.

1054
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,200
This whole time.

1055
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,880
He's A.

1056
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,240
I turned on subtitles.

1057
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,200
He's A?

1058
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,160
Ned Stark is A.

1059
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,320
Okay, the big reveal of season six of Game of Thrones is Game of Thrones is what ties

1060
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,160
all other TV shows together.

1061
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,240
All other mediums together.

1062
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,040
Hi, my name is Zelda, and this is-

1063
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
This is my friend Tit Lickly.

1064
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,200
This is Tit- Hi, I'm Zelda, and this is Bart Simpson.

1065
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,240
Cowabunga, dude.

1066
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,600
That's right, Dumbledore.

1067
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,960
Welcome to my Star Wars.

1068
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,240
Come on inside.

1069
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:37,600
We've got a- We've got a real elo and stitch- I'm just saying shit.

1070
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,920
Welcome to the Shining Time Station, bitch.

1071
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,040
It's on.

1072
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,560
Was that the OC meets Cross Shining Time Station?

1073
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,160
I'm Ringo Starr and also George Carlin.

1074
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,120
No one can decide which of us is more improbable as the conductor of Shining Time Station.

1075
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:59,120
And apparently people live inside the jukebox and we didn't think that'd be scarring for

1076
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,520
children, but Travis still has nightmares about it.

1077
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,040
No one else is in that jukebox?

1078
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,640
Seventeen Candles.

1079
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,320
The movie.

1080
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,320
The sequel to Sixteen Candles.

1081
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,080
Ah, shit, you're right, Trav.

1082
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,600
One too many candelinos.

1083
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,440
One to grow on.

1084
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,800
One to grow on.

1085
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,840
It's a sequel.

1086
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,080
All your favorite characters are still in it, though.

1087
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:27,120
You know, Hank from Breaking Bad, Malcolm in the Middle.

1088
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,040
Malcolm in the Middle's in there.

1089
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,920
Before we end the show, I wanted to share something with you guys real quick.

1090
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,480
We've been sleep training our daughter, trying to get her to sleep better, and Sydney sent

1091
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,480
me a link to a book on Amazon while I've been here in New York trying to make it on the

1092
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,640
Great White Way, and it's called The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep, A New Way of Getting

1093
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,640
Children to Sleep, and she said, I ordered it.

1094
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,160
It looks really good, and you should read the reviews.

1095
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,040
I'm like, yeah, okay.

1096
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
She's like, no, trust me.

1097
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,960
Read all the reviews.

1098
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,200
So this is a book about, like, you basically read it, and it's supposed to, like, lull

1099
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,560
your child to sleep with its tempo and words and everything.

1100
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:16,720
And there is one one-star review on the book from a Josie who says, in all caps,

1101
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,520
it's just something like hypnotism, and hypnotism is just a deep meditation.

1102
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
That is the title of this review.

1103
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,320
Be careful.

1104
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:31,120
It's just something like hypnotism, and hypnotism is just a deep meditation, which is linked

1105
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,320
to evil spirits, which is anti-Christ.

1106
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,520
Do not put your kids into this Satan's hand, please!

1107
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,880
Exclamation point.

1108
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,600
That is their review of The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep, A New Way of Getting Children

1109
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,160
to Sleep.

1110
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:54,400
So you're saying this book, when you wield it, you can be like, hippity-hoppity, hippity-hoppity,

1111
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,400
watch the rabbit go.

1112
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,680
Okay, she's asleep.

1113
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,600
Steal and take drugs.

1114
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,880
Steal and take drugs.

1115
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,440
Cauti baracta onictos.

1116
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,640
Play D&D.

1117
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,160
All that shit, but also, steal drugs, bring them back to Daddy.

1118
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,280
Find out where to get the drugs.

1119
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,440
Daddy does not know where to get them no longer.

1120
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,920
Agent Baby, I need you to get these drugs.

1121
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,440
Activate the Manchurian, baby, to score me some weed.

1122
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,160
Uh, folks, we're gonna close up shop, because Justin's hotel on the Great White Way was

1123
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:33,520
built before electricity and broadband signals, apparently, and I think he's completely gone.

1124
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,020
Justin?

1125
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,060
Test?

1126
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,600
Yeah, I mean, I'm completely here.

1127
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,200
Fort- Niner, Niner, Niner.

1128
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,680
Sewer Shark.

1129
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,600
Uh, so we're gonna shut this shit down.

1130
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,560
Thank you for listening.

1131
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,880
Um, Justin, see, that's the problem, Justin.

1132
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,560
I don't know what you do here at the back end.

1133
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,360
I usually get out my 3DS and play Pokémon.

1134
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,120
Well, I can say that, uh, the big announcement, we've talked about it before, we'll make

1135
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,360
sure nobody misses their chance to see us, uh, we're performing at the Los Angeles

1136
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,320
Podcast Festival.

1137
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,600
Uh, it's our first time there.

1138
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,240
We're really excited.

1139
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,200
We're doing both My Brother, My Brother and Me and the Adventure Zone.

1140
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,760
It'll be the first ever and possibly only live Adventure Zone, depending on how it goes.

1141
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,260
Bad!

1142
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,720
And if you'd like to watch it, well, it might go bad.

1143
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,400
I don't know, but isn't that worth watching?

1144
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,640
Um, the best thing is, even if you're not gonna be in Los Angeles, you can watch it

1145
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,080
from anywhere in the world.

1146
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:27,840
If you go to LAPodfest.com and click on Live Streaming, you can, for just $20, if you use

1147
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,800

00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,000
You can watch the whole weekend, and I think it's archived for, like, a month.

1150
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,560
There's gonna be a lot of amazing shows there, um, and you get to watch them all for just

1151
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,200
$20, coupon code ZONE and BROTHER.

We need it bad.

1155
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,920
Need it bad.

1156
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
We also have some live shows coming up next calendar week.

1157
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:01,200
We're gonna be in Portland, uh, on Friday we're gonna be in Seattle, on Saturday we're

1158
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,960
gonna be in Vancouver on Sunday.

1159
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,480
Now Portland, listen up.

1160
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,320
This is not a test.

1161
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:12,000
Portland people, if you're listening to this, um, on Thursday, do we know the exact time?

1162
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,040
I'm looking right now.

1163
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,280
Okay.

1164
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,120
I think it's noon Pacific Standard Time.

1165
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:19,040
Well, look that shit up for sure, cause I'm not gonna screw over our people here.

1166
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:23,360
Uh, we're gonna open up a few tickets in, in Portland.

1167
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,600
Uh, we're actually gonna open up a few more tickets in Seattle and Vancouver as well.

1168
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:33,360
Um, but Portland has been sold out for months, and if you live there and are bummed, this

1169
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,320
will be a chance, this will be a chance to get a ticket.

1170
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,720
Uh...

1171
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:37,680
Now here's the thing.

1172
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,680
It is noon on Thursday.

1173
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,840
We've had some issues before of, like, them going up a couple minutes before, a couple

1174
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,400
minutes after.

1175
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,600
We don't have any control of it.

1176
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,440
So I would say start looking at, like, 11.

1177
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,640
And, like, this, this is straight up, like, I, I don't wanna give anybody false hope.

1178
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,720
This is, like, golden ticket level, um, availability.

1179
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,640
Uh, there, there are not that many.

1180
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,400
But, uh, you, you'll have your chance.

1181
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,560
It's bit.ly forward slash...

1182
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,320
God, it's been so long since we've had tickets.

1183
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,200
I don't remember the link.

1184
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,960
I think it's NBAA in Portland, isn't it?

1185
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,360
Yeah, the link is bit.ly forward slash NBAA in Portland.

1186
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:13,200
Um, so, so look that up.

1187
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:14,880
Are you sure about the time?

1188
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,240
Yes.

1189
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,240
Thursday, noon Pacific.

1190
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,280
Correct.

1191
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,760
Go place some tickets.

1192
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,840
Start checking minutes before.

1193
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,280
If you live in Seattle or Vancouver, there's still tickets available for you, you guys.

1194
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,440
Uh, it's bit.ly forward slash NBAA in Seattle and bit.ly forward slash van NBAA in.

1195
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,640
Um...

1196
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,240
We wanna say thank you to everybody who's been sending us awesome shit through the P.O.

1197
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:36,880
boxes.

1198
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,120
We got a box of stuff from Stephanie, uh, who got us each, like, personalized thing.

1199
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,440
Griffin got you an awesome, like, Griffin-themed T-shirt that you're gonna dig.

1200
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,080
I'll bring that with me to the live show.

1201
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:46,580
Yay!

1202
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,160
Justin, some, um, some Margaritaville merchandise.

1203
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:53,840
Uh, it's pretty sweet.

1204
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,480
Excellent.

1205
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,080
And got me some nail wraps and, uh, a nail, uh, wrap humidor.

1206
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,320
Um, along with some other really fun stuff that I'll bring and distribute out to everybody.

1207
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,120
Uh, Juice, have we gotten anything in the...

1208
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,480
Yeah, I wanted to thank, uh, Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder, sent me some Seafoam candy and

1209
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,600
a horse candy dish, which is just beautiful.

1210
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,800
And, uh, a company called Amoretti sent some coffee syrups that I've been using to make

1211
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,680
cocktails.

1212
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,040
Check out P.O. Box here in Austin.

1213
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,480
I feel like I'm missing the wave.

1214
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,280
You should, man.

1215
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:25,840
It's awesome.

1216
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,480
It's Southern.

1217
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,440
You can be the Southern HQ.

1218
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,480
I like presents.

1219
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,120
That way, when presents come for you guys, I can just throw them right in the trash.

1220
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,080
Or into your mouth.

1221
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,280
If it's Seafoam candy.

1222
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,880
Delicious candy.

1223
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:43,920
If you want to send something to the West Coast HQ, uh, you can send it to P.O. Box 341769,

1224
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,040

1225
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,320
Or you can send it to the East Coast HQ, which is Justin.

1226

P.O. Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia 25706.

1227
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,080
Uh, significant value baubles only, please.

1228
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,160
Um, if you want a message in the Money Zone, go to MaximumFun.org slash Jumbotron.

1229
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:06,960
Uh, be aware there's kind of a backup, kind of a queue, as they would say, in the aisles.

1230
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,840
Um, but, uh, go there and get a message on the show.

1231
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,240
Uh, and go listen to all the other MaxFun shows.

1232
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,520
There's new MaxFun shows.

1233
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,000
If you've been listening to the network for a while, go check them out.

1234
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,080
There's We Got This, starring Hal Lublin and Mark Gagliardi.

1235
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,360
Uh, Travis produces a new podcast called Can I Pet Your Dog?

1236
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,520
Um, there's, there's a lot of stuff.

1237
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:25,760
And-

1238
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:30,720
And if you're a fan of Lin's, Lin Manuel Miranda, friend of the show, he's on the first episode

1239
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,800
of Can I Pet Your Dog, talking about his dog, Toby.

1240
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:33,920
And it's wonderful.

1241
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,200
His dog is adorable.

1242
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:41,120
The news just dropped that, uh, our buddy Lin's doing a new, uh, uh, Disney flick.

1243
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:41,600
Yeah.

1244
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,240
That's crazy.

1245
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:42,720
Yeah, you know-

1246
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,560
And they're recording the Hamilton album.

1247
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,040
And Hamilton is basically the greatest show anyone's ever seen.

1248
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,640
He's going places and he's the best dude.

1249
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:55,600
But you guys realize we are now going to be one degree away from Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

1250
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,360
Dwayne the Rock Johnson.

1251
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,400
Listen, Lin, if you're listening, it is your job

1252
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,920
to put earbuds into his head and play My Brother, My Brother, Me for him.

1253
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,640
It's going to be tough.

1254
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,920
He's a big, strong man.

1255
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,880
You are going to have to climb him Shadow of the Colossus style.

1256
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,520
Guys, guys, I just had the best idea.

1257
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,160
Okay.

1258
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,800
We need to do an episode specifically-

1259
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,120
It'll start out with us like, no, don't take him out.

1260
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,320
Dwayne, listen, Dwayne, listen.

1261
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,960
Listen, this is a genius idea.

1262
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,440
This is a show, an episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me, a full hour,

1263
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,960
specifically targeted at Dwayne the Rock Johnson and his illustrious career

1264
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,080
and really getting him like deep into the show.

1265
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,800
Yeah, don't panic.

1266
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,560
Don't panic, Dwayne.

1267
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,680
This feels uncomfortable.

1268
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:45,040
The point will be we get Lin to plug him in to his cavernous ears

1269
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,440
while he's sleeping on set, right?

1270
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,240
Maybe taking a nap.

1271
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,720
So maybe we come in soft like, Dwayne.

1272
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,920
Dwayne, wake up.

1273
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,840
Dwayne, you're fine.

1274
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,520
Don't take the headphones off, Dwayne.

1275
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,440
We live inside you now.

1276
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,040
Dwayne, we interspaced in you.

1277
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,720
We got lost because there's a lot.

1278
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,360
There's a lot to explore, Dwayne.

1279
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,880
We need you to sneeze, Dwayne.

1280
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,520
We know you've never sneezed before in your life.

1281
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:08,480
We read it on your Wikipedia page.

1282
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,680
But first, first, do you like ghost jokes?

1283
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,680
Dwayne, we've made an episode just for you.

1284
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,680
This is going to be great.

1285
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,440
It's going to be probably our best episode since the Totino's episode ever.

1286
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,880
Thanks to John Roderick also in the Longwinter Reviews for a theme song.

1287
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,880
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1288
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,160
It's a great album.

1289
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,800
I saw somebody got recommended that album on Spotify.

1290
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,000
Keep up the good work, Spotify.

1291
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,040
You're doing it good, but don't stream it.

1292
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,600
Buy the album.

1293
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,280
Forget you, Spotify.

1294
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,840
Buy the album.

1295
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,720
If you haven't yet, go to our YouTube channel.

1296
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,640
Just search MBMBAM.

1297
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,240
We have lots of like animated shorts and shareable shorts.

1298
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,160
I'll probably put Titliquid on there.

1299
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,560
It's made me very happy and I'm probably going to turn that into a short.

1300
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,440
That's a good IP.

1301
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,480
Let's shut her down.

1302
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:53,680
Yeah, we're done.

1303
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,560
Let's find out who was sent in by level 9,000.

He's anonymous.

1308
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:02,880
We're going to call him Dwayne.

1309
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,600
Who asks?

1310
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,680
Why Shrek is green?

1311
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,920

This is Griffin.

1321
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,600
Real quick, I just have a couple things to mention that we forgot to talk about when

1322
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,200
we were recording the show this week.

1323
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,080
First of all, if you're going to be at the Pacific Northwest shows, the Portland, Seattle,

We definitely need questions for those shows still, so send those emails in, and we'll

1327
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,120
read them on stage.

1328
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:09,360
Second thing, a listener named Zach has organized a MBMBAM Game Jam for us, where over the course

1329
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,480
of two weeks, people are going to be able to make their own games based on bits from

1330
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,120
the show.

1331
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,000
It sounds really exciting.

1332
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,720
It sounds really cool.

1333
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:23,280
You can find more information about that at MBMJAM.com, so MBMJAM.

The federal government has millions of dollars in programs and opportunities that you need

1339
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,560
to seize today.

1340
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,080
You're a taxpayer, right?

1341
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,680
Well, then you've got it coming.

1342
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,840
Thanks to Uncle Sam, you can learn to get grants for education.
