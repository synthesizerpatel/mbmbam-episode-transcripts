1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:08,000
I got a soundboard yeah so that's gonna be a new thing that the ruins or maybe

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,000
finalizes the sort of concept of this show okay you know people have said what what i wish

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,600
i wish that my brother my brother and me was more like an early 2000s like morning drive

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:30,320
to a radio show and we have the pest in there too now oh that's a lot of the pest i would love

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,680
i would actually prefer these to be like short sort of uh yelps or barks and not extended clips

13
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,640
of the past not the entirety of not the entirety of that you don't have a button map to the entirety

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,200
of the pest i'm hoping okay okay so you do have a button map to the entirety of yeah that's the

15
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
entirety of the pest just for that and what did you when you knew a newer program by the way

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,120
special thanks to roman marsden and i'm pretending visible for sabotaging our show by showing justin

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,080
how to do this um i'm assuming that's where you gleaned this particular yeah yeah when you were

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,640
programming in your board and you put in the entirety of the pest intro the hit john leguizamo

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,880
feature film um what did you think the use case for that was going to be like what did you think

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,520
was going to be the time of the show like if we started talking about it and i could just like

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,320
start playing it but then wow that's remember to stop playing it isn't it justin an order boris

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,360
yeah where it's like you started playing it so that we would talk about the enter and then

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,840
you're like oh the intro you mean this so it's kind of like a john leguizamo causal loop is what

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,600
you've established now i did put inspired by you last night griffin i did put something on here

25
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,640
that i kind of thought you would oh please talk about please i thought you would talk about it

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,880
what okay do you want the intro or no intro just hit no no intro i put my hand inside a toilet

27
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,960
oh thank you justin what

28
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:20,640
yeah you you heard it maybe one more i put my hand inside a toilet oh it's so good what is this

29
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,280
i mean this show is going to be please just explain i'm going to stop it now explain to

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
travis what he's just heard i mean i don't think it's the kind of thing that plays just by hearing

31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
it but it made me personally very happy there's a company called brainpower media that makes a

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
bunch of really great films as far as i can tell including best friend from heaven in which chris

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,840
christopherson voices a dog who dies but then comes back from the dead to help his owners plan

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,640
a wedding um and then there's a movie called a witch's ball in which a man gets on stage and

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,480
sings a beautiful song about how he put his hand inside a toilet and so all of that is yeah like

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,160
that like that what does it sound like because i was talking over i put my hand inside a toilet

37
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,400
yes so that's the song i put me okay and then stop it because it's so loud it's very loud

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,640
and uh this show's not going to be a thing people can consume for entertainment anymore

39
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,280
i think maybe like it's becoming more avant-garde in a way which maybe more experimental yeah so

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
maybe we'll get talked talked about on all the big art blogs every frame of painting is going

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,640
to come out of retirement i don't know much about the beatles but this is probably like our revolver

42
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,240
or our sergeant pepper period the macros have changed what it means to podcast because podcasting

43
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,080
used to be a thing that people could enjoy yeah and it is yeah no the macroy brothers are

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,000
challenging you to just try to enjoy their show just try it and it's a lot like revolver in that

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,520
it feels like we are trying to shoot our listeners ears off with like a gun made of bad audio like a

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,440
bad audio experience so a love gun made of bad audio just to tie back in the kiss connection

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,000
so maybe we put the soundboard inside a toilet uh-huh okay and flush it down to sewer hell

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:19,440
so we kind of want to do some old school my bim bam without the soundboard yeah we got a lot of

49
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:28,000
stuff for you tonight you don't mind if we go way back to old school kids do you okay so there is

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
some now i get and now i'm starting to turn around on the soundboard because there is some topical

51
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,040
stuff on there so topical humor yeah okay i'm done well oh you must adjust in your elbow

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,960
i brushed a button on there okay so i'm gonna need you to set the soundboard that was a lot of fart

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,400
noise what's sad justin now we've used up all our whole fart noise budget i don't know how we're

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840
gonna get through a show yeah we actually have to dip into our 2018 fart noise budget uh so this is

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
my brother my brother and me we it's advice show for the modern era uh we're kind of out of the

56
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,440
advice thing and more sort of focused on this soundboard currently so uh but we're definitely

57
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,680
gonna to help some people because that's what we're here before we started to think griffin

58
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,760
did you want to share your you had an idea for the next year slogan that i really liked yes i got a

59
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:25,760
letter in the mail uh and the letter in the mail had a suggestion for a slogan for 2018 and i wanted

60
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,520
to pitch it here i feel good about enough about this one by the way that i am i'm almost ready

61
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
to forego the usual pitch sesh we should talk about it we should you're right we should talk

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
about it but it's something to stew on because i don't know if it's the healthiest i'm all about

63
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:50,000
the health anyway uh landon and justin suggested 20 slates clean 20 slates clean and now let's

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,840
talk about it because i worry the possessive i worry i'm not sure we need that 20 slate clean

65
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,080
could be good i worry that people are going to think that we are there have been a lot of full

66
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,480
blown creeps and freaks creepazoids and freakazoids been coming out of the woodworks this year

67
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,680
and i don't want 20 slate clean to sound like we are um we are we are forgiving and forgetting

68
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,640
in any way but i worry that people could interpret 20 slate clean to mean that i just ah yes

69
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,680
i know our freakazoids we're still down we're so happy to have you on the show creepazoids

70
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,600
you're right creepazoids to the back please you know what creepazoids please go ahead and go

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,400
you can go ahead and go you're excused get the fuck out now freakazoids don't you move a muscle

72
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,000
yeah because y'all are here y'all are here with us scoot up it's got that jam on it and it's got

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,680
the nasty jam that you like freakazoids um but i think i'm also not sure about 20 slate clean

74
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,480
because i don't know that i want to uh establish a motto that is as sort of centered around like

75
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:10,480
boy this was a bad year next year's the one because i feel like maybe we thought 2016 was

76
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:19,200
like oh boy well at least 2016's over and then 2017 was sort of a bad sequel in a way you know

77
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,040
what i mean so i don't want to be like leave it behind i want it to be like fucking mount like

78
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:33,440
regulators mount up what what's so messed up is that it turned out that 2017 what turned out to

79
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,080
be 2013 dig it up yeah so like we just got the year off by like three years this year we dug

80
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,120
up a lot of dirt we there's a lot of dirty dirt just when you thought you'd hit bedrock you'd

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,640
hit it again and it was just more hard crumbly dirt yeah you thought it was bedrock but it was

82
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,840
actually new kinds of terrible dirt just that hadn't even been invented yet so i like the

83
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,880
phonetically 20 slate clean it sounds great i just don't know i i don't want to i'm not settled on

84
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,480
it because i don't know that it's necessarily yeah i was taking it more of like a personal

85
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
starting fresh you know not like forgive and forget but for yourself like allow yourself

86
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,760
this period of phoenix like but that's a good year titled should not need a uh a parenthetical

87
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:29,520
yeah all of us have had parenthetical and also 20 serpentine zag on them uh that was a sub

88
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:37,200
2013 dig it up like that was a subtitle to him to increase the power of it not to codify

89
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,960
that it doesn't apply it also i don't want a fresh start for everybody because i feel like

90
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,400
if one good thing came out of 2017 is that we got fucking hard like we got you you had to get

91
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,240
hard to get through 2017 and i'm not i'm not ready to get i it would be bad for us to give

92
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
up that chitin that we've developed after the waves of fucking garbage have crashed against our

93
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,040
shores for you know two calendar years now i i i feel like tough something about like

94
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,320
just fucking polish that armor we need a rhyme that rhymes with like something that represents

95
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,400
no surrender like 20 20 20 blade 20 blade teen and it's just like get

96
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:31,520
strapped with a big sharp sword maybe this is maybe this is the year that we all become

97
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,880
sword people listen we got another we're still in the candlelight spirit we do not we have plenty

98
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,400
of time to think about what the theme for next year is going to be true true there's probably

99
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,160
something with skating we just have to figure it out um skating uh but uh right now we're

100
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,440
going to get into the questions uh and i have to use the bathroom over here oh well how are we

101
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
going to do the questions if and could you at least press some buttons on the soundboard to

102
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:03,520
uh he's gone on griffin we should just uh pitch other like subtitles and let people come up with

103
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:12,560
the rhymes for us like i like mount up mount up if we mount up makes me psyched right if we can

110
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,880
unstoppable like a freight like a freight train let's do some questions so a few days ago right

111
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,480
after my parents had gotten home from what i don't know we're in media res uh two guys in a

112
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,360
truck drove to up to our house and asked us if our neighbors christmas lights were public i didn't

113
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
think much of it at first but my mother's convinced this is a tactic they were using to scout our

114
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,080
house after thinking about it i myself also now believe we are going to be burgled are we that's

115
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:46,800
from worried in west virginia what on god's green earth does that mean okay so as i understand that

116
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:55,520
okay so this is based on my uh annual watching of um the american scream which is the the movie

117
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,120
about uh it's a documentary about people who decorate their houses for halloween it's extremely

118
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,920
good if you have not seen it it's extremely good it's maybe the best halloween movie right behind

119
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,560
a witch's ball but but one of the characters in there does a map of christmas lights sorry halloween

120
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,160
decorations in the area and so he goes and asks people like is it okay if they have a big display

121
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,960
he adds them to this map but he asked them like for permission before he adds them to the halloween

122
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,720
lights map the halloween decoration map right i do like the idea of halloween like yeah it's

123
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,240
beautiful um like just beautiful black lights um everybody walks down the street like going jogging

124
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,880
it's like is that come i see it in the halloween black lights okay good just but what i what i'm

125
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,840
saying is that he is suggesting like is it it is a wild distinction to make but is is it is your

126
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:53,120
light for you can i look at these can i look at these bad boys but he's asking that these these

127
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,120
these two people are asking a neighbor like hey do you think it's cool if we add your neighbors

128
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,120
well who better they can't approach the house travis with the christmas lights on it without

129
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
looking at the ding dang thing and they're not they don't want to do that if it's not for public

130
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,840
and what are you hey you get away from here this is for my kids what they what they're asking is

131
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,360
when you look at your neighbor's christmas lights how do they react yeah do they shoo you away and

132
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,760
throw a big sheet over it it's not for you it's for little dylan to make his christmas magical

133
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,960
you're using up all the magic with your foul eyes do you guys ever think about when you watch home

the damn traps and then that's that's it that's all there is to it it's like facetime kevin from

142
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:30,320
france or wherever and you're just like hey sorry we left you there you cool all right bye um be

143
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:37,840
cool kid so i mean the alternative is that they were casing the joint oh absolutely you gotta

144
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:45,520
be constantly every time the the fedex comes and delivers my blue apron box i know they're also

145
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,400
like as long as i'm here i'm gonna see where the valuables are which is why i'm always every time

146
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,640
anybody steps near my house i gotta rearrange where my valuables are and i gotta rearrange

147
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,720
where all the traps are yep so annoying and it's so annoying because i don't remember where the

148
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,200
damn traps are and i gotta send rachel the map and then you know henry's play zone i sometimes

149
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,840
a trap ends up there and we have to figure that out and it gets very complicated because he loves

150
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,800
the traps because they look very fun like fun toys uh one of them is made out of a balloon but the

151
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:21,600
balloon's full of horrible you know human dissolving acid um and so we gotta balloon

152
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,160
preserving human dissolving gas right and so we have humans and balloons are made out of different

153
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,440
stuff just yeah read one book and so gotta remember which ones are the death balloons

154
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,560
and which ones are fun balloons for babies let's see here's the thing griffin people will say that

155
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,760
you're being too cautious but you've never been robbed so never been robbed because of all my

156
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,880
they i put up a sign also in front of my house that says great traps inside move them around

157
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,440
constantly so don't even try bother to case the joint kevin pesci i feel like occam's razor if

158
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:02,160
they were casing um houses they would probably come up with a a patter that is less uh baffling

159
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,920
they would probably have sort of a straight line like do you need us to clean your gutters or

160
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,480
something that is not like inventing this whole idea of public christmas or like hey here's a

161
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,720
here's your blue apron box and you say thanks you take it inside you set down in the kitchen

162
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,200
you go to use the john or the lou and then joe pesci pops out of the blue apron box steals all

163
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,680
of your things where'd my xbox one go damn it joe and also where's all my pre-portioned ingredients

164
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:39,360
i can use to make home-cooked meals damn it i got double robbed i don't have an xbox to play

165
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,400
crash bandicoot and all of my food from the blue aprons gone what am i gonna make sure what am i

166
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,520
gonna eat when i don't play crash bandicoot you gotta make sure that your blue apron box does not

167
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,640
contain any live joe pesci's every time i get a blue apron box i run my sword through it you got

168
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,520
yeah just to make sure because he's gonna eat all your ding dang fresh cilantro first yeah and that's

169
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,600
irritating you gotta go to sort of replace that daniel stern don't even take the food out he just

170
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,840
rubs his nasty body all over it and so you don't you're like my xbox is gone but at least my food's

171
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,200
here cook it up yum yum eat it wait a minute this tastes like daniel stern's nasty body shit

172
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:24,000
daniel stern's hair post the events of home alone one is is i think oh i just thought about tasting

173
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,920
daniel stern's hair i just thought about getting a big mouthful of that dude's head and i oh gosh

174
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,440
blue apron almost never has daniel stern's hair stern's hair in it almost never that's a blue

175
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,200
apron almost guarantee statistically speaking i've never gotten daniel stern's hair in my

176
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,640
in my blue apron box right down the box 99.999999% free of daniel stern's hair now we do want to be

177
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,120
clear it's mostly for blue apron we're not talking about a single strand of blue of of

178
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,240
daniel stern's hair it's a lot of it would be a lot of hair to get it to register on the on the

179
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:10,000
their sensors it needs to be a considerable amount of that warning on there but then one box showed

180
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,840
up just completely full of nothing but daniel stern's hair if you're portioning out goat cheese

181
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,880
you gotta assume some of daniel stern's hair it's gonna get in there i mean that's just

182
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:28,240
the reality of everything like everything you buy from the store uh when you get a soda mcdonald's

183
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:36,400
peanut butter all of it has some amount stern take a deep breath there's some daniel stern in there

184
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,120
right i think it was carl sagan who said we are all made of stern stuff yes

185
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,880
how about a yahoo i'd love that i'd love that it felt like we had reached the logical conclusion

186
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
of the daniel stern jokes abigail love it sent this one and thank you abigail to yahoo answers

187
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,400
user conquer the king who asked can i just say just a side note it always makes you really happy

188
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,720
when there's a new name of someone who likes senate like i don't think i've ever heard abigail's name

189
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,760
before and it's nice to know that there's like new yahoo soldiers listen i'm very thankful for

190
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,320
the great yahoo's that everybody sends in week to week and i hope nobody takes takes the uh recurring

191
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,800
people it's a who send them in like getting on the show all the time it is an art form it is an art

192
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,880
form to find these uh trash bags but not just trash bags trash bags that perfectly sort of fit

193
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,200
the the tone and nature of our show but abigail love it has done some great work here because

194
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:42,160
conquer the king asks why is paul mccartney stingy by stingy i mean why is he so greedy

195
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,360
with his music to the point that he isn't letting people play the beatles songs on youtube i know

196
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,760
he has a right to his music just like all artists however being that the songs are a beloved classic

197
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,640
that is over 40 years old he shouldn't be greedy that people love his music so much they are willing

198
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,160
to want to listen to it yeah he should be like other artists do which is be grateful that people

199
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:09,520
listen to his music and stop being so stingy paul mccartney yeah and this is not something i believe

200
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,920
and i need to go ahead and say that out loud because the streaming music industry has pretty

201
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,920
much decimated the music industry as far as i understand it and that's no good and people

202
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,840
artists are completely entitled to receiving compensation for the hard work that they do

203
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,680
and pay an artist quit expecting them to do everything for free but i i don't know why paul

204
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:40,560
mccartney won't let the great beatles music be on youtube let it be you know just let it be you

205
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,080
know eight days a week let me listen to it help i'm not i'm not saying all artists i have a problem

206
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:54,800
with them just paul mccartney just paul mccartney is every time excuse me i you try to hide it right

207
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,560
and it's like here's a fun clip of my family barbecue but really paperback writers in there

208
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:08,000
and paul mccartney somehow no matter how hard you try to bury the beatles music his music

209
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,840
these are my songs he knows and at this point it's just like paul can't you just be happy that

210
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,880
people like like what are you trying to do make money off of your music the songs are so old paul

211
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,880
and beloved people like them isn't that enough for you can you use that they're so old paul come

212
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,280
paul's just like paul's just sitting on his throne made of money and i'm trying to listen to these

213
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:43,920
i can't stress this enough super old songs you're lucky that i'm even listening to your old music

214
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:50,320
because i should be listening to new hot top 40 jams but instead i'm listening to your ancient

215
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:58,640
scrawlings paul it was record that was recorded with like a bird pecking on stone oh yeah i know

216
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,120
and and and like edison thomas edison like looked up from the you know gramophone and gave him a

217
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,920
thumbs up it's like coming out great paul every time i listen to a song that's older than 10 years

218
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:19,040
old which at this point encompasses a lot of the black eyed peas body of work i get this dusty taste

219
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:27,440
in my mouth and the beatles music so old that i listen to you know back in the ussr and i'm just

220
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:36,000
like oh god it's so old you're lucky about a place that doesn't even exist anymore you're lucky i'm

221
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,680
listening to your old music i bought a beatles album and i immediately of course opened it up

222
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,920
and upturned it to see all the web exclusive content behind the scenes footage that was gonna

223
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,800
fall out of it and do you know how much did fall out of this record none what yeah i was like i was

224
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:05,840
like scouring it looking for some sort of twitter handle on it that i could use to like thank them

225
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,400
for the music and complain about the price and there wasn't a single one like do you want like

226
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,440
where is the hashtag do you want me to tweet about this record or not because i'm not going to just

227
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,480
make one up justin how many youtubers were like partnered with them on certain songs and like

228
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,360
featuring like some 12 year old youtuber like there was a lot of that though right here's the

229
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:36,960
thing trap is gonna bug you out but um uh unless ellenor rigby is like some hot tuber that i have

230
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,040
not heard of before i don't think it had like any youtube people wait at all yeah you heard how do

231
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,680
they get people listen i don't know i mean i felt like it was kind of an act of charity on my behalf

232
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:59,200
yeah like reinforcing i went the narrative i went to a record store which is basically like a

233
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:08,240
retirement home for music if you really think about it and i picked up um paul's album the fun

234
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,720
title one that's like dr pepper's fun time jamboree took it home to put it in my record

235
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,920
player open it up two bats flew out of it old this old music guys it's and now it's a dangerous

236
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:26,480
public health hazard because the bats the bats fly into my traps and then they're deactivated

237
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,160
and now i have now i have holes in the in the reinforcements that the the you know the blue

238
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,520
apron thieves are absolutely gonna know about like we don't pay shakespeare when you do shakespeare

239
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,000
shows shakespeare's not like getting on youtube like let me see who's quoting hamlet and they're

240
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,080
like product trying videos come on paul mccartney you're basically shakespeare you're both british

241
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,720
i think come on yeah the beatles paul mccartney who you think you are shakespeare uh it's a bit

242
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,800
of a stretch you're a little full of yourself a little high on the horse a little bit paul

243
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:07,040
paul paul i did like your halo song the song you did for the halo game that wasn't quite halo was

244
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,840
great but paul very good and again artists should be paid for i feel like i have to say this like

245
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,480
10 times artists should be paid for their time and energy yes absolutely 100 all of them don't

246
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,160
steal stuff pay people to do designs for you pay people to do music for you just not paul mccartney

247
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,040
can be a little stingy sometimes when uh the beatles great music and by great i mean like

248
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,960
really old but good and like the old way where you're like you know you watch an old movie or

249
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,680
hear old songs like i see what you're going for if there needs to be like a christmas carol where

250
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,840
like three ghosts appear to paul mccartney and they're like hey just let people use your music

251
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,720
paul and old music is good when you only view it or listen to it through the lens of like well

252
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,200
clearly it's not like black eyed peas good but black eyed peas have 40 years of like extra

253
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:59,920
learnings that they use to make their great music and so i think the number one lesson that black

254
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:07,600
eyed peas taught us was don't put a year number in your song right because then maybe 10 years

255
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,560
later 2008 won't be so new and fresh and impressive sort of like the rubin stuttered hit

256
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,040
this is my sorry for 2004 uh don't you think rubin kicks himself right in the shorts for

257
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:29,040
not waiting 13 years on that one gosh darn it um how about another question yes

258
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,520
i just got paid artists for the time i just got hired just not paul mccartney i just got hired

259
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,120
at a law firm next summer uh for next summer and the head partner invited me to a holiday dinner

260
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,080
party with the rest of the firm's employees the problem is i have to order my meal in advance

261
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,840
my choices of protein are crab cakes chicken or filet mignon with sizes sweet potato fries

262
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,080
scallop potatoes or green beans how is this at all a problem this sounds dope how is this at all an

263
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:08,240
issue this will let me finish okay listen all right listen god uh this will be my first interaction

264
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,160
with the firm and i'm worried that picking the filet will come off too pretentious what should

265
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:22,800
i choose the steaks thank you i've never been hired oh my god okay griffin look at this though

266
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:29,600
right wait oh all right that's from perplexed in the clean plate club wow overtalk's gonna get way

267
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,480
better on this show if justin has a punishment button which is paul stanley yelling at us to

268
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,320
listen what we've got here toronto well that one's not applicable justin so i hit the wrong button

269
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:47,200
okay we've got a logic puzzle here right you have three protein options and you have to get

270
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,680
them across the river but you only have one raft the crab cakes will eat the filet mignon and you

271
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:59,760
have three side options and there is a right combination that will get you promoted before you

272
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,960
even start working oh shit right but if you say crab cakes and green beans are like crab cakes

273
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,400
this is a young man uh who dreams of the sea he's not going to focus on his job and you're like oh

274
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:18,240
i want chicken and scallop potatoes and it's like ah he thinks he's a simple man with simple desires

275
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,040
he has no he has no dreams he has no aspirations and if you're like i want flame mignon and sweet

276
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,720
potato fries and it's like oh la dee da look at mr high and mighty filet mignon over here

277
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,840
right i yeah you must like the minion movies he's a child right it's bad all around i would

278
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:40,240
like to suggest okay let's all have our ideal combination here oh i've got it out here's what

279
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:49,040
i would like to suggest um green beans and then right in at the bottom i will bring my own meat

280
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:56,480
because that's somebody who is worried about the bottom line has sort of like culinary prowess

281
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,000
because they they are willing to like cook their own food and bring it along and it's somebody who

282
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,080
uh uh never you know never wants to do things by the company line they want to think outside the

283
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,440
bun thank you travis none of these foods have buns well all of these all of these foods are outside

284
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,280
of the bun now justin that only works if you can if your dish you bring and you lift the little

285
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:27,520
metal cover off of it and it is more impressively cooked and plated than what has been served oh

286
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,520
shit fucking uh yeah i didn't i didn't uh choose my own meal because i brought my own gordo and

287
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,520
then gordon ramsay's like i wish you wouldn't call me that and you're like i can call you with a

288
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,680
fuck i want to call you gordon ramsay that's maybe the biggest power play that you have available to

289
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,280
you and you yell at gordon ramsay till he cries if you can make gordon ramsay cry at this christmas

290
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,040
party first of all gordon wants to be back in in the uk with his family during christmas time so

291
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,360
you know that you're gonna impress them because they're like wow what's he got on gordon ramsay

292
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,680
that he is able to pull him away from his beautiful family um my suggestion is this you get

293
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:14,880
the flight you get the filet mignon with a side of filet mignon oh and then you say two things i'm

294
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,120
hungry for advancement you don't say that second part but they'll know and then you also say i'm

295
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,360
eating two filet mignons because i'm gonna work twice as hard as any of these other bastards

296
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,720
you say all that you do say all that part out loud this actually goes along with what

297
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:38,320
my kobayashi maru which was you just check all of them okay i will have the filet mignon with

298
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,840
crab cakes and chicken on top and a side of sweet potato fries mixed with scalloped potatoes

299
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,960
mixed with green beans thank you very much oh yeah or because the summer is a long time away

300
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,560
and you might not even get that job but you'll have eaten the equivalent of three free meals

301
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:01,040
oh i see it's sort of a grift situation could mark them all and then right at the bottom

302
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:07,760
please donate mine to hungry orphans and they'll be like oh wow wow that's a big play or

303
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,080
you bring your own big bowl and you mush them all up into just one big nasty mess

304
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,560
and then you eat that with your hands and then the boss is like i like his style i'll have that too

305
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:29,680
yeah pretty soon can i have some of your nasty mess only if you make me the boss okay yes right

306
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,080
just write a little note on the card please provide table blender yeah because you'll want

307
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,720
definitely want that oh just write in dealer's choice that is the worst choice right back on

308
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,280
them that is the dealer's choice will be no food you get nothing because they are not going to

309
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:51,680
bother with that that's true don't mark a protein but next to green beans right seven and see if

310
00:32:51,680 --> 00:33:04,400
you can get a seven times huge green beans x7 people are gonna remember that guy you should

311
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:15,840
call your boss and say a quick question what are green beans are these beans that you have dyed

312
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,280
green in some way um mark mark sweet potato fries and steak but next to green beans put a question

313
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:29,600
mark green beans and then their boss will be like well green beans are these fun little pods full of

314
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,320
these small weird nasty beans and you say okay i've learned that and now you've shown that you

315
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:46,240
are quick to learn ready for advancement ready to go i i maybe just mark out the green on green

316
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,720
beans and then mark that so i want some beans of a different whatever sort of variety you can you

317
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,480
can dig up in the kitchen yeah and write it mark it out and then write in uh scalloped sweet beans

318
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:07,680
scallop sweet beans with chicken with chicken cakes you figure it out i'm a fussy dude and i

319
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:15,040
need chicken cakes or else i'm gonna cry at the party turn it into sort of a logic flow so next

320
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,920
to chicken right if tenders yes if no proceed to next option and then you just have like a

321
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,840
sort of a flow chart to really make it as complicated as possible but that shows what

322
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:35,280
frosting yeah right with butter butter cream please uh could you just say i'll i'll pick

323
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,400
to find out what your boss is getting this is actually a great thing find out what your boss

324
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,920
is getting and get the exact same thing or get something different and then at the party you

325
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,040
sit down next to your boss this is so important and you say splitsies yeah oh yeah split wanted

326
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,160
all those options he definitely has also struggled with this and then insist on paying half the check

327
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,280
for the whole table and they'll keep saying like no this is the whole the business is paying for it

328
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,120
and you keep saying like are you sure because i'll i'll cover it this one could be on me it's like

329
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,760
you haven't even started working here you're like okay but you like really keep being insistent but

330
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,440
if at any point there is a ripcord here if at any point the boss is like okay cool you're like no

331
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,880
i was lying i don't have i guess i don't i don't get the job that's a lot that's far too much money

332
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:29,200
don't mark any food but at the bottom make an option for lots of overdue paperwork and so when

333
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,960
everybody else is eating and just like the beef juice is dribbling down their chin you'll be like

380
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:35,760
um i don't know if it's a secret message or just like the coolest name i've ever seen somebody

381
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,120
may have gotten confused when they were filling out sort of the metadata of the message because

382
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:48,000
it says who's this message for and what they've put here is where like w h e r e who's this

383
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,240
message from where so it's possible they saw these questions were like where do you want me to put

384
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,160
this data where do you where do you where is this supposed to go where they did find the box they

385
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:08,560
did so what's the message trough are you fucking done yet no i no that's the message are you fucking

386
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,280
done yet sigh probably not keep at it though books don't just make themselves just watch out

387
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,520
for a hundred dolls as you print those bastards will get you thanks bros for keeping me laughing

388
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,720
late into the work night you guys are the best hugs um and they wanted that message in 2017

389
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,920
so some important stuff in here a lot actually they they said that their preferred time frame

390
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,400
is whatever's latest i mean this message is applicable until at least 2018 so they definitely

391
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,320
like have a large window here i think this is a message for themselves from themselves to

392
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:53,280
encourage themselves to finish the book they're writing i love that a lot of people though are i

393
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,640
don't know that book printers are some of the most like haunted buildings oh god yes we're doing the

394
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,840
taz graphic novel uh and they were like do you want to come by and see the magic of books getting

395
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,400
printed and i said nice try because once i step inside my spirit will never leave because of the

396
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,560
grudge yeah well i mean i'm pretty sure that only ghosts work in the print industry anymore

397
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,720
oh yeah what does that even mean trap uh well uh got something what's it mean do you have a thing

398
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,400
well like print is dying i think i don't know but that's not what that means what

everybody who's in the choir gets a free frozen yogurt nice count it and all the sales from that

422
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:21,520
night a portion 25 of all the sales go to uh the um the charity while the choir is performing wow

423
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:28,160
25 can you imagine all of us at sweet frog love this annual event that gets us in the christmas

424
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,760
spirit says their ceo patrick gallagher uh it's a wonderful time of community fellowship as people

425
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,320
come together to celebrate christmas what better way to do that than enjoying the sounds of the

426
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:43,200
season sung by local choirs we are proud to showcase great local talent and support local

427
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,680
churches and schools while helping our sweet frog owners generate some serious winter foot traffic

428
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:54,240
okay yeah i have two problems the first one is can i just eat my fucking frozen yogurt

429
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:02,480
please it is i am sad it is the holidays i am alone and i came in to eat some frozen yogurt

430
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:11,280
and just try to like fucking chill have you ever ever been in a frozen yogurt shop the size of

431
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:18,480
which you thought this is a place i would love to get blasted by jingle bells being screamed at me

432
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:34,560
by 40 people never ever ever never the the other thing yeah the other thing is 25 that is so nice

433
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,600
let me just real quick run the margins on frozen yogurt oh that's right it's 98

434
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:51,280
percent you literally take cow stuff and add some sugar and then you sell it for a hundred

435
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,520
dollars as somebody who's worked in the yogurt industry i can confirm justin's justin's math on

436
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:05,760
on this one um this is also like as somebody who's worked in the yogurt industry yes the cold months

437
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:14,240
are not necessarily the hottest time for a sweet frog or a yogurt land or the country's best yogurt

438
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,560
and so this this feels like you're just trying to trying to get us in the trying to get us in the

439
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:25,520
door my main concern is that you know with the introduction of local church choirs it ain't just

440
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,040
gonna be jingle bells it's there's going it's gonna get there's gonna be some jay-su in the mix

441
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:41,040
and there's gotta be you know there's an important separation between church and yogurt and i'm

442
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:48,480
worried that this is blurring the line so you know what though i think it sounds maybe a little nice

443
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,400
okay well here's holly sylvias who is of charlestown west virginia oh hey thank you

444
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:05,040
hey hello um and holly is going to be uh putting on a a deck the halls event in her store and here's

445
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,360
the quote we invited a local school choir fourth and fifth graders to perform good good love this

446
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:18,560
yogurt because it's kids i'm anticipating a huge crowd which is great children really shine when

447
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,160
they have a chance to perform in front of an audience so i want to pack the place out we'll

448
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,800
move tables out of the way to make more room if needed so she's really just like in this press

449
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:33,200
release kind of thinking through the logistics of this event and also so okay so i'm just gonna

450
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,080
enjoy my frozen yogurt while standing up well i'll stay i'll just stand then so i'll just stand

451
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,440
i paid nine dollars for this frozen yogurt but i'll go ahead and stand in a corner could you

452
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,760
excuse me little kid could you scoot over i'm trying to get to the yogurt i just please just

453
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,640
let me get my yogurt and when was the last time anybody bought yogurt and said oh i can't wait

454
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,600
to sit down and enjoy this here at the yogurt place um as somebody worked in the yogurt industry

455
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,520
they'll do they'll do that and it's just it's like when you turn in a test at school and the

456
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,240
teacher grades it right there in front of you because it's like oh boy i hope they enjoy the

457
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,760
work i've done there sometimes they'll look over at you and be like too much crushed up heath bar

458
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:28,880
i'll be like i'm sorry i'll do better next time here's your money back praise jesus love love it

459
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:37,120
love his stuff i think this sounds nice i like a good carol and i like carolers and i don't know

460
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:43,520
that this would necessarily make me want to go get cold cream in the cold cold harsh winter texas

461
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:49,840
months um but i think it sounds sweet and i think that justin was mean for no fun of it let me side

462
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:58,000
with justin here because i think were i unprepared for this site to await me and my frozen yogurt

463
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,640
shop and i opened the door just wanting to grab a quick frozen treat on my way home from a hard

464
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:13,920
day at the office and i opened the door and there was like an army of children singing about jesus i

465
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,800
don't think i'd think oh awesome now imagine instead travis you walked in and there was a

466
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,880
man dressed in halloween clothing standing alone on a stage while you enjoyed frozen yogurt and he

467
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:35,360
opened his mouth and i put my hand inside a toilet yeah that would rule yeah we're all very i mean if

468
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:42,000
we wanted to do a winter promotion um i feel like what would be dope is like hey this is griffin

469
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,080
for sweet frog i've changed i've jumped over like the can you hear me now guy and i'm a trader to

470
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:52,320
the country's best yogurt and there's a lot of shit you don't know about that brand but anyway

471
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,480
i'm excited to announce for the cold winter months you gotta have your frozen yogurt fixed

472
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,880
and that's why i've invented hot yogurt and it's the new jam that you are just gonna love and come

473
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,400
hey get out oh baby it's cold outside enjoy this hot yogurt it's the new thing i've developed and

474
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,680
it burns the mouth so so bad you have to it'll be like an hour before you can really enjoy it

475
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,720
and don't put any toppings in it because the toppings will be destroyed in this molten hot

476
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:29,600
yogurt this steaming plasma of yogurt um but it's better people are serving you yogurt that has

477
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:36,080
living things in it and our yogurt is served at a temperature in which no living these cultures will

478
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:44,000
be obliterated there is no sort of gastrointestinal sort of benefits to be gleaned from this very very

479
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:52,640
very very hot burning fiery yogurt and in fact why the opposite you will regret in you regret

480
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,840
consuming it yes because it'll burn all your insides out it'll burn a hole right through you

481
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,920
and if that don't get you the asbestos cup is definitely not going to be good for the health

482
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,120
it's made of fiberglass basically and it's going to get in the hot yogurt and there's nothing we

483
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,880
talked to the scientists and there's nothing we can do about it how about a yahoo yeah please

484
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,920
merit palmer sent this one in thank you merit it's from an anonymous yahoo user i'm gonna call

485
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:25,920
him the guy from the i put my hand inside toilet video asks how many horses would it take to pull

486
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,640
a horse trailer full of horses oh shit i'm so excited to get into this question with you boys

487
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,800
because we're gonna say a bunch of dumb math stuff but how many horses would it take to pull a horse

488
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:50,480
trailer that is just chocoblock full of horses wow it can't just be one to one right so here's

489
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,640
the question if let's here's what we need to establish first we need to what's the word tear

490
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,680
the scale a little bit is that how you pronounce that we're gonna tear we gotta tear it right so

491
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:09,040
how many horses does a horse trailer weigh i'm gonna say probably about six horses you're saying

492
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,400
sans horses empty horse trailer i think is about six horses worth of weight horses okay and you

493
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:21,760
can probably get like a decent sized horse trailer maybe five more horses in it so that's 11 horses

494
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:32,960
okay okay okay can one dude you need 11 horses to pull 11 horses worth of weight or does the term

495
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:41,520
horsepower refer to the amount of joules of force required to pull one horse against its will well

496
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,600
here's here's the question and i think we have to remove this factor or else this will be here all

497
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:54,400
day and everyone's gonna say like well with wheels on it that simple machine makes it easier okay

498
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:03,440
cool remove remove the wheel we are in a paralogic scenario here where there is no wheel or like

499
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,200
sled or we factor out the wheels and say the wheels will get you about two horses worth off

500
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,640
so now we're talking about nine horses and that's a very i just punched the numbers into siri and

501
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,400
she told me the wheels will counteract the weight of about two horses so now nine horses do we then

502
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:27,440
need nine horses pulling santa's sleigh tonight and bringing all the good boys and girls uh gift

503
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:36,480
of horses or is that not how any of this works well let's take okay griffin we've calculated this

504
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,480
the the the weight of the trailer right uh so now let's imagine 11 horses and each horse is riding

505
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:52,960
on the back of another horse right so you would need one horse per horse this is a lot what you've

506
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,760
just entered into the equation which is horse stacking yeah but you couldn't put two horses on

507
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,120
one horse it wouldn't fit this is gonna trick about that this is gonna trip you all out okay

508
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,840
i'm here to complicate things i did a quick google just to provide a little science okay

509
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:15,840
this is this is complicated but a single draft horse i don't know what that means

510
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:22,160
can pull a load up to 8000 pounds what draft horse is when you get on tap instead of in a bottle

511
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,680
right okay so get one horse out of a bottle it can pull 8000 pounds how much a horse way probably

512
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,760
about 4000 pounds so travis can google that while i'm reading these facts how much horseway don't

513
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,400
you don't have to say it don't use like your speech how much horseway just go ahead and type

514
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:45,920
it all fine siri so much horseway so griffin if i told you one draft horse can pull uh a load up

515
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:59,680
to 8000 pounds yeah how much would two horses be able to pull 16 000 pounds no wrong two draft

516
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:06,480
horses can i guess together and i guess yes 12 000 pounds no can i guess can i guess can i guess

517
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:14,560
yes 20 000 pounds of raw horse material no that's incorrect can i guess can i guess can i guess yeah

518
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:24,960
yeah 45 000 pounds 45 pounds 45 pounds all right listen what they can actually pull and there's a

519
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:31,440
lesson in this and we're gonna find it what they can pull working together is not 16 000 pounds

520
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:40,320
or double they can pull 24 000 pounds they could pull three times whoa they're usual by working

521
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:47,920
working together holy shit think about yeah because they build up momentum every action has

522
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,520
an equal opposite reaction except for two horses as the great law says from the 10 commandments

523
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,840
and so then we shit okay so now we got 11 horses right 11 horses worth take off the wheels that's

524
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:08,320
nine horses if it's a factor of tripling every time you add another horse then three horses

525
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:17,360
can then pull let me run the numbers on this real quick 72 000 pounds the three horses only so

526
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:23,120
they're dragging like a building behind them they can definitely if we get 10 horses and strap them

527
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,560
to the earth we can counteract the rotation of the earth and destroy everything here is where it gets

528
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:35,840
it gets worse guys it gets more complicated two horses that have worked together for a long time

529
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:43,760
buddies get out pals that like long-time collaborators can pull actually pull 32 000

530
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,600
pounds wait as heavy as they even can pull by themselves so now we have to factor in like

531
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:54,880
partnership drift these fucking horses are in the drift and they can pull the earth out of orbit

532
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:01,280
so you're telling me two horses we're in a like a buddy cop scenario here we're like two horses

533
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,560
at first they're both loose cannons this horse is by the books and this book this horse is out

534
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:13,040
there trying new shit and at first they're maybe maybe on a good day pulling 22 000 pounds right

535
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:19,280
but then they start to see within each other like you know we're not so different you and i and over

536
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:30,400
the years they just get it well enough that suddenly they are 8 000 pounds stronger it's

537
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:39,040
amazing you're trying but that a ton a u.s short ton is 2 000 pounds you're telling me that these

538
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:49,440
two horses can pull 16 tons of raw horse meat 16 tons what do you get it's just two horses

539
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,560
two horses friends two best like best friend horses how do you as a horse owner and owner of

540
00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:03,840
the most buckwild freight company ever make these horses become best friends so that your margins

541
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,400
on no how do you stop them that's this is terrifying you can't stop them can't stop

542
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,160
i guarantee farmers look out of their windows and they see two horses like you know we gotta

543
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,000
destroy our house which right like and we gotta go break that up we can't okay a horse an adult

544
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,960
horse i looked this up siri told me an adult horse weighs between 840 to 2200 pounds so let's call

545
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:37,920
it let's call it 16 as an average 1600 pounds so if these two horses are pulling 32 000 pounds

546
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:44,960
and we use 1600 as an average we're talking about imagine looking out your window and seeing two

547
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:53,680
two brutal best friend horses pulling 20 fucking horses behind them oh no it's okay guys we've got

548
00:59:53,680 --> 01:00:02,080
it we are longtime friends and we are going to pull all 20 of you in this trailer and then the

549
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:06,560
horse is like fucking high five because they also figured out how to do that because they're best

550
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,520
best friends now wait a minute i did not factor in what did we say six horses worth of weight in a

551
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:20,320
in a usual trailer minus two for the wheels so that's 16 horses 16 horses still 16 horses that's

552
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:28,640
a mate that is it is so you're telling me yes it is more cost effective for two horses to pull 16

553
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:35,360
horses than to just have all 18 horses walk all right let me add one can i also add by the way

554
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:42,560
that we have now like completely completely obliterated any value to the term horsepower

555
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,200
because it is not it is not a i mean are they uh you know 400 horsepower is that 400 horses

556
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:55,360
400 horsepower would destroy the galaxy yeah are they best friends are they are really like have

557
01:00:55,360 --> 01:01:01,520
they worked together for a long time like there's so many factors in this horsepower also why are

558
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:07,440
we talking about this as clean energy because two horses apparently it all compounds just have like

559
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,600
six horses and you can power all of america why are we fucking with cars like why are we even

560
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:19,680
messing around with it i'll i'll talk about hey elon i'll hop on two horses i'll get to san

561
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:25,440
francisco in like an hour and a half right why aren't horses pulling my goddamn car

562
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:34,240
yeah why are we doing engines and gas and stuff so if i griffin am best friends with my horse

563
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:41,920
which i am take real good care make a big sweater for it with four leg holes love my horse

564
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:48,480
if me and my horse try to pull a trailer how much weight can we do because i think the horse gets

565
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:55,680
the breath the the best friend buff uh-huh the best friend strength buff and i obviously am it's

566
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:00,960
going to be carrying most of the weight literally in this situation does it still get the extra

567
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:08,480
strength from me the horse's best friend how much can you pull griffin probably about 4500 pounds

568
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,240
okay if i really if i if i'm wearing my cleats and i can really dig in there okay so griffin

569
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:20,400
can pull 4500 pounds and the horse by itself can pull 8000 but it gets the best friend buff

570
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:28,880
so it gets the best friend buff i'm gonna say you can pull a together 18 000 pounds and that will

571
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,760
i absolutely can't keep up with my best friend the horse and i will be obliterated by this 18 000

572
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,440
joules of force horse trailer you'll be ripped in half i'll all be destroyed at some point though

573
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,960
at some point though can't the best friend buff start to work against you like if one horse is

574
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:51,840
having an off day do you think there's a chance his partner horse because they are such close

575
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,680
friends would be like we're gonna take a little slower today like there are some days where it's

576
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,680
actually worse than typical horse performance because they do want to slow it down for their

577
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,320
friend or they want to enjoy they haven't caught up for a while so they slow it down like no reason

578
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,520
to rush chester yeah well you have to be careful because if like if one of your horses is sick and

579
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,000
you partner the other one with a new horse and then the sick horse sees that he's like i thought

580
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,680
we were best friends and like now oh good point yeah now there's an issue of like well i don't

581
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:23,760
want to partner with you anymore well that's what blinders are for to keep the horses from

582
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:30,000
seeing when the other horses are becoming other best friends with other horses man there's a lot

583
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,480
that goes into this you're in the horse trailer and the horse trailer is just not moving like

584
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,680
what the fuck's up and you listen to the two horses in front it's like that's my wife derrick

585
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:48,560
and it's like oh shit all right so i guess the answer to this is two pretty much anything you

586
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:54,880
want to haul yeah two good best friend horses can pretty much do it and that's a good lesson for us

587
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:01,600
if we all we don't just all need to work together we need to start working together now so our load

588
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:07,840
will steadily increase that we can haul together as a people then how can we get that gang gang

589
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:16,240
2018 stronger together oh that's not bad holy shit that's really good because that was both

590
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,200
was like romantic but also mates in the way of like friends but also like yeah yeah all working

591
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:27,760
yeah i was thinking about it platonically 2018 stronger together we can we you can do you can do

592
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:33,120
a lot by yourself and you should and you got to try but with another person you can pull 3600

593
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:39,200
pounds we like a lot of themes recently have celebrated self-interest yeah this one 30 30

594
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:48,080
3018 for the for the year 3018 2018 just find a bud or something because it's positive but it also

595
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:54,400
goes along with that like mount up ride or die we're all in this together fight together i do

596
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,960
wonder if you we this needs a particularly large coda too and that we're not incur like

597
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:07,440
we're not trying to repopulate the earth and increase mating amongst peoples well what if

598
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,320
we say it with like a british affectation so every time you say it yeah it's got to be like
