1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
But anyway, I want you guys to put your hands together, together, there's beer here, put

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,200
your hands together like in a clapping motion, and welcome my brother, my brother and me!

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,720
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,040
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,480
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:58,880
cool they are for listening.

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:28,760
The last words Justin said to me right before we walked out here was, I'm fully turnt.

8
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,280
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother, my brother and me, the advice show for the

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,760
modern era.

10
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,560
We want that every sentence, every sentence we say tonight, we expect that result.

11
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,840
I was fucked, that was a goof.

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,800
That'll be great because we only have 30 minutes of material prepared, so.

13
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

15
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,320
Oh no, this will be the loudest one, and we'll feel bad about it.

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
And I'm the baby-est one, Griffin McElroy.

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,360
I'm 11 for 11.

18
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,840
I haven't been keeping score, but 11 for 11, loudest cheers.

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Welcome to my brother, my brother and me, which is my brother, my brother and me, live,

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,040
face-to-face, 11.

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
Did we come up with that?

22
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
No, I said no one goes home alone.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,640
No one goes home alone!

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
What if they, like, want to?

25
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,480
Too bad!

26
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,440
We have, like, Chilean miners, we have emerged from our...

27
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
No!

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
No?

29
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
That is cheap!

30
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Only the hits tonight.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
We know you guys put up with a lot of traffic, we're only doing the hits.

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Welcome to our spookiest live show.

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,200
We'll say, we'll say anything that'll get a response.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,240
There might be ghosts around.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,480
There we go.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
Bramblepelt.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm literally, I'm shameless.

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,320
Thank you, half bottle of Hennessy, half of this is Diet Coke, so...

39
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,040
You pick which half.

40
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,800
I didn't like that LA show, Justin was drunk the whole time.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,840
If you're not, if you're not here right now, which is, like, a lot of the earth.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
Most of the earth.

43
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,840
What percentage?

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
We are, we're in a cemetery, well, we're not like...

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,440
We're in the middle of a cemetery.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,600
Yeah, it's very chilly.

47
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
No, we're in a cemetery.

48
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,520
We're like Lydia from Beetlejuice, just hanging out.

49
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Did anybody, like, walk around and, like, check out the graves?

50
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,520
These weirdos.

51
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,520
There's just two of them.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,520
There's some pretty good graves.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
You see any cool ones?

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Shh, quiet!

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,520
What?

56
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,720
Did you go to the Mel...

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
The Mel Blanc one?

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
Yes.

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,720
That's the best one.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Yeah.

61
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
Was it cool?

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Does everybody in the audience know Mel Blanc's avatar?

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
That's all folks.

64
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
It's so good.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
So choice.

66
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,240
Such a cool dude.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,240
If mine says kiss your dad square on the lips, I'm going to be very, very put out.

68
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,960
So I live here now.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,120
I am a resident of a...

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
In the cemetery.

71
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,720
Travis has been dead for 25 years.

72
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,520
Have you seen Ghost Rider?

73
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,800
I'm like the creepy old guy who once was a ghost rider, but now lives here.

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,160
And you guys are visiting.

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,160
How are you enjoying your visit?

76
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,160
Oh, fucking great, dog.

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
Super good.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,160
Travis has an air mattress.

79
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Oh yeah, there was a vine.

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,440
Here's the thing about this air mattress is every 90 minutes you have to re-inflate it

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
by hand with a pump.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,920
I did not know that when I pitched it to Griffin.

83
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,000
Which almost makes it like a coin-operated bed.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,960
Like the magic fingers at a motel.

85
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,560
So instead of vibrating, it just turns into more floor, essentially.

86
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,000
Now that's unpleasant for Griffin waking up and realizing he's on the floor.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But I was...

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,320
Because I wasn't previously.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,680
I was sleeping directly next to him.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:09,520
So my sleep was interrupted every 90 minutes by this.

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,160
It's a hand pump, but apparently I just breathe very heavily whenever I...

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,200
Griffin takes his pumping very seriously.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
That's my hand pump noise.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,320
I thought that was obvious.

95
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
It's pretty good.

96
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,800
I'm not a Foley artist.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
So that made sleeping interesting.

98
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,560
Yeah, it did.

99
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Should we do the show?

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,800
If you've never listened to our show before, we take your questions and we turn them alchemy-like

101
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,780
into wisdom.

102
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,640
We have some questions specifically from people here in the audience.

103
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,480
Feel free to say woo or wooboy or wooboy.

104
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,000
We will also...

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,960
Any combination of woo and boy.

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Boo and nanny.

107
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Boo, boo, nanny.

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,100
Later in the show, we're gonna take questions from people who are brave enough to stand

109
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,160
up here and ask questions.

110
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
We just ask...

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Do not be a bummer.

112
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
As always, don't be a bummer.

113
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,680
We say this every time and we really, really mean it.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Don't be a bummer.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,640
We'll sit you right back down.

116
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah, it's an exciting show.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Got a lot of buds in the audience.

118
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
Got a lot of yahoos.

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
It's gonna be so good.

120
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,000
It should be pretty fun.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's...

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
And oh, I should mention, we're sorry the Soulbones couldn't make it tonight.

123
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,680
My baby still isn't sleeping great, so we couldn't make it.

124
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Sorry.

125
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Blame it on his stupid baby.

126
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
That dumb baby ruining everything.

127
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,580
But we're super excited about the special guest podcast.

128
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,980
They are so big.

129
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,980
We are opening for them.

130
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,980
We're opening for them.

131
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,040
So they're on after us, but we're really excited to be opening for them.

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,640
It's their first live performance, so stay tuned for that.

133
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,200
But first, questions.

134
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,480
Here we go.

135
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
This past Candle Nights, I got...

136
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,640
First off, I should ask.

137
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,520
Is anybody here not listened to our show before?

138
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Any first timers?

139
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,520
Okay.

140
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Oh, it's gonna be really weird for all y'all.

141
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,520
Oh, shit.

142
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,520
Welcome.

143
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Oh, God, no.

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Bienvenidos.

145
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
You're in for a treat.

146
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Say something not funny, but people laugh, lean over to the person you're with and ask

147
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
why it was funny.

148
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Right.

149
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
And they won't be able to explain it.

150
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,360
Or if you want, we can explain it if you just yell, why was that funny at the stage as long

151
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
as you can.

152
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
No!

153
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
You'll sound a lot like Arnani listening to the show.

154
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I don't get it.

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh, we should have a pop-up video thing that has like, Arnani is our grandmother.

156
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,640
This past Candle Nights, I got my girlfriend tickets.

157
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:34,240
Candle Nights, you see, is a Christmas alternative.

158
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,840
This past Candle Nights, I got my girlfriend tickets to an upcoming Meghan Trainor concert.

159
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,760
Meghan Trainor is the singer we didn't get birth to Meghan Trainor.

160
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,840
Not like for life, just for our, okay.

161
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,440
Upon receiving the gift, I got her tickets to a Meghan Trainor concert.

162
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,800
Upon receiving the gift, she was excited and informed me that she coincidentally has the

163
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,160
same dress Meghan, apparently they're on a first name basis, Meghan wears in her music

164
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
video.

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,800
My girlfriend is considering wearing the dress to the concert.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,680
Is this acceptable or is it just as lame as wearing a band t-shirt at their show?

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
That's from Brian.

168
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Brian, are you here?

169
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Woo!

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Yeah.

171
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
A woo in the darkness.

172
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
That was acceptable.

173
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
That was an acceptable response.

174
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Woo, woo boy.

175
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Or just boy.

176
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Or boy.

177
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Or oh boy.

178
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Oh boy.

179
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,120
If you've been quantum leaped back to the show.

180
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Quantum leapt?

181
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Yeah, you had it the first time.

182
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,880
Quantum leapt.

183
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Lept quantumly.

184
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,280
I mentioned in the, Travis told us about this question and I mentioned in the car ride here

185
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,520
that we had done a question about whether or not it was acceptable to wear a band's t-shirt

186
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:50,120
to that band's concert and they both said, I don't remember doing that at all and I don't

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
think it was that long ago.

188
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,960
In 138 episodes in, I can't remember every stance I took.

189
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
Yeah.

190
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm actually pro wearing a band's t-shirt.

191
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,980
In the episode, I may have been anti, but that's just a character I play on the podcast.

192
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:14,120
We didn't cover, we didn't even touch the concept of cosplaying as good Charlotte.

193
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,800
No, I'm the anti, I'm bad Charlotte.

194
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:30,120
It's a fun spin on the cat, I'm steampunk good Charlotte, it's a fun spin.

195
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,960
I think she should do it because how many more chances is she going to get for a Meghan

196
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,360
Trainor concert?

197
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Listen to you.

198
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Listen to you.

199
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,960
Before it becomes a Meghan Trainor concert to the all about that bass girl concert.

200
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,720
How many completely confusing chart topping hits have you pinned in your lifetime?

201
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Three.

202
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
Oh, okay.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
You're beating her by one though.

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I just called to say I love you.

205
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
That was Travis.

206
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
Mbop.

207
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Mbop was Travis.

208
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Yeah.

209
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,040
And I just called to say Mbop.

210
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,800
I wish you'd stop calling me.

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,040
It's 1996 and this is fucking expensive.

212
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
I bet.

213
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,680
I just called collect to say Mbop.

214
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
What if she-

215
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Hey, don't accept the charges.

216
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,560
Just Mbop, later.

217
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,840
What if she's mid song and she just looks down in the audience like, nice.

218
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,520
Or worse, she looks down and goes, wait, hold on, stop, stop, stop.

219
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,720
What the fuck?

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Everybody else out in the lobby until we figure this shit out.

221
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
One of us has to change.

222
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,440
One of us is changing and I have other costumes and it's not going to be me.

223
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
So figure it out.

224
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,200
We have t-shirts in the lobby that are $45.

225
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,440
Did she coincidentally have the same dress or did she buy it because she's a fan?

226
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,880
Was it a Meghan Trainor fashion decision?

227
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,020
We're sort of asking that to the ephemera.

228
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,160
We're not looking for an actual-

229
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Yeah, it's a rhetorical-

230
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Into the hive mind.

231
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Right.

232
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
What do you all think?

233
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,280
Let's take an audience poll.

234
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
I'm in favor of it.

235
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,560
I think you could pawn it off as a coincidence.

236
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,000
You know, I don't watch music videos.

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's what you say.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I didn't see-

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, did I?

240
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uh-uh.

241
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is it?

242
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,400
I was wearing a cat face on my chest and a cat face on my vagina and it was just random.

243
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Is that?

244
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,800
I have not seen the video.

245
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,680
Is that it?

246
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
That's the follow-up.

247
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
That's the second.

248
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
That's all about the base team.

249
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,200
Are you like shooting without a script here?

250
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I don't know that this is-

251
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,160
Are you guys not big train heads?

252
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,480
No, I am sorry.

253
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,520
I am a train head, a fan of the band Train.

254
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,720
So don't try and take that away from us.

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
There's like 60 of us.

256
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,920
If you want me to replicate the casual yet stylish chinos from drops of Jupiter, I can

257
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
do that for you.

258
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,360
You're dressed just like the lead singer of Train and no one noticed.

259
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,840
There's a lot of people dressed like the lead singer of Train in LA I've noticed.

260
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,160
Keep an eye peeled.

261
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,280
You'll spot a lot of them.

262
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I have a Yahoo.

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,320
Oh, if you've never listened to our show, we occasionally take questions from the Yahoo

264
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
answer service.

265
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Occasionally.

266
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
From time to time.

267
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
From time to time.

268
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,760
Basically, it's whenever the show stops being funny, we'll, you laughed a little too hard.

269
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
You can keep it.

270
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
You can just relax.

271
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,120
We'll take a question from the Yahoo answer service.

272
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Griffin, what question do you have for us?

273
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,120
This one was actually sent in by Drew Davern for you, Drew.

274
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Stand up.

275
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Stand up.

276
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Is he here?

277
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Stand up.

278
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
You mountain of a man.

279
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
I see your beautiful face.

280
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
There he is.

281
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
The legend of a man.

282
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:43,760
Wait, wait, I didn't, I didn't get a picture.

283
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,920
Everybody pretend like it's his first time standing up.

284
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Stand up again for a pose.

285
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Don't move.

286
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,200
Oh, God, that's a great picture.

287
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
That's good.

288
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
That's good.

289
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
He looks like a beautiful ghost.

290
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
You go outside.

291
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
You go outside.

292
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
You pick any tombstone, it's yours.

293
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,480
You can take it home.

294
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
You don't have the Mel Blanc one.

295
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Fuck it.

296
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
As a profile pic for ages, my friend.

297
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
This is a weird giveaway.

298
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

299
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Drew Davenport is a guy that sends in questions a lot.

300
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
All the time.

301
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,840
Drew, tell me if you remember this one, buddy.

302
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,360
It was asked by Yahoo answers user Jabbar who asks, how can I subtly start an apple orchard

303
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,120
in my neighbor's backyard?

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
I feel like the subtleness ends after step one.

305
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:41,600
I have a feeling that the soil he has over there would be great for my orchard plants.

306
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Look at that soil.

307
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:51,640
And since my wife already used up our acre for this BS perfect picnic courtyard, I can't

308
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
do it.

309
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,360
I can't do it on my lands.

310
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,760
Damn it, darling.

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,920
My apples.

312
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,400
We never even picnic.

313
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:09,800
I can't tell me neighbor about this plan though because we've had multiple disagreements lately

314
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,940
and he'd never allow it.

315
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,400
Your picnic courtyard is too fucking perfect over there.

316
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,920
You're making the rest of us look bad.

317
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
How's your soil?

318
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,880
He'd never, he'd never allow it even though all that he grows over there is grass.

319
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a complete waste and he could do more if he cared about the beauty of our neighborhood

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and money.

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,440
It's in his backyard.

322
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,480
The problem with this is there has to be a moment during the blossoming where you have

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
to have a conversation with him like, those are looking, what are you growing over there?

324
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Those look nice.

325
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Also, those are mine.

326
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Also dimps.

327
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,800
Hey, those look awesome.

328
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
Don't fucking touch them though.

329
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,120
Tell you what, I'll take care of those for you.

330
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
No charge.

331
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,720
I'll just get all the apples.

332
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,200
All right, 10% of the apples are yours.

333
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
You drive a hard bargain.

334
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,440
Do you think that was Johnny Appleseed's game when he was like roaming the lands?

335
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,120
Just like, where did this fucking apple tree come from?

336
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,720
You planted an apple tree underneath my child's play place?

337
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,160
Yeah, you destroyed my house's foundation because you planted an apple tree right next

338
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
to it.

339
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,520
Like, yeah, I know, but free apples.

340
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I'll take care of it though.

341
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,000
But flip side, apples are pretty good, right?

342
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You like apples.

343
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,280
An apple tree, taking care of an apple tree is a fucking commitment.

344
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Johnny Appleseed planted his shit all across the country.

345
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,840
You know he wasn't watering those trees as they went.

346
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,440
He was saying, this is, hey, stranger in Vermont who I just planted an apple tree in their

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
front yard.

348
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
This is your problem now.

349
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,600
So basically, Johnny Appleseed is a metaphor for a deadbeat dad.

350
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
That's- Listen.

351
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:52,760
He walks across the country, spreading his seed, and then just moves to the next town.

352
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,160
It's right there.

354
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,720
I like a joke as much as the next guy.

355
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,600
But Johnny Appleseed regularly returned to the orchards he had planted to make sure they

356
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
were thriving.

357
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,320
In his car?

358
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,640
In his magic apple car, like in the fucking Richard scary verse?

359
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,120
Is that what you're suggesting?

360
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,800
Does it exist?

361
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,000
Do you think they had to get new cars like every day or like, they'd spray it with like

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
lemon juice.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,360
Yeah, they'd spray a little bit of lemon juice on the inside, but in like a day, the interior

364
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,840
is just all- What do I have to do to put you into a crab

365
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,880
apple today?

366
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,360
That's a dumb line of jokes.

367
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
Justin, save us.

368
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
I got another question here.

369
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,440
A photographer friend of mine has developed an uncanny ability to consistently take the

370
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,720
worst pictures of me ever taken.

371
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,960
Somebody's laughing a little too hard.

372
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,440
We're going to get you in a second.

373
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,840
Hey, they're pretty funny, but at this point, there are a lot of them.

374
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,960
And some of them are really, really bad.

375
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,780
I am definitely part of the problem.

376
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,120
When she points the camera at me, I always seem to make a face, but she's got an amazing

377
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,040
ability to catch me with my mouth full, mid sentence, while apparently farting and sneezing

378
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,320
at the same time.

379
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,520
How do I train myself to pull a blue steel when my friend and her camera are near?

380
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Or should I buy a large sack and dive into it?

381
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,280
Any tactics or advice will be appreciated, and that's from problematic photos in Portland.

382
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Are you here?

383
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Okay, everyone look away.

384
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Okay.

385
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Pull the face.

386
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Did you drive from Portland?

387
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
No, look away, I said front row.

388
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Okay, pull the face.

389
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Yeah.

390
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Okay.

391
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Solid.

392
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
Yeah, that's- Whoa.

393
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Solid.

394
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,280
That's rough.

395
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Don't want that on film.

396
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
That's rough.

397
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,440
Thanks, Candidly.

398
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,680
I used to take a lot of pleasure in being Stink Face Steve.

399
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
Your name's not Steve, is it?

400
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,680
Because that would be really rude and coincidental.

401
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
I used to really enjoy that.

402
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,920
I used to take a lot of pleasure in looking ugly like you.

403
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,400
No, it's not.

404
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,040
It has nothing to do with attractiveness.

405
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,200
I would like to think I have very high self-esteem.

406
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
But then all my friends started getting married, and that's not good, because everyone looks

407
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,400
so good, but you're up there during the ceremony farting and sneezing at the same time, and

408
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,360
I have a pizza roll in my mouth during the ceremony?

409
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,440
If you all look in your hearts, I think everyone can admit that they have a face that they

410
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,140
pull when a camera's pointed at them and they know that... I mean, we're all adults, right?

411
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,640
You have that face where you're like, and you know that that's going to be your face

412
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
every time.

413
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,160
You're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, camera.

414
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
My face-

415
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Every time, right?

416
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
It's not intentional.

417
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,720
My face is the face I get when I get a Christmas gift.

418
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,960
I don't like, but I don't want to hurt the person's feelings.

419
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:59,360
It's kind of like... Look at any fucking picture of me, I swear to God.

420
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
You'll look for wrapping paper.

421
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Where is it?

422
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,400
I know he's getting a Christmas gift he doesn't like.

423
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,640
That's only one step away from a fire just exploded in front of your face.

424
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
It's hard, right?

425
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,440
I feel you, because you- Oh, if you're listening to the podcast-

426
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,760
It made a- These faces are solid.

427
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,400
You work so hard, right?

428
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:27,000
You work hard to keep it right and tight and just looking super good, and then somebody

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,640
turns the camera on you, and you just drop the ball.

430
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,520
That's why you need final cut in all of your pictures.

431
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
For other people?

432
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
No.

433
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,720
You just take everybody's computers and take the JPEGs yourself.

434
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I wish I could help you.

435
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
I don't.

436
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
I suffer from this pretty chronically.

437
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,820
I haven't had a good picture taken of me since high school, probably.

438
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:54,680
What if you became the back of your head guy, where every time you saw a camera, you just

439
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,560
went- That's grim.

440
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,840
And they were like, I don't think Steve exists.

441
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,920
I hear all these legends.

442
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,480
And then they'll be happy to start seeing your face in some pictures, like, oh, there

443
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
he is.

444
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
Yo, Yahoo.

445
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,880
This one.

446
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,280
Did you really bring three beers?

447
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,560
No, these are backup beers.

448
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,000
In case of emergency, these beers are here.

449
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
If it's- If you- Okay.

450
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,680
So is it if it stops being funny, you're like, I'm out.

451
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,160
I'm under the table with my beer friends.

452
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,520
We record this show sober every single time.

453
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,040
And for some reason- Someone just went, yeah.

454
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,640
Every- You would be shocked.

455
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,080
Dozens of people ask us, you guys do that show high.

456
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,600
No, we don't.

457
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,920
But when we do it in front of people- Because we're older than 22.

458
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
So we don't know where- Right.

459
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,160
We can't find weed.

460
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,440
We're in California.

461
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
We don't know where it exists.

462
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
How about a Yahoo?

463
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Yahoo is my drug.

464
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,120
This drug was sent in by Mark Brown.

465
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Thank you, Mark.

466
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:07,280
It was sent in by Yahoo Answers user Rachel One, who asks, if you had the opportunity

467
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,400
to adopt a talking cat, would you?

468
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,880
Long hair or short hair?

469
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Like of course.

470
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,880
The hair length?

471
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,920
I get that long hair is how it's akin to- If I don't want it to shed all over my carpet,

472
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,720
yeah, it's an issue.

473
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,880
But you could talk to it and be like, can you do something about-

474
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Can you stop shedding?

475
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Okay.

476
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,360
To be fair, it's a talking cat, not a listening cat.

477
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,720
That's a good point.

478
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,920
How would it have learned?

479
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:48,480
Can I ask you though, wouldn't it be disconcerting to have a cat that could speak English but

480
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
can't understand English?

481
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,360
Like, I'm hungry.

482
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,360
What are we going to eat today?

483
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,520
Like, well, I got you a can of fancy food.

484
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,960
I can't- How many times do I have to tell you?

485
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,160
Or worse, a cat that could speak English, but didn't.

486
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,440
Just wouldn't- I was like, hey, how's it going?

487
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Oh my God.

488
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,440
You guys will never believe this.

489
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,440
Watch.

490
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Cat.

491
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
Say something.

492
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Yeah, he won't do it.

493
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
You fucking dick.

494
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,880
Let me hit you guys with this.

495
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Cat story.

496
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,920
It's like Toy Story, but all cats instead of toys.

497
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Same cast.

498
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,240
Same voice cast as Toy Story.

499
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,920
I think you're the first person to ever like pitch animals can talk, but we just can't

500
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
understand them.

501
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
No, no, no.

502
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
That's not the whole pitch.

503
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Tim Allen.

504
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,920
Sold.

505
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Yeah.

506
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
Tim Allen's attached.

507
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:48,680
Those are the three magic Hollywood words.

508
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm having trouble selling my pitch.

509
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
Tim Allen's attached.

510
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,240
Nevermind.

511
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
What was it?

512
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,240
Cat Story 2?

513
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
What was it?

514
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
Cat Story 1?

515
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
That's dumb.

516
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
But Tim Allen's on board.

517
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,720
I just make the check out to cash.

518
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,840
You think that Griffin's joking, but think about how many Tim Allen movies you're asking

519
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,200
yourself, how the fuck did this get made?

520
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Someone said Tim Allen's attached.

521
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,640
Tim Allen's attached and a time machine.

522
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,920
Right.

523
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,000
I like to imagine a rich fiction behind many Yahoo answers.

524
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,880
And for this one, I imagined a person sitting on the couch and looking at their cat thinking

525
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,000
God damn it, I wish you could talk or worse.

526
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,080
They adopted a talking cat, but the cat also scratched up at everything and they're like,

527
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
should I have done this?

528
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,160
Hold on.

529
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
Would you have done it?

530
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,680
Was this a mistake?

531
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,400
It's a talking cat, but also it's really racist and he can't hear, so it's like, you can't

532
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
tell him to stop.

533
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,680
He doesn't know any better.

534
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,240
If I had to shit in a little dirty cave, I would probably be pretty racist too.

535
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,800
The foreigners took all our toilets.

536
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
What?

537
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
What did you say?

538
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
Excuse me?

539
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Whoa, Mr. Bobo.

540
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,120
I can never find a toilet because all the foreigners are sitting on them.

541
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
I was like, whoa.

542
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
What?

543
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
Be cool for two seconds.

544
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
Just one second.

545
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
Please.

546
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
I can't understand what you're saying.

547
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
I don't understand.

548
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,240
I can't learn and grow from my mistakes.

549
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,800
I don't understand English.

550
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,160
Here's a question.

551
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
My wife.

552
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
My wife?

553
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
No.

554
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
My wife.

555
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,040
Have you guys seen Borat?

556
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
It's really great.

557
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I think you guys would like it.

558
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,080
My wife, CeCe'd, recently pointed out that I'm a bit of a jerk.

559
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Her name is CeCe'd?

560
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,080
You CeCe'd her on the email?

561
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
Listen.

562
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
Solid.

563
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,360
I know you've wanted me to own up to my mistakes and I'm finally doing it in an email to a

564
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,920
comedy podcast, Beverly.

565
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,080
She says I treat her pretty well, but with others, sorry, I missed the emphasis.

566
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Let me try again.

567
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Hold on.

568
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Ahem.

569
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Oh, yeah.

570
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
That'll help.

571
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,220
It's Justin's magic talking potion.

572
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,520
She says I treat her pretty well, but with others, I can come across as abrasive, arrogant,

573
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:14,920
overly talkative, and a bunch of other things that basically add up to maximum jerkitude.

574
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:19,460
My first response was to be upset and not believe it, but then I realized that's what

575
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,760
a jerk would do.

576
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,820
It's fair.

577
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,600
Since this revelation, I've been trying to adjust my behavior, but now I feel like I'm

578
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,620
stomping around angrily on eggshells and hyper-aware of my faults.

579
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,160
How can I stop being a jerk without losing my mind in the process?

580
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,720
That's from Jameson.

581
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,040
Your first move is to ask this question in front of a room full of people.

582
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,680
Jameson, get up here, buddy.

583
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
Here, Jameson.

584
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Is Jameson here?

585
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Jameson, you motherfucker.

586
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
Yeah, get on up.

587
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Come on.

588
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Come on up here.

589
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Come on.

590
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,680
Don't cheer for him.

591
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Don't egg on this behavior.

592
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,680
Yeah, right.

593
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
Don't boo him either.

594
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
Just be neutral.

595
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Jameson, can I say you were a micro?

596
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

597
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
Easy, tiger.

598
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Where's your bodyguard?

599
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
Okay, already fucking aggressive.

600
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:11,720
Can I just say, Jameson, you look really pleasant.

601
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,960
Oh, thank you.

602
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,080
So can you give us a specific example of why you think?

603
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,080
I tend to talk.

604
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Whoa, dude.

605
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,080
Calm down.

606
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Pump the brakes.

607
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,080
Coming at us.

608
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
Yeesh, Don Rickles.

609
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,080
You don't have to come out swinging.

610
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Yeesh.

611
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
No, no, no, no, really.

612
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Go ahead, Jameson.

613
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,360
All right.

614
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
You seem very pleasant.

615
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Now we're different.

616
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I can be a bit of a know-it-all.

617
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,360
I admit that.

618
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

619
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
And yeah, lots of stuff.

620
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,360
That's not good.

621
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
So know-it-all, et cetera.

622
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,360
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Can I just say, I totally, totally relate.

624
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Oh, that means a lot to me.

625
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I expected a bigger response, frankly.

626
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Fucking classic comedy podcast stoppers with your host, Travis McElroy.

627
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
No, I...

628
00:26:47,360 --> 00:27:08,280
I had this realization where a friend of mine, Michael Bradbury, basically said like, hey,

629
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
I like you.

630
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,280
Too much information.

631
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
No, no.

632
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Let him out.

633
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Are you speaking hypotheticals?

634
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
Yeah.

635
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Imagine there's a gentleman.

636
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:24,120
Imagine, if you will, and his friend says, I like you, but everyone else thinks you're

637
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
a dick.

638
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Sounds familiar.

639
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
Hypothetically.

640
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Yeah.

641
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,960
And when that happens, all you have to do, like a big move was like take stock, and it

642
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,640
really is like when you respond to anything, think like, how would I feel if someone said

643
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
this to me?

644
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah.

645
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
It's...

646
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,560
Have you read How to Make Friends and Influence People?

647
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Have you read How to Train a Dragon?

648
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,360
Have you read How to Train Your Dragon?

649
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,240
How would you want your dragon to train you?

650
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,560
Not a lot of people think about it.

651
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,600
It's the golden dragon rule.

652
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,520
Jameson, I want to ask you in a serious question.

653
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:04,740
Is your inner Jameson, the Jameson that you hold to be in your heart, is he a dick or

654
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,360
is the Jameson that you show to the world?

655
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,280
Is that the personality you've crafted for yourself on your exterior?

656
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Follow up question.

657
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,600
All right, just let me get mine in.

658
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
Fuck.

659
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm afraid that when he answers, I'm afraid that when he answers yours, it will negate

660
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
mine.

661
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
You can fucking wait and see.

662
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,160
Jameson, hold on one second.

663
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Roll the dice.

664
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Okay.

665
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Sorry, Jameson, about my brother, the dick.

666
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,600
My inner Jameson.

667
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
He's a real Jameson.

668
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
You'll have to excuse him.

669
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
No.

670
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,120
Or maybe you're a real Travis.

671
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
I don't know.

672
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Let's compare stories out.

673
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
We'll hang out later.

674
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
We'll compare stories.

675
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
Wait.

676
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
I want to get a fucking answer.

677
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,320
I would say that my inner Jameson is very sensitive, but I show a sort of thorny facade.

678
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
There.

679
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,560
I knew he was going to answer my question.

680
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,680
Do you correct people a lot?

681
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,160
Yeah, maybe.

682
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
Yeah.

683
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Oh.

684
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Shit.

685
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Hey.

686
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,760
Dude, you just got corrected on how often you correct people.

687
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,000
Jameson, I think that that's part of the problem.

688
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,080
That idea of like, I want to respond before the person says something.

689
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Like I want to be a dick before they do.

690
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
The ma bim bam story.

691
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
The ma bim bam story.

692
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,640
When you write your autobiography, that will be the title.

693
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,200
I'm afraid that someone else will be a dick to me like a brother would.

694
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,980
And so I want to say something first.

695
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,720
So I appear to be the dominant person.

696
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,960
I think that it's a lack of trust in other people to accept you for who you are.

697
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,280
So you don't accept them for who they are.

698
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,840
So I think there's a certain amount of like, just speak honestly to people the way that

699
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,400
they would, you wouldn't want them to speak to you.

700
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,400
I think honestly might be the problem.

701
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Yeah.

702
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,400
It's hard.

703
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,400
Just don't correct people.

704
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Like take that as your first step.

705
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,200
Cause it's easy not to correct somebody and it makes them feel like shit and nobody gets

706
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,760
anything out of it.

707
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Yeah.

708
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Just keep your damn mouth shut.

709
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,360
No, I'm not saying.

710
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,720
I never, no, I literally, I never correct anybody because you, you think about correcting

711
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
people.

712
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
It's a no win scenario.

713
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,640
Either one, you're actually wrong.

714
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:17,160
That's the fucking pit or, or two, like they feel bad and everybody else thinks you're

715
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
kind of a jerk.

716
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,640
So like, I used to do it all the time.

717
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Look for any opportunity.

718
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Loved it.

719
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,480
Was overweight, needed a boost.

720
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:33,080
But now I'm, now I'm still overweight, but I have a podcast.

721
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,960
I have all of you.

722
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,280
The fact of the matter, it's really easy to justify to yourself because I'm in great shape

723
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,280
now.

724
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:48,840
If you're listening at home, I just fell, I just took off my shirt and all the ladies

725
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,880
and so inclined men in the audience were like, a little bit of a delayed reaction.

726
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,880
We will take that.

727
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,920
We will take that audio clip backwards 10 seconds.

728
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Hey everybody.

729
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,920
Nice.

730
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:08,480
It's really easy to justify yourself and say, if I correct them, I'm doing them a service

731
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
because they had the wrong information.

732
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,880
You're not.

733
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,960
No, you're not.

734
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,760
You're insulting them indirectly and you just keep that because no one ever says a fact

735
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,800
saying, if I'm wrong, I hope someone says something.

736
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
No one's ever done that ever.

737
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,160
Jamison, I'm starting to feel exceedingly guilty for the fact that we've had you stand

738
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,200
up on stage for 15 minutes.

739
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,320
If you're listening, Jamison looks great.

740
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
He looks really great.

741
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
He's really great.

742
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Round of applause for Jamison.

743
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
Jamison.

744
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
He's a great guy.

745
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
We love him.

746
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,320
Thank you.

747
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,320
That was very brave of you.

748
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,320
All right.

749
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,200
Who is Jamison's significant other?

750
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Are you here too?

751
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I'm so sorry.

752
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,400
I know you're hanging in there, but- Hey, keep him on the straight and narrow.

753
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
You're doing God's work.

754
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,400
God's work.

755
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,400
Seriously.

756
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
He's going to turn it around.

757
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,720
You wait for his fucking Scrooge moment.

758
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,280
He's going to be visited by some ghosts, us, and he's going to, you watch, he's going to

759
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,280
turn it around.

760
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,240
Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

761
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,520
I just closed it.

762
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,040
Griffin, what's on the Google page?

763
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
What is today's Google doodle?

764
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,040
I don't know.

765
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Some painting.

766
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,960
We'll talk about it later.

767
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,760
Sorry to interrupt you past us, but we wanted to break in here for a quick trip to the Money

768
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,320
Zone.

769
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,960
Have you ever thought about building an iPhone application?

770
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,520
I don't possess the skills.

771
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,200
I mean, everybody thought about it, right?

772
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
It's just like- Everybody thinks that fart button.

773
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah.

774
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,920
You put these some zeros and ones together, and then it spells the words that form the

775
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,680
programming of the swordfish.

776
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,880
I had an idea for one, and I asked Siri to do it, and she said, go fuck yourself.

777
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Yeah, which is weird.

778
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,880
Yeah.

779
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,520
I want to ask- It was my friend Siri, not the Siri on the

780
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
phone.

781
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Oh, okay.

782
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
Oh.

783
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Classic Siri.

784
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
She sounds rude.

785
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
She is rude.

786
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Yeah, a little rude.

787
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
That's why we like her, though, because she's kind of a sass pot.

788
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
You know what I mean?

789
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:58,000
Your lack of technical skills is no longer going to hold you back thanks to your friends

790
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
at one month.

791
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm going to tell you about one month iOS.

792
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,120
It's an easy way to learn iOS development using Swift.

793
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
What does that mean?

794
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
I don't know.

795
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,120
I didn't take the class, but I do know that iPhone is the only way to make money these

796
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
days.

797
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,760
You have to build an app, and you can do that.

798
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,920
The way one month works is you give one month 30 minutes a day for 30 days, and at the end

799
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,440
of it, you will have a legitimate actual skillset, and not like reading or writing or math skillset

800
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,560
that will actually serve you in your day-to-day life like application development.

801
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,120
Justin, did you say that the iPhone is the only way to make money?

802
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
Yes.

803
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,920
Being on iPhone is the only way to make money.

804
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,920
That's a fact.

805
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,840
Sorry, Windows Lumia owners, you fucking broke.

806
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,680
Get an iPhone and get some money, because people are spending money on their iPhones.

807
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,680
They love it.

808
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Snapchat me some bucks.

809
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,760
Snapchat us some bucks.

810
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
We're going to save you a few bucks.

811
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm going to tell you how, you're going to go to onemonth.com slash my brother, and you

812
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,040
can start building your first iPhone app today.

813
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,780
Each class is broken down into 30-minute chunks, so it's really easily doable.

814
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:04,400
You don't have to sit down and do it for an eight-hour block or something interminable

815
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,400
like that.

816
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,320
30 minutes a day for one month, and you're going to become an expert at it.

817
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,720
Now, they have other classes, too.

818
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,860
They have one-month growth hacking, so you can get huge.

819
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Shred your delt with one month.

820
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
I don't think that's-

821
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,320
Your business delts.

822
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
One-month HTML that will teach you-

823
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,240
Your business delts and your accounting abs.

824
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,520
Teach you how to make a website.

825
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,820
One-month rails to help you build your web apps.

826
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,480
If you go to onemonth.com slash my brother, you can get a 25% off discount for one of

827
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,640
these classes, so that's a great deal if you go to onemonth.com slash my brother and get

828
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,840
yourself a skill set.

829
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Now the only thing holding me back is my overwhelming, almost paralytic laziness.

830
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,080
Yeah, but they can't help you with that unless that's what growth hacking is.

831
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,720
Back my lazy brain.

832
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,840
Got a special message from Matthew Hammond from Adam.

833
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,800
Trav, do you want to tell me what they have to say?

834
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,080
Well, Adam says to Matthew, to the beardiest man in China, I'm going to need some documentation

835
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,480
on that, happy candle nights from your home across the sea.

836
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,160
I realize we didn't know about it the last time I saw you, but I guess it's a thing now.

837
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,400
I trust it will be filled with eggnog and revelry.

838
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,120
Two things I can only hope are readily available in your country.

839
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
P.S.

840
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Matthew and Adam are half-brothers, tell all your friends.

841
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,800
The good news about candle nights is it's really more of a state of mind.

842
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
No, it's not.

843
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
It's a specific.

844
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
It's a fluid being.

845
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
It's not.

846
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:38,600
It's a specific octet of days in the last month of the Gregorian year, and it's a state

847
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
of mind.

848
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,060
Yeah, but it's also like a real fluid time, you know what I mean?

849
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,320
What does it mean to you?

850
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,560
What do you think it is?

851
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,240
It's a fluid, transient state of mind that occupies your brain in an octet of days in

852
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,080
the last month of our Gregorian calendar, and it's that simple.

853
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,440
But who knows when that is?

854
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
I do.

855
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
December.

856
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
Nobody.

857
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,440
December, December, December.

858
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,600
December could be any time.

859
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,600
When is December?

860
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
A lot of people are still wondering about that.

861
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
What is December?

862
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,600
What am December?

863
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,680
Matthew, happy candle nights to you from your buddy Adam.

864
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,280
I think that that's very nice that you wished your friend a happy candle nights.

865
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,400
Or half-brother.

866
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Or half-brother.

867
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,840
Jury's still out on that one, even though they explain, when is December?

868
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,240
How are these people related?

869
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,760
Nobody even fucking knows.

870
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,440
Who is this next message for?

871
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,220
This next message is for Ren, and it's from D, D-E, gosh, I hope that's an actual name

872
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,120
and not Denise, and they just got lazy.

873
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,720
D-E, ugh.

874
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Never mind.

875
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:41,640
It's for Rem, it's for Ren, from D.

876
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
Right.

877
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
It could be just a guy named Randy sending it to himself.

878
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Renday.

879
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Renday.

880
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,880
Renday says to himself, happy birthday, here's to the next adventure, short, sweet, to the

881
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
point, easy.

882
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,200
Is this for an adventure of this Money Zone ad?

883
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Yeah.

884
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
We're all on adventure again.

885
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,600
Whoa, barely got through that one.

886
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Yeah.

887
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
Whoa, well this is weird.

888
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:10,200
I've just been handed a map with an X on it, and it says to tell Ren to go to the special

889
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
spot.

890
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
You know the one.

891
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Walk 30 paces.

892
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Walk 30 paces.

893
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Walk 30 paces.

894
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
All right.

895
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,840
Face the sun from using your clitoris as a jumping off point.

896
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
Sundial.

897
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,280
Jump off your clitoris this birthday with one of our brothers.

898
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,560
Wee, it's the magic school bus.

899
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,400
Happy birthday, Ren, I hope it's a great one.

900
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
Sorry about all the clitoris talk.

901
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,080
Sorry again about all the clitoris talk, gosh, if we could go one episode without saying

902
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,080
that.

903
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
I would never.

904
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,080
It would be huge.

905
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,640
I would hit that button on it, an apology.

906
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,400
Sorry about all the clitoris talk, my brother, my brother, and me.

907
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,120
I want to make a quick mention if you're a fan of ours on Facebook or you're a member

908
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,440
of our Facebook group, there's a domestic violence shelter in Heinz, West Virginia,

909
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,280
the only one, in fact, in our hometown called Branches, and they are trying to raise money

910
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,340
to keep the doors open there.

911
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,120
So if you kick in a couple bucks, it'll be money well spent.

912
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,400
The my bim bam angels are already hopping all over it.

913
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,680
If you could pitch in there, that would be great.

914
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
They're doing it.

915
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Just go to our Facebook page.

916
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,840
It's the My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation group, and you can find a link to that, donate

917
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
there.

918
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:23,120
Yeah, they're doing a GoFundMe, so it's easy to help them out.

919
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,880
So please do that.

920
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,960
Oh, also, we're going to have a very special guest, Paul Scheer.

921
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,620
I don't know if it'll be on the next episode, but we are recording, I think, before the

922
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,120
next one goes out.

923
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:41,320
So we could use your questions that we can chat about with Paul Scheer.

924
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,560
Travis, what are his areas of expertise that will guide the questions?

925
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,280
His areas of expertise are Jason Statham movies, thank you notes, and weird collectibles.

926
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,540
I have a weird collection of thank you notes from people who I went to see the Transporter

927
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,600
movies with.

928
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,760
So I think I'm pretty well stopped.

929
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,940
Have you got a question for Paul?

930
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,940
I don't.

931
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,680
I've kind of mastered all of those concepts, yeah, so we'll need other people to chip in.

932
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,840
Also, listen, alert, alert, Valentine's Day is very close.

933
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:19,000
We get a lot of emails from people talking about how much they love that sound effect,

934
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,240
because we do it in every goddamn episode.

935
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Because they weren't paying attention until then, and then we do it, and they're like,

936
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
wait, hold on, shut up, Steven.

937
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,640
Well, hold on, I hear some high-pitched, shitty sounds.

938
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,080
They're doing horrible mouth sounds.

939
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:39,720
ProFlowers is gonna save your keister, ladies and gents, with a gift, a beautiful gift,

940
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,440
if I may say so.

941
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,280
We have received many deliveries from ProFlowers, they have always been quite beautiful.

942
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,840
And quite edible, if you ask my cat.

943
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,720
Yeah, go to proflowers.com, and then you're gonna see a blue microphone in the upper right

944
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
hand corner.

945
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,040
Click on that and type in my brother, and you're gonna get some access to some special

946
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:07,200
deals like two dozen long stem assorted roses with chocolates and a cherry vase for $39.98,

947
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,320
if you can believe that.

948
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:13,960
My cherry vase came in with a bitchin' hot rod paint job, and not that-

949
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,320
There's flame decals, it's awesome.

950
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,560
There is no maraschino-like flavor on the vase.

951
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:28,280
You could get two dozen roses and chocolates with a free vase for $29.99.

952
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:34,200
There's an ultimate long stem Valentine's Day special that has a bear and some flowers

953
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,160
and chocolate and some, look, what appear to be some sorts of lotions.

954
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,780
Justin, can you confirm if the bear is a real bear or a stuffed bear?

955
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,560
It's a real bear, and the only way to pacify it is to squirt the lotion in its eyes, or

956
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,560
it will attack you and-

957
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,920
If you didn't figure that out, then you gotta go back to your last save point and start

958
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
over.

959
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,560
For $39.98, you will go on a bear combat adventure with your beloved.

960
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:07,760
Come find a bear at proflowers.com, click on the blue microphone, enter the code MYBROTHER,

961
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,360
and you're gonna get some additional, some great savings.

962
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,040
And who doesn't want that?

963
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,340
Show somebody you care this year with proflowers.com.

964
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:24,360
If I may suggest, when you deliver these gifts to your sweetie, don't say like, yeah, they're

965
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,280
beautiful and I got them on the cheap.

966
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,640
Maybe keep that bit of info to yourself.

967
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,920
I got full, I got full price love for you, but I paid half price for it.

968
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,000
Your savings are between you and us and God, so we'll keep it that way.

969
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,160
God runs, God runs proflowers, I don't know if you guys know that.

970
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,180
Yeah, it's a, it's a profit deal.

971
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:50,880
Thank you, hey, and listen, thank you LA for coming out and showing your support of us

972
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,120
as we got up there and we did our thing.

973
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,680
We've referenced the Masonic Lodge at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery is a great venue.

974
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,360
Thanks to our very special guest podcast that came out after us and really just fucking

975
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,760
swept the floor with us.

976
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,120
Really showed us, it gave us like a masterclass in podcasting excellence.

977
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,820
We'll find some way, they've agreed to actually let us release that episode.

978
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,000
We'll try and figure out some way to do it.

979
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,080
Maybe as a donor bonus, we got Max Fun Drive coming up pretty soon.

980
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,640
So we'll, we'll, we'll find a way to circulate, circulate the tapes as it were.

981
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,360
Anyway, back to the show.

982
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,720
I close it so I don't know who sent it in because I, Drew, just let me know if you sent

983
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,600
this one in.

984
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:43,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Achaya Siva who asks, what happens when vampire bites a werewolf?

985
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Is that true?

986
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Yeah.

987
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:55,360
This falls into that category of Yahoo Answers that I go, wait, wait, what does?

988
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,800
I writing a vampire book on Wattpad and my character just bit a werewolf.

989
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,680
So now I'm wondering, wait, wait, what did you say?

990
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,120
A vampire book on what?

991
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Wattpad?

992
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm guessing it's a, some sort of, is that a cool hip young person thing?

993
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Yeah.

994
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,120
It's like thought catalog, but for werewolves.

995
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm writing a vampire book on LiveJournal.

996
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:19,120
So now I'm wondering if a vampire's bite somehow affects a werewolf in any way.

997
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,040
I already know what happens when a werewolf bites a vampire.

998
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,840
Well, oh, okay.

999
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,620
We all took high school chemistry.

1000
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,960
Please tell me if you know what happened when a vampire bites a werewolf.

1001
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,280
Someone's in the front row whispering to a friend saying, well, clearly, do you know

1002
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
the answer?

1003
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,880
Oh, I thought you were whispering about what happens.

1004
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Could you read the first line of the first answer, please?

1005
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,200
Jesus Christ, you ask a simple question about fantasy critters and some douchebag thinks

1006
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,140
you asked for a sermon about the frigging evil Girl Scouts.

1007
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
Some people.

1008
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,480
Anyway, where was I?

1009
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,480
Oh yeah.

1010
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Jesus Christ.

1011
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,800
Lost my train of thought there, I got so angry.

1012
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,600
What happens though when a vampire bites a werewolf?

1013
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,280
I think the werewolf goes, what the fuck?

1014
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,280
What does he gain?

1015
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,680
So okay, most of the mythology I've seen is that a vampire has to feed on you and you

1016
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,160
have to feed on a vampire and normally you wouldn't think that a werewolf would do this,

1017
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,240
but you would have to assume a vampire bites a werewolf.

1018
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,760
They're locked in combat, correct?

1019
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,480
We can all agree vampires and werewolves are better enemies.

1020
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,680
Look in your hearts.

1021
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,320
Watch fucking Vampire Diaries or Twilight or any of our home movies.

1022
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,200
You'll see vampires and werewolves are better enemies.

1023
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,760
So the vampire has bit the werewolf, the werewolf has probably bitten the vampire.

1024
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Sixty-ninin.

1025
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:49,960
I want to hear Griffin's story now, you're out.

1026
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
You're out.

1027
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Tag Justin, tag me in.

1028
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:54,960
Sixty bite?

1029
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Is that a thing?

1030
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,400
Start at the beginning and talk slow.

1031
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,800
Well, it's not, they're not really sixty.

1032
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,360
They're not really sixty-ninin.

1033
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,960
It's just, you know, you do a double nose bite.

1034
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
They're sixteen sixty-ninin.

1035
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Oh shit.

1036
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,960
I figured it out.

1037
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I figured it out.

1038
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Nothing?

1039
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
Nope.

1040
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
It's fair.

1041
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
They bite each other on the necks.

1042
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Same time.

1043
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Boom.

1044
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Right?

1045
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:16,960
And then they...

1046
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,960
What?

1047
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
What?

1048
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,960
What's your addition?

1049
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,960
Do you know?

1050
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,960
You saw the answer?

1051
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Whisper it.

1052
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
No, he's saying whisper.

1053
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,960
Oh, you want me to whisper my answer?

1054
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,960
ASMR it.

1055
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,960
ASMR it.

1056
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,960
ASMR it.

1057
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I guess I'll ASMR this thing.

1058
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,960
Everybody, I need complete and utter silence.

1059
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,960
Or I can't finish.

1060
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,400
You can't fucking laugh.

1061
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,280
We do a bite sixty-nine.

1062
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,240
And they both just like, just suck that.

1063
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Shut up.

1064
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,480
We're never going to get a YouTube smash hit.

1065
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,640
They both suck that monster fluid out so hard.

1066
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,680
And then, but they both suck all of it out.

1067
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,320
All of a sudden, the vampire's a werewolf, werewolf's a vampire.

1068
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,160
They fucking switch all their fluids around.

1069
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,600
They do a complete fluid rotation.

1070
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Vampire's a werewolf, werewolf's a vampire.

1071
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,600
Oh, so not like a vamp, werewolf, or were-vampire.

1072
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
They're like, they switch places.

1073
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:22,280
No, I'm saying a complete, 100% fluid transaction.

1074
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,280
Do you think we can mix?

1075
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,280
Total monster conversion.

1076
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,240
No, I need you to look at Griffin's face and how happy he is about this.

1077
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,960
Just think about it.

1078
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,360
First of all, why is the werewolf sucking blood?

1079
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:34,360
That's not his M.O.

1080
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,360
He's thirsty.

1081
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,360
What do you want from him?

1082
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,360
What's he going to do?

1083
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,360
Drink a lemonade?

1084
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,360
Come on, Griffin.

1085
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,360
Full point.

1086
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Sixty-nine monster drain.

1087
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:45,640
Okay, seriously, what liquid would you see a werewolf...

1088
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,360
Three-sixty no-look.

1089
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,200
What werewolf would you see, what drink would you see a werewolf drinking and you think,

1090
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,200
yep, other than blood?

1091
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Powerade?

1092
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Nope.

1093
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
That's a good point.

1094
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
Pink lemonade?

1095
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,200
Absolutely not.

1096
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
Monster?

1097
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,200
Monster, someone said.

1098
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,200
On the nose.

1099
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,200
A little on the nose.

1100
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,200
That's fine.

1101
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
You want to change places?

1102
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:13,440
When we put that on the tube, I think we should mix it stereophonically so I'm in one ear

1103
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,480
and Trous is in the other so you really feel like you're here.

1104
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
When you hear...

1105
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Those are blood-drinking noises.

1106
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,480
Did everyone get their ASMR rocks off?

1107
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,960
Is that important to me?

1108
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,960
You feel the tingles?

1109
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
Excellent.

1110
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,480
I'm the gal you guys created life with during the last LA show.

1111
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,760
That's not what it sounds like.

1112
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,080
Thanks for the advice.

1113
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,560
We're now expecting that baby.

1114
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,560
My friend Julie and I are...

1115
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,320
Congratulations or whatever.

1116
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
My friend...

1117
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,520
Sorry, after you have a baby, it's kind of like, yeah, I get it.

1118
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,240
My friend Julie and I are coming again to enjoy your advice stylings.

1119
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,720
So here's another question.

1120
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,240
Do you have any specific suggestions on baby names?

1121
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:01,440
We got a couple of possibles, but naming a human is hard.

1122
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,160
Specific name suggestions or general ideas would be appreciated.

1123
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,160
Linda, Linda, are you here?

1124
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,160
Linda.

1125
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,480
We should explain.

1126
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,920
If you miss that show, Linda asked us if she should have a child and we said, it's not

1127
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,280
going to be our problem, so sure, go for it.

1128
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:21,080
And then she did that night.

1129
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,920
Well, I don't know that the timing works out so well on that.

1130
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,920
Wait, what is it?

1131
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Fuck.

1132
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,920
Linda.

1133
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,920
We got to go ahead.

1134
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,920
It's time to party.

1135
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:33,920
Are we going to be pod fathers?

1136
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,480
Linda, do you know Boy or Girl?

1137
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,760
Oh, that makes things a lot easier on us.

1138
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Sorry.

1139
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Easy.

1140
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
Lieutenant.

1141
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
Could you...

1142
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
Wait, what's your last name?

1143
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Wait, you don't have to say it.

1144
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,760
What's your social security number?

1145
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,000
It's your Netflix password.

1146
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,480
Give us your thumbprint.

1147
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,120
Show your thumbprint on paper.

1148
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,400
Everyone can do that, right?

1149
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:11,400
Have you considered nature box?

1150
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,680
A streamer's chance.

1151
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,560
Brand your child.

1152
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
Early in all of them.

1153
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,160
I went through, you don't know how many permutations of when I was trying to name our child, Charlie

1154
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,160
the baby.

1155
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,160
Hi, Charlie, if you're listening.

1156
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,160
In 15 years.

1157
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,520
In the future.

1158
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,720
If you're younger than 15, turn the fucking show off right now.

1159
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,760
Because he's about to tell you where the treasure is buried.

1160
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:34,760
I went...

1161
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,160
Also, we just talked about Monster 69, eh?

1162
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,160
I went...

1163
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,160
Yeah, there's no way.

1164
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,720
She's like, ugh, I can't.

1165
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,320
We went through every permutation of like, Batman, no, Batman the baby, no, Batman the

1166
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,680
baby, Junior McElroy, no, Batman the comic of the movie, no.

1167
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,880
Have you thought about Kraken so that every time you let her out of her heart, him out

1168
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,840
of his harness or his like crib, you can say, release the Kraken.

1169
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,240
Yeah, that's pretty good.

1170
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,640
Because when you name a baby, it should be for one easy goof.

1171
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,320
I mean, Justin's obvious.

1172
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,140
Yeah, it's like, I think we should probably, we've been involved so far.

1173
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,600
We kind of have been carrying the load a little, like a lot.

1174
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,200
What does Justin mean?

1175
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,200
What?

1176
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,200
What does it mean?

1177
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,320
What does Justin...

1178
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:34,040
How long have you got, man?

1179
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,840
You wait till you're 34, you're going to be asking yourself a lot of questions like that.

1180
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:44,520
What does Justin mean?

1181
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
What did you do?

1182
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
Oh, fuck me.

1183
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,520
Perfect.

1184
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Just what you needed.

1185
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:53,360
If you're listening at home, I just ripped off my shirt again and my muscles were even

1186
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:59,160
bigger and they went nuts for it.

1187
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,520
Can we combine our names into one totally great name?

1188
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,800
What would that sound like?

1189
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Boo-shimmy.

1190
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,020
None of us have a B.

1191
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,440
Or a shim or an E.

1192
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Okay.

1193
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,800
That always goes by Chaboy, right?

1194
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,800
Fair.

1195
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,800
Lieutenant Boo-shimmy McElroy.

1196
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,800
Lieutenant Boo-shimmy Chaboy McElroy.

1197
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,500
Can you tell us an invented last name so we can have something to work with?

1198
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,500
Just make it up.

1199
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,500
Just make it up.

1200
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,500
Whatever.

1201
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,500
We'll take it from anybody in the audience.

1202
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,500
It's time to put you on the spot.

1203
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,560
Everybody promises not to identity theft them.

1204
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,560
Come on.

1205
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:40,200
Now, give me a location, give me a location someplace where you might go on a first date.

1206
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
I have a veterinarian's office.

1207
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Okay.

1208
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,200
I've heard aerobics.

1209
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,200
Okay.

1210
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Venet...

1211
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Ven...

1212
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,200
Ving Rhames Aerobics.

1213
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,320
Is that what you're saying?

1214
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,400
I was thinking like...

1215
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,400
Like J-trigger.

1216
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,400
Why?

1217
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:57,640
For the last name or for the first name?

1218
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,640
For both.

1219
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,640
Okay.

1220
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,640
Say it again.

1221
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:01,640
J-trigger.

1222
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,600
So it'd have to go back to that J-trigger J-trigger.

1223
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:08,080
I'm Lieutenant J-trigger J-trigger.

1224
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:12,120
Have you picked out his last name yet?

1225
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,120
You laugh.

1226
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,120
But you can do whatever.

1227
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,120
It's 2015.

1228
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,120
Yeah.

1229
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,120
You can play Calvin Ball.

1230
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Let's...

1231
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,280
Should we take some audience questions?

1232
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,720
Calvin Ball is a great first name.

1233
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
It's been...

1234
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,720
Yeah.

1235
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,720
I guess.

1236
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,720
Yeah.

1237
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,720
We've checked out.

1238
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,720
So let's do audience questions.

1239
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,720
Can we do one?

1240
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Okay.

1241
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,720
Here's what we do.

1242
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:34,080
I'm going to read one more and that person comes on stage and that'll be our segue into

1243
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,080
audience questions.

1244
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080
You don't have to line up or whatever.

1245
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
We'll call on you.

1246
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,080
Yeah.

1247
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,080
No bummers.

1248
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:46,120
Remember, seriously, if you fucking kill this, oof, hypothetically speaking, do you know

1249
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
who that is?

1250
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,120
Are you here?

1251
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
Come on up.

1252
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,640
Someone just got real nervous.

1253
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,720
Come on up.

1254
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,720
Come on up.

1255
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
Come on up.

1256
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,640
No, no, no, no, no.

1257
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,600
They approach in silence.

1258
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,600
Everybody just relax.

1259
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,680
Just look.

1260
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Don't speak.

1261
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
Don't speak.

1262
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
Hello.

1263
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,760
Okay, here we go.

1264
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,360
Hypothetically speaking, this is a fucking really funny question.

1265
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,880
This is why I wanted to bring you up.

1266
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,960
Hypothetically speaking, would you consider attending the live recording of a podcast,

1267
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,240
perhaps one that focused on the alchemy like creation of wisdom, good material for a second

1268
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,240
date?

1269
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,040
Follow up question.

1270
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:37,880
Absolutely hypothetical.

1271
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:46,040
Do you think it would make a good second impression if I, I mean Jane Doe, submitted a question

1272
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,480
about whether or not this second absolutely hypothetical date is a good idea?

1273
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,600
Does it make a funny story or a cautionary tale?

1274
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:04,120
And that's from totally not in the audience right now.

1275
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:08,520
The jig, the jig, as they say, is up.

1276
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,520
Hey, Debra.

1277
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,520
Hey, Debra, should I email the brothers?

1278
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,600
They won't like make this completely on blast.

1279
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,600
It might be cool.

1280
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,600
Right?

1281
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,600
Yeah, yeah, that's probably true.

1282
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:23,880
So like, wait, well, I mean, now I have to ask, how's a good one?

1283
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,560
You'll have to speak at some point.

1284
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,560
He didn't come.

1285
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:31,560
Oh, what the fuck?

1286
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
What the fuck?

1287
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,360
What's his name?

1288
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,080
Just first names, please.

1289
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,080
For legal issues.

1290
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,080
Lieutenant.

1291
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,080
Lieutenant.

1292
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:45,320
Well, listen, no, listen, listen, listen.

1293
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,360
If he has served in our military forces, I don't think that we can.

1294
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,440
They don't legally change your first name to Lieutenant when you join the military.

1295
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,440
Yeah, they do.

1296
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,440
It's to like.

1297
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Lieutenant Dan.

1298
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
Yes.

1299
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,840
It's how they make you part of like the machine or whatever.

1300
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:05,960
So they say private and like 40 guys like, yup.

1301
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,200
Well, now it's awkward to say like, yeah, that'd be totally great second date.

1302
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,200
To be fair, though, he's still a funny story.

1303
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,200
What?

1304
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,200
Yeah, I mean, now.

1305
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:15,920
No, it's a great story about fuck that dude.

1306
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,920
Yeah.

1307
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:17,920
Just so I'm clear, he did pay though, right?

1308
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,920
I mean, he still bought the ticket.

1309
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Oh, no.

1310
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,920
What the fuck?

1311
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,480
I got a mouth to feed.

1312
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
Okay.

1313
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Come here.

1314
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:39,160
So this was literally a hypothetical, okay.

1315
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,040
To answer your question, I think it's fine.

1316
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:49,760
One time I went on a second date to see the film, a hundred and twenty seven hours.

1317
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,880
I forget how many hours that man was trapped between those rocks.

1318
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,680
It was a bunch of hours.

1319
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,000
I think it was a hundred and twenty seven hours.

1320
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,960
And I actually did throw up in my mouth while I was watching the movie.

1321
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,400
And it was like, if you're going to throw up in your mouth, I did it probably as smoothly

1322
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,400
as you could do it.

1323
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,400
But yeah.

1324
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,760
It was like two hours in.

1325
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,080
He was like chewing to his own bone veins.

1326
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:18,120
I was like, whoa, hold up.

1327
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
That's fucked up.

1328
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,960
I didn't know you had bone veins.

1329
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,960
And homeboy was like going to golden corral on those motherfuckers.

1330
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
And so I threw up a little bit in my mouth, literally.

1331
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,480
I know that's a thing people say.

1332
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,680
It can happen to you while you're watching twenty seven hours.

1333
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:38,040
I played it off real smooth, but we didn't see each other again.

1334
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:44,640
Jane, if it makes you feel any better, the first girl I ever actually dated, our first

1335
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:52,720
date was bowling with her family.

1336
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:53,720
Be cool, you guys.

1337
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,720
Be cool.

1338
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
He's coming out for the first time ever.

1339
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
I didn't even know that.

1340
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,520
Our second date was seeing Bridges of Madison County.

1341
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,160
Nice.

1342
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,160
I spent.

1343
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,160
I can top that.

1344
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,160
I can top that.

1345
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,160
I can top that.

1346
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Not a joke.

1347
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,400
I spent the what felt to me five hours and thirty minute running time of Bridges Madison

1348
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,000
County putting my arm around her.

1349
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,240
So literally.

1350
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,240
Show me on.

1351
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:18,240
Yeah.

1352
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:24,280
Even even if you had time lapse, it would look like this.

1353
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,760
And I mean, literally, this is accelerated, right?

1354
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,680
Like like five hours elapsed in about 30 seconds.

1355
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,680
She would not.

1356
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:37,760
She would have at the by the fucking time she was swept away by fucking Clint Eastwood.

1357
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
Spoilers.

1358
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
OK, sorry.

1359
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,160
By the time the credits rolled, she would have sworn with her hand on the Bible that

1360
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,600
my hand had always been on her shoulder.

1361
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,600
That was the speed at which has always been there, will always be Justin's hand.

1362
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,440
I think it was there when I was.

1363
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,600
There was moss connecting your hand and shoulder.

1364
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,120
There was went on a first date to see the notebook.

1365
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,120
OK.

1366
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
And I know fresh.

1367
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,840
I left like a baby.

1368
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Yeah.

1369
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,840
And she did not.

1370
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,960
All right.

1371
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,840
And I chose to never see her again because she was a robot.

1372
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,880
Bounces off you first date.

1373
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,840
I went on with this with a young lady.

1374
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:18,800
We were in Godfuck like middle school.

1375
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,920
And it was also my first date ever.

1376
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:26,760
We went to see the Prince of Egypt.

1377
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,840
The animated movie with Johnny Osmond.

1378
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:40,160
I learned for these to get you laid.

1379
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,840
So I guess what we're saying, Jane, is did that help?

1380
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,160
We're saying you could have fucked up so much worse.

1381
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,160
This was like.

1382
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,160
Yeah.

1383
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
This was.

1384
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah.

1385
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,160
He didn't deserve you.

1386
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,160
Yeah.

1387
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
You're way better than that.

1388
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,160
If any single men are out there.

1389
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,160
Don't fucking do that.

1390
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,440
That's not going to fucking turn our podcast into Grinder.

1391
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,800
Thank you, Jane, so much for joining us.

1392
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,280
You want to get some people up here?

1393
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,280
Yeah.

1394
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
All right.

1395
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Let's take another question from the audience.

1396
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,280
Raise your hand if you have a question.

1397
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,480
Not a bummer at all.

1398
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,760
Let's get Drew up here first because like we owe him our lives.

1399
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,760
Yeah.

1400
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,760
Drew.

1401
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:25,200
I like when Drew comes on stage because it puts us in scale.

1402
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,200
He's a big guy.

1403
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
God, look at you.

1404
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,400
He's a giant of a man.

1405
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,400
Strong like a bull.

1406
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,400
Look at that.

1407
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
He's standing.

1408
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
He isn't even on the stage right now.

1409
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
He's standing on the steps.

1410
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
And he's still six times stronger than I am.

1411
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:36,400
Griffin, go stand next to him.

1412
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,400
No, I don't want to do that.

1413
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:42,360
No, I have to pee like so fucking bad if I stand up.

1414
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,360
The show's over.

1415
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,360
Go ahead.

1416
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,880
A little behind the scenes.

1417
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,320
I have a question that probably only you three and one other person can answer.

1418
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,320
Okay.

1419
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,320
Who's gaslighting me?

1420
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Someone in this room.

1421
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,760
Gaslighting Drew.

1422
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,160
I saw a hand move.

1423
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,160
Are you doing it?

1424
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:02,160
No.

1425
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,160
That was very suspicious.

1426
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:04,160
It was very suspicious.

1427
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,400
It was very shifty, madam.

1428
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:10,760
Somebody wrote Drew Davenport a very sweet message that we read a lot on the show, realizing

1429
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,440
as we read it that it was a sweet message to Drew Davenport.

1430
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,440
I don't know if you know this.

1431
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,960
I get a lot of emails, Yahoo submissions, hand of God from people to the Mabim Bam email

1432
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,760
account with Yahoo submissions with the name Drew Davenport, but it's not you.

1433
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:32,880
There are false prophets among us that create Gmail shits like Drew hyphen Davenport.

1434
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,400
I'm like, that ain't it.

1435
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,160
That's not the legit email address.

1436
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:42,080
You have a lot of impersonators, but I know the true flavor.

1437
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,480
Drew, how do you feel being gaslighted?

1438
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
Gaslit I think.

1439
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,480
Gaslit?

1440
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,480
Gas hung.

1441
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,120
At first it was like, oh, that's so sweet.

1442
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
I was really excited.

1443
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,480
And then it started to grow.

1444
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,480
Yeah.

1445
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,000
Someone should have came forward at some point and it never happened.

1446
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Should we just tell them?

1447
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,600
Is it getting like, do you find a dead bird in your car or something?

1448
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:11,160
No, just a lot of notes, like I'm watching, I don't know.

1449
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,240
You scared the shit out of me.

1450
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,080
Man, I feel like this show has done at least a little bit of good for a few people out

1451
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,040
there in the world, but if you got murdered, it would cancel all that out I think.

1452
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:28,880
Drew, let's just say there's a very good, there's a very good reason we're doing this

1453
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,520
show at the Masonic Lodge.

1454
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,560
Was it the tip?

1455
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:39,240
I can't say anything, but yes.

1456
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:44,680
If you're listening at home, we are not making triangles with our fingers.

1457
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:45,680
Where are my people at?

1458
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,680
I know some of you are out there.

1459
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:47,680
We'll edit this out, right Grimmon?

1460
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,680
Yes.

1461
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,680
Yeah.

1462
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,760
We'll edit out the shapes in our hands made from the audio recording.

1463
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,840
Drew, I'm so sorry that we've brought to light all of your stalkers.

1464
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:58,880
But can I tell you, you fucking love it.

1465
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
Sorry.

1466
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,880
Love that shit.

1467
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,880
Sorry we ruined your life.

1468
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:02,880
Drew Davenport, everybody.

1469
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:03,880
Yeah.

1470
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,880
Who's next?

1471
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,880
I saw that hand go up first.

1472
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,880
Yep.

1473
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,080
Come on up with the sweet vest.

1474
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,960
Are you not cold?

1475
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,360
It's not a very protective vest from the elements.

1476
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:19,400
So I'm here with my girlfriend.

1477
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:20,400
What's your name?

1478
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,400
My name's Kenji.

1479
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,400
Kenji.

1480
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,400
How's it going?

1481
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,400
Going good.

1482
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
So I'm here with my girlfriend.

1483
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,400
Hi.

1484
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,400
Yo.

1485
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,960
And the question I have is, my ex will not leave me alone to the point that it's actually

1486
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,880
kind of like really bad and dangerous and it's actually affecting our relationship now.

1487
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,160
Kenji, I just want to stop you one second.

1488
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,160
Yeah?

1489
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,800
You are on a fucking razor's edge, my friend.

1490
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,960
If you take us into Bummer Town- Not literally, don't look behind you, Kenji.

1491
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,960
Not literally.

1492
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,880
Well, I thought you meant like the edge of the-

1493
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,680
Just pull it off of that.

1494
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,680
You gotta-

1495
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,680
She's a downer.

1496
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
Come on, man.

1497
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
She's a downer.

1498
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
Listen to your girlfriend, Kenji.

1499
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
She saved it.

1500
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
Congratulations.

1501
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Okay.

1502
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
Do you want us to get rid of her?

1503
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Is that what it would've been?

1504
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
Does she listen?

1505
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:06,680
We have a particular set of skills, but it's boner jokes.

1506
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:11,600
There's one thing we're good at, it's ruining relationships.

1507
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,560
Let Kenji- We don't even need to be here anymore.

1508
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,200
Let Kenji finish for once.

1509
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,200
Sorry, Kenji.

1510
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,200
Sorry, Kenji, every time.

1511
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:26,000
No, the question I have is, what can I do to get the ex to stop?

1512
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
How tied are you to Hollywood?

1513
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Because I want her to stop.

1514
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,560
I have asked her to stop, and she won't.

1515
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,000
You can go my route and gain like 50 pounds.

1516
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,080
Is it really?

1517
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,480
It was that funny?

1518
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,480
Kenji and-

1519
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,480
Kelsey.

1520
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,480
Kelsey.

1521
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,480
Cool.

1522
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,480
Kelsey and Kenji.

1523
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,480
You guys are doing so good together.

1524
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,640
Yeah, by the way, that's amazing.

1525
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,440
You guys locked it down.

1526
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,600
Just pretend like it's a debt collector and pretend like it doesn't exist.

1527
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Yeah.

1528
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,600
Is that not what you do?

1529
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,760
It's what I have traditionally done.

1530
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,560
What effect does she- She has no effect.

1531
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,560
She can do all she wants.

1532
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,500
She can put forth all the energy she wants.

1533
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,480
Unless she's putting dead rabbits into stews, you got nothing to do.

1534
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,480
Dead rabbits into stews?

1535
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,480
That's where they fucking go.

1536
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,480
I want to know.

1537
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:16,280
What are you fucking talking about?

1538
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:21,720
Unless she's like cutting up potatoes and putting it in soup.

1539
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:25,560
Unless she's like cutting up meat and seasoning it and putting it on grills, like fucking

1540
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:26,560
ignore her.

1541
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,560
Well, I mean-

1542
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:28,560
Is she working a restaurant?

1543
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,560
What's she doing?

1544
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:36,360
Also, have you guys ever had to deal with a situation like that?

1545
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,360
Just like a crazy ex that won't leave you alone.

1546
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,360
Like a crazy ex that won't leave you alone.

1547
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:43,360
With a woman being obsessed with us?

1548
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,360
Look at me, Kenji.

1549
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,360
Look at me.

1550
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:46,360
Look at me.

1551
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,360
Oh, man.

1552
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:48,360
How many times?

1553
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:55,160
At Prince of Egypt date, she was like, come on, we got to go see Exodus.

1554
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:00,400
It's like, it's been like 21 years.

1555
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,200
I love the way you cry in the notebook.

1556
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,200
Let it go.

1557
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,480
Let it go.

1558
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,840
It's like Prince of Egypt, but not animated and Donnie Osmond's not in it.

1559
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:11,520
Like what's the fucking point?

1560
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:18,640
I saw a preview for a NBC special for the New Testament, a mini series coming up.

1561
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,200
Talk about yourself, Kenji.

1562
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,840
Just one second, Kenji.

1563
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:26,920
And the opening of the trailer said, from the producers of the Bible.

1564
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,760
I was like, I'm so glad that fool wrote something else.

1565
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,720
It's like Harper Lee coming back and writing again.

1566
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,280
The Bible was so good, but like, what's next?

1567
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:48,000
So Kenji, seriously, have you been straight up with this girl and said like, we're done.

1568
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,520
Like I couldn't be less interested in you.

1569
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:55,120
Did you tell her we broke up six months ago, get the net?

1570
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,920
I don't even have a gun.

1571
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,040
It's been off for a while now and she says, yeah.

1572
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,680
If you've been clear and you've been straightforward, you've literally done all you can do except

1573
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:06,680
for like a legal restraining order.

1574
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,680
I've tried to be nice with her.

1575
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,440
I've tried to be civil, you know.

1576
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,440
Restraining order.

1577
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,440
Yeah.

1578
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,840
Did she give you a gun rack?

1579
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,840
We just did that one.

1580
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,840
We did that joke.

1581
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,360
I'm just going to fucking keep doing it until you stop laughing.

1582
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,360
Don't laugh at this.

1583
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,920
I don't even own a gun.

1584
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,920
We literally said that.

1585
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,920
We fucking literally just said that.

1586
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,560
Remember when I simultaneously said, Hennessy P. Jones over there.

1587
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,840
That's a great baby name.

1588
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,340
We had a- Hennessy P. Jones, we found it.

1589
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,680
We had a meeting with a business person today for business and we all remarked to each other

1590
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:44,680
that sincerely in our heart of hearts, we were disappointed that the meeting didn't

1591
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:53,600
end with the person saying, and I have a cashier's check here for $5,000 each.

1592
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,160
So yeah, if you've been clear and you've done all you can do, legal, go legal.

1593
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,960
That's why laws exist, dog.

1594
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,760
Not just to like fuck you over because you parked your car in a place where it wasn't

1595
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,560
supposed to be or whatever.

1596
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:11,160
I know that's like 99% of our exposure to the man, but sometimes it'll get you out of

1597
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:12,160
a pickle.

1598
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Thank you, Kenji.

1599
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,160
Say thank you, Kenji.

1600
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,160
Thank you.

1601
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,160
One more.

1602
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:23,160
Let's go a little bit deeper.

1603
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,760
Are there any ladies here that would like our advice?

1604
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,760
We just did two dudes.

1605
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
I see a lady right there.

1606
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,760
Right there.

1607
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,760
Yes.

1608
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:29,760
Come on up.

1609
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
You wooed.

1610
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,640
Give her a round of applause.

1611
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,440
And might I say sweet t-shirt.

1612
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,440
That is a nice t-shirt.

1613
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,440
I'd love to buy one of those in the lobby.

1614
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,440
Yeah.

1615
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,440
Go out there.

1616
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:42,440
They're for sale.

1617
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,800
Travis's wife will sell you one.

1618
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,880
Don't be weird to her though.

1619
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:46,880
Don't be weird.

1620
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:47,880
Be cool.

1621
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:48,880
Can you give me one name?

1622
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,880
What's your name and what's your question?

1623
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,880
My name is Jolene.

1624
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,880
Jolene?

1625
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:52,880
Talking to the microphone, Jolene.

1626
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:53,880
Yeah.

1627
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,880
Don't be scared.

1628
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:55,880
Jolene, can I ask you a question?

1629
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,600
Are you sick of that song or is that song your fucking jam?

1630
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Which one?

1631
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,600
There's like nine of them.

1632
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:01,600
What?

1633
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,400
Jolene Lamontagne's like, hold up, I got a good song name too.

1634
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,400
Like do you?

1635
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,400
Because Dolly Parton like took it.

1636
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,880
You cannot beat that fucking DP joint.

1637
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,880
I get the Dolly Parton one all the time.

1638
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,880
Okay.

1639
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:12,880
It's only because it's like the best song ever.

1640
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:13,880
But go ahead.

1641
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:16,680
Hey Jolene, just between you and I, if you don't talk into the microphone, people can't

1642
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:17,680
hear you.

1643
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,680
Yeah.

1644
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:19,680
Okay.

1645
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:20,680
There we go.

1646
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:21,680
That's better.

1647
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,680
What's up?

1648
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:26,400
So my husband who is here, he has become like completely addicted to like board games and

1649
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:27,400
could play them 24-7.

1650
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,400
Sure.

1651
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,680
Really glad you said board games.

1652
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:34,160
There are a bunch of different avenues that could have gone down that would've been awful.

1653
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,840
That's really the best one.

1654
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:39,160
He's become really addicted to murdering.

1655
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,160
For crack.

1656
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,400
He murders people to take the crack away from the people who have all the crack.

1657
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,400
What do I do?

1658
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,400
Okay.

1659
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,400
Board games.

1660
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400
Go on.

1661
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:48,400
Okay.

1662
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,400
Board games.

1663
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:50,400
And remember, just like get really close to that mic.

1664
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,760
He could play them like 24-7 with his friends all the time.

1665
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,000
I could play them maybe 24 minutes every other week.

1666
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
But he says, well, why don't we do some of your hobbies?

1667
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,440
I don't have any hobbies.

1668
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:02,440
I don't know what I like.

1669
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,120
And you establish that among the things you like, Catan, not one of them.

1670
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,120
Not great.

1671
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,120
Not great.

1672
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,160
So what are some good hobbies to do?

1673
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,640
If I may, let me ask you this.

1674
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,780
And feel free not to answer or to give a range.

1675
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:16,780
How old are you?

1676
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:17,780
I'm 24.

1677
01:09:17,780 --> 01:09:18,780
Great.

1678
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:24,480
The world is so literally going for people to be younger than 30, but go on.

1679
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:33,760
I think a cool hobby would be staying up until 11 o'clock.

1680
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:37,520
The greatest opportunity you have, I assume you live in Los Angeles?

1681
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,520
No, we're from Utah.

1682
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
Oh, I'm done.

1683
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,520
No, fuck off.

1684
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,520
Fuck off.

1685
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,520
West Virginia guy.

1686
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,520
Hey, we're big time now.

1687
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,520
Yeah.

1688
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:52,240
No, but like in any city, there are like classes offered anywhere.

1689
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,560
So like if you're like, I kind of like to cook, wait, take a cooking class.

1690
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,960
If you're like, I kind of like movies, take a film class.

1691
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,440
You're a millionaire, right?

1692
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,120
That can afford to buy like cooking classes.

1693
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,160
Yes, because every class costs $20,000.

1694
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:10,560
We also, we don't like people and stuff, so we wouldn't like go out to find-

1695
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:11,560
It's 2015, nobody likes people.

1696
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:12,560
Can I ask you a question?

1697
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,120
If you were to play a board game with just the two of you, would you enjoy that?

1698
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:21,000
Or is it just like, because like my wife, God love her, she doesn't enjoy board games.

1699
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,960
Like almost to a point where I feel like it's intentional, like because she knows how much

1700
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,720
joy brings me, she wants to deprive me of it.

1701
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,800
You guys don't know who his wife is, right?

1702
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,080
So this is totally cool.

1703
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,560
This is fine if you bad mouth her.

1704
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:36,560
She didn't know.

1705
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,000
I love the woman very dearly.

1706
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,240
She gave me my child, my world, my everything.

1707
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:46,100
She doesn't like board games.

1708
01:10:46,100 --> 01:10:51,120
One time my wife beat me at Settlers of Bataan and then we stopped playing board games together.

1709
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,880
You're a very big person.

1710
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,200
You gotta, can you find, what?

1711
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,200
Can you give us anything?

1712
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:58,200
Can you give us anything?

1713
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,560
What do you like even if you don't think it's a hobby?

1714
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:02,560
What do you like?

1715
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,600
We like- No, what do you like?

1716
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:05,600
What do you like?

1717
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:06,600
This is about you now.

1718
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,600
I like podcasts.

1719
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,600
Ignore all these people.

1720
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,600
You like podcasts.

1721
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,600
Podcasts.

1722
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Podcasts are not a very good shared experience.

1723
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,600
No, it's not.

1724
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,120
Let's sit here and just not talk for an hour.

1725
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:20,200
Hey, did you, listen, shut up.

1726
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Make your own podcast.

1727
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
Yeah, it's easy.

1728
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,200
I've been wanting to do that forever, but he doesn't think we have anything to talk about.

1729
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,200
Listen, can I throw it out?

1730
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,200
Board games.

1731
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,200
Why are you laughing?

1732
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
This is serious.

1733
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:35,520
Do a podcast in which he loves board games and you do not, and it's about him trying

1734
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,520
to sell you.

1735
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,520
Yeah, that's going to be really compelling.

1736
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,000
I really like Catan because it's like every time it's different because the hexes are

1737
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
always shoved.

1738
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Fuck this.

1739
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,840
Can I just say, I would listen to that.

1740
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,000
I would listen to a show of somebody describing how cool Catan is and somebody making wet

1741
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
fart noises.

1742
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I would do that.

1743
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,600
That's the most successful podcast.

1744
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:59,600
That is serial two Catan wet fart sounds.

1745
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,440
I really like it because it's like different strategies every time you go for longest road,

1746
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,440
biggest army.

1747
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:05,440
Why isn't this digital?

1748
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,440
Boo.

1749
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:07,440
That'd be good.

1750
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,440
Yeah.

1751
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,840
So there you go.

1752
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,840
We did it.

1753
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,840
We did it.

1754
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,840
Another one for the brothers.

1755
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
Thank you.

1756
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,840
I think that's a wrap up.

1757
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
Yeah.

1758
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:26,780
Listen, folks, thank you so much for having us here at the Masonic Lodge, the beautiful

1759
01:12:26,780 --> 01:12:28,200
Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

1760
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,200
They have been fucking excellent.

1761
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,200
They've been super, super great.

1762
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,200
Big round of applause for them.

1763
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Yeah.

1764
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:40,440
If you haven't had a chance, just like walk around and look at all of the things they

1765
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:44,840
have here, because they have a lot of really great things, especially at night and let

1766
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,960
them lock the gate while you're still here and just live here.

1767
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:56,840
We want to thank Maximum of Fun dot org, a podcast network that we were proud members

1768
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
of.

1769
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:10,240
They have great shows like Oh No, Ross and Carrie, Bunker Buddies, Saw Bones, and I'm

1770
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,240
a fan.

1771
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,240
I think we should try Bunker Buddies again.

1772
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,240
The Adventure Zone is another one.

1773
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,240
Are there other Macroid podcasts?

1774
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:26,640
There are other Macroid family podcasts.

1775
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,040
Jordan and Jessica, Judge John Hodgson, RISC, The Memory Palace.

1776
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:31,040
Flop House.

1777
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:32,040
The Flop House.

1778
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,040
Yes.

1779
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,760
Try and get a video project on Kickstarter.

1780
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,400
Brian Lindsay will totally eat that.

1781
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,800
Go kickstart that.

1782
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:47,680
It is a full podcast, Cornucopia, and we are so proud to be a part of their vast family.

1783
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,440
So yeah, but above all else, thank you guys for coming.

1784
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,440
Thank you.

1785
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:56,240
You guys have been a wonderful audience.

1786
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,560
Our closer is going to be coming on immediately after we finish the show.

1787
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,040
I hope you're as kind to them as you have been to us.

1788
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,040
Yeah.

1789
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,040
They're super nervous to get out here.

1790
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,040
You guys have been so cool.

1791
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,040
I'm going to run to the bathroom.

1792
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,040
Are you guys ready?

1793
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,400
I mean, are you really going to go?

1794
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,400
You better fucking hurry.

1795
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:12,400
Yeah, yeah.

1796
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,400
You don't want to miss a minute.

1797
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,920
I'm going to stand up and just like sprint full speed as soon as I read this final Yahoo.

1798
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,920
But I have to pee too.

1799
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,920
Nobody go to the bathroom.

1800
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,920
Seriously, stay.

1801
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,920
Stay completely still.

1802
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,920
Stay seated.

1803
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:22,920
Let Griffin run to the bathroom.

1804
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,240
This final Yahoo was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1805
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,240
Thank you, Drew.

1806
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,240

Woo.

1808
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:37,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user baby who asks, any good websites I can meet human sugar daddies?

1809
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,920
Not the candy, but men's sugar daddies.

1810
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,920
Got to say, I'm Joe.

1811
