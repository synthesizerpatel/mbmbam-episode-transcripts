1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,600
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:23,500
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:55,200
It's Familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:12,700
People ask me, Justin, how are Minneapolis audiences?

7
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:22,300
And I tell them, Minneapolis audiences are the horniest audiences in the world.

8
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,800
You're all so horny, it's a little overwhelming.

9
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:32,300
Hello, my name is Justin McElroy, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and the Advice Show for the Modern Era.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,600
The first Justin was more of an emcee, and then I was walking myself into the character of Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,800
You know, that's true, because we are all just a character we play.

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,100
That's so deep, Travis.

14
00:01:48,100 --> 00:02:01,000
And the character I'll be embodying this evening is your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,700
And I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary, Griffin McElroy.

16
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,200
I've... we, uh, we played...

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,600
Travis did, I want it on the audio record, Travis did just shush Griffin's applause.

18
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,300
He gave you a... I just thought it was a little bit like y'all were just trying to make a point.

19
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,500
Like, we like Griffin! Yeah, okay.

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,700
We did a show in Minneapolis like two years ago, and I'm remembering now the horniness.

21
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:38,900
I'm not saying this for applause, because when y'all were doing that thing you just did, it was like, oh yeah!

22
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,700
So horny. Holy shit.

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Uh, what's up? We, like the Chilean miners, we've emerged from the ground and returned to you, Minneapolis.

24
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,200
I just think of everything we've done for the past few years as sort of like dead air between our two performances.

25
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Oh yeah, absolutely.

26
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,700
I measure everything in how long it's been since Minneapolis.

27
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,700
We're so happy to be in the Orpheum, because this place is fucking beautiful.

28
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I said it, did I say, I said it? Yeah, the Orpheum. It's so beautiful.

29
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,700
I thought, I wanted to say Morpheus, but that's the fucking Matrix.

30
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,100
We're in the Orpheum. Can we get the chandelier turned on?

31
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,700
Because this place has the most buckwild chandelier I've ever... I don't know if you have the chandelier switch.

32
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,900
Whoa, they broke it.

33
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,100
My angel of music!

34
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,700
There it is.

35
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,000
Look at it.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,100
So we were talking about it backstage, and here's the thing, y'all.

37
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,900
We're going to need you to help us steal that chandelier.

38
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,100
Oh, it's going away. They're turning the lights off.

39
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,900
Please don't steal our chandelier. Please don't steal this chandelier.

40
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,200
We're going to need someone who's good at gymnastics.

41
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,600
We're going to need a hacker.

42
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,800
We're going to need a face.

43
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,900
We're going to need a face person, a person with a face, I guess.

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,100
We're going to need someone who's not afraid to get in there and mix it up and scrap the people.

45
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,200
We're going to need...

46
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
A gun haver.

47
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,700
A gun haver.

48
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,900
We're going to need someone with a van.

49
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,200
We're going to need someone to go get burgers.

50
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,100
We're going to need someone to just say, like, hey, how's everybody doing?

51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,900
You guys doing okay? Do you need anything?

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,000
Show of hands, has anybody in here ever stolen anything that's worth more than $100?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Wow, a lot of good people in the audience tonight.

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,700
No, that balcony. That's full of crooks.

56
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
The balcony's nasty.

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
You all can't see it, but you balcony folks are nasty.

58
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,900
Which is great. They're closer to the chandelier.

59
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,000
Also need to say, because sometimes our fans take things very seriously, please don't steal a chandelier.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,800
No, don't.

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,500
No, you know what, Griffin? I'm sorry.

62
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,600
If y'all can figure out how to get up there...

63
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,500
No, we're not entreating you to steal a chandelier.

64
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,300
Wink.

65
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,700
They won't give us the money for the show.

66
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
They won't.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
Because they're like, you stole our chandelier.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Take it out of the chandelier sales.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,600
Finding a pawn shop big enough is the problem.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,200
Yeah.

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,900
Because getting in there...

72
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,800
And ritzy enough.

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,600
Yeah, you're going to find a fence with very specific needs.

74
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,700
Can we all just eat a little bit of the chandelier?

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
Oh, no, they are turning it off now.

76
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Thank you, chandelier. Everybody, big hands for the chandelier.

77
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,700
For our listeners at home, there's a very big, good chandelier in the room.

78
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,900
And we're gonna eat it.

79
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,700
And we're gonna eat it.

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,100
Every last delicious crystalline bite.

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,100
And we're gonna steal the smaller chandeliers down here to give it to the big chandelier.

82
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,900
As tribute.

83
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,000
As tribute or fuel.

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,300
This one used to be small and they kept feeding it small chandeliers.

85
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,800
And it got so big.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
So we're gonna need to turn it off, right?

87
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm just gonna stare at it.

88
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
It's so gorgeous.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
They're like, no one's ever asked us to turn it off.

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,300
We don't know how to turn it off.

91
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,300
We're gonna do...

92
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,100
So we're gonna do an intermission a little bit in so we can go pee.

93
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,400
That's the truth.

94
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,100
Right now.

95
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,300
Thanks, y'all. You've been great.

96
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,700
And then after that, we're gonna do some audience questions.

97
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,600
And y'all know the rule for audience questions?

98
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,500
No more!

99
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,100
Cool.

100
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,300
There is now a second rule that we've added, which is ask for actual advice.

101
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,600
Yeah.

102
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,100
Please give us a question.

103
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,600
No anecdotes.

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,700
It just doesn't give us much of a runway.

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,100
We take your questions on the show and we turn them alchemy-like into wisdom.

106
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,300
Let's do that damn thing.

107
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Let's do the damn thing.

108
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,800
Let's get dirty.

109
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Let's twist it.

110
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,500
My husband and I have two cats that both use the toilet.

111
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,100
In our house.

112
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,200
No, you don't.

113
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,000
You mean like use a toilet, not like go to the bathroom because everybody's cat does that.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, they use the actual literal toilet.

115
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
In our house, we only have one toilet.

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,100
That is something that you probably should have thought about before you taught the cats to use it.

117
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,600
When we have guests over, we ask them to leave the toilet seat up

118
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,800
and to flush if they see any pee or poop in there.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
Is that last part too gross?

120
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
I never thought of it before,

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,400
but I realize it might be disgusting to ask some folks we have over to look for poop and flush it down.

122
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,200
Is that weird?

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,900
And that's from the Cats Can't Flush.

124
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,100
Are you here?

125
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,800
Are you here?

126
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
All right.

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,700
Everybody cheered all at once.

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, you're a hive mind.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,600
Okay, cool.

130
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,100
We are, we are here.

131
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,800
I will say this.

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,500
First off, I want to get into the cats shitting on the toilet because that's chef kiss.

133
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,000
But I don't know that you need to give your guests special instructions

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,600
for what to do if there's poop or pee in the toilet

135
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
because it would be a fairly rowdy houseguest who's like,

136
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
huh, look at that, a bunch of dookie.

137
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,600
Anyway, like presumably.

138
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,100
Is that just what they do here?

139
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,600
Cool.

140
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,000
Cool.

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,300
Okay.

142
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,700
Well, allow me to join.

143
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
When in Rome, I suppose.

144
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Oh, you're a bee.

145
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,500
Here's my leavings.

146
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Adios.

147
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,800
I think...

148
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,900
That was really gross.

149
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,600
I hated being on stage for that.

150
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Let me ask you this.

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,200
What's weirder?

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Telling your guests like, hey, we've trained our cats to use the toilet.

153
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,800
So you might need to flush after them.

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,600
That's the weirdest possible.

155
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,800
Or two, we keep a box full of dirt and it's just got poop in it all the time.

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,700
We keep a box full of dirt that they poop in it.

157
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,400
And then by the way, the dirt smells worse than the poop.

158
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Hey, cat litter manufacturers.

159
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,600
Can you do something?

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,700
It smells really bad already.

161
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
That's the base state.

162
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,600
There's never cat litter that's like, is somebody making fried chicken?

163
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,300
I think it would be so funny to see little poop in the toilet.

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
It looks like David the Gnome got in there and wrecked your biz.

165
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
I would love that.

166
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,600
I would be so excited.

167
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
I don't think I'd be able to flush it.

168
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,500
I'd be too stoked.

169
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,100
Aww, look at that little kitty in his biz.

170
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,900
You know the bad part about seeing the kitty poop in the toilet?

171
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

172
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,900
Is that you know upon seeing it that you missed the cat shitting in the toilet.

173
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh man, he's not gonna do it again tonight.

174
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,700
Oh man, can't believe it.

175
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,900
You think he sits there and reads a little kitty paper?

176
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,500
Little kitty magazine. He's a big fan of Garfield.

177
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:25,400
I can't understand the amount of work that goes into teaching a cat to do a person thing.

178
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,900
Like using a toilet.

179
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:34,100
And you can't go the final yard there to cross the 100 yard line into the touchdown area

180
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,100
by forcing them to learn how to operate a very small lever.

181
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:45,300
You did you did the hard part which was convincing a cat to pee where you wanted them to.

182
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,800
Specifically a big bowl like a big thing.

183
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Like how did you start that?

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,500
Like hey cat shit in this room wherever and so they I'll just narrow it down.

185
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
It's different places you get shit.

186
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,200
The answer is the bowl.

187
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,900
The question is where does it stop?

188
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,800
Because you can teach your cat to shit in the toilet and then you can teach your cat to flush.

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,800
And then well, I guess you should teach a cat to wash its little paws.

190
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,500
And then it's like now please get off to school.

191
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,900
Please go get a job.

192
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:27,300
I guess I had a joke but you guys can go ahead and do yours first.

193
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,000
It's just these jokes and this question is like

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,700
meet the parents kind already dug this one out for us and I don't know that it's and this is gonna be funnier

195
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,800
because they had a long time to sit in a room and figure out fun.

196
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Ben and Robbie De Niro got together and they're like we got three weeks.

197
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,500
Let's think of some really funny stuff to say and we just have to say it right away.

198
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Do it immediately. It's not fair.

199
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,300
Ben Stiller gets all the breaks.

200
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,300
How about a yahoo though?

201
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,800
I love that.

202
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,200
Sorry my eyes stopped opening there for a second.

203
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
The road man.

204
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
How about this one? It was sent in by Lauren McPherson.

205
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,900
Thank you Lauren. It's yahoo answers user cotton.

206
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,500
That's really their name. Nice.

207
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,200
Cotton asks.

208
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,300
My bed smell bad.

209
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,100
I tried everything I could but the mattress still smell bad.

210
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,700
What can I do?

211
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,800
Mattress smell bad.

212
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,500
Oh man.

213
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,300
My bed smell bad.

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,600
I tried everything.

215
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,800
Shoot my bed.

216
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,500
I tried everything.

217
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Big washing machine.

218
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
Hose and soap.

219
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,000
Bed smell bad still.

220
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
Wet washcloth.

221
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,600
Pine saw.

222
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,700
Tricky car wash.

223
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Risky candle. My bed smell bad.

224
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,900
Risky candles and the bed smell bad.

225
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,000
Wish on star.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Bed smell bad.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Bed smell bad.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Oh man.

229
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,100
Sometimes you stay in a friend's guest room.

230
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,800
And I just did this in Chicago.

231
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:22,100
So this is not a read on them but.

232
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,800
Bed smell bad.

233
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,300
Bed can smell bad.

234
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,600
And you know it's great.

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Bed has sheet bed has pillow bed comfort is great.

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,200
It sounds like you're leaving off a certain aspect about bed bed bed smell bad.

237
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,800
Yeah, and you know what bed doesn't spontaneously smell bad.

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:50,900
No like a bed has never just started smelling bad for no reason bed smell bad long time.

239
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,800
Bed smell good forever except human.

240
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,700
You've been made bad smell bad smell bad bad human try bucket for breeze.

241
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,800
Wish on star.

242
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,600
Uh-huh. No good.

243
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,100
Still stink dreams still take dreams.

244
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,700
Extra incense.

245
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,100
Five six bed smell bad.

246
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,700
What can we do about the bed smell bad though?

247
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,600
The bed smell.

248
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,000
What was it?

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,800
I think we've tapped it.

250
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,700
We've tapped it, right?

251
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,100
There's no more than me and all the ways bed smell bad smell bad or better.

252
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,000
Does anybody else have any ones they want to kick in?

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,900
Bed smell bad.

254
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,600
Bed smell bad.

255
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
Tried everything.

256
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,100
Try everything.

257
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,400
That'd be bad.

258
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Well, people are now offering handy suggestions on how to make that.

259
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,200
Yeah, fuck Heloise.

260
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,100
No, I just we're just trying to a comedy show up here the bed smell bad.

261
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
How about another question?

262
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,700
I don't care about this bed anymore.

263
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
That's the end.

264
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:03,000
I fucking hate this bed now stupid bed for the last couple of months.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,700
I've spent some of my downtime watching YouTube tutorials on how to do some card tricks.

266
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,300
It was never serious interest but something I could show friends after a couple of tricks.

267
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,800
Okay, so you've been learning how to do card tricks.

268
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,300
Let's just lay it out there.

269
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,700
Let's put the tiger on the table accidentally learn card trick, right?

270
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,100
I was watching them and it turns out picked up a couple things watching other people do card tricks on YouTube.

271
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,300
Yeah, I know one of my friends was so impressed.

272
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:35,900
He decided to talk his boss into hiring me to perform at their company holiday party.

273
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,500
In a month without my knowledge.

274
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:47,300
I know about 10 card tricks with about three good ones.

275
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, no, do I take it on and risk embarrassing myself and my friend or do I decline the chance to make some extra cash?

276
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
That's from maybe magical in Minneapolis.

277
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Holy shit.

278
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you here?

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,100
That was the best.

280
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,700
Yeah.

281
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,700
It was a very oh shit.

282
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,600
They just turned into a bunch of doves.

283
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Fuck it's just that like you gave yourself an out in the email, which I appreciate because there's no amount of money.

284
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,800
You could pay me to go somewhere and do bad at magic in front of people.

285
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I do like though.

286
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I didn't think about this and I was going through but now I'm thinking about it hearing Justin read it out loud.

287
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,000
You are considering doing yeah.

288
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,700
Yeah, that's the real problem, isn't it?

289
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,100
Like there is a part of you that's like listen, I know how it's gonna go but it's money.

290
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,200
Just Matt. It's just card tricks.

291
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,800
I feel like you could hire a plant or several.

292
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Yes is sort of like was this your card?

293
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah, it totally was.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,500
And then someone next to him like it was his card.

295
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,200
He's not a plant.

296
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,300
This guy's not a plant.

297
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,100
I came with this dude.

298
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:12,300
He works at HR, you know, everyone's plans is every single person except the boss.

299
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:20,600
Can you just take the money you were gonna get for the show and give everybody like $4 and just be like, please be cool.

300
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,900
Here's one consolation if it helps they can pay somebody to do card tricks at a party.

301
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,800
You can't pay me to watch card tricks at a party.

302
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,400
So you there's a very good chance.

303
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:37,100
He could walk into a room be like hey everybody. I got something everyone can enjoy press the vegetation.

304
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,800
Bye-bye-bye. Bye-bye-bye. There's punch.

305
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,300
Goodbye.

306
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,900
Also, I don't know what this business is, but your friend deserves a raise if he can sell.

307
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,100
Hey, I saw my friend do a card trick so good.

308
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,300
You should pay them to perform at our holiday party.

309
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,200
That's a hard sell.

310
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,800
That's tough.

311
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

312
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

313
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,000
Table. Four chairs around it.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Say this is very intimate set.

315
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I do intimate close-up magic.

316
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,300
They keep saying the word intimate over and over again.

317
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,400
Yeah, say intimate a lot.

318
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,100
Then you're like if I'm gonna get if I'm gonna get everybody through my set.

319
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,700
I can only do about three tricks.

320
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm sorry. I know many more great ones.

321
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,600
Oh, so good. Even better than the ones I'm doing now.

322
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,200
Even better than the ones I do now, but these are my intimate set.

323
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,800
This is my three song intimate set that I can only do with four people.

324
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,100
Then you just turn them through so you don't have to keep it up for 15, 20, 30 minutes.

325
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,300
It's just like five minutes of intimate close-up magic.

326
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:47,900
Speaking of intimacy, one other thing you could do is introduce some light stripping and erotica.

327
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Like you only need three tricks if each one is preceded by 15 minutes of tasteful erotica.

328
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,100
Justin, is the erotica tied into the show?

329
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,400
Oh, yeah, we're talking about ace of clubs, ace of spades, both pasties.

330
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Like is this your card? Does it even matter anymore?

331
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Is this your card? No, it's not.

332
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,700
That's the jack of diamonds.

333
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I had the three of hearts.

334
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,500
Oh, well, here's my butt.

335
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Is it gonna say my card on your butt?

336
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,100
No. Here's what I can guarantee you.

337
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,800
If you introduce some light tasteful erotica into your office party,

338
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,200
no one afterwards will be commenting about how few tricks you knew.

339
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,400
That is a promise from me to you.

340
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,500
You want a Yahoo?

341
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,400
Sure.

342
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,500
This one was sent in by Stefan Ruby.

343
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Thank you, Stefan. It's Yahoo Answers user Ned Racine.

344
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Oh, last name, too.

345
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:07,700
Ned asks, invent new sport, bird fishing.

346
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Just right off the bat, can I point out birding then?

347
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,900
That's a different thing.

348
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
That's a different thing entirely.

349
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,600
I know, but you can't put fish-ing in there.

350
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Yeah, sure. I'm going deer fishing.

351
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,100
Do you mean... You mean hunting, right?

352
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,500
Just think of it.

353
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,300
Hooking a tough old nasty crow on your line.

354
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
Having the bird take to the skies.

355
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,400
Having the drag on your real spewing out line.

356
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,100
Fuck.

357
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,000
Having more fun... Finishing.

358
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
Finishing.

359
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,000
Completing. Achieving.

360
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Having more fun than flying a kite as the bird soars into the blue sky.

361
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
You nasty, Ned.

362
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
You real nasty, Ned.

363
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,400
Finally, like fishing, do the catch and release.

364
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,100
Sounds like a lot of fun.

365
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,700
You could even invent special lures, etc.

366
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,200
Great new sport.

367
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,300
But what would be the open season?

368
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
Would there be some species off limits?

369
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Give me your input, please.

370
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,900
Yeah, Ned. I think there will be some species off limits.

371
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,300
Yeah, Ned. There's already some species off limits, Ned.

372
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Did you kill this bald eagle?

373
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,800
No, I did not, officer. I fished it.

374
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,700
I fished it.

375
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,800
Out of the sky.

376
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,500
Gonna eat it, so it's good.

377
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,800
Now it's good and legal.

378
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,700
Oh, Ned. You caught me again.

379
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,700
The problem I have with this, everything about it is great.

380
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Agreed.

381
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,500
And logical and good and right and pure.

382
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,000
But the thing about birds are, they're not smart animals,

383
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,600
but if you as a bird see a worm in the sky,

384
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,900
you are going to know something is up.

385
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,800
A bird, a worm in a lake, a fish thinks like,

386
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,600
oh, it is not your lucky day, fell in the lake.

387
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
No swimmy, a chomp, chomp, chomp.

388
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,500
Right.

389
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,200
Unless, bird sees a worm in the sky and thinks like,

390
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,000
look at that magic worm.

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
I'm not going to let this opportunity pass me by.

392
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,300
I have to know what the magic worm tastes like.

393
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
That's a very short-sighted worm though,

394
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,800
because if I was a bird, I would say, go magic worm.

395
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,100
Make others like you for future generations of birds to enjoy.

396
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,900
You make my job so much easier, magic worm.

397
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,400
Do you think that in bird fishing,

398
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
you're like the bobber would be like a balloon?

399
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I think a balloon and a worm.

400
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Because you couldn't just like throw it up in the air

401
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,700
and hope that that second was when a bird went.

402
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:52,300
Travis, you're making this perilously close to a great achievable idea.

403
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,600
Okay, I will say, the balloon really took me,

404
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,800
because like, I'll credit to you,

405
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,100
I was having a trouble with my mind's eye getting the worm up there.

406
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,600
But of course the balloon, excellent.

407
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,900
No, I mean, we're on some busy world of Richard's scary shit for sure.

408
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,200
No, listen, I don't support this, but with a few tweaks.

409
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,500
Yeah, I don't support it,

410
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,700
but I don't know how you can not support this and support fishing.

411
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,300
Because in fishing, you're like, ha ha ha, here's the water worm.

412
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,000
At least this time you're giving this worm the best day ever,

413
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,400
the most unbelievable story of all time.

414
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,500
Yeah.

415
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,800
But here's the problem, and I love that this person in this question is like,

416
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,100
and then you catch and release the bird.

417
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't think that's how that's gonna go.

418
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Yeah.

419
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,500
You have plausible deniability when you catch and release a fish,

420
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,200
because it's like, I got him, but don't worry,

421
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,300
I just put a hook through you, but you're free, splash, gone.

422
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,300
And then you don't have to see it.

423
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,600
You don't get that with a bird, unless it's very foggy outside, maybe.

424
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Or you throw it very hard.

425
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,000
And turn around real quick.

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Where did you go?

427
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,200
With a fish, you can be like, ah, did you get hooked on some sort of line?

428
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,500
Allow me to help, little aquatic friend.

429
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,800
I can't believe somebody did that to you.

430
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,800
A bird watched you.

431
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,500
And also, a bird doesn't need to run and hide back in water to live.

432
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,000
A bird's just gonna chill there and maybe talk to you about what just happened.

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,500
Hey, what the fuck?

434
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,300
What the fuck?

435
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,500
I was here for that whole thing.

436
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,600
Yeah, I saw all of it.

437
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,300
Do not invent new sport bird fishing.

438
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,700
But if you do, the balloon is mine.

439
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,600
We will happily be the announcers if you go pro.

440
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
But it will just involve a lot of this.

441
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Oh, no.

442
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,100
Oh, shit, shit.

443
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Oh, that's horrible to watch.

444
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,500
Oh, it's everywhere.

445
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Farm wisdom, farm wisdom.

446
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,300
Get your friend Doug to spray bugs, farm wisdom.

447
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,900
That's right.

448
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,500
Farm wisdom is back tonight only for our friends in Minneapolis.

449
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,500
I didn't even tell.

450
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
This is a surprise to them.

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,600
I got a whole page here of farm fun facts that I looked up.

452
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,700
And we're just going to talk about farms for a second.

453
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,900
Y'all got farms in Minnesota?

454
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,300
Oh, my God, you're all farmers.

455
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,500
Well, shit.

456
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,900
You all know this already.

457
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,400
Yes, that is true.

458
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,300
That thing you said.

459
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:30,400
This is a very complete list with a lot of ups and downs.

460
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,000
If something is not funny, we're just going to move on past it.

461
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,500
Okay, but you'll learn something and that's the important thing.

462
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:41,600
Goats are great companions for other farm animals, including horses, cows, and chickens.

463
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,400
That's a good hang.

464
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,300
That's a good hang right there.

465
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,700
Also, not true.

466
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,500
There are very few animals that will just ram shit.

467
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,900
One mature ewe, a female sheep, produces seven to ten pounds of newly shorn wool a year,

468
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,100
enough to make a man's suit.

469
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,200
Presumably, a very patient man.

470
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,100
Go ahead.

471
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,900
No, it's fine.

472
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,500
Prom's not for another seven months.

473
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,200
I can wait.

474
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,400
Just keep growing it.

475
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,900
Goats were the first animal to be domesticated, according to many historians.

476
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,600
There's no way.

477
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,400
According to some people who don't know shit, like no way.

478
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,200
It wasn't goats.

479
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
Trust me.

480
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:31,900
Pigs are considered the fourth most intelligent animal after chimpanzees, dolphins, and elephants.

481
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,600
Wait, what about humans?

482
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,700
We're not on the list.

483
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,700
Didn't rank.

484
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,200
Here's a good one.

485
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,500
Ow.

486
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,000
Cows can recognize their names.

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,900
Fuck you.

488
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,400
But though, though, they may not come when called.

489
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,000
Okay, honestly, list, fuck off.

490
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,100
Sometimes when I say my cow's name, it comes to me.

491
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,200
Sometimes, it doesn't.

492
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,200
How do you, okay, because the only way I could think that this is a fact is that you would say like,

493
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,100
Steven, and the cow would turn and go, no.

494
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,800
No, no, no.

495
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,600
No, man.

496
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,200
Maybe that's just not the cow's name.

497
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Whoa.

498
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,900
Just got a proud cow name that you don't even know about.

499
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,800
What if you just named all your cows cow, right?

500
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,600
It'd be very efficient.

501
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,400
Cow.

502
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,000
When do you ever want just the one cat?

503
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,100
Well, there's a time when you just want the one cow.

504
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,300
Slow cow.

505
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,400
Oh, man.

506
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,900
I gotta stop eating meat.

507
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,900
This fact actually is, this is in sequence, and this fact actually comes at this point.

508
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,400
Female sheep are called ewes.

509
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,600
Yeah, I know.

510
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,700
Could have used that earlier.

511
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,800
That was up the list.

512
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
That was earlier.

513
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,100
And that came like, oh shit, did I say it?

514
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,800
I'll add it in.

515
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,100
I'm not going to scroll back up.

516
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,000
Cows have a memory of about three years.

517
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,900
So don't name your cow four years ago.

518
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,800
That's what it is.

519
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,700
Cows have a memory of about three, so you could tell if three years have elapsed, but hey,

520
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,900
do you remember me owing you any money in 2014?

521
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,400
No.

522
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,600
Okay, excellent.

523
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,700
How do you, how the fuck do you know that?

524
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,800
Honestly.

525
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,200
Especially, and I have to say, about three years.

526
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,400
About three years.

527
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,200
Some are more forgetful than others.

528
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,900
Goats are great swimmers.

529
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,000
Goats are fantastic.

530
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,900
Okay.

531
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,700
What cannot goats do?

532
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,800
I don't know that I have a memory of three years.

533
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,700
Yeah.

534
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:42,900
Yeah, now that I think about it, geese are fateful, and they mate for life, and they

535
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,300
mourn when their partner dies.

536
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,100
Ah, shit.

537
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,300
That's not so much a fact.

538
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,700
It's just like, hey.

539
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,300
And also, devoid, no bummers, Justin.

540
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,000
No bummers.

541
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,400
Cows can sense a storm coming, and will lie down.

542
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,600
Okay, stop, stop.

543
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,400
It is time.

544
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,300
We need a peer review.

545
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,600
Where is this list from, Justin?

546
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,300
It's just farm stuff.

547
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,600
No, my buddy.

548
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,500
I screenshotted it.

549
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't know.

550
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't have an internet connection anymore.

551
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
Can I jump back to the geese are fateful thing?

552
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:18,300
Yeah, and then I'll jump back to the cows being like, ah, storm coming later.

553
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,600
I think it's great to say, geese are fateful.

554
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,800
All of them.

555
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,300
You know there's nasty geese.

556
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,900
Right, there's the geese out there that's like, listen, when the other geese is away

557
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,800
or whatever.

558
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,500
I don't know, geese, whatever.

559
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,500
But that idea of all, you know, geese will never, never be nasty.

560
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:43,300
Listen, when you're surrounded by so many of those long, elegant, beautiful, sexy, curved

561
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,700
necks, it is hard not, and those necks they got, they can look all around.

562
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,400
You know geese aren't swans, right?

563
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,000
Like swans aren't geese, geese aren't swans.

564
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,600
Swans are, it doesn't matter.

565
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,100
It's not really playing with me in the space a little bit.

566
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,300
It feels like maybe right now as much as it could be.

567
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,400
We have a room full of farmers here, Griffith.

568
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,900
It's true.

569
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:08,000
This room is farmers only.

570
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,900
Are you done with your fake list of farm bullshit?

571
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:17,700
At this point, I do start to worry that the person who wrote this list started to take

572
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,500
their love of goats and sort of delve into fan fiction.

573
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,300
Because the next fact on here is goats have rectangular pupils allowing them to see well

574
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
in the dark.

575
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,000
I think that one's actually legit.

576
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,800
That one's legit?

577
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,700
No, they legit have rectangular pupils, but like I thought you were going to say like

578
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,100
Jeremy is the best goat.

579
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,600
I love you Jeremy.

580
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Fact, Jeremy is always there for me.

581
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,900
Jeremy is also faithful and he...

582
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:51,500
Some wild goats can climb trees and can walk along a ledge, but not much wider than a tightrope.

583
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,400
I like this one because that means at some point a human was watching a goat approach

584
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:00,300
something terrible and said, let's see where this goes.

585
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,400
You know, you never know.

586
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,300
Let's see how this shakes out.

587
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,400
I also like some wild goats can, some can't.

588
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,700
Some can't.

589
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,200
There's a wild goat try a tree all day.

590
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
Nothing's doing.

591
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,000
How will you know the difference?

592
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,600
There's one way to find out.

593
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,200
Not all goats can walk across thin ledges, but eventually all goats will be able to.

594
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,000
Jeremy can fucking do it.

595
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,800
Jeremy the best goat.

596
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,600
Here is another question.

597
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Some friends and I are at my buddy's parents house to stay for the weekend.

598
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh, I like this present tense.

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah.

600
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I've never been here or met his parents before.

601
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,100
It was a road trip away and 15 minutes after arriving, I went upstairs to use their luxury

602
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,400
rain head shower.

603
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Got that road stink on you.

604
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,700
Unbeknownst to me, the handle was only meant to turn 90 degrees.

605
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,200
I proceeded to turn it 180 in one swift motion, ripping it off the wall.

606
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,900
Currently I'm naked and damp and the shower won't turn off more party guests will be arriving

607
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,100
within the hour.

608
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,200
This is socially awkward.

609
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,400
Defcon one.

610
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,300
What do I do?

611
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,300
And this person has literally just written Derek Brown from Osseo, Minnesota.

612
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,300
So just like, don't even question it.

613
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,300
Derek.

614
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm assuming Derek's not here.

615
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
Derek cannot be here.

616
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Derek cannot be here.

617
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Someone's parents just heard that and they're like, wait, what?

618
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
What?

619
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,300
Oh shit.

620
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
You said it was the dog.

621
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
Derek, are you here?

622
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,300
He made it out.

623
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Okay.

624
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,300
Oh shit.

625
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:45,700
There's so many elements at play here.

626
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,600
You could play it off just like, you've got a cool new water feature now.

627
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,240
It's upstairs and inside and forever and forever.

628
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,600
So it just takes the water through the drain and then recycles it back up to the, no, the

629
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,740
utilities are, you would not believe.

630
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,460
Also there's no hot water anywhere else in the house.

631
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,520
How strong are you?

632
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,020
You very strong, Derek?

633
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
He's so strong.

634
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
Too strong.

635
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,500
That was the, that was the, sorry, weakest delivery of the sentence.

636
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
I'm so strong.

637
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,060
Usually it's, I'm so strong.

638
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,060
I am.

639
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,060
No, I am very strong.

640
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,700
Because right now Derek knows that there is only shame in that string.

641
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,700
Yeah.

642
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,260
This is the moment where Hercules just can't control the power and knocks over all the

643
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
columns.

644
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,260
Yeah.

645
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
You know what I mean?

646
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
And he's not like, boom, you know, this is set.

647
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
Can I ask you something, Derek?

648
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,260
And you don't have to answer.

649
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Wait, listen.

650
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,740
Can we get Derek a mic?

651
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,540
We have a crowd mic or you can come down here.

652
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
He's up in the, I think he's up in the balcony.

653
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,540
Wait, wait, wait.

654
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,140
Derek, are you in the balcony or are you on the ground floor?

655
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Okay.

656
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Down here.

657
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
Yeah.

658
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,660
If we could get Derek, we have a crowd microphone or you can come down here and you can just

659
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,660
talk into mine.

660
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
Whatever.

661
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Derek, where are you friend?

662
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,660
Cause I got it.

663
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,820
We could, we could van, we could talk about whatever garbage we want to, but honestly

664
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,500
we do need to know how this actually shook out.

665
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Okay.

666
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Hey Derek.

667
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,220
Derek, my first, my first question for you is this.

668
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,220
Yeah.

669
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,660
How long did you stand there with the handle in your hand?

670
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
That's actually a very good question.

671
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,700
And how long was your, oh no.

672
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:28,900
See, to be honest, I thought it had been hours as I was standing there, but it was probably

673
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,540
just the mic close to your mouth there.

674
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
I have to hear every single.

675
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:38,860
But not too close, you'll ram it through your face with your incredible strength.

676
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,220
I mean, we have so many suggestions of how you could have done it better, but I do want

677
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,900
to know how this played out so badly.

678
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,020
It was, I stood there long enough that I knew that people were going to start wondering,

679
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,740
wow, he's taken a shower for a long time, which has other sort of sinister, which has

680
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
other sinister.

681
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,740
Correct.

682
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,740
Correct.

683
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:04,700
I was waiting and the handle fell off on the worst part is my friend had another friend

684
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,340
had taken a shower before me and apparently figured it out.

685
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I guess it was fine.

686
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,340
Hey bud.

687
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
It doesn't sound like a real heart.

688
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
It's not.

689
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,340
Jigsaw puzzle.

690
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,340
Right.

691
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,820
How to not break the shower is not a tough one.

692
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,460
How did you fucking cloak your shit?

693
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't know.

694
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:30,940
Well, I, I FaceTimed my girlfriend and she was like, she was like, she was like, why

695
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
are you in the shower?

696
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,500
And I was like, there's no time.

697
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Yeah.

698
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,160
I need help.

699
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,980
So how did you get out of the situation and jumped through the phone?

700
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,820
She was like, just go downstairs and explain and they'll understand.

701
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,540
I was like, are you a crazy person?

702
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
Yeah.

703
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,020
I'm not at any sort of solution.

704
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,500
No, that's not it.

705
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:58,820
I texted my other friend downstairs, who's a plumber, what, what, what now?

706
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,820
A plumber.

707
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,820
There's a plumber.

708
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
Your friend's a plumber.

709
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,180
That's the only right answer.

710
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,540
He turned, he figured out how to turn off the water.

711
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:14,860
Well that's anti-climactic and his, apparently the bathroom was like his mom's like sanctuary

712
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,260
area and I, she's never going to forgive me.

713
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Now it's got a waterfall.

714
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,700
Enjoy your relaxation, Debra.

715
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Correct.

716
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,620
I made it steamy permanently in there.

717
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,620
Forever.

718
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
Forever.

719
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,480
So did you ever admit to it or did you figure out a way to reaffix the handle?

720
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,460
I tried to fix the handle and it didn't work and I shamefully admitted to it.

721
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,100
And now are you and your friend's mom like best friends?

722
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,860
I don't know about best friends.

723
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,460
Was she angry at you?

724
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
She wasn't.

725
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,460
You didn't do it on purpose.

726
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,140
Derek, Derek, I don't want to lie here.

727
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,940
How did Debra react to you breaking the shower?

728
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,700
She was, she said it was okay, but it wasn't okay.

729
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Okay.

730
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Yes, he has.

731
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
That's correct.

732
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Everybody, big hand for Derek, everyone.

733
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Well folks.

734
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,980
One time, one time, one time we were in Florida and we were staying with our uncle Dave and

735
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,180
uncle Dave was psyched about the new screen doors he had in his Florida house.

736
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,740
Keep that in mind.

737
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:16,220
I've probably told this story on the podcast before, but I saw a golf cart in his driveway

738
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,940
and I got real excited.

739
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,460
Also the video game Grand Theft Auto 3 had just come out.

740
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,860
I saw the golf cart and I yelled, Grand Theft Auto.

741
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,540
I jumped through the screen door and not on purpose, it wasn't like Griffin saw the screen

742
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,060
door and thought, I'm going to jump through that.

743
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,660
No, I saw the golf cart and I thought, Grand Theft Auto.

744
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,580
I jumped through it and my uncle Dave said it was okay, but it was not okay.

745
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Folks, we are going to take a break during which time you can go relieve yourself, go

746
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,580
refresh yourself.

747
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
That's what we're going to do.

748
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Straight up.

749
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,580
Got to purchase the posters.

750
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,580
There's posters out in the lobby.

751
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,060
Made by Steven Sugar.

752
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,500
They're fucking beautiful and wonderful and we love them so much.

753
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,060
So go buy those and get your questions ready and please have real questions and we love

754
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,000
you very much and we will see you in a few minutes.

755
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
We love you.

756
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:15,660
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy, Sweet Baby Brother.

757
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,720
Thank you so much for listening to our live show.

758
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,380
This was our show for Minneapolis from the Midwest tour that we just got back from yesterday.

759
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Sorry for the late episode.

760
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,700
We were all traveling yesterday and so here it is today.

761
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,580
If you came out to these shows, thank you so much.

762
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:35,500
We had a lot of fun except for the part where, well, I'm about to do a stunt in the second

763
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
half of this show.

764
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,120
So if you hear a bit where everybody starts laughing at me for no reason, it's because

765
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,540
of the very cool and very brave stunt.

766
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,940
Anyway, I'm going to tell you about some of our advertisers and then let you get back

767
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,080
to the rest of the show.

768
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,740
Our first advertiser is Casper.

769
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,060
Casper is a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create

770
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,880
an exceptionally comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

771
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,820
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman, sells directly to

772
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,940
the customer.

773
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,140
We have a Casper mattress in our guest room and nursery and it is really, really comfortable.

774
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,580
I've slept on it a few times and whenever we've had guests over who've slept in the

775
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,660
bed, we get rave reviews.

776
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,660
Four stars.

777
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Out of four.

778
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,900
That's a 100% perfect score.

779
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:24,300
Anyway, Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep

780
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,060
surface with the right amount of both sink and bounce.

781
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,220
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100 night risk-free sleep on it trial.

782
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Start sleeping ahead of the curve with Casper.

783
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,180
Get $50 towards any mattress purchase by going to Casper.com slash my brother and using promo

785
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,780
Terms and conditions, they do apply.

786
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,460
I also want to tell you about Lyft.

787
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,380
That's L-Y-F-T, the ride sharing service.

788
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,240
Lyft drivers can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.

789
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,360
In fact, Lyft was the first ride share program with tipping built right into the app.

790
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,800
As a driver, you keep 100% of the tips and happy drivers means happy passengers.

791
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,700
You can join the ride sharing company that believes in treating its people better.

792
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:12,460
Just go to Lyft.com slash brother today and you can also get a $500 new driver bonus.

793
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,260
That's Lyft.com slash brother.

794
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,260
One last time.

795
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:21,340
Lyft.com slash brother, limited time only, terms, they also apply here.

796
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,980
I have a Jumbotron message.

797
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,860
This one is for Future Justin and it's from Past Justin who says, Dear Future Justin,

798
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,700
congrats on getting the hell out of the Navy.

799
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,580
I hope you aren't wasting it with that dank kush and video games.

800
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,220
I hope you are.

801
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,340
Get out there and do some good for this world.

802
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,340
P.S.

803
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,700
I bet you wish you had these 100 smackers right now, don't you?

804
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,740
Too bad.

805
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,580
You should have talked me out of it.

806
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Suck it, Past Justin.

807
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,740
I don't know if this is our first Jumbotron to feature a prominent suck it and a self

808
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,620
suck it too, which is impressive.

809
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:04,340
But yeah, hey, current, present Justin, get out there and be the change, I think.

810
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,580
Here's another Jumbotron message.

811
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,780
This one is for Band, spelled B-E-R-N-D.

812
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,180
There's some helpful pronunciation tips here as well as the information that he's Austrian

813
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:19,860
so and that helpful tidbit comes from Amanda who says, pretend for a second this is the

814
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,740
adventure zone where it would be more fitting for me to commemorate and thank you for our

815
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:29,860
many adventures together from pillow fort snuggles to exercising you in the park.

816
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,340
To exercising you in the park?

817
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,940
Do you mean doing exercise or to get a demon anyway?

818
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,260
To not dying on your motorcycle.

819
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,900
Smell you later.

820
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,380
Or ideally sooner, maybe on my side of the pond this time.

821
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,780
That is a very sweet message and I'm sorry you couldn't get it on adventure zone.

822
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:52,500
It's a very competitive market right now and with the economy the way it is, something,

823
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,980
something, something, the economy.

824
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,980
I think that's it.

825
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,360
We sure do appreciate you listening to the episode.

826
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,780
We are gonna try really hard to get a new episode recorded for next Monday so we don't

827
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,300
do two live shows back to back again but with the holiday this weekend and folks are traveling,

828
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,860
I'm not 100% on that but we're gonna try really, really hard to get a new episode for you next

829
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,220
Monday.

830
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
I think that's it.

831
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:20,900
Oh, so when we come back after the promo for our fellow MaxFun podcast here after the break,

832
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:24,820
we lost a little bit of the recording but we are just gonna jump right into the middle

833
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,980
of a, spoiler alert, a haunted doll watch and it's a very good haunted doll watch and

834
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,700
we hope you enjoy it and we'll talk to you next Monday, bye.

835
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,700
I'm Bez.

836
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,700
And I'm Teresa.

837
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,740
And we host the weekly comedy podcast, One Bad Mother.

838
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,260
We celebrate our moments of parenting genius.

839
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,260
As well as our failures.

840
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:47,260
Just like, we're gonna have hot dogs and I'm like, no, we're having fun, everybody loves

841
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,700
hot dogs and it just like smashes that thing right on my chest and then I'm just crying

842
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,500
in the middle of like kids space while people are like literally dancing with their children.

843
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,020
Parenting can be sad and painfully funny at the same time.

844
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,100
So join us each week as we admit that this is hard but we're getting really good at it.

845
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:09,460
Visit us at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

846
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,340
How tall is the doll again, Juice in inches?

847
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,340
48 inches.

848
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,220
That's a lot of inches, holy shit, okay.

849
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,300
That's a lot of doll.

850
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,820
She's from the 1800s, uncertain of exact year.

851
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,580
She sustained a foot injury from a bad fall.

852
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,780
Your doll broke.

853
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,980
It wasn't injured.

854
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,140
Wait, no, this is important.

855
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,620
When they say from the 18th century, the doll.

856
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
The doll of the ghost.

857
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,620
I don't know.

858
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,660
Her foot remained broken and it is the same to this day.

859
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,300
So translation, the doll's foot did break and I did not fix it.

860
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,820
You cannot notice due to her beautiful long Victorian dress.

861
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,820
Oh, I'll notice.

862
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,340
The doll's foot is broken, I didn't fix it but you won't notice.

863
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,340
But it's cool.

864
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,620
You're not gonna bring this on Haunted Antiques Roadshow and they're gonna miss the foot.

865
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,740
I always suggest leave a vessel as is for there's a reason and you'll upset her.

866
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
You're lazy.

867
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,700
Well, here's the thing.

868
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:08,420
My worry is with the broken foot, the ghost is just gonna leak out the bottom.

869
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:15,580
You can hear her roam the hall and hear her drag her foot.

870
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,780
Now you're building it into the character.

871
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:18,780
And you know what?

872
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,780
It's better because her foot's broken.

873
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
It's even better than other ones you have.

874
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,660
I broke it on purpose.

875
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:28,660
She may enter your bedroom at night and touch your face.

876
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,940
Okay, what's great about this is y'all reacted.

877
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,100
She won't.

878
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
She won't.

879
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
It's a doll.

880
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,020
But y'all were like, well, no, no, up till now.

881
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,020
She might.

882
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,300
It gets better.

883
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:54,100
She may enter your bedroom at night, touch your face, it will feel like a spiderweb.

884
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,260
Is that better or worse than it feeling like a haunted small porcelain hand?

885
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,020
It will feel like a spiderweb.

886
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,340
Also, in what way?

887
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,460
Very lightly because she is captivated by human life form to a wild way of phrasing

888
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,460
that.

889
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,140
Actually, it's just her going, fix my foot, please.

890
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,500
She has such great beauty.

891
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,220
She could have any man she wanted and was lucky with love.

892
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,540
But don't let me read this entire sentence because you're going to be very tempted to

893
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,540
get in here.

894
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,260
Please let me read the entire sentence.

895
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:39,740
Her witchy ways, her beautiful eyes, her hair, clothing, jewelry and her body lifelike.

896
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:44,820
She is a designer doll and has real looking breasts.

897
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:56,700
I have never owned a vessel or doll that looked like this, meaning real.

898
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,380
She is shown on the Victorian couch in the same old house I found her and where I heard

899
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,380
her cries.

900
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,060
I can't believe there's more.

901
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,400
Her clothing alone is very expensive.

902
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,980
Also to mention her true to life look and build.

903
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:11,980
She is a true companion.

904
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,980
We get it.

905
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,980
We get it.

906
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
It's a fucking thing.

907
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
It's a fuck thing.

908
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
You want to fuck a ghost.

909
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,980
We get it.

910
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
Have I made it clear?

911
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,580
Exquisite.

912
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:25,780
This is one of three that I have and decided to let her go to another good home.

913
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,860
That's a cool house you have.

914
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,880
What a cool, enjoyable house you have to live in.

915
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,060
She has many talents and can help you with most anything.

916
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,780
They're not fucking automatons.

917
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,580
You don't get one of these fucking things for sweeping, right?

918
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,620
Do you think at this point like his wife walked in like, what are you typing?

919
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,420
Like, I'm selling you, dear.

920
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,540
She is very active.

921
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,220
Once again, I warn you.

922
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,220
Once you look into her eyes.

923
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,220
Very sexy.

924
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,220
I got to warn you.

925
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,320
Once you look into her eyes, you will be captured by her beauty.

926
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,100
She is breathtaking.

927
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,140
I know once you see her, you will want her.

928
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,400
Holy shit.

929
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,660
If she is meant for you, she will stay in your mind and perhaps she will enter your

930
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:10,940
dreams and you will not get her off your mind, man or woman.

931
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:19,220
I feel like we started a bit at the beginning of this read and this person heard us do that

932
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:25,020
and they decided to yes and however many weeks ago, yes and us with their doll.

933
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,420
I just hope that three brothers read this listing.

934
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,620
Once again, she is true to size.

935
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:35,060
A four foot per, I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah, sure.

936
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,740
Beautiful clothing, glass eyes, beautiful jewelry made of porcelain, vintage.

937
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,300
Just like a human being.

938
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:49,500
Real clothing, glass eyes, glass eyes, beautiful jewelry made of porcelain, vintage and her

939
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,660
defective foot.

940
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,660
You cannot see it.

941
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:58,760
Made of porcelain, vintage and her defective foot, but you cannot see it.

942
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,060
You will not notice her foot, but you will notice her breasts.

943
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,060
God in heaven.

944
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,060
She is one of a kind.

945
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
For sure.

946
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:10,780
She's one of three, it sounds like.

947
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,140
The other two's feets ain't breaking.

948
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,420
Whoa, that sentence was bad.

949
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,700
I want you to really listen to me for this next paragraph, okay?

950
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,700
Really listen.

951
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,700
I can't, Justin.

952
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,820
It's the end, but I want you to like really think about it.

953
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,260
She is one of a kind for sure.

954
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,460
Ask yourself, do you want her?

955
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,700
Do you need her?

956
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,180
Do you want love?

957
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:39,780
Only you will know, she is sold as is and beautiful.

958
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:52,260
So that's the haunted doll watch for this week.

959
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,900
We can never do this bit again.

960
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,820
You all may have just heard the last haunted doll watch.

961
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,260
What a momentous occasion.

962
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,380
I can't imagine a doll watch better than, listen, this doll's super haunted and super

963
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,380
stacked.

964
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,380
Check it.

965
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,380
Check it.

966
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,500
You won't even notice the foot.

967
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,820
Can I tell you the terrible truth?

968
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,500
I read the first paragraph of that and thought, yeah, it seems good.

969
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,300
It's a Babe Ruth called shot, pointed the outfield.

970
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,300
Okay.

971
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,900
All right, we're going to start picking people for this part.

972
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,900
Please stay in your seats and be cool.

973
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,900
If you could lower us, like our lights about 30% so we can see and bring those house lights

974
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,260
just all the way up.

975
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,820
Because it's real hard to find people sometimes.

976
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,820
Yeah.

977
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,580
Just give me a full house.

978
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,580
Okay.

979
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,860
God, there are like, there's a lot of people in here.

980
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,980
If we could get even more house and less us, it would help us because right now I just

981
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,140
see sort of a bunch of overcast faces.

982
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,820
I know that you are not normally tasked with illuminating the audience.

983
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,220
That's not really what the lights are built for.

984
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:03,820
Um, okay, this person here with, I think it's a green long sleeve shirt.

985
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,820
It looks like.

986
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:05,820
Yeah.

987
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,860
And yeah, you, where should that, sorry.

988
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,860
Where are the microphones?

989
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:09,860
Where should they go to?

990
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,420
Once they, uh, there's one on the right, one on the left.

991
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,420
Uh, okay.

992
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:19,900
Over on this side, uh, there's somebody with a white, uh, short sleeve shirt that's bouncing

993
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:20,900
up and down and you're celebrating.

994
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:21,900
You're standing.

995
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:22,900
Yes.

996
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:23,900
Yes.

997
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,900
You.

998
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,900
Yes.

999
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,900
You.

1000
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:27,900
You just sit up and celebrate.

1001
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,900
Sit down.

1002
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,900
Right there.

1003
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,900
Right there.

1004
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,900
Code to the microphone.

1005
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Oh, you're worrying me already.

1006
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Okay.

1007
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,460
I seem like you also have already begun to hear are the rules.

1008
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,100
Um, we're going to hear your name and hear your question and it's going to be a question

1009
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,100
that we can help with.

1010
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:49,180
Remember the funny story that ends with your last chance to sit down and, uh, we will choose

1011
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,700
the one that we can help the most, not the best anecdote about whatever, just the one

1012
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,700
we can help the most.

1013
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,700
Okay.

1014
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,860
And also if we don't pick yours, it doesn't mean your question wasn't good.

1015
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,860
No.

1016
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,340
It just means that we can't help you because we're dinguses.

1017
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,340
Yeah.

1018
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,340
Uh, let's start over here.

1019
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:05,340
Hi, what's your name?

1020
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,340
Uh, hi, my name's Ryan.

1021
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,340
Hi, Ryan.

1022
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,340
What's your question, Ryan?

1023
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:14,220
Uh, so my dad won't stop, uh, texting me animated gifts and then asking me for my feedback in

1024
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,220
person.

1025
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:22,620
And I don't know what to say to him.

1026
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,620
Okay.

1027
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,140
That one's very simple, but relatable.

1028
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,140
That's very good.

1029
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,140
Uh, what is it?

1030
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,140
Is that, that's the end?

1031
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,140
Okay.

1032
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,140
That's the end of the question.

1033
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,140
What's your name and your question?

1034
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,140
Danielle.

1035
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,140
Hi, Danielle.

1036
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,140
Sorry.

1037
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:39,140
Yeah.

1038
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,140
It amplifies it.

1039
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,140
Yeah.

1040
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,140
Shoots it all over this big room.

1041
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,140
Even louder.

1042
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,140
Yeah.

1043
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,140
Uh, what is your question, Danielle?

1044
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,100
Um, I work in a nice restaurant and, uh, in an ice restaurant, a nice restaurant, nice

1045
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,100
restaurant.

1046
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,100
Okay.

1047
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:55,020
I don't do anything besides stick a candle in the desserts, but sometimes I'm asked to

1048
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,780
sing because I am studying to be a professional singer.

1049
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,780
Okay.

1050
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,780
Shit.

1051
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:07,220
So, so sometimes I sing for a guest, but sometimes it's during rush and the entire floor gets

1052
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,220
quiet.

1053
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,060
And then the next guest wants me to sing happy birthday too.

1054
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,380
So how do I stop the chain of snowballing happy birthdays?

1055
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:22,300
Ah, listen, y'all, both your lives are ruined.

1056
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,580
We're going to be sorting through rubble either way.

1057
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,220
Damn.

1058
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:28,780
These are both really good.

1059
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Yeah.

1060
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
That's really good.

1061
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,300
Let's, can we help out?

1062
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
We can help out.

1063
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:39,260
Cause I think we can help you very fast, very fast.

1064
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:44,260
I don't actually, I was hoping you could.

1065
00:51:44,260 --> 00:52:07,980
I'm sorry if you're, if you're listening at home

1066
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:18,460
if you're listening at home, I just did a finishing joke to Griffin.

1067
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:26,420
A very big bee got on the stage and went for my beloved brother Travis.

1068
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,220
Just deathly allergic.

1069
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:34,860
I fought the bee and I won, but I farted while I was doing it.

1070
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,860
That's right.

1071
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,860
Everybody laughed very big.

1072
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,860
Griffin fell.

1073
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:43,860
Griffin fell slowly and of his own accord.

1074
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,860
Okay.

1075
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,860
Okay.

1076
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,860
Paul.

1077
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:51,060
Earlier, Paul, earlier you offered me ibuprofen backstage.

1078
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:56,380
I would love some right now.

1079
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,540
Okay.

1080
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,540
I think what you.

1081
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:07,040
I bought you two dipshits a lot of time to think of a good answer.

1082
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,740
So dad texts you a gift.

1083
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,620
You then, when you see him next, I want you unprompted to pull out a legal pad that you

1084
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:17,420
have seven pages of notes applied.

1085
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,660
And I want you to go beat by beat methodically and go, and another thing I think you could

1086
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,380
do better with your gifts and really get in there.

1087
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,200
Tell your dad he's ready for Tumblr.

1088
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,140
Say these are great gifts and I'm ready for you to start Tumblr.

1089
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,540
Then get the link to the Tumblr.

1090
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,340
Then send me the link to enjoy your dad's gifts.

1091
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,100
I hope that helps you very much.

1092
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:47,220
Thank you.

1093
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,500
Three fucking ibuprofen, Paul.

1094
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Let's party.

1095
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,700
This is our fucking behind the music, Griffin.

1096
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:56,420
Things went bad for Griffin.

1097
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:58,100
Things already went bad for Griffin.

1098
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,800
He fought the big bean.

1099
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,540
He found his vertigo unable to control.

1100
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,740
He turned to using drugs on stage.

1101
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:12,380
So people make you sing.

1102
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:18,780
Can you get some sort of hose peripheral that you just put right up here and then lead directly

1103
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:24,740
to their mouth, their ear or their mouth.

1104
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,420
And feed them cake like a mama bird.

1105
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:32,820
I would do the, if Mariah Carey would sing into a hose into my mouth and then make it

1106
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:37,100
sing like I was singing her beautiful voice.

1107
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,300
My head's not going to work good for the rest of them.

1108
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,300
I actually, I miss, because I see this in movies all the time and TV shows and I've

1109
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:49,940
never seen it happen in real life, like the piano just in the middle of the thing and

1110
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:55,060
like a singer who just like, not like a band that performs, but just like that's what this

1111
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,460
restaurant is and everyone's there apparently to see this happen.

1112
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,780
So I say you just lean into it and he just like, this happy birthday song is for everybody.

1113
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:07,420
Full blown la la land.

1114
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:08,420
No that sucks.

1115
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,740
But the song I sing is only happy birthday?

1116
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:12,740
Well does it have to be?

1117
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:16,020
You're going to have to do your own spin on it, right, where you just like make it really

1118
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,860
long because that's what people love.

1119
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:22,860
When the birthday song goes on forever and people are like, yeah more, keep going, slower.

1120
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:26,900
Sing the secret second verse of the happy birthday song.

1121
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,620
All the extra stuff with like Scooby Doo and all that.

1122
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,620
Oh yeah.

1123
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,620
Exactly.

1124
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,620
Yeah, and more.

1125
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,060
But make it last like seven minutes long.

1126
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,860
Nobody will want to hear that again I feel like.

1127
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,420
Oh, I got it.

1128
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,860
Start offering people a choice.

1129
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,860
They can have a free dessert or the song, but not both.

1130
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,940
You'll never have to sing the song.

1131
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:53,540
Can you get someone to come out and like put a cape on you after like James Brown used

1132
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,540
to?

1133
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,540
Like, no, she can't sing anymore.

1134
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,540
She can't.

1135
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,780
Listen, you heard it.

1136
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,780
We put the cape on.

1137
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,780
It's over.

1138
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,780
That's the end of it.

1139
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,780
We need that by the way.

1140
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,620
I would love that.

1141
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,900
Or a neck brace.

1142
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
Did we help?

1143
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,900
Yes.

1144
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Thank you.

1145
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
Thank you.

1146
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
Nice.

1147
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:22,980
All right, let's go more middle this time.

1148
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,740
Somebody has a top hat over here.

1149
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,220
Sorry, this top hat.

1150
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,340
The fact that multiple people applauded for the top hat is like, what's up my brother,

1151
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,340
my brother, my listeners.

1152
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,340
Go left.

1153
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,340
Yeah, stage left.

1154
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,340
Okay, right here.

1155
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,340
This way, this way, this way.

1156
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,340
Yeah, you got it.

1157
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,340
Right here, you're wearing glasses.

1158
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:43,860
You're here to have a blue shirt that perhaps is denim and maybe yes, please stand up.

1159
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,860
Yes, it's you.

1160
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,860
Yes.

1161
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,860
Come on down.

1162
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:47,860
All right, you're stage right.

1163
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:48,860
You're wearing glasses.

1164
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:52,420
That was the worst injury we sustained during a live show before, right?

1165
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,860
Easily top five, at the very least.

1166
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,020
Oh, shit.

1167
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,580
That's not just any top hat.

1168
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:05,540
Your cosplaying is Griffin from episode two of my brother, my brother and me.

1169
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,380

All six episodes available.

1172
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,940
That fucking rules.

1173
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,180
It's really good.

1174
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:19,380
What is your name?

1175
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380
My name is Anna.

1176
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,380
Hi Anna.

1177
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,820
And Anna, what is your question?

1178
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:28,980
I work at a job that I hate and I want to quit, but I can't get my vacation benefits

1179
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,380
until I hit a year and that's six weeks away.

1180
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,380
Okay.

1181
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,860
And my boss, I think senses this and is trying to like get me to quit before then by being

1182
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,580
like, you seem really unhappy.

1183
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:43,980
So how do I beat her?

1184
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:44,980
I love that.

1185
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,540
We don't get the adversarial ones enough.

1186
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,540
That's awesome, Anna.

1187
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,540
Thank you.

1188
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,540
What is your name?

1189
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,540
I'm Katie.

1190
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,540
Hi Katie.

1191
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:52,540
Who are you trying to thwart?

1192
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,540
Security here.

1193
00:57:53,540 --> 00:58:02,020
No, we have, my boyfriend got us a season tickets to the Broadway shows that come here.

1194
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,020
Okay.

1195
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:05,920
And our seats are actually where we're sitting tonight, which is convenient.

1196
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,620
Because my question is what is the best way to hide snacks here for when we come to the

1197
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:13,620
show?

1198
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Yes.

1199
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,620
In the chandelier.

1200
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:16,620
Hypothetically.

1201
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:26,100
I want to do that one just so I can reference heavyweights a lot.

1202
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,100
Anna thank you so much.

1203
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,180
I don't think we can help you enough.

1204
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,660
Just like, just like chill.

1205
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,660
That one's easy though.

1206
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,660
Just like chill.

1207
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,800
Chill and don't get fired, Anna.

1208
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,800
You can do it.

1209
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,540
I'll play out without last.

1210
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,020
Right.

1211
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:46,220
So your first order of business is going to be disguised because you have been spotted

1212
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:47,700
by the theater officers.

1213
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,140
They have your name.

1214
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,140
I'm looking.

1215
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:51,140
Yes.

1216
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,020
They're putting your picture on a bulletin board.

1217
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:57,700
Listen, the first obvious choice is going to be like slid open the seat.

1218
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,700
So the canning.

1219
00:58:58,700 --> 00:58:59,700
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1220
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,700
This is a mistake.

1221
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,700
But don't do that.

1222
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
This is a mistake for a lot of reasons.

1223
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,340
First of all, you're going to put your butt on your food.

1224
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,780
Like this is not great.

1225
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,180
But also there's a lovely theater you shouldn't go to.

1226
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,300
Maybe just like tape it to the bottom of the seat.

1227
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,260
I know that's pretty easy, but is that cool?

1228
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,260
I'm looking around at the security.

1229
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,260
Do y'all check for it?

1230
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,260
No, no, no.

1231
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,980
I'm going to, I'm going to begin to shake it head no.

1232
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:22,980
All right.

1233
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:23,980
But serious questions.

1234
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:24,980
Security forces.

1235
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,980
Do y'all actually check for that?

1236
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,980
They're shaking head yes.

1237
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:27,980
Wow.

1238
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:28,980
That's thorough team.

1239
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:33,020
What don't you check for?

1240
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,020
Yeah.

1241
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,020
I almost fell over again.

1242
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,840
Oh, hell no.

1243
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,840
Now it's real.

1244
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,820
Now there's nothing holding up your back.

1245
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,820
Right.

1246
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:50,340
But my instinct won't be to lean back anymore.

1247
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:54,940
Can you give Katie some sort of like pass, some sort of snack, all you can eat snack

1248
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:55,940
pass.

1249
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,620
How much would they have to bribe you before you let them bring bribery bribery.

1250
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,620
Yeah.

1251
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,620
Okay.

1252
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,620
Okay.

1253
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,620
But like one snack for you, one snack for them kind of thing.

1254
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:05,620
You know what I mean?

1255
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:06,620
Would that work?

1256
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:07,620
No.

1257
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,620
I'm seeing a shaking head.

1258
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,620
No.

1259
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,620
Again.

1260
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,620
That's another no.

1261
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,140
You haven't had like you were a kid that if they bribe a Mars bar, holy shit.

1262
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:25,900
I don't know why I'm focusing on just, I mean, could you borrow their top hat?

1263
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,820
Cause that's just a lot of snack potential.

1264
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:34,140
You could get four summer sausages up in that thing.

1265
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,140
Just four.

1266
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,140
I mean maybe more summer sausages depending.

1267
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:42,660
I mean, if you go full Jamiroquai, we're talking about eight to nine summer sausages.

1268
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:48,940
What you need to do is tape the snacks now to the seats now, but don't eat them now later.

1269
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:49,940
Pick them up.

1270
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,300
So they're already there waiting for you.

1271
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,100
Your seats are saved, right?

1272
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,540
Just magnet them to there like people do with the car keys.

1273
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,940
And can I recommend now and laters?

1274
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:02,780
Perhaps a now and later or something non-perishable along those lines.

1275
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:06,420
Or maybe like tape them to your body, you know, like.

1276
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,380
I don't think that there's a good retrieval path for that.

1277
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,380
That is true.

1278
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,380
In the middle of it.

1279
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:18,340
Do you hear the people sing this song?

1280
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:19,340
Does that help?

1281
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:24,340
We'll see you in two weeks when we come back for that.

1282
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Thank you.

1283
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:31,620
I'm going to turn my chair back around now because this is deeply uncomfortable.

1284
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:35,100
Could you convince them that it's a Rocky Horror kind of thing?

1285
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:39,460
Like every time we see songs for a new world, we throw Raisinets at this one part.

1286
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:40,460
So I got to bring them in.

1287
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,500
I bet Sigourney would be like, oh, cool.

1288
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,540
We love when you throw stuff at the stage.

1289
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:46,540
So good.

1290
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,540
All right.

1291
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,540
Okay.

1292
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,780
Let's go.

1293
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:53,140
Remember you really everybody's doing good so far.

1294
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,140
Let's keep the streak alive.

1295
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,940
There's a person with a red toboggan pointing at somebody else.

1296
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,940
Yeah.

1297
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,860
You like, I don't know, like 10 rows back.

1298
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:01,860
Yeah.

1299
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,660
You just took your toboggan off and now you're pointing at somebody.

1300
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:04,660
Yeah.

1301
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:05,660
You're pointing at yourself.

1302
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,660
There we go.

1303
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,660
This is the most.

1304
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,660
You are stage left.

1305
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:10,620
And then on the right side.

1306
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,620
Okay.

1307
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,620
Right there.

1308
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:16,060
I think you have on a pink, pink shirt and you have like, yeah, you just turned your

1309
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:17,060
head to look behind.

1310
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,060
Yes, you.

1311
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:19,060
Yes, you.

1312
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,060
You're pointing at your own face.

1313
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,300
We should have started with you already 30 seconds ago.

1314
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:23,300
Sorry.

1315
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,020
My name is Becky.

1316
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,340
Hi Becky.

1317
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:31,540
My question is if you could give me advice on good topic starters when I'm meeting new

1318
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:35,460
people because I was told the ones I do are inappropriate.

1319
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:40,940
Well, I got to hear, well, well, no, hold those hostage.

1320
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:41,940
Don't tell us.

1321
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,940
Don't tell us.

1322
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,940
Okay.

1323
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,940
Make us ask for it.

1324
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,900
Give me a sneak preview of their viability for a podcast that people listen to.

1325
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,700
I misunderstood what goes into a prostate exam.

1326
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:58,460
All right, all right, all right, all right.

1327
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:01,620
I think we're going to get along great.

1328
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,620
What is your name?

1329
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:03,620
Violet.

1330
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,620
Violet.

1331
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:05,620
Hi.

1332
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:06,620
Get right up on that mic.

1333
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,620
Violet.

1334
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:08,620
Okay.

1335
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:09,620
Thank you.

1336
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,660
Oh, what is your question, Violet?

1337
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:19,580
So I got a new roommate this year and it's fine, but she has a lot of cups and mugs in

1338
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:22,740
assorted drinking devices.

1339
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:24,960
Like I counted, it's about 30.

1340
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:25,960
It takes up-

1341
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:30,360
Can we bring Violet's mic up just a little bit because I need to hear a lot more about

1342
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,460
cups and mugs.

1343
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,660
It takes up two of our shelves in the cabinet.

1344
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:39,180
I only own two mugs and they barely fit.

1345
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:40,180
Yeah.

1346
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,740
What do I do to these mugs?

1347
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,900
How should I get rid of her cups or-

1348
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,900
Okay.

1349
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,900
All right.

1350
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,220
I love that one very much.

1351
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:52,740
Real quick.

1352
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:55,700
How do you think a prostate exam works?

1353
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,020
And then we're going to do a deep dive on the mugs.

1354
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,140
Do you know the phrase, I hope he has small hands?

1355
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,140
Okay.

1356
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:05,140
Yeah.

1357
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:07,780
I presume that because they're talking about the whole hand.

1358
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,780
Oh my God.

1359
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,780
The whole hand.

1360
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,780
Oh God.

1361
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,140
Like a muppet scenario?

1362
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,140
Yeah.

1363
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,140
Okay.

1364
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,140
Thank you very much.

1365
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:18,340
You're a wonderful person and I'm glad you're on earth.

1366
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:28,500
They have to check the weight of the prostate and the ripeness.

1367
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,500
Not ready yet.

1368
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,500
Okay.

1369
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,340
So my first question is why do you still own two mugs?

1370
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,900
Because it sounds like you're good.

1371
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,140
Sounds like you could probably get rid of those pretty easily to start with.

1372
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:41,620
How novel are the mugs?

1373
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:42,620
Yeah.

1374
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,620
Is that like a mug collection?

1375
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,620
My mugs or her mugs?

1376
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:45,620
Whose mugs?

1377
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,620
Their mugs.

1378
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,060
If they have 30 mugs, they must love all.

1379
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:51,420
There's a story behind each one.

1380
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,620
No, I think she just picked them up at yard sales and then the rest are like Facebook

1381
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:57,740
mom quotes about coffee.

1382
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:58,740
Okay.

1383
01:04:58,740 --> 01:04:59,740
Fuck.

1384
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:00,740
Oh boy.

1385
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:01,740
Um, okay.

1386
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,940
Are there any that are duplicates that she has more than one of?

1387
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:05,940
No.

1388
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:06,940
God damn it.

1389
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:07,940
All original.

1390
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,620
What if those were, I was going to shatter those.

1391
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,780
You were going to shatter those.

1392
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,780
You know what?

1393
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:13,780
Here's the problem.

1394
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:16,780
They're not like in one space on two shelves.

1395
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:17,780
Yes.

1396
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,340
Two mugs spread throughout the kitchen.

1397
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:21,740
Just mugs everywhere.

1398
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:24,940
But just enough that if someone looks in one cabinet, they're like, that's an appropriate

1399
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:26,300
amount of mugs.

1400
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:30,100
Unless they open all your cabinets in your house, at which point they're robbing you.

1401
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,060
And then some mugs are going to go away and you're fine.

1402
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:36,340
Oh, so you got robbed.

1403
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,340
Yeah.

1404
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,300
That'll get you out a lot of roommate pickles.

1405
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:50,820
Uh, I mean, you could spend a whole day smashing 30 mugs or you could just smash the one coffee

1406
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:51,820
maker.

1407
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:55,980
Well, I don't need these anymore.

1408
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:04,900
Because of an advertiser that pulled out of your favorite conservative news talk show.

1409
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,620
Topical when we use this episode in February.

1410
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,620
Yeah.

1411
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,020
What the fuck are they even talking about?

1412
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:15,420
What did Mr. Coffee do now?

1413
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:23,340
Um, sometimes I like to store bacon grease in a mug because if you pour it down the drain,

1414
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:24,940
it'll clog the drain.

1415
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:30,420
So maybe you could just start cooking a lot of bacon.

1416
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:33,660
You can also then later use it for like for making gravy.

1417
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,340
It's not perfect for making gravy or if you want to take some out and put it, hey, Thanksgiving

1418
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:38,340
tip.

1419
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,660
That's coming up.

1420
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,620
Maybe you put a little bacon grease on the skin.

1421
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,620
That's real nice.

1422
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:43,620
You're going to like that a lot.

1423
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,140
It's not a joke.

1424
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,860
Not especially funny is the only problem.

1425
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:47,860
It's not a joke.

1426
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:48,860
Just let me try this Thanksgiving.

1427
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:49,860
Can you form it?

1428
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,740
He's laughing because they're typing it into Evernote right now.

1429
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:54,740
Like, do not forget.

1430
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:05,660
Can you make a mug friend out of all these mugs named Muggsy and you can't take Muggsy

1431
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,660
apart.

1432
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,820
I love Muggsy and it won't be on your shelves anymore.

1433
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:16,540
Be in your living room filling up a whole chair and you can play games with Muggsy and

1434
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:21,500
watch television with your new best friend, Muggsy.

1435
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,780
What video game would you play with Muggsy?

1436
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:24,780
Bubs.

1437
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:25,780
Bubsy.

1438
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:26,780
Oh, shit.

1439
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,780
Cuphead.

1440
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:30,020
That's what I was going for.

1441
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,300
God damn it.

1442
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,300
Here's the thing.

1443
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,300
One of the things you.

1444
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,860
Oh, I love Muggsy though.

1445
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:39,820
Are you going to play with Muggsy or are you going to do a different joke?

1446
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,700
When my daughter makes slime, she only likes to make it.

1447
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:43,700
She doesn't like to play with it.

1448
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,300
So I'll take it and I'll put it in what I like to think of as slime purgatory.

1449
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:52,180
So it's hidden on a shelf and if she notices in three days, then she gets it back.

1450
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:54,100
If she doesn't notice, it's straight in the trash.

1451
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,860
So try that with mugs.

1452
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:00,780
So you just take one mug and hide it and if she doesn't notice that one, then you throw

1453
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,340
it in the trash and you just keep repeating that.

1454
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:07,380
And eventually she's like, I could have fucking sworn I own 30 mugs.

1455
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:09,340
Why don't I own six?

1456
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,340
Unless.

1457
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,340
Unless.

1458
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:16,700
Unless she likes to put them all on the floor, jump into them like a Scrooge McDuck.

1459
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,700
Are you okay?

1460
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:25,340
I think, I think when my vertebra, the one that carries coherent thoughts from my brain

1461
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:29,620
to the rest of my body has dissolved.

1462
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:30,620
Did we help?

1463
01:08:30,620 --> 01:08:31,620
I'm sorry, what?

1464
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:33,620
No, we didn't.

1465
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,620
Sit down.

1466
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:38,980
Thank you.

1467
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,980
Thank you very much.

1468
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:40,980
Thank you very much.

1469
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:41,980
And thank you to you.

1470
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:42,980
Really think about Muggsy though.

1471
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:43,980
Really think about Muggsy.

1472
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,980
There's a lot of meat on them bugs.

1473
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:48,140
Thank you to the Orpheum for having us.

1474
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,140
We're going to wrap up here.

1475
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,140
You can bring the lights down.

1476
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:54,220
Justin doesn't just start thanking people in the middle of, he's a very grateful dude.

1477
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:55,220
Yeah.

1478
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,220
You can bring the house lights down.

1479
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,220
Thank you so much.

1480
01:08:57,220 --> 01:08:58,220
And bring ours like way back up.

1481
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:01,860
So it can just be the shining glittering stars.

1482
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:06,900
Thank you to you all so much for coming and this has been so fun and Minneapolis, you

1483
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:10,780
are like the literal best and we love you so much.

1484
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:11,780
Thank you.

1485
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:18,060
You've been so kind to us and this has been super duper fun.

1486
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,820
Thank you to CAA for helping us book the show and thank you to Paul for giving me the message

1487
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,820

1488
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,820

And other people.

1493
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,300

1504
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,980
Steve, yeah, they're great.

1505
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:05,660
Now the way this show normally wraps up is Griffin reads a Yahoo answer and then we think

1506
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:11,020
about it and then we come back to it next week and answer, provide our answers to it.

1507
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:14,060
So Griffin, do you have one more Yahoo?

1508
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,060
I do.

1509
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,060
Okay.

1510
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:17,060
Let's go ahead and hear that.

1511
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:19,740
I've got an ice cube I'm working through right now.

1512
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:20,740
I'm worried about our brother.

1513
01:10:20,740 --> 01:10:24,180
This one was sent in by level 9,000 Yajoo Drew, Drew Davenport.

1514
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,980
Thank you, Drew.

It's from Anonymous.

1516
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:41,020
The secret hacker organization asks in one collective booming voice, a psychic told me

1517
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:44,860
I had a connection to cats and a cat planet.

1518
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:47,780
It started with a T, but I can't remember the name of it.

1519
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,940
My name is Justin McElroy.

1520

1522
01:10:52,940 --> 01:11:22,780
I'm here with my brother, may kiss your dad square on the lips.
