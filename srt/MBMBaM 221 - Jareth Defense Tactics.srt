1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me,

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,560
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. And joining us today, this is very exciting,

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:03,040
very special guest, beloved J-pop hologram pop star, Hatsune Miku.

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm Hatsune Miku.

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,080
Hatsune Miku, thank you for being here. I feel like your holographic nature is maybe lost

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
based on the nature of our visual medium, but can you in fact confirm for us that you are

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
a projected light specter?

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
I am. I am being projected onto the wall.

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,560
What in the whole shit?

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,760
Um, it's me, Hatsune Miku, fresh from my performance on the David Letterman program.

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
So happy to be here.

17
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,840
Is this your spe- okay, I've only heard your vocaloid singing performances.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
Is this just your speaking voice? Can you confirm that for me hologram now?

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Yes, this is how I talk, and this is how I sing.

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
Griffin, can I talk with you over here for a moment?

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,480
Yes, go ahead about your business.

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,080
Hatsune, you sit down. I made you some oolong that you just absolutely can enjoy because

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,120
you're all light. I'm going to have a sidebar with my brother here. What's up, Trav?

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,240
Griffin, what the fuck is going on?

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
Oh, Hatsune Miku.

26
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
I missed one pre-production meeting.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,760
You missed one very important momentous episode of the David Letterman

28
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,040
late night television program, and you're just- you don't have any cultural touchstones anymore.

29
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
Hatsune, I am so sorry to bother you. I don't know how you're drinking that,

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
but I also don't know how you-

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,960
I'm just making a puddle. It's just a puddle on the floor.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,200
Okay.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
Where's Justin?

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,560
I am using him as my corporeal projector.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
Oh, shit.

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm a hologram based on a vocaloid. It's real confusing for you gaijins, but-

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,480
Not for me. I just want to say up front that I'm a big, big, big fan.

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Yeah, but I have to have a human to project my spectral pop star form,

39
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,080
so I basically just rigged him up as a projector.

40
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,760
And then after you leave your frame, that person dies in 15 minutes.

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
He will be dead in 15 minutes.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,440
That's a bummer. It's real sad.

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,360
Can you- are you- I don't- man, it's really hard to frame this question without being rude.

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you sick?

45
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,120
What?

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,800
I'm just-

47
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah, well, I got the clap.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
No, I meant- oh, Jesus.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,920
I meant, like, do you have perhaps a laryngitic illness?

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
I am a computer program, so you have a virus.

51
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,120
You're next. You're my- I just picked my next projector.

52
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
Oh, shit. Great.

53
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Good one for you.

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,760
See that movie Annabelle? I'm like that.

55
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,400
It's not like that.

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
Except they're the hologram.

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
Sure. Quick question. How was it-

58
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,600
Because obviously, just sort of looking at David Letterman's flop sweats the entire time

59
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,680
that you were doing your shits up there, he did not seem especially,

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
especially comfortable with the arrangement.

61
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
I think- I think the only thing he said afterwards was,

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
there she is, which is arguably the most uncomfortable thing.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,120
I gotta say- I mean, he announced his retirement.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,240
I think upon seeing me, there was a very clear moment

65
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,800
where he realized I've stayed too long.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,200
Yeah.

67
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,000
I am at that point where I'm introducing a hologram.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,080
I've stayed- I've stayed too long.

69
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,880
He walked out of the studio and immediately threw himself into a tar pit.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,560
Just like, I'm ready now.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,840
I'm ready now. I'm done.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
Was it uncomfortable for you?

73
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
I mean, I'm literally just a computer program.

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Nothing is uncomfortable for me.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,360
So no, I had a fine time.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,640
They had some great treats in the green room.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
Like, like EXE's?

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,760
Yeah, there were EXE's that I just know me.

79
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,040
Delicious Executables?

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,280
Okay.

81
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:49,680
Delicious Executables.

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,840
What the fuck is going on?

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,160
I just wish that you paid closer attention to pop culture.

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,880
I pay attention to life, Griffin.

85
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,760
Yeah, I guess so.

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,640
Well, I'm gonna release this guy.

87
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

88
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
I got a show in Cleveland I gotta start.

89
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,120
I gotta plug in and juice up for.

90
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
Oh man, that was good soup.

91
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,480
How are you eating soup?

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,080
I'm just puddling it.

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,080
It makes me gassy.

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,640
Thank you for being on the show.

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,960
Thank you for inhabiting and then killing Paul Schaefer.

96
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
It was a real joy to have you.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
Yeah, but yeah, my pleasure.

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,040
Where's my ride?

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
Oh, it's right here.

100
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
I have a torrent waiting for you.

101
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Into the music Versaio.

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Justin, you all right?

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,160
Yeah, I'm fine.

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
I thought I would die.

105
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:47,840
Yeah.

106
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
But I didn't.

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,800
So that's good.

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,400
It is good.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
You missed probably our best bit ever though.

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
So that's certainly the one that has engaged Travis the most.

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
I think we can all agree on that.

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Yeah, Trav, you should have said when we were pitching this,

113
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,240
when we were like we're going to make all kinds of really great Hatsune Miku jokes.

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,240
Normally what one does in like the comedy structure is take on the role of the

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,480
know-nothing who asked to be educated about the thing.

116
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,480
Maybe you've seen Who's On First where one guy knows about the thing and the other guy

117
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,240
asks questions about the thing and he's confused about the thing.

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,960
Travis has decided to take a different approach where he just pumps, opens up the silence fire

119
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
hose and pumps it right into his mic.

120
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,560
Well, I didn't realize I was supposed to be the know-nothing.

121
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
I just thought I was the say-nothing.

122
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,760
So I went with that.

123
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:40,880
Sure.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,040
You represent the flyover states regarding Hatsune Miku.

125
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,680
I also was checking Twitter, so.

126
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,640
God damn it.

127
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,960
When people give birthday, Christmas, Valentine cards and such, when is it okay to throw them

128
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,360
away?

129
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,240
We all know the cards will get thrown away eventually.

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,720
Should we throw them away in front of the giver after searching it for cash or perhaps

131
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,640
just cross the name out and regift it as an eco-friendly gesture?

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
That's from Hoarding Hallmark.

133
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,640
Is this a- I was thinking about this the other day because we moved and we brought a bunch

134
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,680
of cards with us.

135
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,160
Some from-

136
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,640
Why?

137
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,120
Well, some were like from our wedding and some like I found a couple birthday cards

138
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,560
from like grandparents and shit.

139
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,760
And my question was, it seems like a thing, like I remember growing up, we had that like

140
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,240
box of Christmas cards that like came out every year and just got added to and added

141
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,960
to.

142
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,320
Did people like used to save these things forever?

143
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,520
Like it ended up with boxes and boxes of hallmarks?

144
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,960
Yeah, I think so.

145
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,720
I think what it was used as like the way you kept in touch with people, it was a lot more

146
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,840
important to save them.

147
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,000
I have a pretty strict rule now where I will hold on to it for one week and then I will

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,840
hold on to it for one week for every word that has been written on the card.

149
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,800
So if it's very like a- it's a very sweet card that someone is taking the time to write

150
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,280
a very personalized message in, I'll save it for longer.

151
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,520
If it's just like, B-Day, crushed it, love Nani, then I don't feel the need to keep

152
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
that for more than a month or so.

153
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,960
I think if you got a card from Nani that said B-Day, crushed it, you would fucking take

154
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
that to the grave.

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,840
Yeah, that's probably true.

156
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,920
Buried with it like a pharaoh.

157
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,520
It would be my payment to Styx to cross the river Styx.

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh yeah, this is great.

159
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,240
This is hilarious.

160
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
Nani wrote this?

161
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,880
You know, Teresa and I debated this a little bit, but I think that any kind of greeting

162
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,320
card, anything like that is such a fucking waste.

163
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,680
Waste of money, waste of resources, waste of time.

164
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,000
Like it's- especially when you're giving another present and a card, it seems so redundant.

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,840
And so like they know it's from you because your name's on the tag.

166
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,480
They know it's their birthday and you're wishing them a happy birthday because you're

167
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
already giving them a present.

168
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
Why do I also have to get someone a card?

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,880
I really think that we are going to- I think a lot of people feel that way, Travis, and

170
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,320
I feel like we're going to have one moment like in- like in Pleasantville where one person

171
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,480
realizes, hey, I hate this.

172
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,400
I hate getting these and I hate buying these.

173
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,040
And it's just going to explode virally.

174
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
Like all of a sudden everyone will say, oh, thank God.

175
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,720
Me too.

176
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
I thought you liked it.

177
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
The process is terrible.

178
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,120
Like you go and you're looking at cards and you're trying to think like, okay, what in

179
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,160
like two pages is going to sum up my relationship with this person, what I think about them

180
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,600
and what I think about myself.

181
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,440
It's such like a weirdly like introspective kind of thing of like, what does this card

182
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,600
say about me when I give it to this person?

183
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,880
But there are so many ways that cards can intensify the pleasure of a present.

184
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
They're present lube.

185
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,200
There is but one way and that is ironically.

186
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,440
No, it doesn't have to be.

187
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,880
You can't look at life through the veil of irony or else you're going to miss so many

188
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,960
great things like fucking-

189
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
Jimmy Buffett.

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Jimmy Buffett.

191
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
You motherfucker.

192
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,280
I've tried so hard to not tweet your shit on Spotify.

193
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,360
It's all he listens to anymore.

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,960
But you open up a card and you're like, oh, fuck it, another time for another card.

195
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,680
It's just another, you know, short poem about what a special grandson I am.

196
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
And then you open it up and what is it?

197
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
Oh no, it's the far side.

198
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,200
And then you get a great old Gary Larson nugget of comedy in there before you open your present.

199
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,240
It's an aperitif.

200
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,080
It's an amuse-bouche that cleanses the palette and then you open it up.

201
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,800
What's in there?

202
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
It's a bop it.

203
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,280
The great kind of bop it with like five different commands on it.

204
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,000
And it's better because of the far side.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,400
For my money, there has only ever been one good card.

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
I've given it to probably a dozen people.

207
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,520
I buy stacks of it whenever I can find it.

208
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,200
And you can't find it anymore.

209
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
But it's a picture of a dad and two daughters.

210
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,040
And the dad and one of the daughters have signs that say happy birthday.

211
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
And the second daughter has a sign that says, I like corn on the cob.

212
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,720
And on the inside it says, please disregard Stephanie.

213
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,960
See, that's good shit.

214
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,760
It's the best card.

215
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
It's the best card.

216
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,520
That's primo.

217
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,080
And you know what?

218
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
That puts you in a mood, doesn't it?

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,120
I get that card and I'm in a mood.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,960
And now I'm ready to receive and then I get the gift.

221
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,920
Ah, fuck yeah.

222
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,760
It's a gift fluffer.

223
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,280
That's what I'm saying.

224
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,480
I think that like you've got to hold on to cards because I think there are fewer,

225
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:42,720
more pure and blissful forms of comedy on this planet than recycling cards

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,000
that you got for someone like say an ex-girlfriend's parents for your birthday.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
And then you recycle that.

228
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,840
And then all of a sudden you're wishing your brother a happy anniversary.

229
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
That's amazing stuff.

230
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,000
That's really, really good stuff.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,840
Yeah, our dad taught us that gag.

232
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,800
And I think I still, it is always actually my instinct to buy the card

233
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,320
that would be the least appropriate for the occasion as a sort of like a built-in punchline.

234
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,880
Yeah.

235
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,520
And it's like a-

236
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,240
What?

237
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,120
It's like a fun like mystery that you have to unravel.

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,360
Like what was the original context of this card?

239
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Justin, you got an anniversary card from me by way of Doval, my ex-girlfriend's dad.

240
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,480
And then you had to remember who that was and why I would ever know a person named Doval.

241
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,880
And now you're in there like now you've cracked it.

242
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,440
Good work.

243
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,880
Thanks.

244
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
I feel like I solved it.

245
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,680
But do we keep them?

246
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,160
That's the thing.

247
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,520
Yes, for that express purpose.

248
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,200
If they're a grand slam and you have a lot of good memories, you keep them.

249
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
But I think if you're not attached to it in any way, it was clearly a formality from the person.

250
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,640
Like you trash it.

251
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,240
Yeah, I think that like a healthy buffer of like two weeks, because here's what you do.

252
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,480
You get the card, you put it on your mantle.

253
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,080
It sits there for like a week, two weeks.

254
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,360
I don't even do that.

255
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,800
That's crazy.

256
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,320
I think you only have to do that if it was a card only occasion.

257
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,520
If they give you a card and a gift, you can trash the card as soon as the party's over.

258
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,400
Yeah.

259
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,840
Because you have the gift to display to say like, I care about the thing you gave me.

260
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,160
But like if all they gave you was like a card expressing like how proud of you they are and

261
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
like a check, you can't display the check.

262
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,840
I just I wish there was some sort of resale environment for greeting cards.

263
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,600
I think there's a secondhand market that exists out there, especially now that I've established

264
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,520
that it's the fucking funniest thing ever.

265
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Like traditional cards just don't cut it.

266
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,480
They don't.

267
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,960
I wish I could get a pre used card.

268
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,000
That's what I'm saying.

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
A lightly used or fuck it.

270
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,080
I want a never ending tome of greeting cards.

271
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,720
A card that is like has been reused 50 times over and it's been somebody's birthday card,

272
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
somebody's Bob Mitzvah card and somebody's brisk card.

273
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,720
So let me throw this out.

274
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,520
Like, sorry.

275
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,800
So how about this?

276
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,600
No, you said it and it's in the episode forever now.

277
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,680
They know what I want to lean into it.

278
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
Let me throw this out.

279
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,960
Let me that's your fucking that's your fucking DJ cool.

280
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,160
Let me clear my throat.

281
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,000
Go to the library.

282
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
Check out a birthday card.

283
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,920
You open the front.

284
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,440
You see where all the dates are stamped right and the names are signed.

285
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,920
You check out the birthday card for someone's birthday and make sure you say I am going to

286
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
need that back.

287
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
I've got to return it to you.

288
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,760
It's it's forty five cents a day that it goes past.

289
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
So I need you to get this back.

290
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,000
But happy birthday.

291
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,480
I mean it.

292
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,040
I love you.

293
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,800
You're my most special grandpa.

294
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,080
But fucking if you don't get this back to the library, I'm coming for your ass.

295
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
I think the I think the recipient has to return it.

296
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,840
Oh, I think that's the only thing that can make it better for you.

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,040
Yeah.

298
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,040
I got you a chore.

299
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,400
My friend started a comic book store in our small town a little over a year ago.

300
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,040
He plans to go out of business soon.

301
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
Nobody plans to go out of nobody plans to go out of business.

302
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,400
He expects to go out of business soon.

303
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,320
And let's see.

304
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
February is looking pretty good for everything I own to come.

305
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,040
Oh, no.

306
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,480
What's the etiquette for the death of a friend's dream?

307
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
Do I send him a card?

308
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes.

309
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,880
If it makes any difference, he is not into hugs.

310
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,080
And that's from morning.

311
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,000
Miss Marvel in Logan.

312
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,800
Seems like some sort of Wolverine tie in could have been appropriate there.

313
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,440
But oh, yes, I'm no expert.

314
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,120
And I'm sorry about Miss Marvel.

315
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,080
Oh, I'm sorry about your friend's dream.

316
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,240
But and I guys, I hate to be this way after receiving this bad news.

317
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,960
But this is what happens when you don't get money zone spots.

318
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,000
Right.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,960
We could have blown that.

320
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,560
We could have fucking helped out.

321
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,000
God, wait a minute.

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,960
You should be careful.

323
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,760
Maybe we did.

324
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
I don't remember all of them.

325
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,560
This this strikes me as like one of those moments in like a movie or a TV show where

326
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,920
what happens is unlike the night before it gets turned over to the bank or whatever,

327
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,080
you just go in with like a six pack of beers and you and your friends have montage

328
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,240
remembrances of all the good times you had in the comic book store or fucking UHF fucking

329
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
pledge drive last minute.

330
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,360
Last you got to be careful.

331
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,080
Oh, my God.

332
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,080
You got to be so careful that you do a UHF and not a be kind rewind.

333
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,600
Oh, boy.

334
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,240
Howdy.

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,000
That's that's very that's very key.

336
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,040
Hey, be kind rewind.

337
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,680
Thanks for being an adorable and funny movie that ends with like the crushing acceptance

338
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,200
that bad things often happen and cannot be changed.

339
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,240
Geez, spoilers.

340
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,360
Yeah, really?

341
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,680
Let's go back to UHF.

342
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,640
See, they buy stocks in UHF, you see shares.

343
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,800
And then at the end, they're not going to make it.

344
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,360
And there's a homeless gentleman who had been given a nickel, a special nickel that

345
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
he sold for a bunch of money.

346
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,720
And he comes in and saves the day at the end.

347
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,400
And thank you for giving a run down of you.

348
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,840
That was really good.

349
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,480
Thank you.

350
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,760
Now this will only work if there's a big corporate comic book store in town that has

351
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
been putting him out of business.

352
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,080
Globo comic.

353
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,280
We'll call them.

354
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
I hate to hear this first off.

355
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,160
Like this is this is very sad.

356
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:20,960
What I would try to urge you to have your friend focus on is that while the comic book

357
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:28,320
store may not have thrived, the dream was fulfilled.

358
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,280
I mean, so many people walk around thinking, you know, I'd love to do this.

359
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,520
I'd love to have a comic book store.

360
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,360
I'd love to have, you know, a bar that I own.

361
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,520
I'd love to have a hit comedy podcast.

362
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,600
With my two brothers, people have these dreams and they just carry them around and never

363
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,160
live them out.

364
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
Your friend did it.

365
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I mean, they they started a comic book store that they they owned it.

366
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
They worked there.

367
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,520
It was their baby.

368
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,720
I mean, they did it, you know, just because it ends doesn't mean that they didn't, you

369
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
know, get to live their dream.

370
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,640
And that's that's a lot further than a lot of people get.

371
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
Let me ask you guys this.

372
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,240
Does how does it change this situation and how this person should react to it?

373
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,760
If it's because it's one of two things, either the comic book store is closing because, you

374
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,640
know, the economy or maybe it's in a bad location or because everyone's going digital and no

375
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,400
one's like buying comic books anymore or be who the friend running this store just ran

376
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,680
it into the ground.

377
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,280
It's free.

378
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:29,680
Come.

379
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,240
It's free.

380
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,040
Comic Wednesday, by which I mean, everything's free.

381
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
Come come and get it.

382
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,680
You know what I mean?

383
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,720
Like how Stan Lee to run the store on the weekends.

384
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
How do you react if you know what I mean?

385
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
Like because if it's the economy, I feel like that's so much easier because like then you

386
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,280
have that like grumbling like, oh, man, it was the deck was stacked against you.

387
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
Oh, oh, maybe maybe in 10 years.

388
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,560
But right now, but then when you know your friend like, oh, you were doing that, like

389
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:01,760
buy one, get six free deal to try to get people in the door and you you ruined it.

390
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
Like, how do you comfort that friend?

391
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,640
I know I think you have to blame the economy no matter what.

392
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,800
Never admit this friend's family.

393
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,400
The time for that conversation was roughly six months ago.

394
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,600
The time for that conversation was when he decided to let the giant hungry goat sleep

395
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
in his comic book store.

396
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,880
That was before that happened was the ideal time to say, hey, maybe you should have a

397
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,400
strict no goat policy for this establishment.

398
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,280
Lot of edibles.

399
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,120
I hate to hear this.

400
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,240
I hate to hear it, too.

401
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,240
You know, I mean, is it too late to save it by doing what my local comic book store did?

402
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,960
Well, not did.

403
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,120
It just started to have this in its DNA from the beginning and that they sell comics, but

404
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,640
they also sell board games and fucking magic cards and D&D minis.

405
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,880
And they rent out table space where people play D&D.

406
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,840
I feel like a lot of comic book stores go in that direction where it's just like a honey

407
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,520
pot for like seven kinds of nerds.

408
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,760
It's like a full hobby shop.

409
00:19:59,760 --> 00:19:59,920
Right.

410
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,800
And you get them in there like, I don't know, I just kind of want to play some Pokemon cards.

411
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,680
They're like, cool, cool, cool.

412
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,880
Have you read the new Hawkeye?

413
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,680
What's a Hawkeye?

414
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,640
What's reading?

415
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
And they say, I've got a lot of things for you.

416
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,680
And the guy who's a hawk.

417
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,720
There's a guy who's a hawk.

418
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,600
He's a pretty cool guy.

419
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,760
No joke.

420
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,240
That's actually why I started reading comics.

421
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,360
Because you were just there playing Pokemon?

422
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
I was there.

423
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
Well, I wasn't playing Pokemon.

424
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
I was filling in the gaps of my collection.

425
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,680
For you, it's more art.

426
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,480
It's more like you're painting.

427
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,760
I appreciate the arts.

428
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,880
The art of the dance.

429
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:37,440
I appreciate seeing how the artist of the card has realized Electabuzz in his native environment.

430
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
The Electabuzz card is beautiful.

431
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,480
It's on acrylic.

432
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,920
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,960
Please, anything.

434
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,640
This Yahoo is sent in by level 44,000 Yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

435
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,160
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

436
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:56,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jim, who asks, how to package hummus for trick-or-treaters.

437
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
Oh, no.

438
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,920
I'm handing out homemade hummus this Halloween and want to ensure it stays fresh and doesn't

439
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,560
spill in the bags of trick-or-treaters.

440
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,360
What is the best small inexpensive container I can use?

441
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,080
Garbage can.

442
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,680
Just hand each of them pre-thrown away.

443
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
I know what you're doing with this when you get home.

444
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,600
The thing that I imagined was like, do you guys use those dishwasher packs of detergent?

445
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,040
I imagine that, just like filled with hummus.

446
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,880
But I want it to be like super pressurized, so like when you puncture it at all, it's

447
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,720
just like an ocean of hummus, just sort of spraying out.

448
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,640
So I'm a 30-year-old man.

449
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,240
I have not trick-or-treated in many years.

450
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,800
But I wonder if parents have become more or less like, we have to check your candy and

451
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
go through your stuff before you can eat any of it.

452
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Or if now it's just like, fuck it, I don't care.

453
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,840
In this, in the dawning of the age of Etsy, fucking everyone's gotta be crazy about homemade

454
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,240
goods.

455
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,160
You made cake, what'd you get?

456
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,200
Well, I got two bit of honeys, I got one fun-sized Snickers, and like 8,000 cake pops.

457
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,560
Yeah, and so like our parents are like, well, you can have those three things, and I guess

458
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
I gotta garbage the rest of this.

459
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,960
No, no, I think parents are down.

460
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,480
I don't think nobody puts fucking razor blades and pineapples.

461
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:29,200
That candy stuff is the most, it's such a bad and good side of humanity.

462
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,480
It's like, there's one night where kids can just go door-to-door and their neighbors

463
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,880
in the spirit of community open their doors and give the kids free candy.

464
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,760
There has to be one person who's like, but what if one sicko wants to poison it and they

465
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,680
wanna poison a bunch of kids?

466
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,920
Like, listen, it's not hard to poison kids.

467
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,880
If you're looking for an opportunity to do that, kids will eat anything, okay?

468
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,440
You don't have to make a big show of it.

469
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,160
I imagine if I was like, I'm so horny to poison kids, I would probably get a job as

470
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,680
someone who works in a cafeteria.

471
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,000
That would be the gig for that person.

472
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,880
They wouldn't set a trap and hand poison everything.

473
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,080
I think they'd just dump something into oatmeal and say, best of luck.

474
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,800
You know, I'm really gonna make an evening out of killing these kids.

475
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Sure.

476
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,440
Yeah, like, don't make a big production out of it.

477
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,880
Somebody, Yahoo Answers user starfishltd said, Ziploc baggies, but as you've been told,

478
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,560
homemade treats get thrown out.

479
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,720
If you put your name and address on an accompanying card, they may keep it.

480
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,280
Oh, this is, oh, this is Bryce Hummus?

481
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,240
This is Bryce Hummus at 2101 Oakshire?

482
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Oh, man, you got it.

483
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,760
Yeah, no, this one is-

484
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,360
This is some artisanal hummus.

485
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
This is artisanal, you're a fucking little kid, you wouldn't appreciate the work that

486
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,920
went into these chickpeas.

487
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,400
Wait, that's an even bigger question, girl.

488
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,960
What little kid is like, I got a fun-sized snicker, I got some, oh, hummus!

489
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
Oh, a gross bag of hummus!

490
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
Mom, some loose hummus in my bag?

491
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,640
Yes, please.

492
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,160
Cut up those green peppers, Mom.

493
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,280
We're having a night.

494
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,920
Have some friends over, I've got Nosh covered.

495
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,440
Do you remember when we used to play poker with our Halloween candy?

496
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,080
Can you, what is, what is the fucking exchange rate of a fucking dime bag of hummus?

497
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,960
The hummus works to lower the price, like, all I've got is this full-size snicker.

498
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,160
Okay, wait, and hummus, so then it's like half of a candy bar.

499
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,680
You can always tell when Teddy KGB goes for a second dip into the hummus that he's bluffing.

500
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Do not splash the hummus!

501
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,000
He's my-

502
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,440
Splash the hummus whenever I want.

503
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
Ah, fuck me. He's a man, he's chickpeas.

504
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,440
As an adult kid, just give him a fucking Milky Way.

505
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
What's the matter with you?

506
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,400
Like, it's what Halloween is for.

507
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,680
Kids, like, it's almost like, I remember there was a person on our block that just would,

508
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:04,000
like, reach into a bowl of change and just, like, dump, like, six pennies and a nickel into your bag.

509
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,240
Oh, yeah.

510
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,880
And it was, it was as though his hand was saying, and fuck you, and here's 11 cents.

511
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,400
Like, okay, great, I'll just throw this away later.

512
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,560
How? How sad?

513
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm sorry, it's like, all I can think about is that Halloween episode of Freaks and Geeks.

514
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,320
How sad is that episode of Freaks and Geeks where the mom makes all the cookies,

515
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,240
then, like, none of the parents will take the cookies,

516
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
and then Linda Cardinale throws eggs at her brother?

517
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,360
Fuck.

518
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,240
Freaks and Geeks, you brought me down, and I haven't watched you in months.

519
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,680
I've never even seen the show, and now I'm like-

520
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, we've balanced it out. Watch the Halloween Pete and Pete.

521
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:39,840
Yeah.

522
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,480
Yeah, that's cool.

523
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,120
That's a good one.

524
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,600
Did you just say you've never seen fucking Freaks and Geeks?

525
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,560
Yeah, I'm sorry.

526
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,200
This has been our Halloween recap episode of My Brother and My Brother and Me,

527
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,360
where we go through some of the classic Halloween eps.

528
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,720
I have a kid.

529
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,680
I want to tell you guys this.

530
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,280
This is not a question or anything.

531
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,440
I'm just sort of, like, going off script.

532
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,560
I have a kid now, and she wakes up early.

533
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,960
I know.

534
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:12,400
Now, did you guys know that at 7.15 a.m. every morning, Cartoon Network shows Check It Out with Steve Bruhl,

535
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:20,080
but at seven o'clock every morning, every morning, they show a special called Fartcopter?

536
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,000
Did you know that?

537
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Every- that's their fucking, like, color bars and beep?

538
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,400
That's the color bars is- and I thought it was a series,

539
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,440
because it's about a kid selling a helicopter toy that makes fart noises,

540
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,560
and it's, like, the best toy and kids are so violent

541
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,480
that it's the only thing that will distract them from violence is Fartcopter.

542
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,680
And I watched it the first time.

543
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,320
I was like, this is amazing that this is a series,

544
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,360
but no, it's a 15-minute special called Fartcopter that they show every day.

545
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
It's baffling to me.

546
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,360
Is this- it sounds a lot to me like Thunderpants.

547
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,160
It sounds a lot to me like Thunderpants.

548
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,800
The movie- do you guys know about Thunderpants?

549
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,400
I always saw it- I always saw it on the shelves in Blockbuster,

550
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,360
and it's sort of like my- it's sort of like my- that book that Desmond from Lost,

551
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,680
like, only wanted to read right before he died.

552
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Thunderpants is like my swan song, and it has Rupert Grint in it.

553
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,880
I'm looking at the IMDB.

554
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,440
Fuck me.

555
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
It's got Ned Beatty.

556
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,680
It's got Paul Giamatti.

557
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,120
It's got Stephen Fry in it and Rupert Grint from the Harry Potter films.

558
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,680
And here's the description.

559
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,080
An 11-year-old boy's amazing ability to break wind leaps him first to fame

560
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,800
and then to death row before it helps him fulfill his ambition of becoming an astronaut.

561
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,800
What?

562
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,160
Stephen Fry.

563
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,400
Cool stuff, man.

564
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
Hey, Ned Beatty, how's your whole thing?

565
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
Is Ned Beatty related to Ned Beatty?

566
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,840
No, Ned Beatty is like, he's a- he's a- IMDB, we have to talk about your descriptions.

567
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,600
Ned Beatty, stocky, genial-looking, supporting actor who was born and raised in Louisville.

568
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,320
Fuck off.

569
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,880
He wrote that himself.

570
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,400
Bad actor.

571
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,400
Anyway, fart movies.

572
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,440
What were we talking about?

573
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,800
Fart movies.

574
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,880
We weren't actually talking about anything.

575
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
How about another question?

576
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,560
I recently moved to a town that has a reputation for being kind of dangerous.

577
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,560
More often times than not, I find myself on the other end of some aggressive

578
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,080
stares from rough-looking individuals.

579
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,720
I'm an Asian male and as such, direct eye contact isn't my area of expertise.

580
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:39,040
Coming out on top of a staring contest, even less so.

581
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,520
With that in mind, what are some things I can do to wig out people who try to stare me down?

582
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,120
That's from Glaring Gladiator in Gilroy.

583
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,520
It- what is- I have to know what Gilroy is.

584
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,400
Apparently, it's like Badlands.

585
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,880
Yeah.

586
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,760
It's in California.

587
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:56,560
Okay.

588
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,480
I- I will say that if- I guess the confusing thing about this question to me is,

589
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,680
if your area is known for being kind of dangerous, maybe wigging out people is not a good idea.

590
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,600
I bet- look at this guy over here, I bet it would take one push,

591
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,320
one solitary push to get this nut off his rocker.

592
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,040
Let's try it.

593
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,480
And watch what happens when I do this.

594
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,680
Let's dance.

595
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,640
You won't use that gun, pussy.

596
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,080
Guaranteed.

597
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,520
Let's dance.

598
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,000
I mean, maybe you guys-

599
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,760
Yeah, I mean, I might just have Bowie on the brain,

600
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
but can you dress up like Jareth from The Labyrinth?

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,360
And just walk around all day fucking swirling a crystal ball of wishes.

602
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,280
There is nothing that would be more intimidating than someone-

603
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,680
someone staring you in the eye and you're like,

604
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,880
I could beat this guy, I could take this Jareth looking motherfucker,

605
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,760
and then he starts contact juggling with the magic of Fushimi.

606
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,440
And walking up the side of a wall.

607
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
You're like, well, fuck me.

608
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,400
Well, okay, well, okay, maybe not.

609
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,520
Now I'm wigged out.

610
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,720
Now I'm wigged out.

611
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
Now I've been wigged.

612
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,160
No, I gotta go home and rethink some things.

613
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,120
I gotta think some things.

614
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
I thought I was the weirdest guy on this block.

615
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,680
Look at this guy crawling up holding a baby.

616
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
He just put me in a- he put me in an oubliette.

617
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,560
No, I'm in an oubliette.

618
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,680
I've never been in an oubliette.

619
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,200
There's a whole new thing for me.

620
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,680
I thought I was cool dressing like 1970s Bowie.

621
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,080
I have to move out of this fucking town.

622
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,200
It's too dangerous here.

623
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm in an oubliette.

624
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,040
There was this song that he started singing,

625
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,120
and I sang it with him about a babe

626
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,240
and how I reminded him of it,

627
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
and the song didn't stop.

628
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,760
We couldn't stop singing it

629
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,360
because it didn't have an end.

630
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,320
It was horrifying.

631
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,080
I walked 15 blocks to the train station

632
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,040
and he put me in an oubliette,

633
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,720
and then all of a sudden I'm back at my house.

634
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,240
I have to start all over again.

635
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:51,760
Sucks.

636
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,640
This sucks.

637
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,840
Jared, through the words.

638
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Got me walking in circles, buddy.

639
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,720
I'm wigged out now.

640
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
I'm officially wigged.

641
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,720
I'm real wigged.

642
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,800
Oh, man.

643
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
Where's my baby?

644
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm gonna swear I had a baby.

645
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
I had a baby like a minute ago.

646
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,560
Can you listen to this?

647
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:08,960
I got it.

648
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,840
I solved the problem.

649
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,640
Good news, guys.

650
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,000
I solved the problem.

651
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,440
When you get close to the person

652
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,480
and you're staring them down,

653
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,440
hand them a chick track.

654
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,560
Say, hi, I want to take you through the Romans road.

655
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,560
Do you know what happens to you when you die?

656
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,280
Wait, come back.

657
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:23,600
Come back.

658
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

659
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,840
You might not realize this,

660
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,640
but something you're probably doing is witchcraft.

661
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,560
You know that Ouija board you're carrying with you?

662
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,960
Did you know that the devil lives inside of it?

663
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,520
Oh, you don't have a-

664
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
Can I just have a moment of your time?

665
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,440
You don't have a Ouija?

666
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,120
Do you play D&D?

667
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,760
No, shit.

668
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,640
Do you listen to Iggy Azalea?

669
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,360
Do you like Kesha?

670
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,740
Okay.

671
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,160
We found it.

672
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,000
There's our inn.

673
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Or the devil's inn, I guess I should say.

674
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,640
That dollar sign in her name stands for Satan.

675
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,360
Speaking of dollar signs.

676
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:08,720
I got two words for you guys.

677
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,440
Hungry boy.

678
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,320
Okay.

679
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
Have you checked out hungryboy.com?

680
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,200
It's exactly what it sounds like.

681
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,160
Hungry boy.

682
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,360
Good news.

683
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,880
Are you a hungry boy?

684
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,080
Uh-oh, are we getting an on-air demonstration of how to eat?

685
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,320
I got a solution for this hungry boy.

686
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,120
Whoa, slow down.

687
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,080
Step-by-step this.

688
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,560
That's nurturebox.com.

689
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,280
Nurturebox?

690
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,400
That is what you're saying.

691
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,160
No, they hate nurturebox.

692
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,400
Yeah.

693
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,600
Two of them are always at odds.

694
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,560
Nurturebox is just pictures of moms hugging kids.

695
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,320
You don't want that one.

696
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,360
You want naturebox.

697
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,880
They got delicious, wholesome snacks at naturebox.com delivered to you.

698
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,280
Do you know what's better than delicious and wholesome?

699
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,080
What?

700
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,480
Free.

701
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,360
Whoa, what?

702
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,800
I'm picking up what you're laying down.

703
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,400
How am I gonna get some free snacks?

704
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I want some free baked sweet potato fries or dark cocoa almonds.

705
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,360
Would you like some free Dutch chocolate sun crunch?

706
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
That's not, there's no way that's healthy.

707
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,800
It is.

708
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,720
Oh, and right now in October, and I don't know how long they'll have this,

709
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,840
but pumpkin nom-noms, pumpkin spice nom-noms, they're incredible.

710
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,960
They're incredible.

711
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,360
We say this shit every week.

712
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,600
I don't understand the fucking physical, chemical,

713
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,440
natural makeup of what a fucking nom-nom is.

714
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,720
We say this, we say those words every week and I don't, is it-

715
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,000
I'm eating them and I still don't understand their dark sorcery.

716
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,560
So you know how you have like a nom, right?

717
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:38,800
No.

718
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,600
Yeah, you know how a nom, like you get a nom off of a nom bush, right?

719
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
And then you just kind of jam two of them together

720
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
and you put some pumpkin spice in the middle.

721
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,120
Okay. Yeah.

722
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,360
It's so good.

723
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,800
It's delicious.

724
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,480
These snacks are free.

725
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,800
If you go to naturebox.com slash my brother, you can get a free trial.

726
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,520
They'll send you a trial box of five of the most popular snacks.

727
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,560
If you work for nature box and you're listening to this,

728
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,960
maybe send me some of those pumpkin nom-noms

729
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,040
and some other stuff with no added sugar.

730
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm trying to get tiny.

731
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,200
Help me out.

732
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,680
Naturebox.com slash my brother is where you can get your free trial of delicious snacks.

733
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,440
So if you do not do it, you're a fool.

734
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,320
You're a fool.

735
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:25,040
We have people every week who are like, I finally did it on Twitter.

736
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,520
We see them.

737
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,320
Do you want a fucking ribbon?

738
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,640
You got free delicious food.

739
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:31,680
Great, great job.

740
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,480
Congratulations.

741
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,920
Now that it's free, if 100% of our listeners aren't doing it,

742
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,360
I don't know what's going on.

743
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,960
Like we're giving you a gift of a free box of stangs.

744
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,640
Just take our gift.

745
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,920
Take our damn gift.

746
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,200
I'm embarrassing us.

747
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,320
You take fucking so much from us already.

748
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,520
Don't pick and choose the lifeblood that you drain out of us.

749
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,320
We're giving you food.

750
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
Your three-headed giving tree.

751
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,120
And now that we're just a stump, you're going to sit on us.

752
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,320
We also have three butts.

753
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
That's not important to this story.

754
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,560
Why would you need to make that?

755
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,000
Why would you need to specify that?

756
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
I'm just trying to clarify the mental picture.

757
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,320
The original giving tree didn't have one butt, Travis.

758
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Wait, wait, wait.

759
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,320
How do you know that, Griffin?

760
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
Because I asked the author.

761
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,680
Take a second to think about the fact that the giving tree had a butt.

762
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,520
I have read every piece of giving tree slash fiction that exists.

763
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,120
That probably exists, doesn't it?

764
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
The giving and taking tree.

765
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,760
Hachi machi.

766
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,980
Hulu.

767
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,740
Yep.

768
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,860
Okay, Travis, you did some weird...

769
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Some weird copy-paste here, my friend.

770
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,020
Oh man, I am reading some giving tree slash fiction.

771
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,260
It is all stump knots and bumps and dents.

772
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,500
It is all sap and ruination.

773
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,940
No, no, no, no.

774
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,820
No, turn it off.

775
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,100
Oh, God.

776
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,400
No.

777
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,740
A slice, it's just a sample.

778
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,660
Isn't it better just to know how it's affecting me?

779
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,020
Let Griffin take this hit.

780
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,060
No need to ruin it for all of us.

781
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,140
No, this is illegal.

782
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:35,780
Griffin is absorbing all of this like John Coffee from the Green Mile.

783
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,620
Leave the lights on.

784
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,620
Fuck me.

785
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,300
So you've tried Hulu.

786
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,980
Oh my God, and it ends with...

787
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,620
Okay, it's extremely explicit.

788
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,100
And it ends, but it ends the way I think the book should end.

789
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
This is the last sentence, and this is actually kind of beautiful.

790
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,460
The shit before it, decidedly not beautiful.

791
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:08,420
The boy laid down and wrapped himself around his childhood friend and love of his life.

792
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,740
Aw, with one final sigh of contentment, gross, and a smile on his face,

793
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,020
the boy closed his tired old eyes for the last time.

794
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,860
He dies on the tree that he just fucked.

795
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,220
With a huge boner.

796
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,260
And was fucked by, thank you giving tree slash fiction.

797
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,660
Did he fuck the tree to death?

798
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,580
Did he, that was his last?

799
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,180
He fucked it in half.

800
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,580
Did he, is this his last action?

801
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,700
Author's note, author's note.

802
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,020
To enhance your reading experience of my tale of love and reconciliation,

803
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:45,460
I suggest that you listen to Jeff Buckley's Hallelujah ball reading.

804
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,500
I heard there was a secret tree that you could fuck.

805
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,660
And all your childhood memories are dead.

806
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,340
Cause I listened to a podcast, tried to sell me snacks.

807
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,340
Oh no!

808
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:06,420
Well, that was a fun sponsorship partnership that we had for a while.

809
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,180
Goodbye, nature box.

810
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,660
So Hulu, you all know Hulu, right?

811
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,300
It's where you can see images that will wash away the images that you currently have in your head.

812
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,460
But HuluPlus.com will do an even better job of laundering your mind with a bunch of,

813
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,100
they got a bunch of current season episodes of shows like Modern Family and The Daily Show.

814
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,700
And you can watch every episode of South Park only on Hulu Plus.

815
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,060
That's amazing.

816
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,260
I mean, Teresa and I use it for like Bob's Burgers and when new episodes of stuff come out.

817
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,900
And we watch it all the time, especially since we moved and we're still getting everything set up.

818
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,100
So it's really pretty awesome.

819
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,380
I love Hulu Plus.

820
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:49,780
Me too.

821
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,300
I love it and they mean a lot to me.

822
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,580
It's the only way that I watch ANTM Cycle 21.

823
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,500
Boys still in that house.

824
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,180
Still a lot of boys in that house though.

825
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,540
Boys have not been removed from the house.

826
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,660
Boys have not been removed.

827
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,220
That man still wears a fucking beard weave.

828
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,820
And then this week they did DNA tests and found out like,

829
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:14,740
oh, you are one 100th of a 15,000th of a percent Eastern European.

830
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,820
So that's what I'm going to make you dress up as.

831
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:22,420
Yes, they had people dress up and you're one bajillionth Native American.

832
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,540
Now put on this headdress and inexplicably pose with a gay bald robot.

833
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,660
I'm not making this up.

834
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,980
And Tyro is like, yeah, it's no big deal.

835
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,180
In the future, all of our races will merge to become one.

836
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,900
Okay.

837
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:37,540
Okay.

838
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,580
And also we will all be part artificial intelligence.

839
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,660
What?

840
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:51,060
Is there a producer of this show that steps back after every episode airs and goes,

841
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,100
was that not enough?

842
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,740
Was it not enough?

843
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,980
What does it take to get this show canceled?

844
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,740
This week they had, this is all on Hulu Plus, by the way.

845
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,780
So you should be watching Hulu Plus.

846
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,740
It's a fever dream.

847
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:06,660
Hulu Plus injects you with a fever dream for 48 minutes a week.

848
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,460
It's eight bucks a month.

849
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,900
Right now you can get a two week free trial when you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

850
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,500
You get an extra week for free.

851
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
So go do that.

852
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,100
And they have tons of original content too.

853
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,420
Oh yeah.

854
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:18,740
Yeah.

855
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,260
There's the awesomes.

856
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:23,620
Seth Meyers and Mike Shoemaker made a show called The Awesomes about

857
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,220
misfit superheroes.

858
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,620
They got 10 episodes in season one and season two.

859
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,140
Well, it says here it's premiering August 4th.

860
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,260
So let's say that it's probably already up and cooking.

861
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,900
And they have shows like East Loves High and The Real Housewives.

862
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,180
Sorry, The Hot Wives of Orlando, which is a parody of The Real Housewives series.

863
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:42,820
Tons of stuff.

864
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,460
Go check it out.

865
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,340
Okay, back to Griffin.

866
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,380
So, okay.

867
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,860
So they had, this week they had two gentlemen.

868
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:56,420
One of them had been sort of making some homophobic comments and the other gentleman

869
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,380
was a gay man who had been offended by said comments.

870
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,900
So they've been sort of beefing.

871
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:08,260
And then Tyra reveals to them in like, it's supposed to be a gigantic twist that they're

872
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,940
both kind of Finnish.

873
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:14,500
There's so much more that connects us than divides us.

874
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,380
For instance, you're both, you're two hundredths of a trillionth of a percent Finnish and you

875
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,940
are four hundred trillionths Swedish.

876
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,060
And those are close together.

877
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,980
And they were like, hug it out.

878
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,340
Hug it out, my brother.

879
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:30,420
There were like three people of different races and ethnic backgrounds.

880
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,140
They're like, guys, you're all barely Asian.

881
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,380
And one dude was like, I knew it.

882
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,620
Yeah.

883
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:43,300
And also it gave a lot of them instant permission to start using like really racist accents.

884
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,460
Like this guy's like, you know, I always thought that I was just Italian and Native American

885
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,340
and now I'm the Latin Lavera.

886
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,700
Yeah, like he actually said, I'm Zoto.

887
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,780
Like dog, dial it back.

888
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,340
This is cycle 22.

889
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,940
We're calling it dial it back.

890
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,900
I think we might just have you guys smile while we take pictures of you for a while.

891
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,380
Could you all just model for one episode?

892
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:15,060
Can you just smile and let me take a fucking picture of you without spitting into a cup

893
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,980
and having scientists analyze it?

894
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,900
What are we doing?

895
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,140
Boys are in the house and so is just like unadulterated lunacy.

896
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,660
Fuck cycle 21.

897
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,420
I have a message for Alexandra Splendor and it's from Maria Babin or Bebbin who asks who

898
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,340
says to Alexandria Splendor.

899
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,220
Oh man, it says it says read as Amelie.

900
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,900
So I have to pump the brakes and let Justin.

901
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,780
No, no, no, no.

902
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,820
Let Griffin read it.

903
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,340
No, I just can't.

904
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,140
I don't do voices.

905
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,860
That's not my thing.

906
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,140
Happy 21st birthday, AJ.

907
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:59,940
You are the friend I always had but never spoke to until the time the universe decided

908
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,380
to send us to Italy.

909
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,460
You deserve all the happiness that exists in this crazy world.

910
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,220
Sir, you're the best.

911
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:16,420
I don't know what I do with dance parties, endless laughs, and drunken times in Rome.

912
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,260
I love you, glass shot.

913
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,260
Why do people want that?

914
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,900
God, that makes me so fucking horny.

915
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:27,460
Oh no, it can't.

916
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,180
It does.

917
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:28,500
It can't.

918
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,020
Got a message here for Travis McElroy.

919
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,140
Hold on, start this over.

920
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:39,060
It's a message for Travis McElroy and it's from Spencer.

921
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,860
Oh man.

922
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,820
And the message is hi Travis from Spencer.

923
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,580
Hi Spencer.

924
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,300
The preferred time frame for this to air is whenevs.

925
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,540
That was like a hundred dollars.

926
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,060
Money well spent, Spencer.

927
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,220
That's so well spent.

928
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,020
Can I say?

929
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,820
Can I say?

930
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,620
Yeah, yeah.

931
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,860
It was the best greeting card I've ever received.

932
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,740
Yeah, see?

933
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,700
But we can't reuse it.

934
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,820
It's the unfortunate part.

935
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,300
There's no-

936
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,420
I can too.

937
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,220
There's no resale market for Jumbotrons.

938
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,180
Trav, one more message.

939
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,060
One more message.

940
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:18,340
Got a message for the brilliant and delightful Lindsay Prevett from her friend and former

941
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,780
traveling companion, Liz.

942
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,900
Thank you so much for being great company and comforting me on so many long and arduous

943
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,380
book tours.

944
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,580
I will miss it all, but especially the bliss of hanging out in airport bars with you,

945
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,780
watching soccer and listening to my bim bam together.

946
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:37,460
You are and always will be the greatest.

947
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,500
Oh my gosh.

948
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,140
I love how-

949
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,020
Beautiful and shit.

950
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,980
Whoever wrote that should be a writer.

951
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:48,580
Should be a writer of novels and autobiographies.

952
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:50,020
That's our friend Liz Gilbert.

953
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,500
Hi Liz.

954
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,940
And that was her message.

955
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,980
Mark your calendars for a brand new thing.

956
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:00,420
The first ever Max Fun Week is coming up October 15th through 21st.

957
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,300
Max Fun Week's all about celebrating the creativity and passion of our listeners.

958
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:09,940
We'll have podcast crossovers, Q&As, behind the scenes tours, giveaways, and more.

959
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,900
No fundraising, just awesome stuff for you.

960
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:16,820
So tune into your favorite Max Fun shows, tell a friend about Max Fun, and check out

961
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,820
some new shows during Max Fun Week, October 15th through 21st.

962
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,380
I made the mistake of reading this Farm Wisdom ahead of time and it just bumps me out.

963
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:29,300
Yeah.

964
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,300
It's like, wait, Griffin, sorry, what did you say?

965
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:40,100
Did you say, Farm Wisdom, Farm Wisdom, get your Pitchfork album recommendations, Farm

966
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,380
Wisdom.

967
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,180
Oh, God.

968
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,020
It's like, guys, you can send us Farm Wisdom.

969
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:49,060
It's like, baby chicks are really soft.

970
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,620
They're scientifically proven to be the softest thing on Earth.

971
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,260
That's great.

972
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:52,740
Give me that.

973
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,300
Baby chicks love so hard that it hurts them.

974
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:55,860
No.

975
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,260
Yes.

976
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,060
Give me that.

977
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,900
But don't give me, chickens only have one hole called a vent they use to poop, pee,

978
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,100
lay eggs, and have sex simultaneously.

979
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,420
That's from Jason Zeta from Montana.

980
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:09,140
Simultaneously.

981
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:09,460
Yes.

982
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,100
They just sort of fucking explode down there.

983
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,340
It's a bad mess.

984
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,220
You have to schedule their whole day around it.

985
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:17,780
There's a lot of-

986
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,260
Can you go to my ballet recital that?

987
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,980
What time is it?

988
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,540
Three?

989
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,340
Hell no.

990
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,420
Well, no, I can't.

991
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,260
I am booked every day at three.

992
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,180
I can be there at 3.01.

993
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,380
That's for goddamn sure.

994
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,100
There's a lot of farmhouse sounds that I, Griffin McElroy, am acquainted to.

995
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,460
Maybe a moo, or a baa, or a er-er-er-er.

996
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,220
Not like a baa-baa.

997
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,380
And that's the sound that chickens make.

998
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,340
Not again, not again.

999
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,020
Oh my god.

1000
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,380
Oh my god.

1001
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,020
I mean, it's over with.

1002
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:50,660
I wish I was dead.

1003
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,820
I mean, it's over with and done.

1004
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,660
They are dead for a second.

1005
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:00,420
I'm done for like a whole day, but oh my god, it never gets any easier.

1006
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,420
I need a minute.

1007
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,660
I don't have a minute.

1008
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,740
I gotta get to my daughter's ballet recital.

1009
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,660
There's a lot of stuff coming and going just in.

1010
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:09,220
Wowsers.

1011
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,540
If you're ever on Survivor, you can use chicken mess to start a fire.

1012
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,020
Is that true?

1013
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,060
Yeah.

1014
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:19,300
But what's, it's all so messy.

1015
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,020
What do we call, what are we classifying as the mess?

1016
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,740
That's everything.

1017
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,260
The poop, pee, eggs, whatever.

1018
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:24,740
The sex.

1019
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,020
The cx.

1020
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:28,020
Is there another one here?

1021
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,580
Yeah, there's another one.

1022
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,380
Is there another Farm Wisdom?

1023
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,500
Fact, fact.

1024
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:30,980
Hit me.

1025
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:34,820
Can you believe there are people who don't like the Farm Wisdom segment?

1026
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:35,860
People are fools.

1027
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,260
It enriches me cosmically.

1028
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,220
Fact, in cold climates, cows love hanging out on top of manure piles

1029
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,580
because the fermentation going on inside puts off a lot of heat.

1030
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:47,620
And that's from Jonathan.

1031
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,820
Jonathan, who I hope is not intimately familiar with poop heat.

1032
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,460
With the radiation of this situation.

1033
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,140
I bet at least one of those cows is just a dirty bird.

1034
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:01,620
They're all dirty birds.

1035
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,820
Yeah, it's warm here, right?

1036
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,620
I know, it's so gross.

1037
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:04,820
I would hate to do this before.

1038
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,740
There's a lot of different kinds of heat right now.

1039
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,380
Actually, I'm exhausted from making my chicken vent noise.

1040
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,460
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1041
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,620
Absolutely.

1042
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,740
This Yahoo was sent in by Jesse Marciano.

1043
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,940
Thank you, Jesse.

1044
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,100
Marciano, I'm sorry I'm so bad at names, everybody.

1045
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,060
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Moon Yara, who asks,

1046
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:32,500
do you believe in the power of runes?

1047
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,140
No.

1048
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,340
Do you believe in runes?

1049
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:37,620
And what will happen to you if you carry a rune or runes in your pocket?

1050
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,140
Does it have an effect on your life?

1051
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,220
I wonder if I will benefit from it.

1052
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:42,580
Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

1053
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,540
What a great, like, mouth-field pleasing word.

1054
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,540
Runes.

1055
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,700
You know, this is the thing.

1056
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,940
I'm gonna real talk here for a second.

1057
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,340
I think the reason stuff like this upsets me so much

1058
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,220
is like when people talk about like crystals and runes and stuff

1059
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,060
is because there was a period of my life

1060
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,260
where I wanted this kind of thing to be true so hard.

1061
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,140
When you were jerking it to Xanth?

1062
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,100
Yeah.

1063
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,060
From age like 12 to like 17, where it's like, please, Matt, please.

1064
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:17,380
Please, please, please, please, crystal, do something.

1065
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,140
Please, crystal, do anything.

1066
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,380
I want Loch Ness Monster to be real.

1067
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:23,140
I want there to be runes and crystals.

1068
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,060
You had a box of crystals, if I'm not mistaken.

1069
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,060
Yes, I wanted it to be real, Griffin.

1070
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,460
I believed it so hard.

1071
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,620
And now I look back on that, Travis,

1072
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,420
and I'm like, fuck, fuck that dude.

1073
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:37,940
Well, I mean, are you mad at yourself?

1074
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:39,940
Are you mad at those fucking crystals for not producing?

1075
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,260
I mean, isn't that the case?

1076
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,140
Like, the thing is, it's like Amnesia Scrooge.

1077
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,020
I need like three crystal ghosts to come and teach it.

1078
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:48,900
It's like, remember?

1079
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,460
Remember when you loved crystals, Travis?

1080
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,980
Take my crystal in hand.

1081
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,820
Fly with me to Xanth.

1082
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,140
I'm going to show you the future of crystals.

1083
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,020
Still nothing.

1084
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:59,380
They're still not doing shit.

1085
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,740
They're still just like pretty translucent rocks.

1086
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:03,620
And that's great.

1087
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,060
I mean, be into that if you want to be into anything.

1088
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,700
I'm the crystalline ghost of the present.

1089
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,140
Still just crystals.

1090
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,540
I, for a while, I thought at that same age range,

1091
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,660
I thought I had psychic powers.

1092
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:19,380
Oh, sure.

1093
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:26,020
Oh, sure, no, when I look back at like my primary school career,

1094
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,020
I have a lot of regrets, but I think the number one regret

1095
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,740
is that I wish I wouldn't have fucking tried to move

1096
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,900
so much shit with my mind while I was just sort of

1097
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:35,780
standing in the hall.

1098
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,340
I think that was probably number one on the list

1099
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:41,300
when I was fucking, when I was like working safety patrol

1100
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,380
and making sure the kids got home from school.

1101
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,060
I wish I had stopped like trying to move leaves around

1102
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,260
with my hand from far away.

1103
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,020
I think that could have significantly improved your profile

1104
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:58,580
within the school if you were weird, leaf-wavy Griffin.

1105
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,060
But you know what?

1106
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,220
It's a gamble because if that shit had worked once.

1107
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,060
It only takes one.

1108
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,620
It only takes the one time, doesn't it?

1109
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,740
I actually have a very clear memory of talking to mom

1110
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:13,620
about my belief that I had psychic abilities.

1111
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,020
And then I described to her, I said,

1112
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,700
here, let me prove it.

1113
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,580
I described to her a gentleman who I believed

1114
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,540
had come into her office like suit color,

1115
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,700
hair color, the whole thing.

1116
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:34,100
I have a crystal clear memory of mom absolutely dodging

1117
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,780
whether or not a gentleman matching that exact description

1118
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,180
entered her office on that day.

1119
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,180
I knew what was up.

1120
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,220
She definitely in retrospect did not say no,

1121
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,580
that didn't happen.

1122
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,340
She kind of changed the subject.

1123
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,900
I think she was scared when I had.

1124
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,140
When we turned 15 and 18 respectively

1125
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,420
and you got like a big birthday party

1126
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,620
and I was like, well, why is 18 so important?

1127
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,220
And mom's response was, when you turn 18, you'll find out.

1128
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,500
And my immediate thought process was,

1129
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,980
oh shit, you get magic powers at 18.

1130
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,900
And they just haven't.

1131
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,340
I mean, you get the magic power of political enfranchisement.

1132
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,140
You get the magic power of smoking legally.

1133
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,740
You get the magical power of just like

1134
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,340
buying like physical pornography,

1135
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,620
which is like, I mean,

1136
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,940
basically the worst magic power at this point.

1137
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,860
But isn't it, isn't that like so like

1138
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,940
because of Harry Potter and shit like Xanthe

1139
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,140
and other kind of like where it's like,

1140
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,620
there's this whole other world of magic going on

1141
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,460
and only the people that truly believe

1142
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,900
and it's like, oh, okay, cool.

1143
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:44,500
So I'm just gonna really truly believe over here for a second

1144
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,260
and just wait for that to start.

1145
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,740
I mean, people wouldn't be writing about this magic shit

1146
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,420
if it wasn't a little bit real.

1147
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,860
It's gotta come from somewhere.

1148
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,220
What, should we just make it up?

1149
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,380
I'll just buy the one room

1150
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,540
and just carry it around in my pocket for a while

1151
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,260
and see how it feels.

1152
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,540
And if you're out there fucking casting dispersions,

1153
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,060
I want you to go into your closet

1154
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,060
and I want you to open that deep dark secret box

1155
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,340
that you have that like magnetic copper bracelet in

1156
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,220
that like moves your fucking inner johns around in your wrist

1157
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,940
to heal your diabetes.

1158
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:14,980
And then I want you to come back

1159
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,340
and listen to the rest of the podcast.

1160
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,300
Hey, you back?

1161
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,340
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1162
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,340
Yeah, guess he told you.

1163
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,100
I guess I told you Mr. Magnetic Bracelet

1164
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,180
everybody on fucking Earth had

1165
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,620
because Dr. Drew was like,

1166
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:28,660
guys, you gotta get down on these magnet bracelets.

1167
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,020
Moves your inner johns around in such a pleasing manner.

1168
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,980
There will probably be a max fun meetup at 25.

1169
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,820
Oh, max fun week is coming up.

1170
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,180
This is a good segue.

1171
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,140
With this talking about bonkers people

1172
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:43,220
who believe in magnet therapy.

1173
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,860
No, well, I think max fun listeners believe in magic.

1174
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,260
Hopefully, I like to speak.

1175
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,860
You know, if you're interested in this kind of stuff,

1176
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,020
check out Oh No, Ross and Kerry and the Max Fun Network.

1177
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,380
They cover this kind of stuff across the board.

1178
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,980
Max Fun, what's that?

1179
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,540
That sounds like a network podcast.

1180
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,660
Max Fun Network.

1181
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,100
That kind of sounds like a network.

1182
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,460
What do you want?

1183
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,540
Sounds like some kind of hive mind of comedy.

1184
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,580
What are you trying to sell me?

1185
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,900
Max Fun Week is coming up.

1186
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,420
We have a question about Max Fun Week.

1187
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,340
Let me just tell you real quick.

1188
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,300
Max Fun Week, October 15th through the 21st.

1189
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,140
Oh my God, that's a coming up.

1190
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,860
We got a bunch of activities.

1191
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,340
There's a trivia day.

1192
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,220
There's a day to leave reviews collectively.

1193
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,420
Collective review day.

1194
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,300
There's all kinds of fun stuff.

1195
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,500
We'll talk about it more here in a little bit,

1196
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:35,380
but there's gonna be a ton of meetups for everybody

1197
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,620
to get together with other Max Fun listeners

1198
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:43,620
and you can find one in your area and go enjoy it.

1199
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,180
So question.

1200
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:46,740
So question.

1201
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,260
There will probably be a Max Fun Week meetup,

1202
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,500
a 25 minute drive away from our home,

1203
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,500
but my husband doesn't want to go because it's a Sunday night.

1204
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,460
How can I convince my husband that it's okay

1205
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,940
to occasionally go out on a school night

1206
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,740
even though it might mess up our chore schedule?

1207
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,820
And that's from No Semi-Spontaneity in New Jersey.

1208
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:10,420
Do you guys do this?

1209
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,540
Yeah, here's the thing.

1210
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,340
It does feel like when you hit a certain age,

1211
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,260
okay, so when you hit like 18 and on,

1212
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,940
the school night thing kind of goes away

1213
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:18,900
and you're like, fuck it.

1214
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:19,940
I got a class tomorrow.

1215
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,580
I don't care.

1216
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,580
I'm just gonna sleep three hours and I'll be fine.

1217
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,780
Why would you sound like that?

1218
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,860
Because that's how I sounded in college

1219
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,780
because I had so many runes in my pockets.

1220
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,820
I couldn't move very quickly.

1221
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:32,660
Ah, Trav's coming.

1222
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:33,940
Here he comes.

1223
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,620
He's like a magic maraca.

1224
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,060
Ah, shit, it's the crystal guy.

1225
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,500
But then like you hit a certain point again

1226
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,500
where you're like, I have to do shit tomorrow.

1227
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:44,900
I think it's like at like 27, 28,

1228
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,740
where you're like, I gotta do stuff tomorrow.

1229
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,020
I don't really want to go out tonight.

1230
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:50,900
And it's like you hit that kind of invincible,

1231
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,420
I don't need any sleep age.

1232
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:54,500
I do that now.

1233
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,780
There is a definite like,

1234
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:59,460
there's a definite risk here though.

1235
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,540
Once you open up this particular, this lamp,

1236
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,380
once you let the genie out of this one,

1237
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:10,260
another thing I always wish for, go on.

1238
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,860
Where you realize like, hey, wait a minute.

1239
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,900
I went out tonight.

1240
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,900
I went out on a night when I have to work tomorrow.

1241
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,980
I could do this every night.

1242
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,860
I had a time, we had a time period

1243
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:24,660
where we were playing trivia in a bar

1244
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,580
and it started out as like a weekly thing.

1245
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:29,380
And then we found out that there were like trivia nights

1246
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:30,420
in other bars.

1247
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,700
So we started going like a couple times

1248
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,740
and then three times.

1249
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,460
And then there didn't need to be trivia.

1250
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,540
We just should be in a bar.

1251
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,300
And then all of a sudden we were a sitcom

1252
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,940
because we were at a bar every single night.

1253
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,620
And you kind of realize like, wait a minute.

1254
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,540
I've been at a bar every day this week.

1255
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:51,220
It would be a great scene in a sitcom

1256
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,820
if they sat down at the end of the week

1257
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,420
and like we're going through receipts.

1258
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,620
We're just like, honey, we spent $600 at a bar this week.

1259
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,900
I have to point out an important distinction though,

1260
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,380
Juice, and was it different bars

1261
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,260
that you were going to every night

1262
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,380
or was it the same bar?

1263
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,220
No, it was different bars.

1264
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,660
Okay, that's not what happened.

1265
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,260
Different bars and a Hooters.

1266
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,660
That's not what happens in sitcoms though

1267
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,980
where people just like show up to bars like,

1268
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,700
oh man, same clowns, different circus.

1269
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,500
And it's like, guys, go home.

1270
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,220
Just go.

1271
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:24,580
If How I Met Your Mother instead of just going

1272
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,260
to McLaren's in each episode,

1273
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,020
they were just like going to different bars

1274
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,580
because of some sort of unnatural compulsion.

1275
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,100
That's not a sitcom.

1276
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,380
That's a sit bummer, a sit bum.

1277
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,500
I think that having a night where you make a bad decision

1278
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,340
like, hey, I'm gonna stay out too late

1279
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,700
on a night when I have to work,

1280
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,980
just makes you appreciate and help break up

1281
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,580
the mundanity of all those other nights

1282
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:52,980
when you don't misbehave.

1283
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:54,900
I'm a big fan.

1284
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,940
I would also like to point out

1285
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,100
that the next fun meetup started 7 p.m.

1286
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,620
I don't wanna like throw shade and pass judgment here.

1287
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,340
Is that you fucking Wilford Brimley motherfucker?

1288
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,780
Maybe you should just go out.

1289
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,220
You could go out and be home.

1290
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,620
You could go out, stay out for three hours

1291
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,940
and still be home by 10.

1292
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:19,140
But 730 is when I watch Two Broke Girls

1293
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,340
and I start molting.

1294
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,180
I start the molting process at 730

1295
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,540
when Two Broke Girls comes on.

1296
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,060
I love that show.

1297
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,660
It's my favorite show to molt to.

1298
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,420
I can't wait to be dead.

1299
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,260
Thank you for listening to our show.

1300
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,220
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

1301
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,740
That's gonna be our program,

1302
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,140
but we wanted to remind you,

1303
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,300
I don't know if we alluded to it before,

1304
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,340
Max Fun Week kicks off this Wednesday

1305
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:52,260
and there's a ton of really fun stuff happening.

1306
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,620
Great.

1307
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,740
Yeah, I'm just gonna run through the schedule real quick.

1308
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,860
If you go to maximumfun.org forward slash maxfunweek,

1309
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,820
it's all on there.

1310
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,180
It's broken down by the day.

1311
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,660
You can also follow Max Fun HQ on Twitter

1312
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,420
and they'll run you through everything.

1313
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,660
But basic schedule, Wednesday, October 15th

1314
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,020
is Max Fun Trivia Day.

1315
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,860
Max Fun HQ is going to be tweeting out

1316
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,900
different trivia questions.

1317
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,940
And if you're the first person

1318
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,300
to answer each question correctly,

1319
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,380
you'll be entered in a drawing.

1320
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:20,020
On Thursday, October 16th is Leave a Review Day.

1321
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,500
So we're encouraging everyone to go on iTunes

1322
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,540
and rate and review

1323
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,700
and just kind of get the word out of the show

1324
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,620
and talk about it on iTunes.

1325
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,060
You can also tweet iTunes podcast

1326
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,860
and tell them thank you for hosting the shows

1327
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:35,940
and all of that and tell them how great they are.

1328
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,380
On Friday, October 17th,

1329
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,740
it's Immediate Summary Judgment Day.

1330
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,140
So John Hodgman super fans

1331
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,220
and pop culture experts will really love this one.

1332
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,340
They'll post an audio clip.

1333
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,340
I think we can just say humans

1334
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,980
instead of John being John Hodgman super fans.

1335
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:52,820
Human beings will really like this one.

1336
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,180
They'll post an audio clip

1337
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:56,500
of one of John Hodgman's signature interpretations

1338
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,020
of cultural artifacts.

1339
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:00,580
And it's up to you to guess the reference.

1340
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,700
And the first correct answer

1341
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,300
gets entered in drawing for prizes.

1342
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,980
And so on Saturday, October 18th,

1343
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,820
if you listened to our Adventure Zone episode,

1344
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:12,260
well, and if you didn't, go do that, please.

1345
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:15,060
But if you did, then you'll be really interested

1346
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,260
in this one, we played D&D and stuff.

1347
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,460
But what they're asking you for

1348
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,460
is for people to draw, paint, sculpt,

1349
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,220
whatever medium you choose to work in,

1350
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,780
representations of the characters we played

1351
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,540
and the winning artist will get

1352
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,780
a fifth edition D&D players handbook

1353
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,140
signed by all three of us.

1354
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,140
So if that's something you're into,

1355
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,500
then there's a great opportunity.

1356
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,700
If not, it's just a fun way

1357
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,820
to show off your art to people.

1358
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:39,300
We'll put that shit on character sheets too, fuck it.

1359
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,500
Yeah, yeah, we will.

1360
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,860
And I assume that's something

1361
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,140
you're gonna either send to us

1362
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,500
or send to MaxFun HQ.

1363
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,100
But if you send it to us,

1364
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:47,780
we promise we'll get it to the right place.

1365
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:48,260
I won't.

1366
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,420
Griffin won't, just send it to me.

1367
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,540
So Sunday 19th, this is what we were talking about earlier.

1368
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:54,660
It's MaxFun Meetup Day.

1369
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,260
And all over the world,

1370
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,980
we're encouraging people to set up meetups

1371
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,060
and start at 7 p.m. local time.

1372
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,940
If you wanna host a meetup, you just pick a place

1373
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,900
and then contact Jennifer at MaximumFun.org

1374
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:07,860
and we'll spread the word.

1375
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:10,260
And just real quick, I wanna run through some of it.

1376
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:10,740
Some of them.

1377
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,020

What the fuck?

1381
01:01:19,140 --> 01:01:20,020
Is there one in Japan?

1382
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,020

1383
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,700
There's one in Phoenix, one in Los Angeles,

1384
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,060
one in Oakland.

1385
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,620
There's one in Los Angeles, it's just for like families.

1386
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,340
It's during the day on the 19th, sorry, on the 18th.

1387
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,060
That's hosted by One Bad Mother, so check that out.

1388
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,780

one in Houston, one in Seattle.

1394
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,540
Cincinnati doesn't have one.

1395
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,500
So one, I'm really disappointed in you, Cincinnati.

1396
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,780
I'm looking at you, Kyle Ross.

1397
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:02,820
Whoa.

1398
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:05,060
Yeah, Kyle Ross.

1399
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,740
Host one in Cincinnati, you fool.

1400
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,180
Get one in Huntington, Justin.

1401
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,420
I got a baby.

1402
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,940
So set those up and go hang out.

1403
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,740
I've been to a couple, they're always fun to be around

1404
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,340
other people who love the thing that you love.

1405
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:18,660
It's a great way to make new friends in your city

1406
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,980
or just get together and kind of have a fun evening

1407
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,980
talking about stuff that you feel comfortable talking about.

1408
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,660
Also, Max Fun fans are like the fucking coolest people.

1409
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,940
Yeah, they're like the best people.

1410
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,820
We're the most uncomfortable, like socially speaking,

1411
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:33,140
human beings on Earth and I still have a great time

1412
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,340
every time I meet people in Max Fun community.

1413
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,940
So on Monday, October 20th is Share Your Favorite Episode Day.

1414
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,780
So whether it's the funniest, the most interesting

1415
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,140
or anything like that, just tweet it out, go on Reddit,

1416
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,260
talk about it on the Max Fun forums, whatever you want to do.

1417
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:49,620
Just get the word out and tell all your friends

1418
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,060
about the episode, share a link to it.

1419
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,540
It's just a day to kind of say,

1420
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,380
hey, I've never mentioned this to you before,

1421
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,700
or maybe I've mentioned it to you like a bajillion times,

1422
01:02:57,700 --> 01:02:59,300
but today's the day, go check it out.

1423
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:01,540
And then on Tuesday, October 21st is

1424
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,460
Max Fun Rocket Coloring Contest.

1425
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,700
So they'll post a line drawing of the signature

1426
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,300
of Max Fun Rocket, you color it in,

1427
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,580
and the winning artist will get a prize.

1428
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:13,140
So it's really just a day about celebrating you, the fans.

1429
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:18,100
We've also got a Ask Me Anything coming up on,

1430
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,380
we're doing it on Thursday, October 16th

01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,420
from 12 to one Pacific time.

1432
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,820
I don't know what time that is, Eastern.

1433
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,660
What are you guys on, Eastern time?

1434
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,980
I'll listen to Hollywood tribes and microwave.

1435
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:31,860
That's that old shit.

1436
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:34,340
But yeah, come hang out with us and ask us questions.

1437
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:37,460
You can literally ask us anything, not about poop.

1438
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,460
But there's AMAs every day of that week.

1439
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,100
You could talk to Dave Holmes,

1440
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,860

1441
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,860

01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,020
Jesse and Jordan have one.

1444
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:54,980
Our new shows, Destination DIY, Baby Geniuses,

1445
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,100

1446
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,620
Flophouse has one on there.

1447
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:59,780
We're adding new shows, new awesome people,

1448
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,620

So that's gonna be great.

1457
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,540
And then I think-

1458
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,900

Also wanted to say real quick,

1462
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,620
that first day, October 15th,

1463
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:34,820
if you're in the LA area, you should go see Bullseye live.

They're gonna have Dan Harmon, Steve A.G., Andy Kindler-

1465
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,020
Rob Corddry.

1466
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:44,580
Yeah, Rob Corddry and Travis will be there.

1467
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:45,460
I will be there.

1468
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,300
Not doing anything, but if you wanna meet Travis,

1469
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,180
he'll be there.

1470
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,580
You should go get tickets.

1471
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,860
And it's in a Masonic Lodge in the middle of a graveyard.

1472
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,460
Yeah, go to maximumfund.org.

1473

And after the show, NPR is giving everyone free beer.

1475
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,420
So, I mean, if that's not cause enough to go,

1476
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,140
I don't know what is.

1477

Thank you, Michelle.

1491

It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Kozik,

1492
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:33,540

01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:14,660
It's a show about people taking matters into their own hands,

1505
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,540
and we're really excited to be bringing it to Maximum Fun.

1506
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:21,060
You know, having that experience of I can do that

1507
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,140
makes me feel like I can almost do anything.

1508
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,220
Here at Destination DIY,

1509
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,460
