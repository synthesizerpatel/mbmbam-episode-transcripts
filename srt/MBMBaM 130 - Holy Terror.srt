1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:51,280
Can you feel it in the air? Everything's frosty.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
What's that smell? Is that pine? Of course it's pine.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,440
Why is there pine in my nose? Something tells me we on that Christmas creep.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
We on that Christmas creep? We on that Christmas creep.

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840
I'm sorry guys, do you mean holiday creep? No, I mean Christmas creep.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
You're fucking- Do you mean non-denominational,

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
non-offensive holiday creep? No, I'm on that going to heaven creep.

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,760
Get your socialist moon bat ideologies out of here, Travis.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
This product was brought to you by the red, white, and the blue.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,160
Keep your war on Jesus where it belongs in my new religious based fighting game.

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,880
Holy terror. Holy terror.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,440
It's in full effect here in the ATX. Our street is known for its extravagant

17
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,520
Christmas light displays, and I am paralyzed by fear of not being able to live up to the

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,080
expectations. Do you have a plan, Griffin?

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,280
I do, and it's- A design that you're shooting for?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
Sort of like a Jackson Pollock of light, you know what I mean?

21
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,640
It's sort of like a- Just slopping something up there.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,200
Just slopping, just maybe sort of like a Kevin Pollock of light, and maybe I'll do like,

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,280
I'll do like, I'll cover myself in lights and then stand up in the front yard and just do my

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,000
favorite Kevin Pollock routine, and I'll do that day in and day out, and that can be the whole

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,240
display. It's like fun- When you say your favorite Kevin

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,400
Pollock routine, do you mean like you would be doing an impression of Kevin Pollock doing an

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
impression of someone else? That is precisely what I mean.

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,200
It's fun for kids, it's fun for adults, it's fun for your grandma and your dog,

29
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,200
but not for Kevin Pollock. If he comes around, I'm gonna have to do

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
someone else. Yeah, you're gonna have to do

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,560
someone else doing Gryffindor walking. So just throw in some- Do you have any,

32
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,480
I mean, do you have any expertise with wiring or anything like that?

33
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,920
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Wiring, electricity, electrodes.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
Are you gonna have to wire it up? Gryffin, if you could wire it up so that

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,920
like every time you flush the toilet, like Santa would wave, so that your neighbors really know

36
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
how it's going. Could the-

37
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,840
Maybe the lights are spelled out in a way that just makes it say,

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
I just pooped. And then people will know, people will know that.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,720
I think Gryffin's gonna have the oversized like PSA

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
plug that Louie the Lightning Bug warned us about. That outlet with like

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,800
eight different plugs plugged into it. Gryffin, just remember, you gotta play it

42
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,080
safer on electricity. I'm gonna have it going into a European

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,360
converter and then back into an American converter. It's gonna be disgusting.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,240
And then- Gryffin, is there a potato in the middle of

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,280
your extension cord? Gryffin, is this a hyperconductive

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,240
piece of produce that you've used, you've lodged in here?

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,480
At the end of the day, you got yams. That's not how it works?

48
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,280
Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. If you cook a potato-

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
Plus electrical equivalent does not equal yams.

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,400
Yeah, that's how they turn. Let's answer some questions.

51
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,960
This is an advice show for the modern era after all.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
Did we introduce ourselves? I don't believe we did.

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,800
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Chavis McElroy.

54
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm your sweet baby brother, Gryffin McElroy.

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,800
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era.

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,880
And here we go. I'm moving schools in a month,

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,840
and I had an idea. I'm gonna pretend I can't smell

58
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,760
at my new school. It's just a little thing that will

59
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,360
make me unique. Is this a good idea?

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,480
Any ideas on why I can't smell? How about because you're an angel,

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,120
and because angels can't smell. Is that fun enough for you?

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
You're an angel sent by God.

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,560
What are you doing?

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,280
Have you casually dropped that you can't smell

65
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
in a conversation at your new school? When someone's just like,

66
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960
smell the french fries in the lunch room. I can't.

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
I smell that Christmas creep. I'm not aware of any Christmas creep.

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
I certainly cannot. You know,

69
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,120
this is gonna be all negative for you because you're gonna

70
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
constantly have to keep in your mind that you can't smell

71
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,760
that horrible thing that you smell. But not only that,

72
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,280
your friends are gonna test this shit constantly.

73
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,480
You are gonna have four butts around your head farting at all times

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,040
just so that people will be like, oh, what's wrong?

75
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,880
Let's assume that you're in high school. When you drop something like,

76
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,600
oh no, I've lost the ability to smell, high school students do not

77
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
inherently go, oh, okay, I accept that.

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,640
Interesting.

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah, of course.

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,040
It could be college, but even college students, I think,

81
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,440
haven't mastered the curve yet where they're like, oh, I understand

82
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,600
and I will be more sensitive to that. Next time we drop by that bakery,

83
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
I won't say anything about it.

84
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
I haven't learned tact yet, so smell everything.

85
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,680
Everybody, when they go to a new school, has to adopt some sort of affectation.

86
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,800
That's like, even if you find that process completely douche-tastic,

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,480
it's gonna happen, you've gotta do it, or else you'll be eaten alive.

88
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm just not sure this is the one.

89
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,280
The things that you could do to make yourself unique,

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
not being able to smell is one of the least attractive,

91
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,480
least interesting ones.

92
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,440
It's so high pressure and it's so easily disproven.

93
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
Why not go with something that's more...

94
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,200
Like, I met Donny Osmond.

95
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,720
Like, nobody can, unless they hunt down Donny Osmond.

96
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,920
I am Donny Osmond.

97
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,520
Do you remember this fool, Donny?

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Like, that's the only way that that's gonna be disproven.

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,920
I think you're thinking too small.

100
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,320
I think you need to pretend you're a kid who can't walk.

101
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,240
What about that?

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:58,480
Wow.

103
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:58,980
Okay.

104
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Ooh, ooh, pretend you're a kid who can't walk.

105
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
Keep it up for like two months and then start to improve.

106
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
Mm.

107
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, I love that.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
Start to gain the ability to walk.

109
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,320
Does the school rally behind you?

110
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,720
Yes.

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, oh, oh, before you put on this ruse,

112
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,200
can you train your body to be like the world's fastest runner?

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
And then now that's a kid's...

114
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,080
Every fucking day some kid stands up from his wheelchair

115
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,040
and starts walking.

116
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,240
That's not cool.

117
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,440
You know what's cool?

118
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,560
A billion dollars.

119
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,840
What I'm saying is practice basketball a lot.

120
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
Get great at basketball.

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,080
So at the end they're like, coach, coach,

122
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
if Wheelie Rob isn't gonna play, I'm not gonna play.

123
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,640
He's learning to walk and I'm proud of him.

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,120
Yeah.

125
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,600
And then they'll be like, give it to, put in Rob, put in Rob.

126
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,760
And then you'll get it like, what?

127
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,040
I guess this whole time I've been great at dunking.

128
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
And then you look as surprised as anybody.

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Another idea is you just get really good at basketball

130
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,680
and then you'll be fucking popular

131
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
because you're really good at basketball

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,120
and you don't have to pretend to be handicapped.

133
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
Listen, I think that terminology may be offensive.

134
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
I have a hard time keeping up.

135
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,560
What's the...

136
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,040
The first day go in and say, I have anosmia.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,560
I got it from a nasal spray.

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
I use the nasal spray too much.

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,080
I was too congested.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,280
Is there a kid who's gonna hear that and go,

141
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,880
oh, fucking cool, he used too much nasal spray.

142
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,520
And then if anybody busts you on it, you say, no, my bad.

143
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,200
I said, insomnia.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
And I have a hard time getting to sleep at night.

145
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,440
How about, okay, I'm gonna throw out, it's a little change,

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,520
but I think it'll make it easier to keep up the ruse.

147
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,880
Instead of saying you can't smell, say you don't smell.

148
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,840
Like you've made a choice.

149
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,760
Smell this, like, oh no, I choose not to.

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
I would rather not smell.

151
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,360
Well, that's a good life advice regardless.

152
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,160
If someone says, hey, smell this, usually the answer is no.

153
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah, I would prefer not to.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,880
I choose not to.

155
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I think that you say the reason you,

156
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
I think the reason that you lost your smelling

157
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,200
is the important part of the story.

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,040
I think it can't be something tame.

159
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,280
I think it's gotta be like you went on a Coke bender.

160
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,520
Maybe you went on a Coke bender with Donny Osmond

161
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,920
and then it's the best of both worlds.

162
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Griffin, please give us the Yahoo question.

163
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Sure, this Yahoo question is sent in by Michael Lee.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,400
Thank you, Michael.

165
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,320
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark.

166
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,680
Somebody explain what that meant.

167
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,080
I think it's like the person deleted their account,

168
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,280
which I love that Yahoo Answers treasures their questions

169
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,080
so much that they don't just delete the questions too.

170
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,000
Question Mark asks, how do I un-potty train myself?

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,640
How do I un-potty train myself?

172
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,080
I am a teen baby and really want to know

173
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,640
how to un-potty train myself night and day

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,480
so I can be more like a baby again.

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Yep.

176
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
Just wait.

177
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
Just wait, like wait 60 years.

178
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Close your eyes, relax.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
And wait for 60 years.

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,040
You'll be un-potty trained, easy.

181
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,540
I guess.

182
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,380
Easy.

183
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,540
It sounds like this guy is looking for a better answer

184
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,340
than just poop and pee in your pants

185
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,660
instead of in the toilet like a big boy does,

186
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,260
like you did on your big boy birthday.

187
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,660
But I don't know what to tell him.

188
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,980
Open your toilet and put scorpions in.

189
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,660
That is an option to you.

190
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:43,700
Yes.

191
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,380
They're about to use the toilet.

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,880
Don't.

193
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,660
Okay, Josh, you think of it small.

194
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,500
Let's go back to scorpions for a second.

195
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
When you're about to use the toilet,

196
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,300
you look at the toilet and say no, not today.

197
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,300
And I will hear a million toilets screaming poop at us

198
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,900
and I will whisper no.

199
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,140
Can you remove the toilet from your house?

200
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,820
Or better yet, can you have a friend do it

201
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,180
when you least expect it?

202
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,340
Oh, this?

203
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,940
This is the bye-bye hole.

204
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,700
There used to be a toilet here.

205
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,180
Now I just put things in it I never want to see again.

206
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,620
What?

207
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,220
Like all of my friendships.

208
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,020
And my dignity.

209
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,900
Hey, Justin and Travis.

210
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah.

211
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,100
Can you explain to me what a teen baby is?

212
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,420
And it's not, apparently it is not a baby sired by a teen,

213
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,140
which is what I prayed to Jesus it did mean.

214
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,380
So some people have chosen to live their life

215
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,780
and I'm trying to be very diplomatic here

216
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,820
because I'm sure there are people who listen to this show

217
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,660
who are adult babies, but some people have chosen

218
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,500
to live their lives as babies

219
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:00,900
because that's what makes them happy to live as babies.

220
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:07,780
And I'm not sure if it's completely always sexual in nature.

221
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,500
If it's not sexual in nature, what is it?

222
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,900
Because it sounds pretty fucking sexy.

223
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,620
Here's my thing with adult babies.

224
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,740
Okay.

225
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,300
I mean, nice work if you can get it.

226
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
I'd like to be a baby too.

227
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,300
Like I think we'd all like to figure out

228
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,260
how to put this particular genie back in the bottle.

229
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,940
And I'd do re-bottle.

230
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,580
If I may, even then.

231
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,060
You may.

232
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,780
Adult baby, I get that.

233
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,100
Adults, tons of responsibility, it fucking sucks

234
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,260
and you want to be a baby and just be taken care of.

235
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,060
I get it.

236
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,420
Teen baby, what's your life really like that's so hard?

237
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,140
No, Travis.

238
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,980
As a teenager that you're like,

239
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
if only I could regress eight years.

240
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,260
Think back to high school.

241
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,900
High school is, middle school especially,

242
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,340
but high school to some extent,

243
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,420
the worst part of your entire life.

244
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,540
The absolute worst part.

245
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,580
I feel like the reason that not all teenagers are teen babies

246
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,300
is because they don't know that that's an option.

247
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,820
Yeah, they can't just retreat.

248
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,900
If there was some sort of awareness campaign like,

249
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,220
hey, here's this crazy fetish you can get into

250
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,740
and then you don't have to deal with the,

251
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,140
you know, how none of your classmates like you,

252
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,260
then that, I feel like it would become much more popular.

253
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,220
I think that it would be like at least a secondary,

254
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,220
maybe tertiary storyline on Glee.

255
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,020
And honestly, I would say that if you,

256
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,500
if you are charismatic enough,

257
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,180
you could probably pull off teen baby

258
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,100
and be one of the most popular kids in school.

259
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,580
Travis.

260
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,580
You would be like, ah, it's big baby, what's up?

261
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
I think you're thinking of Teen Wolf.

262
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,460
Yeah, Teen Wolf couldn't pull that.

263
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,420
You're right, you guys, sorry.

264
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,900
Oh, could you tell your new school that you're a werewolf?

265
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,700
Oh, they would want to see some, some.

266
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,220
They're gonna need to see Heartproof.

267
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,620
Yeah, they're gonna need to see the long form.

268
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,660
Tell them it's too dangerous.

269
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,780
Now, the commitment is two days out of every month,

270
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,980
you can't go to school.

271
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,100
You don't want to see me, I get super Randy

272
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,700
and I'm real good at basketball

273
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,460
and I surf on top of my friend's van.

274
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,700
It's too dangerous, you don't want to see this.

275
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,740
I do want to update everybody about teen babies.

276
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,780
You can go to the tbjumpstation.tripod.com

277
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,820
and find a whole web network of great links

278
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,380
to TBDL and bedwetter sites.

279
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,860
All right.

280
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,540
Now, here's the really important thing.

281
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:31,620
I find this web design more offensive than teen babies.

282
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,140
I find it more upsetting.

283
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,260
Uh, there are lists of links

284
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,380
and they have put pictures of sunglasses

285
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,820
next to the best ones.

286
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,180
Like for instance, good old Andy's play pin

287
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,100
at ibigbaby.net, that's got sunglasses.

288
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,860
Jared's diaper site, which is not a good name,

289
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,300
has sunglasses.

290
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,660
Now, why is that not a good name?

291
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,860
Because it sounds like it gets straight

292
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,780
to the heart of the matter.

293
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,260
I think it's Jared.

294
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,980
I think it's an odd comparison.

295
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,220
There's one called teens who wear diapers,

296
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,420
which is direct.

297
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,780
Again, we are getting into the nitty gritty.

298
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,780
I enjoy, my favorite personal website

299
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,780
is Tony's nappy place.

300
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,100
God, these are also so real.

301
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,100
No, here's the best advice

302
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
you're ever gonna get from a bim bam.

303
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,740
Never take a nap or become unconscious

304
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,380
in any way around anyone named Tony.

305
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,420
Ever.

306
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,220
Ever.

307
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,580
Now, those are just the premium links.

308
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,260
If you're willing to go down.

309
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,780
To get down into the snickle frit.

310
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,860
If you're willing to get down into the chaff,

311
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,460
might I suggest angelfire.com

312
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,460
forward slash ct forward slash poop2

313
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,940
and you'll be transported to Baby Sammy's Baby Summers,

314
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,860
which is this,

315
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,580
I think it's supposed to be a series of stories

316
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,020
about Baby Sammy,

317
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,260
but there is just one story called

318
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,060
Baby Sammy's First Ever Baby Summer.

319
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,420
And yes, you guessed it.

320
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,660
It does have 30,000 views.

321
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,980
Jesus, is there any website

322
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,820
on tripod or angel fire remaining

323
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,940
that isn't about fucking people in really weird ways?

324
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:29,140
I can't find any if there are

325
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,340
and I've looked.

326
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,700
Oh, have I looked.

327
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,860
It's like if you have a baking website,

328
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,620
you transfer from Angel Fire to Tumblr in like 2005.

329
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
I feel like the people who haven't gotten the net

330
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,940
are the people who spend their entire day

331
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,540
pretending to be fucking babies that are 38 years old.

332
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,020
Not that there's anything wrong with it

333
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,700
despite the tone of my voice right now.

334
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,020
I know it may sound,

335
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,700
it sounds angry and confused and a little worried,

336
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,420
but it's totally kosher.

337
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,280
Right.

338
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,060
I just, I'm not angry.

339
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,420
I'm not judging.

340
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,540
I'm just, I'm just confused.

341
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,460
I want to know if it's like a full on

342
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,820
like diaper bib rattle lifestyle

343
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,340
or if it's like a mental thing

344
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,820
that like you just know deep inside that you're a baby

345
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,020
and that's enough to get you through.

346
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,660
I want to know what that match.com profile looks like.

347
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:26,260
Like do you come right out with it?

348
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:29,140
Because it sounds like a pretty defining thing in your life.

349
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,060
I think you should probably figure out

350
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,380
how people are going to be with that.

351
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,100
I think you got to get a read on that before anything.

352
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,060
You think it's going to hit some people's palette

353
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,140
and be like, no, it has a nice finish.

354
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,340
It's like a raspberry jelly.

355
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,500
I wasn't expecting it, but it's very refreshing.

356
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Hey, that, maybe it's good to be a teen baby

357
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,220
because you get it out of your system.

358
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660
For instance, when I was a teen,

359
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,580
I took cotillion classes

360
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,660
and thought the Heights was a pretty good band.

361
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,140
So maybe-

362
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,660
Wait, so wait, if you're a teen baby,

363
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,580
then do you grow up to be an adult teen

364
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,660
and then you grow up to be a senior adult

365
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,380
and then eventually you're just, you're just-

366
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,660
Actually, Cloris Leachman, just an old, old lady

367
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,900
with the heart of like a 45 year old.

368
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,820
You can actually keep going back.

369
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
You can keep rewinding to baby.

370
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,620
It's like that movie Big, but the complete opposite.

371
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,500
It's called Small.

372
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,060
It's called Small over and over again,

373
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,980
starring Tom Hanks as a teen baby.

374
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,100
Well, that's what, that's what-

375
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,540
Oh, that's right, sorry.

376
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,820
That's copyright infringement.

377
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,980
I have a severe problem.

378
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,660
I got an interview to apply to Cambridge.

379
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,340
However, two days before, I'm also going to a party.

380
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,860
I'd quite like to get characteristically wasted,

381
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,340
but I need to be on the ball for this interview.

382
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,060
So how can I make sure I have fun at the party

383
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,340
whilst maintaining a hangover less interview?

384
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,100
That's from Blasted and Blighty.

385
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,940
Man, I've gotten, I've gotten fully Blasty Blasted before

386
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:10,980
and I have never had a hungover, hangover for two days.

387
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,100
That's never, I have never had a 48 hour.

388
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,980
That would be rough.

389
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,620
Yes.

390
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,900
One, that's amazing.

391
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,020
If you do that, you should tell some kind of news program

392
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,060
and get on TV.

393
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,500
And then some sort of counselor.

394
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,460
48 hour hangover.

395
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:33,940
Secondly, don't, don't, like just don't.

396
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,340
Do you, are you writing into an internet advice show

397
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,780
because you don't know how to not get so drunk

398
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,140
that you're drunk for two days?

399
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,260
Is that?

400
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,700
You don't know how to not get so drunk

401
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,780
that you ruin your future?

402
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,020
Like, just don't.

403
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,060
This isn't like, but the girl of my dreams is gonna be there

404
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,380
and I'm worried that if I don't, just, just don't.

405
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,860
Don't.

406
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,900
Just don't.

407
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,340
Maybe, maybe go to the party, say hello to some friends

408
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,140
and then excuse yourself at a reasonable hour.

409
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,220
Go home and think about how great it's gonna be

410
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,620
to graduate from a good college with a great education.

411
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,780
And just don't drink that much.

412
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,500
Just don't.

413
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,500
Maybe space it out.

414
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,940
One drink, one glass of water.

415
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,380
One drink, one glass of water.

416
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,940
Just really hold yourself back.

417
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,660
You have a lot of options as far as moderation goes,

418
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,940
but I am actually, I am shocked at you two

419
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,020
for telling him not to YOLO

420
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,620
because you do only live once

421
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,140
and then that's gonna end in like 23 days

422
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,660
when Quetzalcoatl comes out.

423
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,580
And so like, it's, we can't really,

424
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,060
I feel like it's irresponsible for us not to say,

425
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,860
you know, YOLO, YOLO, live like you were dying.

426
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,780
Is there a thing for a live like you were?

427
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,180
But is there any way to like, transition it and say,

428
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,100
yes, it's YOLO, but it's also like a

429
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,860
choose your own adventure YOLO

430
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,380
and you could say you only live once,

431
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,740
it's time to get wasted at this party

432
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,860
or you only live once,

433
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,700
I should prepare for this big interview.

434
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,660
Okay, but have you, when teens use YOLO,

435
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,180
when teens exercise their YOLO,

436
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,180
they don't, it's always like they're jumping off of a bridge

437
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,580
with a bungee cord and they're like, YOLO.

438
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,340
You never see a teen like walking into

439
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,700
like an important college interview,

440
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,620
like, all right, man, YOLO.

441
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,980
And then he comes in the door

442
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,780
because then the interviewer is like, what's a YOLO?

443
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,100
Explain to me what a YOLO is.

444
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:35,780
Speaking of which, this week I was a little tipsy

445
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:46,660
and I came up with a great slogan for a frozen yogurt stand

446
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,740
and the lady who's producing our musical,

447
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,340
one of the two ladies producing our musical

448
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,540
that Sydney and I are working on right now

449
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,980
is in the frozen yogurt business.

450
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:05,220
So I texted her, I said, I got a great slogan for you.

451
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,940
Check this out, fro YOLO.

452
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,060
And she said it was great

453
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,980
and admitted to me two days later,

454
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,060
she had never heard YOLO.

455
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:20,820
So it probably did not come off as a great slogan in the moment.

456
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,660
But now it's a great slogan, I call it fro yo Baggins.

457
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,980
Fro YOLO.

458
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,540
Okay, that's not, I don't understand.

459
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,180
It means nothing to me.

460
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,780
That doesn't mean anything to me.

461
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,980
I respect you as a person.

462
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,540
Arrangement of all capitalized letters.

463
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:40,340
But okay, thank you for passing that on.

464
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,260
And then I made a point of saying

465
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,940
that she could use it for free.

466
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,980
I didn't want there to be any sort of question of payment.

467
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,460
Like it's just hers, gratis.

468
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,220
I'm surprised at you, Justin.

469
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,860
Why?

470
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,460
Don't sell yourself so short.

471
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,820
You're right, I should have charged.

472
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,740
Your future wife could be at this party.

473
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,240
What's up?

474
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,300
What's up now?

475
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,100
Yeah, your future wife could also attend Cambridge.

476
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
Yeah, but that's much less likely, don't you think?

477
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,900
No, I'm sorry.

478
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,700
Your future wife is probably not gonna be knocked off her feet

479
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,100
by the guy who literally knocked her off her feet

480
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,580
because he's falling around the room drunk.

481
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,620
Two day drunk.

482
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,460
Why would you not want to be at the top of your game

483
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,820
to meet the girl of your dreams?

484
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,220
Do you guys not understand?

485
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,900
This show is better when there's contention

486
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,100
between the three of us.

487
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,020
Of course he should go to the fucking interview.

488
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,300
Of course go to the goddamn interview, of course.

489
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,580
You dumb dumb.

490
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,220
But it's way better if I'm like, what if he likes to-

491
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,300
I know, why are you tearing down the walls?

492
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,100
Why are you-

493
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,540
Because it sounds like you guys don't get it.

494
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,660
And I don't want people to think

495
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,820
that I'm endorsing irresponsible drinking.

496
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,340
Just smoke-

497
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,260
We endorse responsible drinking.

498
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,140
Get really drunk after the interview

499
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,140
to celebrate how awesome your interview went.

500
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,580
Or get really drunk and then roll on some doja

501
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,180
because they cancel each other out.

502
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,540
Does the doja help?

503
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,780
The doja gets in there and it fights the toxins of the alcohol.

504
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,300
It lowers your content, actually.

505
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,860
If you get pulled over, I saw it on Mythbusters,

506
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,980
if you get pulled over and you're about to get DUI'd,

507
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,460
you just roll a quick doja, if you-

508
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,340
Yeah, that weed special was one of the weirdest episodes

509
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,100
of Mythbusters I've ever seen.

510
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,420
Yeah.

511
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,820
Jamie Hyneman was like, yeah, man.

512
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,460
My hands are shaking.

513
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,660
That's what people sound like when they-

514
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,300
I've never heard-

515
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,260
I've never been around-

516
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,620
Hey, I got an idea.

517
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,780
Let's blast this cannon through that dude's house.

518
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,820
Let's do it.

519
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,740
It's a Mythbusters deep cut for everybody.

520
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:44,820
Okay, I think if you don't end up hungover for the interview,

521
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,780
you should announce that first.

522
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,420
Say, good news, I'm not hungover for this.

523
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,660
Listen, I don't want to brag.

524
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,060
I don't want to brag, but I was really worried

525
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,660
that I would still be hungover from two days ago,

526
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,580
but it turned out that I wasn't.

527
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,780
So what's your first question?

528
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,860
First question, will I leave?

529
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,620
Sure, yeah.

530
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:07,860
Okay.

531
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,140
Okay, let's go.

532
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,740

Yeah, like every professional podcast,

we like to warn you before it's about the sound professional

550
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,860
to give you a nice buffer.

551
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,660
In case this transition is grating to your ears.

552
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,100
Well, I didn't want them to be like,

553
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,340
whoa, did my computer glitch out

554
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,940
and now it's playing Radio Lab?

555
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,220
Like, no, don't worry about it.

556
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,540
It's super not still, super not Radio Lab.

557
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,380
Although I can tell you all about science facts.

558
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,980
Yeah, we're basically Radio Lab for cool people.

559
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,500
Do you guys know what creates rainbows?

560
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,860
What?

561
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
Um, kid wishes.

562
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,980
Gay dust.

563
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,480
Hey!

564
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,600
God.

565
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,560
What?

566
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,380
What's gay dust?

567
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,980
It's from, I don't know, crunched up gay things.

568
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,340
And if you want to crunch up some gay things,

569
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,740
you need to head to streamerstraights.com.

570
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,140
That's right.

571
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,540
The magic's back for an unprecedented holiday spectacular.

572
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,380
How people have been so cold.

573
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,180
People have been like,

574
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,540
people are like going around like breaking off chair legs

575
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,060
and like trying to jam it in themselves

576
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,260
because they don't know.

577
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,900
They don't know what to do without our fucking guidance.

578
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,300
This is like a extreme restraints presents

579
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,380
my brother, my brother and me season two.

580
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,260
Mm-hmm, we took a brief summer break,

581
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,860
but now we're back with the new plot line.

582
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,460
This is the season premiere.

583
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,740
The season premiere.

584
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,060
One of us buys some special balls

585
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,220
that you put in your butt hole to make sex feel better.

586
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,060
Strict, like here's my featured item today.

587
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,740
Strict leather locking butt plug harness

588
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,420
with an inflatable plug.

589
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,940
So let me walk you through this.

590
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,260
You gotta ring around your, your ding dong.

591
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,020
You have a bucket full of poses.

592
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,980
And a pocket full of, you have a belt

593
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,980
that goes up to your belly button

594
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,420
and then around your waist and through your butt hole.

595
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:03,700
And then you can inflate it to make your butt bigger.

596
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,700
I think that's how that works.

597
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,940
Okay, can I drop some knowledge on you

598
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,420
about the Strict Leather Cock Straight Jacket?

599
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,540
Hit me.

600
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,180
It's a straight jacket for your cock

601
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
and also according to this picture,

602
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,340
your balls also.

603
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,260
Your whole ball, it's your whole unit.

604
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,940
You get it tied up in this thing.

605
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,500
God, I have like, I have like 14 dicks

606
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,140
on my monitor right now.

607
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,140
And you have to, I guess it's like a trick.

608
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,380
It's like a stunt and you try to get it out.

609
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,500
It's fun for the kids.

610
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,780
It's fun for the whole family.

611
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,820
You can do like Houdini, but with your,

612
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:48,180
but it's like your dick instead of like an immigrant.

613
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,660
Holy shit.

614
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,980
Okay, you guys, I feel that when we do

615
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,100
the Extreme Restraint spots,

616
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,660
we have a tendency to focus on stuff for dudes.

617
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,380
And so now I'm going to say,

618
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:00,100
my product of the week

619
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,580
is the Passionista Vibrating Strapless Strap-On.

620
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,420
Hold up.

621
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,060
Looks like.

622
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,420
How does it strapless strap on?

623
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,780
I don't even know, Griffin.

624
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,460
And it adheres to your body through magic.

625
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,060
Yes, it just will never let go.

626
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,980
Once it's in, it never goes away.

627
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,300
It's a permanent fixture now.

628
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,060
Well, you're going to have to buy new pants, I guess.

629
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,340
It's like an eight prong thing

630
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,700
and it's just fun for everyone is what it says.

631
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,860
And it looks fun for everyone.

632
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,780
So it's like a, it's like a menorah?

633
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,940
Yes, it's a sexy menorah.

634
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,900
If you're looking for a perfect, perfect candle night's present,

635
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,860
then this butt menorah is going to be your thing.

636
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,020
I want you guys to know I keep looking at it and blushing.

637
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,860
So check it out.

638
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,500
If Travis's audio sounds bad right now,

639
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,940
it's because he's got both of his hands

640
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,380
in front of his mouth and he's giggling.

641
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:02,020
Here's a quick sample of a review

642
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,180
from the Strix Leather Locking Butt Plug Harness

643
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,140
with Inflatable Plug.

644
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,500
My wife buy this for me to wear to work

645
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,020
and around the house, one day I was in the bedroom

646
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,700
wearing this butt plug harness

647
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,460
and the kids were out playing with their friends.

648
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,500
Hey kids, hey kids, big news, big scoop

649
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,180
from my brother, my brother and me.

650
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,180
You thought you were having fun outside

651
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,500
but your dad was having the real fun in the bedroom

652
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,180
when you saw him through the window

653
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,780
and he looked happy, that is why.

654
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,460
It wasn't because he loves you.

655
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,900
It was because he had-

656
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,940
He does love you.

657
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:42,100
He does love you but he also loves this apparently a balloon

658
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,820
and it's asshole.

659
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,660
Listen, we don't wanna scare you off with these.

660
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,100
These products are more on the extreme side

661
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,220
of extreme restraints.

662
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,700
Maybe things are getting a little stale in the bedroom.

663
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,460
They have all gradients of sexual pleasure tools

664
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,300
for you to enjoy.

665
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,460
Maybe you just wanna, maybe you just wanna Dilbo.

666
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,380
Maybe you just want some lubricants.

667
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,220
Maybe you want something with a little flavor.

668
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,380
Then these are all things that you can play with

669
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,700
and experiment with and it's safe and it's fun.

670
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,020
It's called, they're called Dilbos, right?

671
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,620
They're called Dilbos and listen,

672
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:22,180
if you want your Dilbos at a bargain rate,

673
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,580
you're gonna wanna go to extrememachines.com,

674
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,020
spelled just how it sounds,

675
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,340
and enter the coupon code MIDDLEST.

676
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,420
What'll that save you?

677
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,980
What that's gonna save you is 20%.

678
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,660
That's a fifth.

679
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,060
That's a fifth or a fourth.

680
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,700
That's a fifth.

681
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,100
We'll call it a fifth.

682
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,860
Let's call it an even fifth.

683
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,900
Well, you can call it that

684
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,060
because math arithmetic fucking says

685
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,820
that that's what the number is.

686
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,540
I agree to disagree.

687
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,380
Let's decide that it's a fifth.

688
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,580
Let's say a fifth for now and then we'll revisit.

689
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,620
extrememachines.com, coupon code MIDDLEST.

690
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,380
At some sex shops, when they sell you a Dilbo

691
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,220
at four fifths of the price,

692
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,860
they'll chop off the tip of the Dilbo

693
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,700
and send you four fifths of the Dilbo.

694
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,420
The extremist trains will not short you like that.

695
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,180
You get the whole hog.

696
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,300
That's their motto.

697
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,780
Come to Extremist Trains and get the whole hog.

698
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,660
But the hog in this case is like a fake cock.

699
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,940
It's like a hog.

700
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,660
It's like a hog.

701
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,540
Yeah, I guess I didn't need to be any more explicit than that.

702
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,980
Sure, yeah, I think it's covered.

703
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,460
This Christmas will be the first I've had

704
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,300
while being in a long-term romantic relationship.

705
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,900
And my girlfriend for sure expects me

706
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,860
to get her something nice.

707
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,060
The problem is I'm a minimalist.

708
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,500
And in my lifestyle, I'm a mental mentalist.

709
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,820
I am so opposed.

710
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,620
I'm a mentalist.

711
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,060
I'm so opposed to non-materialism that I cannot say it.

712
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,260
This Christmas will be the first that I've had

713
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,580
while being in a long-term romantic relationship.

714
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,980
And my girlfriend for sure expects me

715
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,260
to get her something nice.

716
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,140
The problem is I'm a minimalist in my lifestyle.

717
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,500
And as such, I have a really terrible, terrible time

718
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,500
picking out things to give people.

719
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm just as bad at selecting gifts all around.

720
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,140
It occurred to me, however, that my girlfriend

721
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,820
and a close female friend of mine,

722
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,620
who full disclosure, I previously had

723
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,540
a pseudo romantic relationship with,

724
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,180
have similar taste in fashion accessories and stuff.

725
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,500
And that if I got her to help me pick something out,

726
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,620
it would for sure be a hit with my girlfriend.

727
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,140
I just can't decide if this idea is brilliant and practical,

728
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,940
solution of my gift giving woes, or the worst idea ever.

729
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,140
That's from Gift Blind Guy in Minneapolis.

730
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,460
Oh, it's the worst idea ever.

731
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,780
Hey, Gift Blind Guy, if you want to get back together

732
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,660
with the first girl you dated, just do it, okay?

733
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,380
Please don't make me watch you at JCPenney

734
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,460
as you go through the scarves, okay?

735
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,020
Thank you.

736
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,860
Um, I mean, it depends entirely on what the relationship is.

737
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,260
I mean, it depends entirely on what the relationship is

738
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,660
between the two women.

739
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,700
Because if your girlfriend is not comfortable

740
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,900
with you hanging out this former beau of yours,

741
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,700
then I don't think she would be cool with like,

742
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,700
oh, these are so great slacks.

743
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,580
I love these slacks.

744
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,540
Where'd you get these slacks?

745
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,700
And you say, JCPenney, and you say, how much do they cost?

746
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,620
And you say, well, don't ask me a question about that.

747
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,060
Like, that is a gift.

748
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,420
And say, oh, well, how did you know

749
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,940
how I would like these slacks?

750
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,300
And then you say, oh, oh, Large Marge told me.

751
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Why did I, I am so fucking bad at thinking in names

752
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,060
whenever I tell anecdotes.

753
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,180
Let's roll with Large Marge.

754
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,820
So your friend, Large Marge, helps you to pick this out.

755
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,020
If she, if current, current special someone

756
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,780
does not know about your relationship with Large Marge.

757
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,260
Small Marge.

758
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,620
It's Small Marge.

759
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,100
If New Marge doesn't know about Large Marge,

760
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,580
then you are fine.

761
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,780
Here are some key notes.

762
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,580
I don't care what the relationship is.

763
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,260
No one wants to hear that they needed someone

764
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,740
of the opposite sex to help them pick a gift

765
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,820
because they know you that little.

766
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,380
Like, that's not, that's going to sully the present.

767
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,140
They must never know, okay?

768
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,020
That's number one.

769
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,900
No reason, no reason.

770
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,260
I don't think there's any reason to be bad

771
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,380
at buying people gifts.

772
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,620
Because that just means that you don't know what they like.

773
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,740
Like, yeah, this is the problem is that when you say

774
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,900
that she wants something nice and you're a minimalist

775
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,220
and blah, blah, blah, you're missing the point.

776
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,620
The point is not how expensive or how big

777
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,780
or how great the present is.

778
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,780
It's that when, my feelings on gift giving

779
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,180
is that when the person opens the present

780
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,860
and sees it for the first time,

781
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,340
they should know instantly why you thought

782
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,140
they would like it.

783
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,100
Right.

784
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,460
Whether they actually do or not,

785
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,060
they should be able to think, okay, well,

786
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,980
he knows that I like this movie

787
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,540
and this is a piece of memorabilia from that.

788
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,700
Or he knows that my favorite color is blue

789
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,300
and so he bought me this blue shirt.

790
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,860
I come at it more from a shock and awe angle

791
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,700
where like, holy shit, I can't believe this person

792
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,980
spent this much money on me.

793
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,220
I'm just saying your advice makes you really sound

794
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,540
like one of the 47%, but go on.

795
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,980
It sounds like poor people advice.

796
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,180
You're poor mouthing right now.

797
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,100
Well, do you, okay, so gift line,

798
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,940
do you want me to solve this for you?

799
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,820
Do it.

800
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,660
And it's a little tweak,

801
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:17,140
but just don't have the person go with you.

802
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,460
Ask them beforehand, ask Large Marge, say,

803
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,860
hey, I'm trying to think of things

804
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,100
to get my girlfriend this Christmas.

805
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,540
Do you have any suggestions?

806
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,220
And then you don't have to say

807
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,580
that someone helped you pick it out.

808
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,940
Well, except that she did.

809
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,660
No, I do that all the time.

810
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,460
If like, and I never, you know, go on that solely,

811
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
but I'll pull some friends and say,

812
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,140
I'm thinking about getting Teresa this.

813
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,260
What do you think?

814
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,900
You know what I mean?

815
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,660
Like, there's no shame in asking the audience.

816
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:44,900
Yeah.

817
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,540
You know what I mean?

818
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,580
So you don't have to go in it alone,

819
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,460
but maybe don't make the person such an intrinsic part

820
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,900
of picking out the gift

821
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,740
that you've got to give them credit for it.

822
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,260
How about this?

823
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,300
Let's buy her some lotion, you goofster.

824
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,820
Is this a surefire hit?

825
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,740
What flavor?

826
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,220
You know, fucking pecans or vanilla or something food,

827
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,140
like some sort of dessert flavor.

828
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,420
Or just get her some food.

829
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,700
See, that's classic.

830
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,220
That's how Large Marge thought.

831
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,540
Large Marge wanted everything to smell like food.

832
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,460
So of course she's going to get you like barbecue sauce lotion,

833
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,300
but that's not what New Marge likes.

834
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,460
New Marge likes baubles.

835
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,260
Yeah.

836
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,420
Maybe, maybe get her a date at the spa.

837
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,860
I bet, who wouldn't like that?

838
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,460
Maybe get her some bath salts, actual bath salts or the drug.

839
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,060
Yeah, just get her the drug.

840
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,220
Have you guys noticed,

841
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,660
and I don't know if it is this way at your personal malls,

842
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,700
but have you noticed that like after November 1,

843
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,540
the Bath and Body Works is just untenable.

844
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:53,860
Yeah.

845
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,700
You cannot enter that.

846
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,380
It is a throng of humanity.

847
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:05,940
It is Black Friday in that particular kiosk all month long.

848
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,260
Yeah.

849
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,540
And the smell, the smell manifests into a very physical presence.

850
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,060
It's a visible smell coming out of that place.

851
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,820
You will see like a smell ghost,

852
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,540
like wafting out of the front door saying coming in.

853
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,340
It's like somebody baked all of the different cookies

854
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,620
that there are in the world

855
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,940
and then covered them in rose petals

856
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,340
and then buried them in the ground for 2000 years

857
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,940
and then dug that up and then injected it straight into the nostrils.

858
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,100
When the like whiff of smell comes out

859
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,620
and like entices the hobo to like come to the pie in the window.

860
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,020
Yeah.

861
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,860
It's like that only with sons and husbands

862
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:44,100
who don't know what their wives or moms like.

863
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,340
Yeah.

864
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,620
Going into Bath and Body Works

865
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,060
to get a gift for your significant other

866
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,540
is basically just like giving up.

867
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,500
Just like, I don't know.

868
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,820
I guess they like to smell good and be soft.

869
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,060
Fuck.

870
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:54,420
Shit.

871
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,380
Smell beautiful for me, Deborah.

872
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,340
It is also like the quintessential like,

873
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,940
you know, white elephant, you know, secret Santa present.

874
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,860
I'm like, I know nothing about this person

875
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,700
except that they don't like to stink.

876
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:13,300
I just don't like the idea of getting somebody a gift

877
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,020
that basically says,

878
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,500
I want you to smell better for like two weeks

879
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,780
and then this is going to be gone.

880
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,780
Enjoy this for less than a month.

881
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,180
Can we also say that there's something skeezy about saying,

882
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:25,060
I got you a gift and I want you to rub it all over your body.

883
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,740
Rub this on your body.

884
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,660
I've gotten several grandmothers lotion from Bath and Body Works

885
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,460
and that thought didn't really cross my mind.

886
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,220
It was more like, this is just twisted peppermint.

887
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,140
Rub it all over your body.

888
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,260
No, it was more like,

889
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,660
I got a vanilla, Vanilla Bean Noel.

890
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,220
Take this Vanilla Bean Noel.

891
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,940
Rub it all over your ashy elbows.

892
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,980
Mine was more like, oh, meeps, meeps, meeps.

893
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,860
I know that your hands get all crackly

894
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,700
when you play computer pachinko.

895
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,140
So why don't you rub this sweet, sweet peppermint all over.

896
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,820
I'll take care of that crackly problem.

897
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,820
You can play pachinko uninterrupted.

898
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:14,500
It's very, it's very, very dry in your assisted living housing.

899
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:19,780
Maybe put some pink sugar plum onto those crackle knuckles.

900
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,940
Oh, meepers, it's dry, dry work, writing in all caps on my Facebook wall.

901
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,300
You know you got to lube them up.

902
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:33,540
Lube those, lube those joints up so you can keep clicking and sharing.

903
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,780
As to how the jazz musician made his way into our conversation about lotion.

904
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,620
Jazz musician has a grandma too.

905
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,900
I'm jazz granny.

906
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,900
I'm Lou Reed and I'm going to rub stuff all over all your grandmas.

907
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,660
I'm going to put a little soul in a bowl.

908
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,300
We're going to rub stuff, wait, wait.

909
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,620
Did you say Lou Reed or Lou Ross?

910
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,460
I said both of them.

911
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,780
Both of them have grandmothers after all.

912
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,180
We all have grandmothers, don't we folks?

913
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,900
Lou Ross is going to tag team your grandma's elbows.

914
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,180
I used to like this show, my brother, my brother, me,

915
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,780
and then every episode devolved into them low talking

916
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,540
and try to say the most upsetting things they could think of to each other.

917
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,460
Vanilla bean Noel, folks.

918
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,020
That's the scent to watch, in my opinion.

919
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm keeping track of all the scent stock markets.

920
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,660
I have invested heavily in pink sugar plum.

921
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,700
Yankee Candle has got it popping off.

922
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,700
They've got some apple and pine needle.

923
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,780
Ooh, that smells great.

924
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,220
That sounds delightful.

925
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,060
So I've dropped about 10 large on one that's just called buttholes.

926
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,540
They sell it only on extreme restraints.

927
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,780
Some people just can't get enough of that funky stuff.

928
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,740
That funky stuff.

929
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,180
This isn't funky.

930
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,860
Funky is a terrible word.

931
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Now at Yankee Candle, they now have scents for men.

932
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,020
Pumpkin pie is not a scent for it.

933
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,460
They're all scents for men.

934
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:23,300
No, I'm talking about there is a smell like, for example, of

935
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,580
fresh pussy.

936
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:32,180
Like the smell of freshly cut wood.

937
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,820
The smell of carpentry, basically, is a smell you can get at Yankee Candle.

938
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,180
I want to know how you play that off to your bros when they're like,

939
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,660
hey, bro, have you been cutting the cabinet?

940
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,740
Are you building something with your own hands?

941
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:48,260
Like, well, almost.

942
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,740
I lit a candle that smelled like I did.

943
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,940
Are we good?

944
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,860
Am I good right now?

945
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,420
Am I good?

946
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,660
I'm sorry, Yankee Candle.

947
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,700
I usually like you, but I do not live in a world in which I light a pumpkin spice candle

948
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,980
and some bros walk in the room and say, oh, are you burning a candle like a lady?

949
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,140
I've never heard that before.

950
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,580
You light a cut wood candle and your girlfriend comes home and is like,

951
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,260
what the fuck is this shit?

952
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,100
I hate this smell.

953
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,420
Oh, it's like poison.

954
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,660
And now I can't smell.

955
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,380
Well, there is an actual, no bullshit, Yankee Candle that is called,

956
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:28,740
and I kid you not, Man Town.

957
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,140
That is a candle.

958
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,300
You could go to Yankee Candle and say,

959
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,020
I tell you where I want this scent to transport me to, Man Town.

960
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,420
Which is also the follow up hit to The Weather Girl's It's Raining Men.

961
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:51,940
About this fragrance, escape to the man cave with this masculine blend of spices, woods and musk.

962
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,020
Oh my God.

963
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:56,660
Is there a word worse than musk?

964
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:01,780
That's been the problem with men exclusive rooms all these years

965
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,580
is that they haven't smelled enough like dudes.

966
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,500
No, wait a minute.

967
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,580
I got that completely backwards.

968
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:12,260
No one ever walks into your quote unquote man cave.

969
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,860
First off, gross.

970
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,220
Second, no one ever walks into your man cave and says,

971
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,060
man, I tell you what it could smell more like in here right now, dude.

972
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,180
Or better yet, I fucking love this smell,

973
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,940
but it's so hard to get bros together, drink beer, eat corn nuts,

974
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,700
and watch football all the time.

975
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,180
I wish I could wake up to this scent.

976
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,820
I just wish that there was some way that I could just take myself to Man Town.

977
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:41,140
I tell you, I tell you, Philippe,

978
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,220
it really, really smells like you've had a bunch of dudes in here hanging out and broing.

979
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,140
It smells like that, doesn't it?

980
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:52,100
It's pretty much just been me, me and my candles.

981
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:57,220
We had a pretty heavy bro sesh last week and the musk is still hanging in the,

982
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,580
it's in the wallpaper.

983
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,260
That stank ain't never coming out.

984
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,980
Well now it won't because I just don't know what,

985
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,460
but if you light a candle-

986
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:08,180
What market?

987
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,100
Yeah, what's the market?

988
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:15,700
If I light a candle, the use is almost always to get rid of a smell that a man created.

989
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,500
It is almost always from like, ah, Greg, you left your fish out again.

990
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,340
Guys, I know what the market is.

991
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,740
Tell me.

992
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,900
Army wives.

993
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,420
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

994
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,820
How could this be?

995
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,500
How could this happen?

996
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:44,180
130 episodes without picking on America's most deserving demographic, army wives.

997
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:46,660
They've had it easy for too long.

998
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:49,700
Here comes my brother, my brother and me to knock that proverbial-

999
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,140
Calm, calm, calm.

1000
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,260
We're gonna bully you.

1001
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:58,740
Here we are.

1002
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,100
Can we end the show?

1003
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,140
I feel terrible.

1004
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,060
Yeah, that's the end.

1005
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,780
Yeah, I think, yeah, I think that's the end of the show.

1006
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,500
Absolutely.

1007
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,700
I don't really know if we've really given it to army wives enough.

1008
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,660
I think we even, we cracked open the door and it was enough.

1009
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:19,940
They're getting, listen, listen, army wives, you're unnoticed.

1010
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,340
We don't have any good goose for you this week, but next week, oh boy.

1011
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:29,220
You're getting off easy, easy right now, but-

1012
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,220
You're finally gonna get yours next week.

1013
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,220
You'll get your comeuppance.

1014
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,700
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1015
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,660
It's an advice show.

1016
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,340
Thank you so much for listening, for whatever reason you do do that.

1017
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,060
Thank you for tweeting about the show with the MBMBAM hashtag.

1018
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,820
Metrixer, Amy El Russo, Little Socrates, Crystal Whalen, of course.

1019
00:46:52,820 --> 00:47:02,900
Mason VD, Alphagetti, I believe, James Leff from Miss Dapper, DJ Pazazz, everybody.

1020
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,100
We really appreciate it.

1021
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,060
The Thunder Boss.

1022
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:12,820
Also, I wanna throw out, Christian is heading out to basic training, I think this week,

1023
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,340
and he's looking forward to two months of my brother, my brother, and me waiting for him

1024
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,060
when he gets back.

1025
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,180
So Christian, have a good time, I guess.

1026
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,740
Thank you.

1027
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,300
Get training.

1028
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,700
Get trained up, basically.

1029
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:28,260
Thank you for your service, and apologies for that sweet transition.

1030
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,020
Travis Engineer, sorry to your wife if that's a thing.

1031
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,540
I wanna thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

1032
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,940
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1033
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,500
A great Candle Nights present, I'm sure.

1034
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:47,300
I'm sure everybody who listens to this show already owns that album, but maybe your friends

1035
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,820
don't, maybe your parents don't.

1036
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,260
Your parents are gonna love these sounds.

1037
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:55,060
He's got a real Peter Gabriel thing going for him that your rinse are just gonna enjoy.

1038
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,420
Travis, do you have anything you wanna say?

1039
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,420
I actually do.

1040
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,100
I realized going through the questions this week, we get a lot of questions every week,

1041
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:10,980
and we can only answer usually three or four or two for not really paying attention.

1042
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:18,580
I just wanted you guys to know, I do read every email that you guys send, and I just

1043
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,060
wanna say, I love all of you so much, and I'm sorry that we can't get to all your questions

1044
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:27,540
every week, but just know that I do read and I do care, and I know that some of you are

1045
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,100
going through some pretty tough stuff, and just know that we're here and we're pulling

1046
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,460
for you no matter who you are or what problems you're going through.

1047
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,660
We care about you.

1048
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,100
So there, we love you.

1049
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,820
There, I said it.

1050
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,260
There, the truth's out.

1051
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,660
Take a load off, Andy, and put that load right on me, but not in like a sex way.

1052
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,340
Do you guys wanna Yahoo?

1053
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:47,700
Yeah.

1054
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,860
This final Yahoo was sent in by Frederick Olson.

1055
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,060
Thank you, Frederick.

1056
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:57,380
It's by Yahoo answer user Hunita, who asks, what kind of juice is good?

1057
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,340
I'm Justin McElroy.

1058
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,460
I'm Travis McElroy.

1059
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1060
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,100
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1061
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,820
Kiss your dad.

1062
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:20,580
Square on the lips.
