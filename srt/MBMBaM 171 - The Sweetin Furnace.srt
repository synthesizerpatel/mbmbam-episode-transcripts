1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,880
your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,720
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Guys, the government is shut down.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,760
Scrapping it together. Against all odds.

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,880
Gum and twine over here. Sticking it together with gum and twine.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,200
This is the worst conditions under which we have ever recorded

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,880
My Brother, My Brother. Let's break it down.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,240
This is the daddy I made you an ashtray episode.

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,680
You thought that we weren't going to have an episode. Maybe it would have been better if we

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
didn't, but we got hungry mouths to feed. All right. So condition one.

15
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,160
Condition one. My Macintosh computer made by Apple Corporation is dead. I am recording on a

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,560
personal computer made by Bill Gates himself. I'm assuming it is college days because it doesn't

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,800
have anything. Bill Gates sent Justin an email said, listen, Justin, I understand you need to

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,160
scrap together a butt quality episode. I understand that this is something you need to do. So have

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:48,960
this Tandy 12 for free. This is the 12th Tandy to roll off the line. I tried to install Java and

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,320
a guy came by and poured coffee into my lap. It is the worst computer anyone's ever used.

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,280
I am recording at work at the Cincinnati Shakespeare Company in the ladies dressing room.

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
I am Skyping through my phone, according onto my computer,

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,800
and you may from time to time hear them recorded rehearsing of mice and men in the background.

24
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,880
I am technically at work right now. So that's my that's my cross to bear.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,800
Oh, also, I just got married. So that's really slowing me down.

26
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,680
We should back up and explain that Travis just got married.

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,400
And let's just say we were a little presumptive in the amount of free time we thought we'd have

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,640
during Travis's wedding, I guess. Yeah, I guess we had made plans to like

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,840
ditch all our family and friends and then just like mid ceremony. Like there's there's the

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,880
homily. There's the charge, a couple of songs, the wine ceremony, duck out for a quick record sesh

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,360
and then the vows. Yeah, fully, fully like graduate style, fending the family off as we

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,480
as we run away down the aisles and we did. But the episode wasn't that funny. So we scrapped it.

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,400
Yeah, it was mostly Travis crying like a little bitch. Travis, do you want to? Sorry, should we?

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,160
Let's keep painting a picture of this wedding. Travis, do you want to talk about how many like

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,280
little bitch tears you cried out? I cried three. No, it was more than three.

36
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,800
It was just three. I was I was the best man standing standing at riding shotgun in the cockpit.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,880
I only recall three. He had me carry special tissues for him. And during several times during

38
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,880
the wedding, he turned to me like, I'm sorry, I'm such a pussy. No, I had a really bad nosebleed.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah. And I needed the tissues. So I didn't get a beautiful dress with water. My eyes were bleeding

40
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,960
because I was crying so hard like a pussy. Oh, oh, oh, I forgot to mention one of the things.

41
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,560
I'm using a Battlefield 3 keyboard on my personal computer. And this is literally what it sounds

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,080
like. Are you ready for this? Jesus, you sound like a hacker on CSI. That is literally enhance,

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,600
enhance. This is literally what it sounds like. So taking them back to the good old days,

44
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,640
the rock band microphone days. I used to like those days because I could hold the microphone

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,160
like sim bad. And you know, if I had a good line, I could literally drop it here. If I drop it,

46
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,880
you know, I got to go back to Amazon and buy a new one these days. So this is an advice show for

47
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,320
the modern era where we help young people and old people, I assume, from time to time, navigate the

48
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,120
rocky waters of life. And let's let's get into that right now. When my husband and I watch our

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
favorite serial dramas, I prefer to let things unfold without trying too hard to guess what's

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,840
going to happen next. My husband is the type who likes to guess what's going to happen out loud.

51
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,200
And he's often right. His correct guesses include some key points in the season two finale Boardwalk

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,600
Empire and the series finale of Breaking Bad moments that would have been pretty jaw dropping

53
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,160
to a passive viewer like myself. Had he not already predicted what was going to happen.

54
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,440
I asked him to quit sharing his spoilers with me and keep quiet till the show's over. He said

55
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,000
they're not technically spoilers since he doesn't know what's going to happen. He's just guessing.

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Um, there's more to this question, but I think we get the gist. That's from passive

57
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,240
versus predictive in Portland. The thing is, there's two different ways he could be doing

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,120
that. Like Teresa does this, but it's usually just out of fear and tension where she says,

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,480
like, oh, he's not going to die. You see, he's not, they're not going to kill him. Are they

60
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,480
versus they're going to kill him? It's these are still spoilers. I think if you guess something

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,000
correctly in the past and it turns out to be true, you spoiled it. You did spoil it.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,840
Oh, I mean, I agree either way because it's usually like I, I always hate it when you're

63
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
watching something you've already seen with someone who hasn't. And you can remember it

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,920
being this huge reveal moment. And then that person being like, ah, he's going to fall down

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,840
the stairs and you're like, what? Um, just watch it. I have a, I have an alternative to suggest,

66
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,040
uh, for you to suggest to your husband. It was a cool move that I pulled once when, uh,

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,040
some friends and I were watching the, uh, one of the mini season premieres of 24. Uh, I didn't

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,240
watch that program. This is a baller move on your part. This is a baller move. I, I, uh, I

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,920
had a feeling and I got a little scrap of paper and I folded it. I wrote a note on it and I folded

70
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,920
it and I, uh, just showed everybody the note and I put it down on the table. And then, uh, again,

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:26,160
here comes the spoilers if you haven't watched. And then, uh, when this incredible moment happened,

72
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,800
I took out my scrap of paper that said, president Palmer will be assassinated before the first

73
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,200
commercial break. And then he was, and then you dropped it on the table, like the fucking finale

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,160
of rounders. I checked my style out. I think you actually said, check my style out. Check this

75
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,400
style. Check this dope style I have. I mean, but the other end to that choose your own adventure

76
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,800
is that you lay down and then you just slowly reach out and pick it back up and eat it.

77
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,800
Or you just slowly slip it into my mouth. You just fucking like take it home and it like sits

78
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,920
on your dresser for a while. And every once in a while you look at it and just think about what a

79
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,160
stupid idiot you are. Like what I went through all that fucking trouble. That is a, that's a

80
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,880
baller play, Justin. I'm not going to lie, but if it doesn't pan out, that's a, that's a cross you

81
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,280
have to bear for the rest of your life. Like knowing that you spent the time to you, you put

82
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,960
in even like a little stamp on the envelope, which seems excessive to me. That'll make him count it

83
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,560
though. Like he has to be really sure before he opens his pen. Oh, that's true. Right. Yeah. His

84
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,440
pen's gotta be his pen mouth to be absolutely concretely sure that this is what is going to

85
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,000
happen in the series. Uh, which, which might help to stave off his, uh, his spoiling. Our dad used

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,520
to be the worst, the worst or the best. Well, dad would like subconsciously spoil something where

87
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,480
he wouldn't say anything. He would just go, ah, okay. Wait, hold on. What, what is it? He was

88
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,080
like, no, just watch. I think I know. I think I just watch. And, and, and that was another level

89
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,160
because we could never prove or disprove the correctness of his theory. He might have just

90
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,200
been doing that. Yeah. That might just be a dad move that dads can pull. I see what's happening.

91
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,920
Okay. I think you should just keep your mouth shut. Just enjoy it together. Just enjoy the

92
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,280
moments together. And then afterwards he can say, that's what I thought was going to happen in my

93
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,480
brain, but I didn't say anything about it out of courtesy. My dad will still text me like during

94
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,000
Doctor Who. He's like, I know it's, I know what's happening. Like, okay. All right. You live in

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,960
another state now. You can't keep doing this to me. I'm my own man. I have a wife and a home. I'm

96
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:43,360
a grown adult. Stop terrorizing me. Y'all want a yahoo? Yeah. It sounds like to us, just see,

97
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
it probably sounds fine when you're listening this at home. It sounds to us like Travis is

98
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,720
being held in a Russian prison. It sounds like they gave him a payphone to call his brothers.

99
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,680
That is actually what we're doing for our honeymoon. It's a whole experience that you

100
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,600
can sign up for and you spend a week in a gulag. Travis actually was a founding member of Pussy

101
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:11,120
Riot. He thought that he was signing up for some sort of rad party. But no, he was actually in a

102
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,520
feminist punk band. Do you guys want a yahoo? I asked you this and you said yes. This yahoo was

103
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,800
sent in by Drew Davenport. Thanks Drew. It's by yahoo answers user Miana who asks, what can you

104
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,240
do while you're pregnant to make baby be born with a head full of hair? That's it. Eat a lot of hair.

105
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Next question. I think that's pretty good. I think if you can eat a lot of hair and some sort of

106
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,840
bonding agent, that is a tricky needle to thread because you're going to need something that's

107
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,360
going to make it through your gully works without stopping the shit up, but it still has to be

108
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,800
cohesive enough to bond the hair together into some sort of fetus wig. The terrible risk that

109
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,600
you're running there is that your baby will see it and it comes in with all the other food you're

110
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,280
eating. And this is a stupid baby things like, oh, this is food. Oh, I was going the other way

111
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,200
where you end up with some, some food on their head or he has a taste for hair. He just loves

112
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,800
to eat hair. It's all osmosis down there in the, in the early months of the formation of the feti,

113
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,560
right? It's all osmo osmotic, right? All osmosis Jones, all of these, if this fucking osmosis Jones

114
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:30,400
that's growing inside of you, it's just a big bag of translucent cells and shit. Anything can pass

115
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,480
through there. You gotta be careful. If you eat a Frito and it goes down the wrong pipe, that baby

116
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,040
is going to come out with Frito hands. Cause it's just, your tummy doesn't know what's up. It doesn't

117
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,080
know where to put things. By the way, Tim Burton, I don't know why you thought that Edwards is

118
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,720
their hands needed a follow-up, but Ricky Frito hands is not, is not in keeping with you. I'll

119
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,920
always remember he was totally crunchtastic. It's the best, it's the best Christmas ever.

120
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,360
Um, you can probably just eat a bunch of hair and then nature finds a way, you know,

121
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,440
he'll figure things out in there. What about this? Ch-ch-ch-chia. What is,

122
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,840
you just said a slogan of a thing. Ch-ch-ch-chia. It's the pottery that grows.

123
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah. We know what it is clearly, but how does this, how is it?

124
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,960
You're going to need to swallow. I think it was like mud with some seeds in it.

125
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,840
And then with your like belly hands, smooth it onto the baby's head with your, so you're a

126
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,920
little bit unclear just about the basic mechanics. You got the belly hands in there and that's what

127
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,520
puts the baby together. Travis has a fundamental misunderstanding of gully works.

128
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,560
They put it together like in a factory and that's what, that's what daddy told me.

129
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,120
You're saying that every woman's uterus contains a set of hands, like the tunnel in the labyrinth

130
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,680
that Jennifer Connelly falls down through and then the hands push the baby down,

131
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
but while the baby is in there, they put the parts together. That's why, that's why the

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,240
dude says push and then the hands all push it. This is a horrifying, I, I never. Happy Halloween.

133
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,360
That's the spooky twist of pregnancy. I never want anybody to be pregnant again now. No. Yeah.

134
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,440
That's that. That's the plot line to story, uh, children of men.

135
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,040
And all the hands like, fuck it. Yeah. Fuck it. We're done. We're on strike.

136
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,320
They all got game boy body case and they did stop working. Is there a way that you can copulate?

137
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,120
Cause from what I understand, life's life obviously starts at inception. I mean conception

138
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,520
life started with when the movie inception was made. Life starts with conception.

139
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Or that was all amoebas and sun. More like life starts at deception.

140
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,760
And yeah, not trying to, trying to get my money or something. I don't know. Uh, there's, there's,

141
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,560
I think that there's a way to like chop and screw and get the kind of baby that you want to get

142
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,400
while you are, um, chopping and screwing. If you know what I mean, I think that it's like,

143
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,360
you know how they say like, wait till there's a full moon and then have sex

144
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,360
upside down on a couch while saying ABCs with the Wolfman with a Wolfman. And then that's how you,

145
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,760
um, you know, that's how you have a strong baby. I think there's probably a method of copulation

146
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,040
that you can exercise, uh, to make sure that you got a her suit child. You gotta have,

147
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,400
you gotta do it, uh, whilst on a treadmill and eating a plate full of angel hair pasta, no sauce.

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,920
That's quite the balancing act. Does it, can it be on like, do you want a hairy baby or not?

149
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,840
That's how I prep for marathons. It can't be the same procedure.

150
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Mm-hmm. Oh, be careful. Be careful. You might get pregnant with a hairy baby.

151
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,320
Man. Pregnancy is the weirdest. Once you're pregnant, it's probably too late to be Italian,

152
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,400
isn't it? Because I think that that seems to be a pretty good method.

153
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:11,360
I think, uh, by the point that you are conceived not by Italian people that shipped unsailed.

154
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,080
This was my fear. I was afraid you were going to say that.

155
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't think- But I had to take a shot.

156
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,640
I don't think there's a way to remix it in the post.

157
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,920
We'll fix it. It's white? Eh.

158
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,960
Don't worry about it. Fix it in post.

159
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,680
Don't worry about it.

160
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,600
Guys, I've been dating my boyfriend for about six months now. He came to me with a predicament.

161
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,440
He wants to recreate his image, mainly his wardrobe, to look more adult as he prepares

162
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,840
to graduate college in May. He is a relatively skinny guy, and the clothes he wears right now

163
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,680
are too big on him and make him look a lot younger. He asked for my help, but here's my

164
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,160
worry. I know exactly the look I want him to have. Kind of a Joseph Gordon-Levitt vibe,

165
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
but don't- Yeah, yeah, you and me both, sister. Come on.

166
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,160
Yeah, yeah. If you figure that one out, let me know. Uh, how do I help with this new wardrobe

167
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,480
without seeming pushy and aggressive, and, like, I really hate what he wears now. How

168
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
could I get on that JGL grind? That's from Baggy in Boston.

169
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
I mean, I have a- I have a real answer.

170
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,600
Go ahead, Travis.

171
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,400
Oh, great.

172
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,640
Here's my real answer. So what you need to do is, uh, to plug a video clip. He was just

173
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,720
on, uh, Jimmy Kimmel. No, he was on Jimmy Fallon.

174
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,280
No, he was on Jimmy Johns.

175
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,520
He was on- He was at a Jimmy Johns, and Travis saw him.

176
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,000
He was on Jimmy Neutron. Boy, genius.

177
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,080
He was on Jimmy Durante's Show from Heaven.

178
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,720
Oh, this is fun.

179
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,760
The talk show from heaven.

180
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,160
But he- So he was on, uh, Jimmy Fallon, and they did, like, a, uh, lip sync off. Show

181
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,360
him that clip, and while you're watching that clip, say, like, God, that's a bea- That's

182
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,640
an awesome jacket.

183
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,040
Yeah.

184
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,680
And just, like, start- And just do that every time you see things like that.

185
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,920
Man, look at those jean- Look at those jean shorts, because he's wearing jean shorts.

186
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,520
He was wearing jorts. And just, like, subtly plant things like that, you know, and any

187
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,360
time you see something- Rather than go, you should buy that jacket, say, like, oh, that's

188
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,640
a- that's a rockin' jacket.

189
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Oh, what a great guy.

190
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
I think that would look really good on you.

191
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,920
Don't you want to be him?

192
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
Well, maybe don't take it that far.

193
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,200
Travis has brought us a response to this question from an alternate dimension where any man

194
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,560
ever has picked up on subtext or contextual clues.

195
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
No, no, no, because what I- That's never occurred.

196
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,680
Because what I'm saying is you're planting it in his subconscious so that when he goes

197
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,240
shopping and he sees a jacket like that, he's gonna go, ah, I like that jacket.

198
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
He is not going to go out looking for that jacket.

199
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,560
I- No, absolutely not, Travis.

200
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,040
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Maybe we have different methods of shopping.

202
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,480
When I go into a men's clothing store, I'm running around like Dorothy when those trees

203
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
are throwing apples at her, okay?

204
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,280
I'm just- My-

205
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,840
Any- anything I can get a grip on, I'm reaching through the darkness, screaming at the top

206
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,640
of my lungs, hoping against hope that I can find solid ground where I'm not gonna get

207
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,880
any more- My entire emo is not, um,

208
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,960
WWJGLD.

209
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,320
It is, god damn, I hope I don't embarrass myself in here.

210
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
Let's just find- let's just find the things.

211
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
I'll go to Old Navy, I'll take in ten shirts, because one of them will fit, and then

212
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,320
I'll very hurriedly and embarrassedly just toss the other nine on the put away table,

213
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,160
the this is your problem now table, and then- and then skirt my way on out of there.

214
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,320
And even that one- even that one's not gonna fit.

215
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,520
It'll work on the sleeves, definitely not in the neck and chest area.

216
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,160
And that is why, with that lack of self-confidence, you guys will never be married.

217
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,560
Well, that's not true for Justin and almost certainly not true for me.

218
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,560
Alright.

219
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm just saying, some of us- some of us are a bit too chesty and necky to be a JGL.

220
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,360
Well, that- I mean, that's the thing.

221
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,760
I would love to dress like JGL, but, like, frankly, I got this, like, barrel chest and

222
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,120
a start of a beer gut.

223
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,080
Like, I can't pull that off.

224
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm gonna look like a fucking sausage that's broken through its casing.

225
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:49,920
Yeah.

226
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Trouser look like a carnival barker.

227
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
He can't- he can't do it.

228
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,720
Not again.

229
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,920
It'll look like a Joseph Gordon Levitt that is busted through its casing.

230
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,640
It's- it's horrible.

231
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,480
We have another failed clone, sir.

232
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,200
Oh, God.

233
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
We left him in the pan too long.

234
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,920
God.

235
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,880
That's the problem with artisanal Joseph Gordon Levitt, you know?

236
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,320
It sure- it looks great.

237
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,360
It looks rusting, but it's always bursting through its casing as soon as it hits the front.

238
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,560
The sage-crusted potatoes come out really, really well, but the- the JGL, I don't know.

239
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,680
Unless you're using a thick casing, uh, some-

240
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,800
It all depends on how- how thick was your JGL grind.

241
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,600
Yeah, yeah.

242
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,520
If it's- if it's too fine, then it's like you're eating JGL putty.

243
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,600
Too coarse, and it's like a crunchy JGL putty.

244
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
You gotta split the uprights.

245
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
This is why JGL success late in life is- is a great indicator that nobody knows anything.

246
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,200
Nobody knows a goddamn thing.

247
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
If you've been watching Third Rock from the Sun and looked at that little bastard and thought,

248
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
he is gifted.

249
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,480
He is going places.

250
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,800
He's not gonna fall into the chasm where we keep all the other Jody Sweetens and the like.

251
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,600
Like, he's gonna bust right out and be his own man.

252
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,400
I wouldn't know.

253
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,800
I wouldn't-

254
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,160
Chuck him in the Sweeten furnace.

255
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,480
Just throw him in there.

256
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,360
Make sure his casing doesn't pop.

257
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,000
But wait a second.

258
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Look through the window.

259
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,320
He's untouched.

260
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,320
It is Shadrach, Meshach, Avednego, and JGL.

261
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
I saw a fourth figure in the flames.

262
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,560
Was it an angel?

263
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,120
Kind of.

264
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,960
Kind of.

265
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
Did you see 500 Days of Summer?

266
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:17,840
He dances like one.

267
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,880
Dances like a fucking angel.

268
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,760
Dresses like one.

269
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,720
Sings like one.

270
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,280
My wife loves Josie- Who doesn't?

271
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,080
Everyone loves him.

272
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
He's my perfect little sausage boy.

273
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,200
So good.

274
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,760
I wish they hadn't janked up his face in the looper.

275
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,960
In a looper, yeah.

276
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,080
That should be a war crime.

277
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,480
Yeah.

278
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,400
Those people should- You wanted to talk about somebody who should be thrown in a gulag.

279
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
It's the people who messed up- Here's the thing.

280
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,800
If I might bitch about looper for one moment, I've never seen a movie in which an actor

281
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,760
played a younger version of an older actor that's also in the film and been bothered

282
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
by the fact that they didn't look alike.

283
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,160
Not how it worked.

284
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,200
It looked more like they had put him and Bruce Willis into what will our baby look like generator

285
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
and then aged him 25 years.

286
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,960
I think that JGL's look is so on point that Bruce Willis should have had to got reconstructive

287
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,800
surgery to look more like JGL.

288
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,320
Permanent JGL overhaul.

289
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,400
I would have preferred that instead of making JGL look like a JGL BW hybrid in looper, if

290
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,240
they had just made him look completely like old school Bruno, like when he was recording

291
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,160
music, you know what I mean?

292
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,680
Back in the Hudson Hawk era.

293
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,480
Hudson Hawk era fucking pot jazz BW when it was-

294
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:45,120
Can we just like Photoshop in just like CGI in Hudson Hawk into looper in place of JGL

295
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:52,320
and then maybe just also like CGI in like JGL just over in the corner crossing his arms

296
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,120
and shaking his head.

297
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,920
Yeah, I bet originally they made JGL look like music slash Hudson Hawk era Bruce Willi,

298
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,280
but he just couldn't help but jam with himself.

299
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,840
Like every time he saw me, he's like, we gotta jam.

300
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,240
Come on.

301
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,680
Gotta kill you, but that'll kill me.

302
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,400
You're right.

303
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,840
Hold this saxophone.

304
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,400
Let's jam.

305
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,440
Let's just jam.

306
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,920
My yearly get together with some of my old friends is coming up.

307
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,640
I'm excited to see them again, but one thing is different.

308
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,000
One of them has a kid since the last time we saw them.

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,680
I absolutely detest holding babies, but I'm sure the child will be passed around at some

310
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,320
point.

311
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,880
Is there any way to decline without making the moment awkward or should I just suck it

312
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,240
up and play along pretending I'm not screaming on the inside?

313
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,720
That's from Indisposed in Indiana.

314
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,880
Just tell them legally you're not allowed to be within 300 yards of a child.

315
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,240
Yeah, that'll go really, really well.

316
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,440
I think that'll keep her from being awkward.

317
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,560
You want to talk about being afraid of popping something outside of its casing.

318
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,320
Can babies, what can you do during copulation to give your baby thicker, firmer skin?

319
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
I feel like I can see through every baby I hold.

320
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
I want to really build up my baby's chitin.

321
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,160
Yeah, I don't think that's too much to ask a baby shell.

322
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
A strong exoskeleton.

323
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,680
Here's what you do.

324
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,000
In the kitchen, you keep a tray of jelly.

325
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,200
When the baby starts being passed around, you run into the kitchen, dip your hands in

326
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,040
the jelly and say something like, just cooking up some jelly things.

327
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm doing something in here.

328
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
Doing something in here and then rush out when it's your turn and say, ah.

329
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,040
Would love to.

330
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,560
Love to hold the baby.

331
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,480
Got jelly on my hands though.

332
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,040
Can't at the moment because of the jelly.

333
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,480
Does it have to be jelly?

334
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
Because I feel like there's a myriad of things that if you had on your hands, the parents

335
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,200
would not want you to.

336
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,440
If you got jelly in a baby's crevices, do you know how long you'd have to work to get

337
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,160
all that gunk out?

338
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,280
You know how many folds they have?

339
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,920
Justin, you're forgetting something though.

340
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,800
This baby's probably already going to have quite a bit of jelly on it.

341
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:02,400
This baby's already going to have a preternatural layer of self jelly that the parents are going

342
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,440
to be like, I don't worry about it.

343
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
It's just, you know, you're just going to add.

344
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,200
We'll hose them down in the back.

345
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,160
Yeah, we have, we hose them every 10 minutes.

346
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,920
So like, go ahead and get that jelly on there.

347
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:12,960
Okay.

348
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,280
All right.

349
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,600
All right.

350
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,520
It'll make it easier actually to see the other jelly that's already on this kid.

351
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
If you just go ahead and jelly them up.

352
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
Like plot candy basically.

353
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,400
What if you bring them like a baby shower kind of present and you're like, hey, I got

354
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,120
this for you.

355
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,480
It's a baby suit of armor.

356
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,920
Are you worried about hurting the baby?

357
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,640
Is that the problem?

358
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,160
Or are you just like, ew.

359
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,280
I think it's, who doesn't love holding beautiful babies?

360
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,320
It's an embarrassment thing.

361
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,440
How are you even supposed to hold?

362
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,640
How do you hold a baby, Justin?

363
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
Let me critique it.

364
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,480
How do you hold a baby?

365
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,280
Fireman's carry.

366
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,280
By their heel, I'm going to dip them in a lake and give them a blessing.

367
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,760
See, there's no right way to do it because there's only one right.

368
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,160
There's, there's one right way to hold a baby, but that way over your shoulder, like a

369
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,200
continental soldier.

370
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:57,680
No, no, no.

371
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,160
You scoop, you scoop them and you, you scoop them right in the, your loving crevice of

372
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,960
your arms.

373
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,360
Right.

374
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,600
And you have to support the head or it falls off.

375
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
If you do that to a stranger baby though, it feels like you're trying to steal.

376
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
It looks like you're trying to steal it.

377
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,400
Right.

378
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,360
And when you hold it like that, it looks like you're trying to, to, to supersede the parents

379
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,480
and become the new parent.

380
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,920
And that's way too forward.

381
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,040
Oh, okay.

382
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,040
I've got an idea and it'll, it'll force you to hold the baby, but for the shortest amount

383
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,040
of time possible, hold the baby and then go right into the Heisman.

384
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,560
I guarantee those parents will take that baby back from you.

385
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,760
Travis, I feel like you're being a little devil may care with this baby's life.

386
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,640
Heisman.

387
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,040
Yeah.

388
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,840
Little reckless.

389
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
I like the jelly idea.

390
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,600
I feel like there's something you could have on your hands at all times that would preclude,

391
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,880
but like, what are babies vulnerabilities?

392
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,560
Like what are babies weak to?

393
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,320
Everything.

394
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
Maybe have some like raccoons on your hands.

395
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:54,960
Okay.

396
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
If you could cut your hands in raccoons, I think you'd be out of baby duty.

397
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,200
Oh, bad schools.

398
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
Have bad schools on your hands.

399
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
Can you cover yourself in bad schools?

400
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,120
Can you get another baby?

401
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,560
Let's say this is my baby and I'm bonding.

402
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,480
So I don't want to mess up the bonding.

403
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Get another baby that has like tattoos and is smoking a cigarette.

404
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
And then the parents would be like, well, I don't want my baby around that baby.

405
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
A tougher baby.

406
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,760
You should be able to rent a tougher baby for a day.

407
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm really nervous to hold babies.

408
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm right there with, yeah, I really am.

409
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,760
I super am.

410
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,720
It really is.

411
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,960
I still don't think I've mastered the hold yet.

412
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,320
It's the same way I feel self-conscious when using chopsticks.

413
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,720
It's the same way I feel when using baby.

414
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
You just need to hold the baby a couple of times.

415
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
You know, you're not going to get better at it if you don't try.

416
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Yeah.

417
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah, no one has babies in Austin though.

418
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,400
Because like I've said before, it's a nation of-

419
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
The humidity.

420
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,240
Of 18 year olds.

421
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,840
Also, yeah, nobody wants to get up on all these swamp balls.

422
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,040
They're floating around down here.

423
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,040
Do you want to make love?

424
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,040
I don't know.

425
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:14,000
Oh, hey guys, I have to get paid.

426
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,640
I want to tell everybody about Warby Parker.

427
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
He's a friend of ours that we've talked about a few times.

428
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
And I've seen many of you getting into his wares.

429
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,600
So if you haven't gotten on board yet,

430
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,120
these are contemporary eyeglasses that are extremely affordable and fashion forward.

431
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,560
These are not your daddy's glasses.

432
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,040
These are prescription glasses that start at $95 including prescription lenses.

433
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,160
Including prescription lenses.

434
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:42,960
It's written twice here.

435
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
I don't think I'm supposed to say it twice.

436
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,160
But I said it again with emphasis.

437
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,600
Travis probably pasted it bad.

438
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,480
All the glasses have anti-reflective and anti-glare coating at no additional cost.

439
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,120
So here's the best thing.

440
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,000
When you call him and you say, hey, I want five pairs of glasses.

441
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,800
They're going to bring them to you.

442
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,360
Warby's going to get into the Warby mobile.

443
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,280
He's going to drive down to your house with a suitcase.

444
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,760
He'll be like, psst.

445
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,800
The Warby machine.

446
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,280
The Warby machine.

447
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,280
He's going to come to your house.

448
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,160
He's going to let you try on these five pairs of glasses.

449
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,360
Show your family and friends.

450
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,000
Don't worry.

451
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,720
He'll wait.

452
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,600
He'll just sit there.

453
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,040
But he will not eat your food.

454
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,760
He won't hold your baby.

455
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,480
He's not a friend of the family.

456
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,600
He's a glasses salesman.

457
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,120
If Warby's too busy to visit you, he will ship them out.

458
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
You get to hang on to him.

459
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,720
Pick the glasses or I guess just the one pair you want.

460
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
Then you send the rest back.

461
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,840
Normally they get there within 10 business days.

462
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,960
But we got a promo code.

463
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
My brother.

464
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
You use it checkout and you're going to get them faster.

465
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,000
So there's that.

466
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
So that's fantastic.

467
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,800
And here's the best part.

468
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,960
Well, not the best part, but a good part for every pair of glasses they sell.

469
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,800
They distribute a pair of glasses to someone in need.

470
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,600
Fantastic.

471
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,680
Fantastic you can get non-prescription Polaroid sunglasses from 95 bucks.

472
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
Polaroid sunglasses.

473
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,680
Polaroid sunglasses that don't exist.

474
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,480
You can get those for like a million because they're not real.

475
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,800
And then polarized sunglasses from 150 dollars.

My you guys know me.

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,160
I fucking love my Randy Jacksons.

482
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,520
I fucking love these things.

483
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,560
They have been allowing me to see in crystal clear HD vision for a super long time.

484
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,480
I'm ready to throw these motherfuckers in the street.

485
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,280
Yeah, all thanks to the pressure provided by Warby Parker.

486
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,000
Trav, you've been married now for a few days.

487
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,280
How you been spending your time with your new bride?

488
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:46,000
We've been watching Hulu Plus like non-stop.

489
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,960
Bullshit.

490
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,360
Really?

491
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,600
Yeah.

492
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
Yeah, well, that's a great segue, Trav.

493
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,520
Tell me about it.

494
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,960
Well, Hulu Plus, you watch all your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

495
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,520
So whether you're sitting in front of, you know, your Xbox or you're in your hotel room

496
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,760
the night after your wedding making love, you can watch Hulu Plus anywhere.

497
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,320
Oh my God.

498
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,440
It all streams in HD, right?

499
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,080
That's what I've heard.

500
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,640
That is correct.

501
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,760
And Hulu Plus has a lot of your favorite shows like Saturday Night Live Community and Family Guy.

502
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,720
You can also check out.

503
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,360
There's an original program like The Awesomes from SNL Seth Meyers and Moon Boy,

504
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
which stars Chris Haddad from Bridesmaids.

505
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,880
They also have, you know, not just TV shows.

506
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,560
They have films on there too.

507
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,480
And it's only $7.99 a month and you can stream.

508
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,400
That's ridiculous.

509
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,880
I know.

510
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Like, how are they possibly making money?

511
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,080
Except for the fact that I guess you don't use it up by watching the TV show.

512
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,800
So that's actually a non-profit actually.

513
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,080
So they're not making money.

514
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,600
It's just everybody should be seeing Parks and Rec.

515
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,760
So it's like a government-provided service.

516
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm amazed that they're keeping it afloat despite the government shutdown.

517
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,800
Here's better news.

518
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,680
You can try it free for two weeks when you go to huluplus.com slash my brother.

Maybe we got a bonus for you.

525
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,480
It's hard to say.

526
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,720
Guys, I got a message for Zoe from Alden who says,

527
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,440
happy birthday to the best sister and one of my best friends.

528
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,560
Sorry it's a little late.

529
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,040
My bad.

530
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,640
Her birthday was September 25th.

531
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,600
God damn, Alden.

532
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,640
Dangest by a mile.

533
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,240
Of course, part of that is because we're recording so late, but hey.

534
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,000
Thank you for introducing me to MBMBAM,

535
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,880
by which I mean playing it in the car until I gave in and started downloading

536
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
and listening to it myself.

537
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,040
Now, it's a favorite podcast of mine.

538
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,160
Here's to another great year.

539
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,800
I love you.

540
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,360
Man, I love when people do advertisements and they advertise us in the advertisements.

541
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:47,920
It's like double.

542
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,200
Yeah, that's gonna help build our brand.

543
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,760
Double good for us.

544
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,260
No kidding.

545
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,640
That's really great.

546
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,400
Thank you to Zoe for being so considerate and helping to spread the word

547
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,720
about our podcast to people who listen to our podcast.

548
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
That's a free plug.

549
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,320
Hey, you know what I like to make my plugs out of?

550
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:04,800
What's that?

551
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,280
Cow manure!

552
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
Farm wisdom!

553
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,160
Farm wisdom!

554
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,120
Sounds awful.

555
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,200
Call and meet your Uncle Jake at the lake farm wisdom.

556
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,320
I wish Jake would stop hanging out in places only that rhyme with him.

557
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,600
So I was like, you want to go to Pizza Hut, Uncle Jake?

558
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
He's like, no, can't.

559
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll meet you at Cookie Break where they fix your breaks.

560
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,800
So I don't want to go there.

561
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,800
Not cookies?

562
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,560
So wait, at Cookie Break, they fix your breaks?

563
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,840
They don't prepare cookies?

564
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,320
I said Cookie Break.

565
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:40,960
Cookie Break.

566
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,680
I thought you said Cookie Break.

567
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,920
Man, I wish I could have a conversation with Justin

568
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,720
without him hearing ghost cookie words.

569
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
Travis, are you okay?

570
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,920
I am.

571
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,800
It sounds like you're at the bottom of the ocean

572
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,600
and you're trying to bury your microphone in the silt.

573
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,920
It sounds terrible over there.

574
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,320
Do you guys want to hear some farm bullshit?

575
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,520
Yeah, sure.

576
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,160
We were told that this is farm bullshit

577
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,800
and think of it like Yahoo Answers version of farm wisdom.

578
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,520
These are all actual superstitious suggestions for farmers

579
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,840
from the Canadian edition of the Farmer's Almanac.

580
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,280
Oh my God.

581
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,400
Never thank a person for giving you a plant or it will die.

582
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,920
In fact, the best way to ensure that plant slips will thrive is to steal them.

583
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,600
Wow, man.

584
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,720
This is the official Canadian Farmer's Almanac?

585
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
It is endorsing larceny?

586
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,280
Peppers should only be planted by a violent tempered person,

587
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,840
a redheaded person, or a person in a bad mood.

588
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,800
I don't think there's anyone in the world

589
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,960
who's not in a bad mood when they're doing chores.

590
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,480
Travis, what is going on?

591
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,760
Flax will grow tall if you show it your buttocks.

592
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,480
Flax.

593
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,840
Okay, come on.

594
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,280
No, this is true.

595
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,640
Flax is fucking nasty.

596
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
Flax will trick you too.

597
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,000
Flax will be like, hey, I dropped some flax seed over there

598
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,640
for you to harvest.

599
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,440
It's on the ground behind me.

600
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,040
Why don't you go ahead and pick that up?

601
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,560
Why don't you go ahead and pick that up, girl?

602
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,840
Now this I have problems with.

603
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,920
To cure a founder in a horse,

604
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,640
cut three locks of hair from your private parts,

605
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,280
place them between the halves of an apple or potato,

606
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,720
and feed it to the horse.

607
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,220
Okay.

608
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:16,980
All right.

609
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,960
Yeah.

610
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,920
So Canadian farmers are basically witches?

611
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,280
Is that what we're getting at here?

612
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,800
And their plants are perverts.

613
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,520
This is why I just have never been able to endorse the practice

614
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,200
of eating Canadian produce.

615
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,080
Because they're all sex-

616
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,080
And they're all full of pubes!

617
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,580
Stop!

618
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,640
You have two apples in your hand.

619
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,400
You're like, um, looks like my horse needs a snack.

620
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,680
What is that, founder?

621
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,280
Let me just shove some pubes up in there.

622
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,160
Wait, shit.

623
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,080
Which apple did I put the pubes in?

624
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,240
Do I cut the red wire or the blue wire?

625
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,640
God, you work so hard to build a relationship with your horse.

626
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,600
Can you imagine the risking that bond,

627
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,800
that eternal like interdimensional bond

628
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,640
by feeding it your own pubes?

629
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Maybe your horse is like, hey, I've got founder.

630
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
I don't- I still don't know what that is.

631
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
Ah, man, I've got a real bad case of founder.

632
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,040
Hey, Mike?

633
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,400
Hey, Mike, can I ask a favor?

634
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
Make us some of that bush.

635
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
Mike, I got a weird question for you, buddy.

636
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,640
I know we got a bond, and I don't want to overstep my horse bounds,

637
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,000
but make us- why don't you shave off a couple little sprigs?

638
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,680
Make it a couple sprigs of your zone.

639
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,680
Can you imagine?

640
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,600
Let me paint the horror story for you.

641
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,480
This is the situation that everybody wants to think about.

642
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,680
It's three o'clock in the morning.

643
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,680
What's that?

644
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,600
Is that- hey, hey, Doug, did I- were you asleep?

645
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Hey, sorry, Doug.

646
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,840
Listen, uh, my founder's really-

647
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,880
Really bad over here.

648
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,720
And, uh, really-

649
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,400
Walgreens is already closed.

650
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,880
They had no bush at Walgreens.

651
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,960
They were closed, and I just- I need to get a quick gnaw on your sprigs.

652
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,720
Now, Mike, I can't help it.

653
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,080
This looks like head hair, and I appreciate it,

654
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,240
but I feel like you're trying to dupe me, Mike.

655
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:58,880
Doug.

656
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,440
Doug Mike.

657
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,680
Mike Doug.

658
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,400
Mike Doug.

659
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,200
I thought we were boys.

660
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,760
Thought we were boys.

661
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
Couldn't spare a couple pubos, huh?

662
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,800
I'll watch you in the shower.

663
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
I know what you got going on down there.

664
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,600
You got bush to spare, dog.

665
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:11,840
I'm hungry.

666
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,160
I'm hungry.

667
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:12,480
I mean-

668
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,640
You got bush for days.

669
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,480
Tuck some of them sprigs in a tater.

670
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,640
Hi, welcome to Denny's.

671
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,400
Would you like to try our new sprigs in a tater?

672
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:21,780
No.

673
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,200
Welcome to Guy Fieri's Restaurant.

674
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,840
Guy Fieri's Restaurant.

675
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,480
Restaurant.

676
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,120
Try our sprigs in a tater.

677
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,520
Hey, what's up with these little hairs?

678
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,120
They're high lit on the end.

679
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:36,880
They're high lit on the end.

680
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,400
They've got goggles wrapped around them.

681
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
Yeah, that's how you know.

682
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
That's how you know it's authentic.

683
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
Authentic Fieri cuisine.

684
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,240
I'm Cameron Esposito, the host of Wham Bam Pow.

685
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,200
This is an action and sci-fi movie podcast on MaximumFun.org.

686
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,160
Talk about punching.

687
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,520
We talk about car chases.

688
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
We talk about arms.

689
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,880
Muscles that are on arms.

690
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,760
And every week I'm joined by panelist Rhea Butcher.

691
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,480
That's me.

692
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,120
And of course also Ricky Carmona.

693
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,080
Oh, I'm all up in it.

694
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,800
That's what's up.

695
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,920
The Afro Spokesman.

696
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,760
We are gonna give you all of the jokes and all of the happiness

697
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,960

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,120
and sci-fi films to the fullest.

Find it at MaximumFun.org or you can subscribe on iTunes.

700
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,880
I have been married for four years and my wife complained to me today

701
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
that I don't tell her she is pretty anymore.

702
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,840
I don't like saying the word pretty and I can't say beautiful

703
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
without sounding sarcastic.

704
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,760
What can I say to make my wife...

705
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,360
What can I say to my wife to convince her I still find her attractive?

706
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,440
That's from Still Sexy in Salt Lake.

707
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,600
Hey, you need to start saying pretty.

708
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,040
Just get over it.

709
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,520
How's that?

710
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,040
Actions speak louder than words.

711
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
So the action you have to do is saying these embarrassing words

712
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
to let your wife know how.

713
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,680
No, because it's true.

714
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
You're so pretty.

715
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,920
I don't know.

716
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
It doesn't sound good.

717
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,080
And I feel what they're saying.

718
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,840
Like, you look so beautiful.

719
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,280
I feel like a character in the room when I say that word.

720
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
Yeah, but the thing is, it ain't about you, dawg.

721
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,080
Like, I feel stupid saying this.

722
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,120
Well, okay.

723
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,680
Like, throughout time, that's like 60% of people in romantic stuff.

724
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,080
Watch.

725
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,160
Like, you do it because she wants you to.

726
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,960
Here's what you do.

727
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,080
You gotta watch the season premiere of any season of The Bachelorette

728
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,960
and listen to the adjectives that these fools drop.

729
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,440
They are-

730
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
They're gonna have so many different ones.

731
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,560
They are out of control.

732
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,360
Surprisingly, no.

733
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,880
There's only like two or three alternatives,

734
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,120
but they drop them every other sentence.

735
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,640
You look so stunning.

736
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,840
Doesn't she look stunning?

737
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,200
Look at how stunning she is.

738
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,840
Look at how stunting she is.

739
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
She's doing all kinds of sweet tricks.

740
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,920
Look how stunted she is.

741
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,400
She could be like 5'6", 5'7".

742
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,800
Look at her little nubby arms.

743
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,160
Look how stunned she is.

744
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,520
She's just sitting there, mouth agape.

745
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
She's just lying there on the floor

746
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,920
because she tried to steal a cop car.

747
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,720
That was a terrible idea.

748
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,640
Look how stumped she is.

749
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,800
That was a great riddle, I told her.

750
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,440
Look at how stumpled she is.

751
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,800
That's a word I just made up

752
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,160
because I'm afraid to say pretty.

753
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,720
Just say pretty.

754
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,600
Move on with your life.

755
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Say pretty.

756
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,520
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

757
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:23,840
Yes.

758
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,320
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

759
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,200
Thank you, Alan Black.

760
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user Andre who asks,

761
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,280
Nipples tweaked.

762
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
Why are guys tweaking my pecs?

763
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,520
Every since I've been working out,

764
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,920
I've developed a lot of chest and pectoral development.

765
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,080
Guys at the gym are tweaking my nipples

766
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,840
and I'm confused as to what that means.

767
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,400
Does it mean keep up the good work or something else?

768
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,600
Oh, he's probably got a sign taped to his back.

769
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,560
I've seen this before.

770
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,040
Tweak them.

771
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,240
Tweak them, please.

772
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:54,560
Tweak them.

773
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
Tweak them, I think.

774
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,160
If I don't have,

775
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,400
I haven't developed my chest and pectoral development much.

776
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,320
When you do that, like do your nipples get like super beefy?

777
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,240
I bet they could.

778
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,280
I bet that's an outcome.

779
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,240
There's probably that, you know, in all those muscle magazines.

780
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,680
I bet that's one of the articles.

781
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,520
Hey, Sam.

782
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,080
Sam, I just want to say your pecs are rocking

783
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,560
and your nips are super inviting.

784
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,520
Your nips are like, they're round like a pepperoncini.

785
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,640
They are winking at me.

786
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,280
You know what I mean?

787
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,360
The actual tipple is like plump, like a pencil eraser.

788
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,440
I guess what I'm saying is daddy likes.

789
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,480
I guess daddy likes.

790
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,640
I have to find out what's up.

791
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,120
I have to.

792
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,320
Do you mind if I just get it?

793
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,520
Like I've been trying to develop my own pectoral development

794
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,920
and like, but my nipples are just doing nothing.

795
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,440
And what's fucked up is that my pecs are getting so big

796
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,480
and so ripped, like two big juicy flank steaks.

797
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,920
My nipples are the same size that they were six years ago.

798
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
They're these little like nothing nubbins.

799
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,400
You know what I mean?

800
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,280
They look like little beady chameleon eyes on the tips.

801
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,240
But I'm looking at yours.

802
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,880
I'm looking at yours.

803
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,360
So you know what I see?

804
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
Yours like Mount Everest.

805
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,620
Perfect.

806
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,280
Perfect nipples.

807
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,080
Like Olympus rising above the Serengeti.

808
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,560
Am I right?

809
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,120
Mm hmm. Are you showing your nipples enough butt?

810
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,480
Because I think that that could really help to encourage their growth.

811
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,440
What are you talking about?

812
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,280
Who planted your nipples?

813
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,640
Were they redheaded and angry?

814
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,720
Show the nipples your buttocks.

815
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,560
If you can figure out how to show your nipples your own buttocks,

816
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,360
I think that you well, I don't know how your strength training is going,

817
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,360
but your flexibility training is out of control.

818
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,160
I think I need to go ahead and take the biggest loser off my DVR subscriptions.

819
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
I do not think I can watch this show anymore in good conscience.

820
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,040
All right, here's the thing.

821
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,000
Yahoo question is asking.

822
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,640
Your problem was the first time one of these dudes tweaked your nipples.

823
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,040
Why didn't you react strongly?

824
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,600
That is that is the unanswered question of this.

825
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,240
You don't want to make it.

826
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,440
You don't want to make a scene.

827
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,840
Well, but it seems like you just went, hmm, you're going to journal about this.

828
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,160
Listen, this is going to sound weird,

829
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,760
but the next time Craig walks by, you have to tweak his nipples.

830
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,040
The expression on his face is absolutely out of control.

831
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,480
It looks like he's eating a sour warhead.

832
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Um, how about another Yahoo since we're in?

833
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,360
Yeah, rapid fire.

834
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Ashley Burghardt.

835
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,000
Thanks, Ashley.

836
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,080
It's by Yahoo answers user Jared, who asks,

837
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,080
do people not realize McDonald's is not the only restaurant?

838
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,080
Burger King, Wendy's, Taco Bell are all across the street.

839
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,880
They were all dead on a night there was a home football game

840
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,320
and a car show you McDonald's had a long line and drive through

841
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,720
and standing room only in the lobby.

842
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
We had customers angry because they had to wait longer

843
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,920
than they wanted for their food.

844
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,160
Knowing how busy we were and short staffed.

845
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
There's those other restaurants.

846
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,920
Plus the car show and football game had concessions.

847
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:00,800
I want a McDonald's like a register clerk that chastises you for eating there.

848
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,640
Wow, really?

849
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,480
You couldn't have gotten some tacos at the game?

850
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:04,960
Oh, wow.

851
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,520
Okay.

852
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,000
With the Panera across the street, you're here, huh?

853
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,720
Huh?

854
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,280
Interesting.

855
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,000
Huh?

856
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,560
More than that.

857
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,120
I want to see, like, maybe there's a, like, his boss is like roaming Yahoo answers

858
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,240
and comes across this question.

859
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,680
It's like, Hey, Craig, Craig, I saw your post.

860
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,800
Um, do you not want us to hit goal this month?

861
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,360
Travis, I'm a small business owner.

862
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,520
So if you could just not capsize my investment, that would be fantastic.

863
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,840
This Ma and Pa McDonald's.

864
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,200
I've been trying to get it off the ground my entire life and I don't need you.

865
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
I don't need you sabotaging.

866
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,200
We have worked so hard to get here.

867
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,520
Build brand awareness and recognition.

868
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,080
Do you remember when we went through the whole litigation because we wanted to be

869
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,800
McDonald's with an extra in and they wouldn't let us?

870
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,480
Do you remember how angry everyone was when we didn't have hamburgers on the menu?

871
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,400
Remember our struggles that we've had to overcome?

872
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,560
We had those seasonal bratwurst for a while and I said, Hey, what if we make this the whole thing?

873
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,160
And we became McDonald's Bratwurst Depot and, and God, who knew that McDonald's was so litigious

874
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,360
to its own branches.

875
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,880
Folks, thank you so much for hanging out with us this week.

876
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,800
We hope you've had as much fun as we have.

877
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,760
Uh, I do want to let everybody know that, uh, Griffin brought me back toys from Japan

878
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,160
and included on them in those toys was this button that I could press to make this happen.

879
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,440
And it's a, it's a button that makes a Japanese man talk.

880
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:25,920
I'm sorry.

881
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,480
I didn't make it.

882
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,640
Better use of that during the program.

883
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,880
I'm going to try to do, but I mean, if the problem was that it's not particularly funny.

884
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,720
Griffin do the thing where you thank the guy for this stuff.

885
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,280
I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters.

886
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,080
I've been thanking him for every episode for maybe a hundred episodes.

887
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,000
So I can't believe Justin can't remember his name.

888
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,920
Um, but, but I John Roderick and the long winters.

889
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,640
Who's he?

890
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,560
I don't think you Ron Jodrick.

891
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,400
I want to thank John Tartrick and the long winters.

892
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,280
I know the band name.

893
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,120
God damn my aphasia, uh, for the use of our theme song.

894
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

895
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,640
Uh, it's a great band, great album.

896
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,160
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

897
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,000
Like Lindsay, Sarah Ingram, Holly L.

898
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,880
Peacock, Ben Sherman, Michael Collins, Corinne McShane, Schmoe Z, uh, dead.

899
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,240
Yell corpse Edo.

900
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,840
I don't think that's her actual name.

901
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,880
Uh, but, uh, thank you to everyone spreading the word.

902
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,680
Thanks for the short kind of weird, maybe a bit unpolished ep.

903
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,840
Now that all the weddings and traveling are done for like two fucking months.

904
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,760
This is a bonus.

905
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,040
This is a bonus episode.

906
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,160
I didn't know this was going to happen.

907
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,400
Uh, yeah, thanks for, thanks for sticking by us thick and thin.

908
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,200
We'll get it together.

909
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,320
We just got to stop getting married for like a second.

910
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,640
If we could just go one month without a wedding, that would be ideal.

911
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,400
Just want to remind everybody, uh, to, uh, stop by Hulu Plus.

We love them.

919
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,200
Thank you, Hulu.

920
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,120

Thanks TN.

It's by Yahoo answers user Hannah Kirkup.

923
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,320
Who asks using her real name?

924
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,800
I have diarrhea.

925
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,840
Should I go to college?

926
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,240
