1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Welcome to this very special episode of My Brother, My Brother, and Me. It's our Grammy

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,240
Awards 2014 special, My Name is Justin McElroy. My name is Travis McElroy. My name is Griffin

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,280
McElroy, and I know that sounded weird, but I'm just so excited. I know, I've got Grammy fever.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,160
Tonight we are going to be honoring some amazing achievement in the arts of butterscotch cookie

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,600
making, of ribbon candy placement, cheek kisses, cheek kisses, hair tousles, biggest purses,

10
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,960
oversized sweaters bought, most uncomfortable fabrics, weirdest smelling quilts, weirdest

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,480
smelling hair. Weirdest smelling house. Yeah, just a lot of weird, there's seven subcategories.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,080
A lot of weird smells, stainless bread. Okay, well that seems a little hateful.

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,720
Most, you know, the problem with the weird smell categories is most of them are handled off camera.

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
We don't even get to see those. They have like a special subceremony that like-

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
These awards are presented by Tom Wopat at a separate event.

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,520
It's always Tom Wopat, too. That's his hell. That's his, he did something,

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
and that's his punishment. He did something really bad. Guys, what

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
Grammys are you most excited about tonight? Where do you think the hot contingent's gonna be?

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,240
I think it's gonna be most spangly dressed. Spanglishly dressed? Is that-

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:18,240
Well, who's dressing with the most spangles? Who's got the most, you know, what am I looking

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,360
for here? Sequins. Travis is making a play for the most confused category. Sorry, Travis,

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,000
but that award has actually already been handed out by Mr. Wopat. Congratulations to Darlene Mecklen,

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,800
age 73. You really went for it this year. You have no idea why you get to hang out with Tom

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,280
Wopat every year. I think my favorite thing about the Grammys is, unlike other award shows,

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,080
it airs at like 3.30 in the afternoon. Yeah, that's really nice because you can

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,400
finish the whole award show and still have an early dinner. And boy, you thought Jacqueline

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,240
Bessette took a long time to get to the stage during the Golden Globes. You haven't- You ain't

28
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,320
seen nothing yet. Every procession to the stage lasts at least 20 to 25 minutes.

29
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,640
And it's like a race to who can get up there before they start playing the

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,960
get off the fucking stage meemaw music. It's never happened, but I hope to someday

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,360
hear a meemaw deliver a speech. Someone's going to get up, someone's going to train for that,

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,200
and she's going to get up there like right as the music starts and be like, nope, nope, booyah,

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,200
and then walk away. I'm really looking forward to the performance. I heard that this year

34
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,120
there's going to be a meemaw reading some Dr. Seuss. I'm really excited about it.

35
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,080
That's going to be really nice. Why is she doing that?

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,360
She's doing the first half of the places you'll go to her six-year-old grandson.

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
I like that. That's not funny. It's just nice.

38
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,800
Yeah. The weird thing is it won't be mic'd, so you won't be able to hear it.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,480
Okay. Let's shoot for just nice this episode. Okay.

40
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
You know what the bummer about the Grammys is actually, though?

41
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,080
Still, Meryl Streep always wins. She doesn't even have grandkids.

42
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:14,800
Also, the In Memoriam reel lasts three hours. Yeah, it's three hours long.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,960
Okay, this is a comedy advice show.

44
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,080
And they have to add some people in from the beginning of the awards show,

45
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,920
people that were on the red carpet and are now in the video.

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,080
That year that H1N1 was really bad, it actually wouldn't stop. They had to just cancel the show.

47
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
They just kind of leave it on in the background as they present all the awards.

48
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,280
Man, H1N1 took a lot of grandmas from it. So anyway, let's start with the show.

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,760
Let's get on with the comedy jokes. Man, that flu just fucking devastated our old people.

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,280
Speaking of Grammy fever.

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Man, they all drowned to death on their own mucus. Anyway, let's go ahead and get it rolling.

52
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Big wheel, keep on turning.

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Jokes and jokes and jokes.

54
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,280
That swine flu canceled a lot of Disneyland trips. Let's get this ball rolling.

55
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
Pack up the car, kids. We're going to Comedy Town.

56
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Grandma's not coming because she did a swine flu. Fuck, man. Wow.

57
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Yeah, a lot of them.

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
We could have talked about Bieber.

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I tried to tell you we should have talked about Bieber.

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
No, no, no. Let's talk about this devastating flu.

61
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Raise your hand if your grandma died in 2009. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Everyone, I guess.

62
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Oh, I'm sorry grandmothers.

63
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I've got a coworker who's a complete idiot.

64
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Nice guy, but total moron who's completely unable to perform even the smallest task on her own.

65
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
What's wrong?

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
You still laughing about that swine flu?

68
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm still thinking about dead grannies.

69
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
There's nothing funny about it.

70
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
He says laughing.

71
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,280
So the coworker's an asshole and once in a while he'll do something stupid.

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Everybody will fix it for him and say something like, I hope I didn't just look too stupid.

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
And our question asker tries to make him feel better about himself, but he's getting tired of it.

74
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:21,280
And he's trying to find a balance between supportive and making him feel dumb.

75
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,280
Doesn't want to be a jerk, but it's something even his 11-year-old could figure out.

76
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
That's from overly supportive in Ohio.

77
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
I paraphrase there because it's a long question, but you get the gist.

78
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Well, he's playing you.

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Oh, this is one of those you mow the lawn shitty one time your dad won't ask you to do it anymore type situations.

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
And even better because then he finishes it by going, I hope I didn't look stupid.

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
No!

82
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
No, you did great.

83
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
You're my big office worker boy.

84
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
You mowed your basketball number into our front yard.

85
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,280
So in terms of completion, not great, but you expressed yourself and that really matters.

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
So you think he's on the grift?

87
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,280
I think everyone's on the grift, but I think this person is on the grift spectrum, like leaning super hard into it.

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:23,280
So is the response not to try to correct this person, but somehow make yourself appear less capable than this person is?

89
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:36,280
So could you go stride into the boss's office, deliver the big report and then once you set it on his desk, you just dump a bucket of soapy water on it and go like, did I do that?

90
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,280
I wanted to clean it.

91
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I cleaned up your hard drive, boss.

92
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,280
And then you pour soapy water on his hard drive.

93
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Is it possible that your coworker is an 11 year old who has been big into an adult body?

94
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Oh, that is always, always your first inclination.

95
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
And you know what?

96
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
It's a good one because you're right most of the time.

97
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
You're right most of the time.

98
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
So here's what you need to do.

99
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:04,280
You just quarter him and you say like, Joshua, I know what's happened and we can fix this together.

100
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
I know where there's this ultamachine.

101
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,280
We'll get to it and we'll do this and let's do a secret handshake to prove that I know you're a kid.

102
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Yeah.

103
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Here, take this adult go-gurt and then you hand him an adult go-gurt.

104
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I think it's just Activia.

105
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I think it's just Activia, Griffin.

106
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,280
I wish they would make like, I love food in tubes, but I don't want all that colorful packaging.

107
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,280
I wish they had something a little more upscale, a little classier, maybe leather.

108
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,280
You know, I drink those yogurt smoothies because they have all the probiotics that my gurgle guts need,

109
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,280
but I don't get to squeeze it.

110
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I don't get to like force it into my...

111
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:53,280
I don't get to like recreate the peristalsis of an intestine as I just like sploosh the food glop into my mouth hole.

112
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,280
What if this guy has JAK disease?

113
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Oh, what if he has combination JAK disease and bigitis?

114
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
No, no, it's fine.

115
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
It's fine.

116
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm going to look like this in a couple years anyway.

117
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
No, it's okay.

118
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,280
So every one year I do eight, but then I also had to skip like nine through 36.

119
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,280
So like kind of a raw deal I'm getting here.

120
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm basically two.

121
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
I'm basically two years old is what I'm...

122
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I was born...

123
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
I wasn't born yesterday.

124
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I was born last Thursday.

125
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
I do have JAK and big.

126
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Yeah, I still have like a little bit of umbilical stumble down there.

127
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
But it's okay because I also have Benny Button.

128
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,280
So hold on, let me figure this out.

129
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,280
I was born at two, skip to 10, skip to 36.

130
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,280
I will be 45 next week and then 28 the week after that.

131
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Yeah, I think I figured that out.

132
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Basically the Highlander is so...

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:54,280
Look for that question on the SATs someday soon.

134
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:04,280
I mean, if someone is going to be a screw up and you're not their superior,

135
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
I think you just kind of have to lump it.

136
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
I mean...

137
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
No, Justin, you are wrong.

138
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
And I'll tell you why.

139
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Everybody's covering.

140
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Well, at least I got to state my whole point.

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,280
I can tell you really weighing all the pluses and minuses.

142
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Justin, you sounded like you were about to be wrong.

143
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
The problem is everybody's covering for the guy.

144
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
I didn't have a point either.

145
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Yeah, I mean, yes, but...

146
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,280
I understand that it's like you want to do it because you're not a terrible human being.

147
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
You don't want to see this person fail.

148
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:40,280
But at the same time, every time that you fix it for him without attention being brought to it,

149
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,280
you're not helping the dude because it sounds like he's not capable of doing this job.

150
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Yeah, but you are helping the dude.

151
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,280
By definition of helping the dude, you're covering his tracks constantly.

152
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
That's what help is.

153
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Making it so he never gets busted.

154
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,280
But what if he progresses rapidly and people are like, you know,

155
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,280
his boss who doesn't know any of this just sees the work he does.

156
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,280
And he's like, oh, okay, everything's turning out well.

157
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Promotion.

158
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,280
And then he runs that business into the ground and 100,000 people are laid off.

159
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
I think the best solution...

160
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
This is a big business.

161
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,280
What kind of overhead does this 100,000 employee business have?

162
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
They make adult go-gurt.

163
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,280
They're an Illuminati.

164
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Everybody has to help him run all of the conspiracies.

165
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Maybe the solution is somewhere in the middle of telling him what's wrong about it,

166
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,280
but making him make the corrections because that's probably the best way of helping him to learn.

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:46,280
And also, you're not going to have to do the work for him because I feel like after you explain to him

168
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:52,280
what the mistake is and have him corrected himself, then he has to sort of be responsible for his own product.

169
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:59,280
But I also would say, do you really want to be the George to this dude's Lenny for the rest of the time that he works there?

170
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,280
If it does culminate in an assassination, then...

171
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
This is probably not something you want to be a part of.

172
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Yeah, definitely not.

173
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
You guys want a Yahoo?

174
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
Please.

175
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,280
This Yahoo was sent in by Alan Black.

176
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Thanks, Alan.

177
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,280
It's by Yahoo!

178
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
And it's just user Taylor B. who asks,

179
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,280
has anybody been to the Guy Fieri show?

180
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,280
If you have, is it appropriate for younger children?

181
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
No.

182
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,280
My daughter is a huge fan of him, and we got some free tickets,

183
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,280
but I'm not sure if it's appropriate for her or not.

184
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Help, please.

185
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,280
You know, when you hear stuff like that, it always makes me remember that there are parents and authority figures in the world

186
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,280
that their kid said once when Guy Fieri was on TV and their mother was like,

187
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
don't you like this guy?

188
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, he's great, whatever.

189
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
And then went back to like reading their book,

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,280
and their mother just clicks in their head, huge Guy Fieri fan.

191
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
This lady loves Guy Fieri.

192
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,280
Got it.

193
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I'll remember that for next Christmas.

194
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Is the show...

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Get some of those Guy Fieri tickets.

196
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Is the Guy Fieri Road show appropriate for younger audiences?

197
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Is it TV PG?

198
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,280
If you leave at intermission, you're fine.

199
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Because after intermission...

200
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
At two is where it starts to get a little not safe for work.

201
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Before it starts, he's like, all right, is all the kids gone?

202
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
All right, fuck nuts.

203
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,280
Let's cook some food that's going to make you cry.

204
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Before I make these spare ribs, let me get my balls out.

205
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:33,280
And yes, they are bleached blonde and spiky.

206
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:42,280
This is a great time to remind parents that you have got to be cautious about exposing your children to Guy Fieri.

207
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:50,280
As they're too young, they can't process it, they think they're having fun, and they could get addicted.

208
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:58,280
You think this is a good thing for your kid to be into when he or she is a little kid,

209
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:06,280
but then when he's 14, his first day of high school, and he's wearing a visor, that one's on you.

210
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
That visor's on you.

211
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,280
I mean, it's on your kid, but morally it's on you.

212
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:18,280
I went looking for some more information about Guy Fieri's roadshow, trying to get a concrete answer to the question,

213
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,280
and I stumbled on Guy Fieri's Twitter account.

214
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Would anyone be interested in what he's been cooking up there on his Twitter feed?

215
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Is it covered in cracklins and bacon butter?

216
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Cooking it up big time for new season of Guy's Big Bite.

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
You're going to dig it.

218
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
Okay, that's pretty benign.

219
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
I feel like I ate that sentence.

220
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,280
Wait, Justin, could you say that again, but like he's sad about it?

221
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Cooking it up big time for a new season of Guy's Big Bite.

222
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,280
You're going to dig it.

223
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:59,280
Just hit Bentonville, Arkansas for a big Walmart meeting about Guy Fieri's sausages.

224
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,280
God, I swear to-

225
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Say it at a killer hotel.

226
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I swear to God, when you're doing it, maybe it's the impression or maybe it's the words that you're saying,

227
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,280
he has said big several times in both these treats.

228
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Just like all I'm hearing is just consonants, is all I'm hearing from you.

229
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle.

230
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Don't get a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle, pick a pickle.

231
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Yeah, it's funny.

232
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,280
There's a thing that happens in the human brain where you can leave out every fourth letter,

233
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
and people will still read it the same way.

234
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I think maybe that's just how Guy Fieri communicates with the world as a whole,

235
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:47,280
and we just as a people have been filling in the blanks, and it's a cry for help.

236
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Some friends of mine found my salsas in Roatan, Honduras.

237
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Dig it.

238
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,280
Is that a tweet?

239
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Does he have a secret stash of salsas in Roatan?

240
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,280
I think they're salsas that belong to him, I think they're salsas that he made.

241
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,280
They found my salsas and I had to kill them.

242
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,280
My secret salsa stockpile.

243
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Apparently, so Yahoo Answers user Alana answers,

244
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,280
it's supposed to be family friendly, but there are reports of body jokes in innuendos.

245
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,280
More from the flair bartender than from Guy Fieri.

246
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,280
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, this just in.

247
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Reports of body jokes in innuendos coming from the Guy Fieri Roadshow.

248
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,280
Strike team, assemble.

249
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,280
It's supposed to be family friendly, but there's a little bit of body.

250
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Film at 11.

251
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Freedom ain't free.

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,280
To all veterans, past, present, and future, thanks for your service.

253
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
What?

254
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
It wasn't really about food as much.

255
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I thought he said something about Fritos in the beginning.

256
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Fritos ain't free.

257
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Come buy me some.

258
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I'm so sad.

259
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Stoked to see my new line of sausages at Walmart.

260
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Check out the four killer flavors.

261
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
And then there's a picture of him with ZZ Top and the guys from Duck Dynasty.

262
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Perfect.

263
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,280
Perfection.

264
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm noticing lately I'm incredibly sensitive and insulted slash hurt easily.

265
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:24,280
For one instance, I have a friend who greets me by saying, fuck you.

266
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,280
And while I know he's joking, it still makes me feel better.

267
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Pretty good joke.

268
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Hey, great joke.

269
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Pretty good joke.

270
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Solid goof.

271
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

272
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,280
It worked on us, but we thought that Grammy thing was funny.

273
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,280
Also, if I go to Jack in the Box and the girls at the window don't greet me with a smile,

274
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I feel personally responsible.

275
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
How do I grow thicker skin?

276
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
And that's from Gabriel.

277
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,280
The first one is like, okay.

278
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Gabriel, you're here just in time.

279
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Nobody owes you a smile.

280
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You need to get over the idea that people owe you smiles.

281
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Awesome.

282
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,280
No one at Jack in the Box is ever happy to see someone roll.

283
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,280
If anything, they're disappointed in you.

284
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,280
They have to paint that smile on the Jack in the Box mascot every day because just the

285
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,280
fumes from the fryer just like peel it off.

286
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,280
That is how sad that restaurant wants you to be.

287
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,280
Oh, Gabriel, you have got to start loving yourself a little more.

288
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,280
You have got to start having a little more time, a little more consideration, a little

289
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,280
more energy put into Project Gabriel, which sounds sweet now that I say it.

290
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
I mean, it sounds like you're saying you need to have more frequent jerk sessions.

291
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I don't mean, I don't mean frequent jerks.

292
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Find the time for Gabriel time.

293
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,280
Make the time every day at noon 15.

294
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:52,280
I don't see how the first time your friend says fuck you, if it bothers you, you tell

295
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
him.

296
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
If it doesn't bother you so much and you want to say friends with him, you tell him fuck

297
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
you back.

298
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Or just sort of hurt him.

299
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Just let that one ride.

300
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,280
And that seems like a situation that will sort of sort itself out because you do you

301
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,280
get pulled over by a cop like, oh, fuck you, officer.

302
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,280
What do you need?

303
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
License and registration?

304
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
All right.

305
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Let me get that for you.

306
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,280
Fuck you real quick.

307
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
All right.

308
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Here you go.

309
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
I really you can't.

310
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Gabriel, right now you have what was called an external locus of control.

311
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,280
You're handing over everything about your demeanor and your mindset.

312
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,280
You're putting it in the hands of other people.

313
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,280
And I guarantee you when you do that, it is always it is never going to pan out because

314
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,280
the world's never going to care as much about your own feelings as you do.

315
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,280
You have got to first off, take time and build your self-confidence a little bit.

316
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Think about all the things that are great about you, because I know there are many places

317
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
you excel.

318
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,280
And then once you once you've done that, start focusing on how you can make other people's

319
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,280
days brighter rather than how those people are making you feel.

320
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Because I guarantee you once you start putting energy into that, it is going to come back

321
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
on you several fold.

322
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
That's it.

323
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
That's the only way to go through it.

324
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,280
Because you're just you're like a beautiful plastic bag floating through the air whimsically

325
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:22,280
just hoping no one, you know, films you, films you, sells it, sells it to Sam Mendes to use

326
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
it as movie.

327
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
You don't want that.

328
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
No.

329
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Let me throw this out.

330
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Maybe you snap.

331
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,280
Okay.

332
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,280
And your friends like, fuck you.

333
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
Like, no, fuck you.

334
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Smack him in the face.

335
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,280
And when the girls the dragon box don't smile at you, you walk inside and go, why didn't

336
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
you smile at me?

337
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Why didn't you smile at me?

338
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Are you not happy to give me burgers and tacos?

339
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,200
Listen, you work at a restaurant where I could get burgers and tacos in the same box.

340
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,840
Like how does the farce of that should make you so happy?

341
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,800
I'm just saying, turn it into like a Nicholas Cage movie.

342
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,520
Have you not seen your own commercials?

343
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,920
They're hilarious.

344
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't get, I don't get to see those cause we don't have any Jack in the Boxes here.

345
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,560
If you want, I can like DVR them.

346
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Can you DVR them?

347
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,000
I can just describe them to you on the show.

348
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,320
Can you just tape them, Trav, and then like get a whole tape together of them and then

349
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
just mail them the tape?

350
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Yeah.

351
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,200
Jack in the Box sells a dinner box cause everything does come in boxes there, true to name.

352
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,080
That is like, I think it's even called like the 4am box and it is for mega chiefers.

353
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:32,160
It is for people that have been sucking down the saltiest spliffs and they do not hide

354
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
it.

355
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,480
It is for, it's basically like two dudes sitting on a couch just like taking a bong hit and

356
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:44,600
then like blowing the smoke into their 4am box and then just like drinking down a taco.

357
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,360
No, I have not seen these ads.

358
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm assuming you're exaggerating a little bit, but.

359
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,080
They definitely do the bong rips.

360
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,680
And at one point the dude takes off the giant white ball Jack in the Box helmet thing and

361
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,720
just smoke pours out of the bottom and just pours out of it.

362
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,320
It's been Snoop the whole time.

363
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Yeah.

364
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,560
He is not as into marijuana as he once was.

365
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,480
It's part of his reform, part of his reformation.

366
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I didn't know this.

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Thank you for the update.

368
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Yeah.

369
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,520
Gabriel, you're great.

370
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,960
You have great taste in podcasts.

371
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,980
I know that.

372
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,180
You have a cool name.

373
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
There's that.

374
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,760
There's lots of other good stuff about you.

375
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,480
Focus on that stuff and don't worry so much about how other people are making you feel

376
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,440
and stop with the Jack in the Box thing.

377
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,440
That's just nutty.

378
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Yeah.

379
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,880
Those people have to work at Jack in the Box and every time you see them they know they're

380
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,680
about to hurt you with food.

381
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,960
Like that's a double thing that they have to overcome.

382
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
You have to be a little more generous.

383
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
You have to be a little more generous.

384
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
They should be awash with their regret.

385
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Yeah.

386
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I'm so sorry about this.

387
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I'm sorry about this.

388
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,880
If it were up to me, I wouldn't hand this to you.

389
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I care about you.

390
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,740
Hey, how about a Yahoo?

391
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,120
This Yahoo was sent in by Amanda Thatcher.

392
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Thanks, Amanda.

393
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessie, who asks.

394
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,560
How to make your own hot dog.

395
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,280
How do I make my own hot dog?

396
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,080
I would like to make a beef hot dog that is nine feet long and try to eat it in one sitting.

397
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,320
Also I need instructions on how to make a nine foot long bun also.

398
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,240
Any suggestion, fellow hot dog lovers?

399
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,120
All right.

400
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,140
You can like human centipede it.

401
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,920
You're going to have to take a mulligan on the bun.

402
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,200
You are not going to be able to make a nine feet bun.

403
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,320
You're going to have to make a long, long, long hot dog and then put several buns on

404
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
it.

405
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
There's no way around.

406
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Or get a bun.

407
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,260
Bun step one, go to Subway and buy nine foot long, just the bread.

408
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,000
That would be so fucking gross, Travis.

409
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Think about what you're saying.

410
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,280
Think about how big and robust those delicious Subway rolls are and then imagine like a tiny

411
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
little wiener.

412
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,640
Well, I really just want to see the look on the people at Subway's face and you go, I

413
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,120
would like nine of the Italian herb, please.

414
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Okay.

415
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
What kind of sandwich?

416
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
No.

417
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
No.

418
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
You don't understand me.

419
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
I just, and I do need them cut down the middle, please.

420
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,780
That's a pretty good idea, Travis.

421
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,040
I wish you could buy hot dog buns at the store.

422
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Well, no.

423
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
No.

424
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,580
Guys, I wish there was a place where you could get bread except for Subway.

425
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,240
Why did we ever give them the monopoly on bread sales?

426
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,280
Rachel made some banana bread yesterday and a lawyer came to our house, issued a cease

427
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,240
and desist right there on the spot.

428
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,240
Took the bread away.

429
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,120
Travis, Travis, you do some gross cooking.

430
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,320
Have you ever tried to make your own hot dog?

431
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:34,240
Would you ever consider making your own hot dog?

432
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,520
I know that there are people in this world that like make their own sausage.

433
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
Yeah, but I know you don't want to see that.

434
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,000
Sausage comes from somewhere.

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,200
There is a reason we use the phrase, this is how the sausage gets made.

436
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,560
There's a reason why, because it's gross as balls.

437
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,100
You don't want to make your own hot dog because you have to see it.

438
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:01,040
The only way to make it, and listen, if you think it doesn't bother you, okay, so eating

439
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:08,720
hot dogs, what it really is is a test of your own mental acuity and your ability to distract

440
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
yourself from facts.

441
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,880
As you snap into a hot dog and you taste that juicy, beefy flavor, you are swept away by

442
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:23,520
the taste, and then you think, okay, I have five inches or so left of this hot dog, and

443
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm in a race to keep from remembering how hot dogs are made and the things that are

444
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,560
in them and the things I would never know are in them.

445
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,120
It's like 75% toenails, right?

446
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah.

447
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Yeah, at least when you're doing like a bratwurst, like Italian sausage, it's like, okay, I know

448
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
that that's me.

449
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
I know what that is.

450
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,680
I guess, Travis, you're not a part of this conversation.

451
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,520
This is a conversation for fellow hot dog lovers only, so if you're going to want to

452
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,480
try and like go outside the box, then maybe you should excuse yourself.

453
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,160
It's weird that I have to realize that a hot dog is the kind of food that the bigger it

454
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,440
is, the more, like it's exponentially more disgusting.

455
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,520
That's what I'm saying.

456
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:05,860
I'm saying nine feet in by like by three feet, the reality of hot dogs is going to be soaking

457
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,120
into you from every angle.

458
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,320
Like your stomach will be so full of hot dog and all you'll be able to think about is like

459
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,800
that giant crazy grinder that they just throw whatever meat related products they can find

460
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
into it.

461
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Meat adjacent.

462
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Just meat adjacent.

463
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,800
Hey, uh, dog, do rocks have protein?

464
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I don't know.

465
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,800
I don't know.

466
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
Just throw it in.

467
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
We made it to eight and a half feet and we're out.

468
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
What do we got?

469
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Hey, a pig.

470
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Hey, a pig looked at this chair.

471
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,680
Yeah, throw that chair right in the grinder.

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,400
Hand me that stack of invoices.

473
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,960
I did not know you guys were so cavalier about hating hot dogs.

474
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
I don't.

475
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,000
What I'm saying, Griffin, is that some things you have to just eat them and not think about

476
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,160
it too much.

477
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
It's about distraction.

478
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,600
And I'm saying you're going to lose the distraction game if you are eating nine feet of hot dogs.

479
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,640
Unless, unless you're fucking Kobayashi.

480
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
Okay.

481
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:11,440
I bet that dude could drain a niner in, I would say, probably 80 seconds.

482
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,040
It's like you walk by in your kitchen and you're like, where's that nine foot hot dog

483
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
I made for myself?

484
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I literally just made it.

485
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
It took me a week.

486
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
And you look over and Kobayashi's just like burping.

487
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,720
He's like, I didn't even know what I was doing.

488
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,160
Do you think because it's so long, there's no table that can fit it and here I have to

489
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,280
put it on the ground and then he'd also have to lay on the ground and it would look kind

490
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
of like Pac-Man?

491
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Yeah.

492
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Just like walk, walk, walk, walk.

493
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
It would look like he's doing the worm.

494
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,280
Don't you think it would be cool if there's a nine foot hot dog and one end was Scooby

495
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,960
Doo and the other end was Shaggy and they like ate it.

496
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,800
Oh, and you put like a dab of ketchup right in the center and it's you race to the ketchup.

497
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,200
Then they kind of kissed and they're like, whoa, that was an accident, but then they

498
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
kind of liked it.

499
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Do you want to do it again?

500
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Yeah.

501
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,760
And then they just kind of keep kissing and then Fred's there and he's like, you guys

502
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,760
keep going and I'll just snap some pictures.

503
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,840
I got a Scooby snack for you and then he does touch himself.

504
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,620
There is no way you're going to be able to transport a nine foot long hot dog and have

505
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,680
it maintain structural integrity without several people having their hands on it.

506
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Like no question, right?

507
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:21,480
You can buy 10 foot PVC pipe at Home Depot so you just need to construct some kind of

508
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,200
tubular carrying device.

509
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
You know what you need?

510
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:34,400
It's a coffin, it's just a big coffin and you lay the big hot dog down in it and then

511
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
you can dress it.

512
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
It'll be like one of those little paper trays that they give you at the ballpark with the

513
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,000
hot dog, but it's giant and then you can go ahead and eat it and then you just lie right

514
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,520
down in it because then you're done.

515
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Because then you're done.

516
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,400
That's your last accomplishment.

517
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,080
You're inducing the end of your life, but hey, what a way to go, you know what I mean?

518
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,360
How come Kevorkian never thought of jamming a nine foot hot dog?

519
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
I watched it drift off.

520
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,200
The head says, I can't believe I ate the whole thing and then died.

521
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,200
It is your right.

522
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,600
I believe to end your life however you see fit and in your case, I believe the best approach

523
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,400
would be to slam one of these juicy ballpark frags.

524
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,320
Just slam, not just one, a niner.

525
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
A niner.

526
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Listen.

527
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
I know a guy.

528
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,720
I know a guy.

529
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,520
He can make you a niner.

530
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,680
All you do is drain it, do it fast enough, and the pain is over.

531
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,640
The pain is just beginning, but your death will soon follow, so it wasn't a huge deal.

532
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,920
You're at foot six like, Doc, I don't know if I can do it.

533
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,840
You got to push through, baby.

534
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Sweet release on the other end.

535
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,760
And he's saying, do it, Adam, for Man vs. Food.

536
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,820
Do it.

537
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,240
This week on the series finale of Man vs. Food and also Adam.

538
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,400
Adam's finale of the series of his life.

539
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,400
And today, food won.

540
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's go to the money zone.

541
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:15,400
At everybody's part of Hulu.com, Hulu.com is a staple.

542
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,860
It's probably everybody's homepage at this point, but Hulu Plus is beyond that.

543
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,620
It's beyond Hulu.com.

544
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:27,280
If there was something better, if it was Hulu 2, the sequel to Hulu.com, it would be Hulu

545
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,280
Plus.

546
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,000
You can watch thousands of shows all from your living room or on your smartphone or

547
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
your tablet.

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,200
They've got movies, too.

549
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,560
And there's tons of shows, like SNL, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, man, I love Shark

550
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Tank.

551
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Do you guys love Shark Tank?

552
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,800
I know we talk about it sometimes, but I love Shark Tank.

553
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,320
I like watching snake oil salesmen just get fucking screwed.

554
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,280
Mark Cuban really took down that guy that was selling a diet pill.

555
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,280
They've also got Lost, Law & Order, SVU, Doctor Who, Community.

556
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:06,280
There's so many things, and there's new shows that they just made up.

557
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,400
There's original shows that you can't watch anywhere else, like The Wrong Man's and Behind

558
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,360
the Mask, which is a documentary series about mascots, super fascinating.

559
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,240
It's $8 a month, but you know you're not gonna pay that here.

560
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,280
This is my brother, my brother, and me.

561
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,160
For those first two weeks, you're not gonna pay eight bucks, you're not gonna pay seven,

562
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,040
and you're not even gonna pay six, like you may all be thinking.

563
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,640
But they're also not gonna pay you money.

564
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,280
It just balances out in the middle.

565
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
Okay, listen.

566
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,680
We're gonna be straight up with you.

567
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,160
There's a lot of numbers you're not gonna pay.

568
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,520
There's so many numbers, and you're not gonna pay any of them.

569
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
750?

570
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
No.

571
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Stop wasting our time?

572
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
No.

573
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Stop wasting our time.

574
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,920
Guys, what I'm prepared to offer you, I'm a representative of Hulu.com, I'm prepared

575
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,560
to offer you, if it's acceptable for those first two weeks, the price of $2 for the first

576
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
two weeks.

577
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
What do you think?

578
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Huh, audience?

579
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
How's that sound?

580
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
$2 a week?

581
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
No!

582
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Lower!

583
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Not good enough.

584
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Okay.

585
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Gosh, I don't know.

586
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
I'm gonna get in trouble with this guy back at the home office.

587
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Can you just say the price of a thing?

588
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,520
We've just been doing this for so, it's free, it's free, it's free.

589
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,960
Can we also get some, like, rope, and maybe some kind of, like, knife and sharpening device?

590
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Uh, yes.

591
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,240
I'll give you a knife sharpener and the car wax and HuluPlus.com for the first two weeks

592
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
for free.

593
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,360
Just go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and get that free trial.

594
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,760
I guess a little editor's note, they won't give you rope and car wax.

595
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
Probably not.

596
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,240
Well, I mean, ask.

597
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,520
Travis, were you trying to think of, like, one of the add-on gadgets that they'd give

598
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,920
away on Amazing Discoveries and you came up with rope?

599
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,960
There was always rope.

600
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,840
It was always, like, I'm gonna throw in this, like, clothesline.

601
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,520
I shit you not, I'm not, it was, like, everywhere.

602
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,000
And we'll throw in this rope.

603
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
More!

604
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,440
Well, obviously more.

605
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,120
Going on way too long and that HuluPlus ad sure made me hungry.

606
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
Mm-hmm.

607
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,120
Does anybody have any solutions for that?

608
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,560
You gonna eat something?

609
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,480
Can I recommend a nine-foot hot dog?

610
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,200
Okay, I don't, I don't need all those, all that stuff in there.

611
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:24,520
All the, like, CBC and DMT and PVP, DMX, JTT.

612
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,600
I don't need to eat a hot dog made of Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

613
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,480
Thank you for offering, Jonathan, a hot dog made from your body.

614
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,960
You are the giving tree of humans, but I am not interested.

615
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,080
What I am interested in is that nature box.

616
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,200
Listen, Jesse, you said you're gonna lose weight this new year.

617
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,040
Let me tell you straight up, you've been doing a pretty shitty job of it so far.

618
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Okay.

619
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,120
I don't care if you have actually lost weight, you can do it better by eating healthier food.

620
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,600
So instead of going to that vending machine, pressing that J5 to get, like, a pack of Starbursts

621
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,820
and that's lunch, no, you can snack smarter with a nature box.

622
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,040
It's a box that gets delivered to you, filled with great tasting and healthy snacks sent

623
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
right to your door.

624
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:14,440
So when you say healthy snacks, you mean like that, like a celery wrapped in carrots?

625
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,160
No, yes, that's exactly what, it's a celery wearing a carrot bow tie.

626
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,600
No, how about French toast granola?

627
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Yum.

628
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,640
How about a salted caramel pretzel pop?

629
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,480
Every word that I just said in that, in those four words, salted, yes.

630
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Salted caramel, pretzel, sure, pops, my favorite food delivery form.

631
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,280
Dark cocoa almonds, whatever.

632
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,440
They have them and they will fill you up in your guts and they will leave you satisfied

633
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
and healthy.

634
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,320
They probably really screw you on the shipping though, right?

635
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,640
Oh, God, Travis.

636
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,680
Did you read the fucking talking points?

637
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,920
I can't read.

638
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
It's free shipping.

639
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,800
Because you know why?

640
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Nature's free shipping.

641
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,120
If an acorn falls out of a tree, the tree's not like, that'll be $1.99 for Express Post.

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,280

663
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
How do I get out there?

664
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,680
How do I turn my body into hot dogs?

665
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,760

667
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,520
I'm Barbara Gray and I'm weird for beards.

668
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm Tess Barker and I have good tastes and bad ideas.

669
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,440
I'm Brandi Posey and I've been dead the whole time.

670
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,720
We're Lady2Lady, a new podcast on maximum fun.

671
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,720
It's the three of us girls, a fourth girl that we invite to come hang out with us and

672
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,520
sometimes characters that drop in.

673
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
We're weird.

674
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
We're fun.

675
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
We're here.

676
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
We're queer.

677
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
We're here.

678
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
We're queer.

679
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
We're queer.

680
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
We're queer.

681
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
We're queer.

682
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
We're queer.

683
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
We're queer.

684
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
We're queer.

685
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
We're queer.

686
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
We're weird.

687
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
We're enjoy.

688
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
We're queer.

689
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
We're here.

690
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
We're queer.

691
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
You're confused.

692
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
We're weird.

693
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
We're fun.

694
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
We're here.

695
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
We're queer.

696
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
We're here.

697
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
We like beer.

698
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
You can find us on iTunes or Maximumfun.org.

699
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
See you soon.

700
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
And this next message is for Brent.

701
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
I'm gonna go with Tigalore.

702
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
Tigalore.

703
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,500
And it's from Alison and Alison says, Happy 30th birthday sweet cans.

704
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Love you more than pickles.

705
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I don't...

706
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
It's pretty huge.

707
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,200
I mean, if Alison likes pickles.

708
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,580
If Allison does not like pickles,

709
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,620
this is in no way flattering.

710
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,940
I'm not, I'm just not okay with her

711
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,140
sort of objectifying his body.

712
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,200
Wait, what are?

713
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,740
No, he's into canning.

714
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh, maybe that's it.

715
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,980
He cans a lot of his own like fruits.

716
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,500
He makes sweet cans.

717
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,140
Cans are like breasts, right?

718
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,060
No, it's buttocks.

719
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,220
It's buttocks.

720
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,300
Oh, is it?

721
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,860
I thought so.

722
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,680
See, that's the thing.

723
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,620
I think it's like a blanket term

724
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,380
that can be anything that you find good.

725
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:46,660
Sweet can.

726
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,980
Sweet cans is like your individual butt cheeks.

727
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,420
The only way Griffin would be comfortable

728
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,380
with objectifying Brent is if the object

729
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,520
she's turning him into is a hot dog.

730
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,360
Right.

731
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,180
He seems very big on that.

732
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,720
And if the person is specifically Jonathan Taylor Thomas,

733
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,500
whose waxy skin is really capable of casing in those meats

734
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,100
and like really keeping them there.

735
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,820
Nine feet long, you gotta worry about like structural issues.

736
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,380
JTT's tallowy, tallowy stretchy skin

737
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,780
will just wrap right around there.

738
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,500
And that is a crispy bite.

739
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,940
So happy birthday, Brent.

740
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,740
It's all downhill.

741
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,580
I mean, it's not bad skin.

742
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,140
It's just like-

743
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,340
I recently got married.

744
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,260
It's some solid skin.

745
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,100
You know what I mean?

746
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,220
He's a very shiny individual.

747
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,500
I recently got married.

748
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,820
And I hope that the two newlywed McElroys

749
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,020
and one veteran can help me out.

750
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,380
I am having trouble getting used to my wedding ring.

751
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,580
It starts off fine, but after 15 minutes,

752
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,260
it drives me crazy.

753
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,180
I've never worn rings or watches before.

754
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,020
This is a new thing for me.

755
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,780
Please, how do I get used to this permanent addition

756
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,620
to my hand?

757
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,520
That's from David.

758
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,280
David, here's a story.

759
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,820
I used to be just like you.

760
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,900
I would take off my ring to sleep because it drove me crazy.

761
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,940
I would take off the ring to shower because,

762
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,760
I don't know, it seemed like the thing to do.

763
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,600
And when I was on my-

764
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,580
I would take off my ring to cruise chicks.

765
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,700
I would definitely take off my ring to cruise babes.

766
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,780
I left my ring on the toilet.

767
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,220
And this was when I was on my honeymoon.

768
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,460
I left my ring on the toilet.

769
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,840
And then my wife and I were walking around London.

770
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,740
She said, do you feel like you forgot anything?

771
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,140
And I said, no.

772
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,500
And then she had my wedding ring.

773
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,580
And I thought, well, I cannot be trusted

774
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,420
to take this thing off.

775
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,140
So I'm just gonna have to lump it.

776
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,820
And I don't know how long it took, just a few weeks,

777
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,420
but it feels pretty natural now.

778
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,900
I'm pretty much used to it.

779
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,820
Did you take your ring off to sleep

780
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,020
in case you had a dream fantasy

781
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,900
where you had sex with the cartoon MC Scat Cat

782
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,420
and it'd be adultery otherwise?

783
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:55,500
So you sort of take the ring off for protection?

784
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
I'm just a tremendous honey

785
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,180
that needs specific sleep conditions

786
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,660
that even the slightest temperature variation-

787
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,460
Oh my, it was the proverbial pee under your mattress.

788
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,300
Yeah, it's not.

789
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,340
Yeah, you're not that far off.

790
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,540
But anyway, now I never take it off

791
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,620
and I'm completely used to it.

792
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,860
I have to take off my wedding ring when I work

793
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,180
for the horrifying phenomenon known as gloving

794
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,480
that can happen when working with machinery

795
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,180
and construction where something catches your ring

796
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,540
and then tears the skin off of your finger

797
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,000
in one whole piece like a glove.

798
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,860
Danny Glover comes in and bites your finger off

799
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,680
if you're working around large pieces of machinery

800
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,340
because he is very scared of those.

801
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,860
For me, it gets in the way of my gaming time

802
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,260
because I need to be pretty dexterous with these digits

803
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,920
if I'm playing in the competitive StarCraft circuit.

804
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,420
My APM, that's actions per minute,

805
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,580
really do diminish if I have this big clunky,

806
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,740
it's basically a handcuff for your finger.

807
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,180
And I just find it really hard to stay

808
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,460
at the top of the ladder.

809
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,540
Are you guys used to wearing rings by now?

810
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,180
Travis, you've worn rings I think from time to time before

811
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,340
but Griffin, are you pretty comfortable with it?

812
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:13,140
One time I bought a ring that was just like

813
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,100
a little tribal fire thing.

814
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,740
I did buy that at Hot Topic and I wore that,

815
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,820
I think actually on my wedding ring finger

816
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,820
so that actually sort of eased me into this process.

817
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,200
I don't think I ever bought anything

818
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,380
at Hot Topic I'm proud of now.

819
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,220
You seem pretty proud of it in that story.

820
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,540
Like you didn't shy away from it at all.

821
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,540
I bought a sweet tribal fire ring that I wore with,

822
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,220
I know you're wondering, Griffin, did you wear this

823
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,460
at the same time as the goggles that you also bought

824
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,020
from Hot Topic and the answer to this is yes.

825
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,220
Yes, because there's no such thing as too much look.

826
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,700
Don't let the fashion police convince you

827
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,620
that there's such a thing as too much look.

828
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,220
That's a lie.

829
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,460
I probably would be more used to wearing my wedding ring

830
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:07,780
if I would remember to put it back on.

831
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,180
Because I have to take it off when I go on stage

832
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:13,460
for Hamlet because my character is not married.

833
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,020
And at this point I have three wedding rings

834
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,680
because I am prone to losing things

835
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,420
so I have three separate ones

836
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,500
and I have left all of them at the theater.

837
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,340
Perfect.

838
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,200
Yeah, so I'm really nailing it on this whole ring game.

839
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,780
You know what I mean?

840
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:33,780
So far to sum up our advice from Justin,

841
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,000
from Justin, like it or lump it.

842
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,740
From Griffin, go back in time, buy a ring at Hot Topic

843
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,580
and wear it.

844
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,780
From Travis, eh, screw it.

845
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,300
Just as long as no one notices.

846
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,500
Yeah.

847
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,100
Can you wear all three rings, Trav?

848
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
What?

849
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,820
Just turn your finger in like a big roll of Lifesavers?

850
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:54,500
You could, oh, what if you just tattooed a ring

851
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,860
on your finger?

852
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,220
I love that.

853
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,700
No, I'm sure there are people that do that.

854
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,460
Isn't it weird how if you wear one ring

855
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,540
it salts your game, but if you wear many rings,

856
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,900
you're Mystery and the Pickup Artist and you're great,

857
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,500
your game is great again.

858
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Are you suggesting that Mystery has great game?

859
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,380
What I'm saying to you is that.

860
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,640
What game is he good at?

861
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,820
I'll tell you what game he's bad at, StarCraft,

862
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:25,820
because you really need to have light hands.

863
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,860
I just moved out two months ago with a new roommate,

864
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,580
a friend of mine, not a stranger,

865
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,780
and things are going great.

866
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,020
He's a tidy dude who spends a lot of nights

867
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,580
out of the apartment, sorry,

868
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,740
but when we do cross paths,

869
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,180
our interactions are totally pleasant.

870
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,780
A few months before we moved in together,

871
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,940
I started dating someone

872
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,460
and things have rapidly gotten serious between us.

873
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,420
Although I think it's a big step to take after four months,

874
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,460
we would like to be living together.

875
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,280
The question is would I be a jerk if I moved out right now

876
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,500
after a roommate and I basically finished unpacking,

877
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,680
or is there a certain amount of time

878
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,860
I should wait before I bail?

879
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:57,780
We have a one-year lease,

880
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,980
but I don't think it'll be hard to find someone

881
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,940
to take it over.

882
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,880
What is the best way to bring up

883
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,260
that I suddenly wanna move out

884
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,660
so he doesn't think I'm a flake forever?

885
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,860
That's from a mover, not a shaker.

886
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,200
You've already answered your question

887
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,400
and the appropriate amount of time to wait is one year,

888
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,300
so the lease is over.

889
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,380
I feel like it's fine if you,

890
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:19,440
I feel like you have to tell your friend that like,

891
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,360
hey, I'm about to do something rash,

892
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,460
but it's not gonna be so rash

893
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,340
that I'm not gonna give you time to handle it.

894
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,500
Can you try to find another roommate?

895
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,580
Like, I don't,

896
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,860
listen, I'ma fuck you.

897
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,700
That's just how it is.

898
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,740
Like, that's just how it is,

899
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,300
matters of the heart. I'ma fuck you right now.

900
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,780
But I can fuck you less.

901
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,340
It's gonna suck for you. You can lighten the load.

902
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:43,620
You can lessen the burden.

903
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,460
You tell me if I'm being a butthole.

904
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,620
Okay.

905
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:47,580
I think.

906
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,420
Probably.

907
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,260
Yes, you are.

908
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,080
Okay, great.

909
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,260
Listen, Teresa and I moved in together after four months

910
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:55,940
because both of our leases were ending

911
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,820
and it was either that or like get two separate apartments

912
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,820
and spend the whole time in each other's houses.

913
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,020
So I don't know that it's necessarily about the time

914
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,100
so much as it is the inconvenience to me

915
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,660
of like, I completely get wanting to,

916
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,000
but there's no impetus to do it that quickly.

917
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,720
So why not plan on doing that

918
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,320
and then do it when your lease is up?

919
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,420
That's like, to me, that makes perfect sense.

920
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,740
How is that even butthole-y at all?

921
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,980
Yeah, that's the thing is like, you wanna do it, great.

922
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,740
So plan on doing it

923
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,500
and then do it when your lease is up.

924
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,220
Like if you feel that you have to rush it so fast,

925
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,120
that's, you know, there's no need to rush it.

926
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,060
If it's true love and you mean something, then wait.

927
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,380
You're also rushing a great part of the dating process.

928
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,220
I mean.

929
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,580
The terrifying indecision

930
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,280
where you think you wanna move in with a person,

931
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,340
but you think about like the first time

932
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,660
you walk in on them pooping

933
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,900
and what that is going to do to your whole dynamic.

934
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,980
Teresa and I have lived together for four and a half years.

935
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,920
Now I am more married and that still has not happened

936
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,540
because we are very careful.

937
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,380
Yeah.

938
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,340
There's a whole airlock system if you move through the rooms

939
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,820
and you call out from room to room,

940
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,420
I'm 10 feet away, I'm five feet away.

941
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,940
We have a system of bells.

942
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,700
It's basically a hand bell

943
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,500
like you would use in a hand bell choir

944
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,420
and while you're pooping,

945
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,980
you have to constantly be ringing it.

946
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,860
My wife has never done that.

947
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:18,300
So I don't know, it's not a problem for us.

948
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,140
That is true.

949
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,580
That is a weird medical condition that Sydney has,

950
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,700
which she does not number two.

951
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,540
She doesn't. She doesn't.

952
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,360
She doesn't remind me of frequent.

953
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,380
But you really, if you look at all the facts,

954
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,860
this isn't like you can't be with this person.

955
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,460
Like if this was a grand act of romance

956
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,780
where you had to break your lease

957
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,020
to follow a person across the country,

958
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,340
I think it would be rash but necessary.

959
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:43,740
Right now what you're doing is just it's rash

960
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,180
and it could be hurtful

961
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,000
and it would be really hard to walk back

962
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,660
if it doesn't pan out.

963
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,860
After like another eight months,

964
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,180
assuming you started dated when your lease began,

965
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,580
it's kind of hard to figure that out.

966
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,860
I mean, I think you're in a good situation.

967
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,700
Like run with it.

968
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,700
You need to appreciate this unicorn that you've ensnared

969
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:09,080
in the form of a roommate

970
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,940
that is not just an absolute shithead.

971
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,700
Also scientifically speaking,

972
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,340
or rather statistically speaking,

973
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,420
by month six of living with this roommate,

974
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,420
it is undeniable that you would do anything to fuck them.

975
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,260
Like you, things are going good now.

976
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,260
I'm really happy to hear it.

977
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,620
You will hate this person.

978
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:37,640
Okay, so when you said fuck then.

979
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,900
No, I mean you will hate this person in two months,

980
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:43,020
guaranteed, no question about it.

981
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,020
No one has ever lived with someone

982
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,060
that they weren't like dating or married to

983
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:49,980
that has not wanted the other person

984
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:52,820
to in some small way die.

985
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,620
So if you just wait,

986
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,080
then you're gonna be able to move out

987
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,580
and feel great about it.

988
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,300
But right now you're gonna carry a lot of guilt.

989
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:02,560
You have to let this thing run its terrible, terrible course.

990
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,660
And let me throw this out.

991
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,880
Your boyfriend's probably gonna be over at your place

992
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,740
most nights anyways.

993
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,900
It's not like you're not gonna see each other.

994
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,280
So I would say just after a while,

995
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,560
maybe after like six or eight months,

996
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,380
you're not gonna notice the difference anyways

997
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,100
and then your lease ends

998
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,140
and you guys are gonna move in together.

999
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,700
Eight months is gonna pass really quickly.

1000
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,060
Yeah, and then eight years and then 80 years

1001
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,900
and then that was your life.

1002
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,740
There is no reason to rush this relationship.

1003
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,980
No, there is a reason to rush into this next Yahoo.

1004
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:37,280
This Yahoo was sent in by gotta catch em all.

1005
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:39,700
Okay, mom.

1006
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,460
Thank you, it's by Yahoo answer user Janine who asks,

1007
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:46,200
will I get arrested for an internet fight here?

1008
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,220
Moments ago I got into an internet fight

1009
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,420
with someone, I'm seriously trying to apologize

1010
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,100
to this person because I seriously don't know

1011
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,280
what came over me.

1012
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,700
Will I get arrested for the fight?

1013
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,780
Because to be honest with you, I'm afraid.

1014
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,420
Like really, I'm seriously crying my eyes out.

1015
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,160
That's how afraid and sorry I am.

1016
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,660
What did you do?

1017
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,540
What did you do on the internet?

1018
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,460
What could you possibly have done?

1019
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,460
They were like, oh no, I took this too far.

1020
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,500
Not again.

1021
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:11,540
This is a bridge too far,

1022
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:14,100
I'm gonna have to change my internet name.

1023
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,320
I don't even think, you know like physically harm somebody

1024
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,900
but sometimes emotional harm.

1025
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,600
This is what's so fucked up about our legal system, right?

1026
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,420
If Travis and I are at Cheddar's

1027
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,100
and I punch Travis in the jaw,

1028
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,340
then that's assault, right?

1029
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,180
Or battery, or both.

1030
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,300
And he can file charges and I can go to prison for that.

1031
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,340
Correct, and I would.

1032
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,340
And he would do that.

1033
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,220
And he has.

1034
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,900
And he has done that.

1035
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,180
And that's why I'm. That's in the past.

1036
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,020
I'm not allowed in.

1037
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,540
Why are you dreshing this up?

1038
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,660
I'm not allowed in any Cheddar's anymore

1039
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,540
for this exact reason.

1040
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,380
I'm actually legally only allowed to be in Cheddar's.

1041
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,020
I'm recording from a Cheddar's right now.

1042
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,220
It's the only place I'm safe from.

1043
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,820
Travis is in Cheddar's house arrest.

1044
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,460
It's the only place he's safe from my wrath.

1045
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,260
If Travis leaves the Cheddar's, I have an alert.

1046
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,000
He's wearing a reverse ankle bracelet

1047
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,620
that will tell me when he's left the Cheddar's.

1048
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,300
I will come down on him like a fucking albatross.

1049
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,140
Luckily, there's a set of tubes, underground tubes

1050
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:23,300
that connect all the Cheddar's in America

1051
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,740
so that I'm able to travel from place to place.

1052
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,900
It's the underground Cheddar's railroad.

1053
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,580
Is the oven keeping me safe?

1054
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,420
Travis is still working out a plan

1055
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,260
to get Griffin to punch him at a cinema arc

1056
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,980
so he can see 12 Years of the Slay.

1057
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,920
Right.

1058
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,620
Okay, so back to the story.

1059
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,740
I punch Travis in the jaw at a Cheddar's

1060
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,320
and I went to prison for that.

1061
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:49,720
If I say, but if I tell Travis like,

1062
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,760
hey, you're looking a little doughy,

1063
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,780
then I have done an emotional harm to Travis

1064
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,520
that I think rivals the jaw punch that I did to him.

1065
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,360
Although I did punch him.

1066
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,940
Well, what are your jaw punches, certainly?

1067
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,780
Yeah.

1068
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,500
I can't go to jail for that, can I?

1069
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,860
It's assault of a different kind.

1070
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:11,820
I hurt him, not in his jaw, but in his heart.

1071
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,180
Like, I think that that's probably a prisonable offense.

1072
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,780
So your argument is that we should begin

1073
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,600
arresting people for saying hurtful things.

1074
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,620
Right, and because you can't punch someone

1075
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,260
through the internet, but you can tell someone

1076
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,900
they're looking a little Marlon Brando later years,

1077
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,260
doughy, then you should go to jail for that.

1078
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,100
Does that make sense?

1079
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,740
Am I making any sense right now?

1080
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,740
No, I completely understand what you're saying.

1081
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,780
But it would have to be like a separate prison

1082
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,700
because you don't want to be the guy

1083
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,620
who rolls up to prison on the first day

1084
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,940
and somebody's like, yeah, I stabbed three dudes

1085
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,580
when I was robbing a store.

1086
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,420
What did you do?

1087
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,780
I was like, I told somebody that they were looking

1088
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,720
really tired and had crows feet.

1089
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,420
Yeah, you know, stabbing three dudes

1090
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:00,100
while robbing a store really is the perfect crime.

1091
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:05,100
You really got like, in the crimes per minute ratio,

1092
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,900
like you did actually pretty great there.

1093
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,000
Yeah, I stabbed three dudes while I was robbing

1094
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,340
a liquor store, and then I turned to the proprietor

1095
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:17,340
of the liquor store and I said, hey fat ass, bye.

1096
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:18,180
So yeah, I'm here.

1097
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,180
And because you called him fat, you got arrested.

1098
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,340
I got 15 years for the stabbings,

1099
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,260
another eight for the robbery,

1100
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:27,460
and then I got 35 years for saying he was fat.

1101
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,660
We really need to take a look at this system.

1102
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,180
What really, the bad thing about this system

1103
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,660
is that, you know, it's gonna be a light sentence.

1104
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,780
It's gonna be a slap on the wrist, right?

1105
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,220
So the person goes in, they serve their time,

1106
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:41,820
but then they're allowed to call you fat

1107
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,020
whenever they want to, the double jeopardy.

1108
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,940
You didn't even consider that.

1109
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,160
I would like to see those scared straight meanings though.

1110
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,180
You think it's fun to tell your friend

1111
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,060
that his hair looks bad today?

1112
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,140
I told my friend that once, now I don't have hair.

1113
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:00,340
Because the barbers are really bad in prison.

1114
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:02,480
You guys think you're tough, you're just a bunch of pussies.

1115
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,460
Oh, wait, shit!

1116
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,100
Ah, damn it, god damn it.

1117
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,300
That's another six months.

1118
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:08,300
Well, son of a bitch.

1119
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,460
I'm so stupid.

1120
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,420
No, wait, fuck!

1121
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,260
Ah, shit, god damn it.

1122
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,580
Listen, this has been a lot of fun,

1123
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,420
but I have talked all I'm willing to.

1124
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,180
I have helped all the people that I physically can today.

1125
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,280
I've grown weary.

1126
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,420
I've entered, by the way, as I age,

1127
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:31,100
I've entered now my like, my James Brown phase

1128
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,620
where after all the advice, I'm physically

1129
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,780
and spiritually exhausted.

1130
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:36,860
I needed someone to come put a cape on me

1131
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:38,460
so I could make my way off stage.

1132
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:41,100
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

1133
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:46,100

1137
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,220
Big, big thank you to Tyler Crowley,

1138
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,780
who, excitingly, while we were recording this episode,

1139
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,420
just released a new episode of his Mabim-baminations.

1140
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,740
Oh, man, sweet.

1141
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,560
I know, animated bits from My Brother, My Brother and Me,

1142
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,800
and you can find his Twitter at Agent O'Hara.

1143
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,740
Oh, and thanks to Megan Knott.

1144
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,180
She made the My Brother, My Brother and Me cat,

1145
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,560
us as cats, GIF.

1146
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,180
We tweeted it a day or two ago.

1147
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,300
It's both mesmerizing and adorable,

1148
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,900
and my favorite thing about it is that my cat

1149
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,480
has little cat genitals.

1150
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:45,740
You can also find, by the way, that cartoon is on YouTube.

1151
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,620
Just search for Crotoons, C-R-O-W-toons.

1152
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,660
There are lots of other programs you can listen to

1153

1156
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,540
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,940
Thanks to John Roderick in the long winter

1165
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,420
for the use of the theme song It's a Departure

1166
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:26,340
off the album Puttin' the Days to Bed.

1167
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:27,820
That's the music we use.

1168
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,100
You can find it on iTunes.

1169
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:35,100
You can find it on other services like iTunes, probably.

1170
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,500
And that's gonna do it for us?

1171
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,700
Oh, and we're gonna have a special guest

1172
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,420
in the next week or two on the show.

1173
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,300
We're gonna have a, I'm calling it a guest-bert,

1174
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,340
but I think that-

1175
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,300
I like that.

1176
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,400
I mean, it's not- You like that?

1177
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,420
It's not like phonetically perfect.

1178
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,380
No, it's not pleasing in any way phonetically,

1179
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,700
but I like it.

1180
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:59,740
And this guest-bert is coming on to talk,

1181
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:02,220
if you have any advice on-

1182
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,060
Or need advice.

1183
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,060
Gays or lesbians in the media.

1184
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,700
That is what they are guest-bert on.

1185
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,820
So if you have any advice-related questions

1186
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:12,140
or just, you know, any kind of questions really,

1187
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,980
I don't wanna fence you in.

1188
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,460
