1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,960
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,320
Hey, I'm your sweet baby brother in 30 Under 30 Media Luminary back in a big way, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,520
Hey guys, you know how last week we tried to be earnest and we really nailed it,

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,320
and we were earnest the whole time? Yeah, I said a lot of shit, and I meant all that shit.

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,840
I meant all of it. I was thinking about it, and this week, what if we keep that old train a-rollin',

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
and we focus on the 20 funny things in your life without your love, and this week,

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,760
we aim for another goal, and we try to be relatable. Okay, that could be good.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,360
Let's be honest, we've gotten so big, or big shots, as they say, palling around with the glitterati,

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,920
and I'm feeling maybe we might have lost touch a little bit with, you know, your quote-unquote

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,160
every person. Yep, yep, yep, yep. So I think a big tenet of this, and it's a thing I've been meaning

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,680
to talk to you two boys about for quite some time now, is we have been awfully cavalier

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,640
about open and frank conversations about getting our buttholes sprayed by our toilets

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,480
in the form of bidet seeding, and obviously it's important. Obviously it's important.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,520
It's an important facet of my life, Justin's life, Travis's life, keeping it clean down there,

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,280
getting the spray is... I love it, and I need it, but I don't think the rest of America

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,320
is ready to go there with us yet. So Griffin, you're saying if we wanted to make it more relatable,

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,520
instead of saying, like, I don't think I could live without my bidet, you would say something like,

23
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think I could live without, you know, every time I go to the bathroom, going outside

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
and spraying myself off with a hose. I think that that's better, yeah, because bidet is like a French

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,560
word, and I think a lot of people are still kind of sore about all the Iraq War stuff, and so

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,560
if we could just call it a booty super soaker or something fun like that. I couldn't live without

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,080
my booty spray. My booty spray is... but that sounds like actually something that could come

28
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,520
out instead of go in. I could live without that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:17,920
I gotcha. So that's the big... that's sort of my big note. No more bidet chat. Maybe we have a separate

30
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:27,840
podcast for, you know, folks more on our level. That is definitely... I love that impulse, Griffin,

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
and I just want to kind of grab it and just kind of tweak it a little bit, give it a little

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,600
tickle on the tummy and see if I can't change that frown upside down, and maybe instead of not

33
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,480
talking about bidets, we could try to educate people a little bit more about how they're

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,240
actually surprisingly affordable and hygienic. And good for the environment, saves on TP.

35
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,000
Good for the environment, saves on TP. Now, Justin, I like this, because I was afraid we

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,160
were becoming unrelatable, but maybe it's everyone else that is on... we have become so relatable that

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,520
people no longer know how to relate to us, so we need to educate them. Because they're

38
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,840
daunted by how relatable we are. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, we're so relatable and

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,120
approachable, and, you know, we're basically three everymen over here, and so we need to

40
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
educate everyone else. Three everymen, you hear that, you're like, wow, that's a lot of men,

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,280
actually. Now come to think of it, that may be too many men for me to sort of talk to.

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,480
It's like an infinite men. I think also, in the spirit of the Max Fun Drive coming up pretty soon,

43
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,800
maybe we just... let's have a conversation at least about cutting Bugatti boys,

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,320
the segment in our show where we talk about all our Bugattis, and our new colors of Bugattis,

45
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,240
and the news about new Bugattis that are coming out. I have actually been edit... okay, this is

46
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
embarrassing. I hate to do this here. I have been editing out Bugatti boys for the last four years.

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,760
It's like 45 minute long segments. My Bugattis! Yeah, if you guys have been wondering why those

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,600
sponsorship dollars have not been pouring in, it is because I have been editing the 45 minute long

49
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,640
Bugatti segment we do every week. I can't believe I'm about to have to even ask this, but Justin,

50
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,960
you've left in Tiger Cub Chat, right? Where we talk about all the Tiger Cubs we've adopted?

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,200
So what I do with that is because we endeavor to make Tiger Cub Chat as long as the actual episode

52
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:36,640
itself, I have edited in underneath the episode at a really low volume. So if there's ever a long

53
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,360
period of silence, that's where we're all talking so much. Talking over each other, cross talking,

54
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,080
it's so we can cover up the chat about how we've adopted cubs and have named them after our

55
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,120
favorite US presidents. That's constantly underneath the audio of us sort of prattling

56
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,080
on about ghosts and horses and whatnot. Can y'all even just, and I'll cut this out,

57
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:09,840
but if we could get a bidet in the Bugatt. Oh shit, dude. A Bugatti day. A Bugatti day.

58
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,400
A bidegati. Oh man, we sound like, it's hard not to sound like Adam Sandler when you say that word.

59
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,400
And maybe a little special harness in there for my Tiger Cub. Yep, gotta keep him safe,

60
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,800
gotta keep him safe. So no, no, no. Hey, rear facing. Rear facing. Okay. Until he's at least

61
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,360
40 pounds. A rear facing bidet. Oh, a harness. I was trying to imagine what a rear facing bidet is

62
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,400
because I think that would just sort of hit my front stuff. Then he's rear facing until he's

63
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,760
three and turning around. And I like to think of that as roar facing because he's directing

64
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,160
the roars directly at you. So from rear facing to roar facing. Justin, at what point can I use

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,960
my Tiger Cub as a living hood ornament on my Bugatti? Oh, dipping your Tiger Cub in copper

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,960
and freezing it for time immemorial? No, no, no, no, no. Let me be clear. He's fully animate.

67
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,040
Right, inside of the copper, yeah, but you do need to keep him, eventually he's going to turn

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,400
into a tiger and that's going to be- Well, then I just flush him down the toilet after using the

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,600
bidet. Guys, this is exactly the kind of shit we shouldn't talk about on the show anymore.

70
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,240
Also, because we're burning up all our material. I don't know what we're going to talk about during

71
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,240
the segments that we will continue to record despite the revelation that they are not included

72
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,920
in the show. Yeah, sure. Why don't we do the regular show here, Bugatti boys? Yeah, we got to

73
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,680
say, I've got the whole afternoon cleared out for all the different shows that we have to record.

74
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,600
Excellent. Our first question is this. At my college, we have a buffet style cafeteria.

75
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,360
I grabbed a plate of the chef's meal of the day, sat it down on an open table with my backpack,

76
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,160
and then went to go get a drink. I came back with my drink and enjoyed my meal before wondering

77
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,960
where my backpack was. And then I looked down two tables to see my backpack and my original plate

78
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,080
of food. I had sat down at the wrong table and had eaten someone else's identical meal without

79
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,160
realizing it. I quickly left afterwards out of fear and shame, correct? Brothers, in what way could I

80
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,960
atone for this sin to the unknown individual whom I accidentally dine and dashed on? That's from

81
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:30,800
Momo in Virginia. Momo. Momo. Momo. Their instincts were correct. Yes. Fear and shame,

82
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,680
that's perfect. That's a good blend to start with. That's great for me.

83
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:44,400
Can I tell you the part of this question that haunts me? So Momo had time to eat the entire meal,

84
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,560
which means that whoever the original owner of said meal was approached,

85
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,320
saw them eating the food and said, well, what are you going to do? And left.

86
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Well, maybe. I mean, that's a possibility, Travis. I'm really challenged by the exfiltration from

87
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,040
the situation because option one is realize the mistake, stand up, walk away, and there's a sort

88
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,120
of zone of, I like to think of it in social situations as a zone of culpability. Like if

89
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,280
you can make it, if you can make it 10 feet away from a thing, you can sort of like blend into the

90
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,880
crowd and maybe even start announcing like, who did this? Who did this thing? Who could have done

91
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,680
this? Sure. But I think that the other option, so that's option one. Option two is you realize

92
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,520
your mistake and then take it to the trash. And then you are running into the possibility of this

93
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,120
person seeing you take their food. Didn't see you eat it, but did see you pick up their plate,

94
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,840
take it to the garbage and empty it out, which is also very bad.

95
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,880
I was trying to work out where the other person was in this scenario. And I think I've got it

96
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,400
cracked. This person walked back to what they thought was their seat and saw a different person

97
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,160
that wasn't them sitting in it and eating their food. And so their, their mind immediately told

98
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,800
them, Oh, I thought I was sitting there, but that's not my food. So it's not. And then they

99
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
kept walking and they saw the identical plate of food, but they saw a backpack by it. And so they

100
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,400
said, Hmm, that is also not my food. I should probably just leave or go get home. Now we've,

101
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,600
this is where we encounter the question mark that haunts me. Maybe they're still wondering

102
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
the cafeteria to this day. I probably got something else to eat. Well, hopefully,

103
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
what can you do to make it up? I mean, you got to find them first if you're going to make it up

104
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,160
for them, because otherwise you could just kind of start buying plates of food and leaving them

105
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,440
around like you're some sort of, you know, pelt hunter or something that you're trying to catch

106
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,120
a hungry student. Um, you gotta find them. I don't know what you do for that. Is this a

107
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,040
missed connection? That's what I was going to say. Yes. This seems like maybe, maybe you could even

108
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,640
go even more grassroots and just post flyers. Like, did you get a meal and somebody snarfed it?

109
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,040
I was the snarfer. I owe you one. It's me. Hey everyone. It's me. The snarf. Thanks for

110
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,120
coming to my Facebook page. I am looking for a person who likes spaghetti,

111
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,840
but not in a strong enough way to say something when encountering someone else eating it.

112
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,360
Moma, what did you do? What did you do with your original plate of food?

113
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,400
Good question.

114
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,680
Cause now you just have a big plate of cold spaghetti and you got to decide like,

115
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,000
am I going to have to eat? Okay. There's three options. One, people see you empty it into the

116
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,200
trash. Wasteful Ricky. Not good. Especially since it does look like you ate your food and then

117
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,040
walked over and took someone else's food. I'm full. Everyone should be full. I'm throwing this in the

118
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:13,600
trash kids. I'm done. Get back in the car. That's possibility. One possibility to slide it into your

119
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:20,160
back pack and you have to get a new backpack, but at least you've tamped down the shame. Three is

120
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,520
you eat a second plate of delicious chef's spaghetti. And that's fine. I guess it's a lot

121
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,800
of carb. Maybe you do a half marathon or something.

122
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,720
During college though, you can do it.

123
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
Yeah, that's a good point.

124
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,600
When I was in college, I had one meal at the cafeteria that was included in my plan a day

125
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,040
and it was all you can eat, as you said, buffet style. So I would just go in and hurt myself with

126
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,000
food, but I was like 20. So I barely even felt it. You know what I mean? And then I'd go home and

127
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,960
sleep for 14 hours or whatever because I could.

128
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,160
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

129
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,640
I'd love that.

130
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,200
Yes, please.

131
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,640
Here's one that was sent in by Brian. Thanks, Brian.

132
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,440
It's from Yahoo Answers user muhahaha. Who asks?

133
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh, not a great start.

134
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:14,960
How to still look perfect in a farm. So me, my family and cousins are going to my grandmother's,

135
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,200
my grandfather's farm for vacation for like two to three days and I need to look perfect. Thank you.

136
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,240
Oh, wow. What an open-ended, like perfect, like, are you, are you gramming it? Is that it?

137
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,000
Or is this just like, if someone saw you, they'd be like, they totally belong here.

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,320
Travis, don't be fucking obtuse, dude.

139
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,640
They need to look perfect on, while in their grandfather's farm for two to three days.

140
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:47,520
Now, so this can be tough. What I would do personally, and listen, I'm speaking relatably

141
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,480
here. I would hide toiletry kits throughout the farm that include maybe some concealer,

142
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,200
new deodorant, maybe even like a new shirt so that I can constantly look fresh no matter what

143
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,240
work I've been doing. And, you know, and then what's great about that is if you don't use them,

144
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,360
maybe the animals will and you have some, yeah, some fresh looking cows out there or whatever.

145
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,520
They'll love your cream. That's for sure. They're going to get all over that.

146
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah.

147
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,720
But let's talk about clothes.

148
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,220
Uh-huh.

149
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,240
Perfect in this. Sorry, go ahead.

150
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,240
Dungarees. Now you go ahead.

151
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,160
Dunkaroos.

152
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,880
I've decided in the grand tradition of evolution of the show that I'm going to start outsourcing

153
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,840
some of these to Korra, which is like the smart, it's like the actual good alternative.

154
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,480
It's a positive universe, Yahoo Answers.

155
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,560
And so there's a question here, what do they call the outfits that farmers wear?

156
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,160
And I thought that that would be perfect, right? Because you're getting kind of a,

157
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
you want to get the look right, right? Because if perfect in this scenario is to be like the

158
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,920
perfect farming look, is that fair? Can we grant this conceit?

159
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,240
Okay.

160
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,040
I mean, I got, yeah.

161
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:16,000
So Janice here says has worked with farmers for decades and she answers clothes.

162
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,280
Oh, all right.

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm sure some farmers wear coveralls or overalls, which is what TV shows and movies

164
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,760
would have us all think farmers wear. But most of the farmers I know just wear clothes.

165
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,240
So like a suit?

166
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
Depending on the work. I know farmers who wear long sleeve plaid shirts

167
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,280
and others who wear sports wicking shirts. Some wear jeans while others wear shorts.

168
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
This is getting a little Dr. Seuss for my taste.

169
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,720
Now here's the part where this kind of like gets kind of fucking weird.

170
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,680
Janice then writes, here is a dairy farmer friend working on his farm two different days.

171
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,080
One day he looked like a stereotypical farmer in overalls.

172
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,880
And there's a picture of fucking, I don't know how to say this,

173
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,640
other than creep shot of an old man walking in white overalls towards some cows or something.

174
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,280
White overalls?

175
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
White overalls?

176
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
White.

177
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,000
Is that for milk work?

178
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,680
It's Star Trek rules. You have to dress for the color of your job.

179
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,360
So the first one is just this fucking creep shot of this man walking towards cows.

180
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,400
And then it says the next time I caught him in the barn unloading feed,

181
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,760
he just looked like everyone else. And then there's a picture of a man wearing khakis

182
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,280
and staring at a huge fucking pile of cow food.

183
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,440
And both, by the way, are from behind.

184
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,120
Absolute creep shot.

185
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,160
I sent the link to you guys.

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,720
Are you seeing this business?

187
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
Yeah, I'm seeing it. It's not great.

188
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,640
It's not great, Janice.

189
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,840
I think probably, this would be like if Sesame Street is like kids today,

190
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,880
I'm going to take you to show how farmers work and every shot is them

191
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,080
fucking hiding in the bushes like, shh, don't be too loud.

192
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,040
They'll know we're here.

193
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,520
Just watch them stare at feed and walk towards cows.

194
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,720
But like, my man in the big food picture is wearing a short sleeve button up, looks like.

195
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,920
And it's so big and baggy.

196
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,520
That's not perfect.

197
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,120
It's not perfect.

198
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,160
That doesn't look perfect.

199
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,560
Sportswear I'm excited by. You mentioned sportswear.

200
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,080
I think sportswear is going to get a lot of the sweat and a lot of the stink out of there.

201
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
But what's the-

202
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,160
He is also in a more fashion forward choice.

203
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,760
He's rolled his white coveralls up at the bottom up to above the calf,

204
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,360
which I'm assuming is for various cow liquids that he'll have to sift through throughout the day.

205
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,040
It's very on trend.

206
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,200
It's kind of like a Capri overall.

207
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,240
It does kind of hurt the coveralls because you could just cut them off,

208
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,400
I guess, into sort of a coverall jorts situation.

209
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, let's talk about the functional sort of purpose of coveralls.

210
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,760
Because I'll tell you what else covers all.

211
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,920
The jeans and long sleeve shirt I'm currently wearing right now on my body.

212
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,440
I'm fully covered with that.

213
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't know why my pants also need to be a vest.

214
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,000
So let's just get that-

215
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
Am I afraid of things getting in my pants?

216
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720
If so, I wouldn't have my calves exposed like this,

217
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,120
so that all the dangerous cow worms, bacteria, whatever get up on them.

218
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,960
This is not perfect.

219
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,360
This is sub-ideal.

220
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,640
It does reduce-

221
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
I think it's just so your pants don't fall down, right?

222
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,400
Isn't that for this sort of look,

223
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,080
is just so your pants are sort of like permanently affixed above your shoulders?

224
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,580
Yeah.

225
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,640
So there's another picture on this page of a man wearing coveralls

226
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,280
and he does have a chicken sort of perched on his shoulder.

227
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,880
And I do think that that I hadn't really considered the organic component of your-

228
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh yeah.

229
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,720
Like the accessories.

230
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
But like if you want to look perfect in a farm,

231
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,000
you gotta have a hen just on you.

232
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,600
Like you just have a hen on you so that you look like you belong there.

233
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
That is important.

234
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,320
We gotta combat the sweat.

235
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,880
We gotta combat looking drab and boring.

236
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,640
And you also need to have some sort of living barn element.

237
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,400
I would say what you want is you want a hen on the shoulder

238
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,640
and a collie at your heel, right?

239
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
So that way you've got the-

240
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,680
I'm having fun with like the working animals up here,

241
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,560
but I'm working with the fun animals down here.

242
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
The animals at the ground are friends.

243
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,360
Yes.

244
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,800
The animals on your shoulder,

245
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,360
if you have a chicken on your shoulder, sort of a far miller, if you will,

246
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
that is a more symbolic choice.

247
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
I think it's meant to tell something about the person that it's affixed to.

248
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
Travis, I gotta say that a hen on my shoulder and collie at my heel

249
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,960
sounds like such a sexist to folksy idiom that is so veiled

250
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,840
you can't really even understand where it is that they're going with it.

251
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,440
Like it's so deeply, so deeply rural.

252
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,240
It feels like if Christians made a line of big Johnson shirts for farmers,

253
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,840
that is the vibe it would be.

254
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,920
Just sort of like we can't have anything racy,

255
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,360
but it just needs to be sort of like right underneath the surface.

256
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,920
Yeah.

257
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,280
Like it would say in big letters, a hen on my shoulder,

258
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,760
collie at my heel, and then like the farmer winking.

259
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,280
Right.

260
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,240
That's good.

261
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,920
There would be a smaller URL at the bottom that you would go to

262
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,640
that would maybe break down what the metaphor was of it.

263
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,840
If you want to find out, you can go here.

264
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,200
He's wearing a t-shirt with a QR code on it.

265
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,240
To have the joke explained to you, scan that.

266
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,760
That's great, and of course, I can't believe we've gone this long without saying it.

267
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,920
And I don't even think you should be allowed on the farm without it.

268
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,560
A long stock of wheat that you're just kind of got hanging out of your mouth.

269
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,400
Yeah, just to test it to make sure it's ready to go to market.

270
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,840
Yeah, I like that.

271
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
I haven't seen a farmer do that in real life.

272
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:08,400
I've only sort of seen like, you know, the mascots for farming-based phone games

273
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,800
always got a long stock of wheat sticking out of their mouth,

274
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,040
and it tastes good, maybe.

275
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,440
I don't know.

276
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
Bread tastes good.

277
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,960
That's how to pace your carbs right there.

278
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,040
You can't eat a whole loaf of bread.

279
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,120
Just eat one delicious stock at a time.

280
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,480
Just vape a stock, dude.

281
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Oh, hello.

282
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,240
Didn't see it come in there.

283
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
I was just about to give a quiz to my brothers,

284
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
but I thought maybe you could play along at home.

285
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,440
You're kidding me.

286
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,200
Do you remember how this bit went last time?

287
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,600
Now, these are all animal questions, fellows.

288
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
Oh, fun.

289
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,480
I love that segue.

290
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,360
Oh, thank you.

291
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,080
Now, boys, here's my question for you,

292
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
and I invite our listeners to, of course, play along at home.

293
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,680
In proportion to body size, which animal has the largest penis?

294
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,480
Okay, so Juice, maybe it's like last time he did this,

295
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
we were like, maybe by the third question,

296
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,320
there'll be like some big payoff for like a funny joke.

297
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,360
Maybe he's playing chess and it's like the third time he does this bit.

298
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,800
So you're saying we power through this one.

299
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,240
This one's going to suck shit.

300
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
Everybody at home, listen, this is Griffin,

301
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,760
and I'm going to be real with you.

302
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
The next few minutes of the show are going to suck shit,

303
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,480
but the next time Travis does this bit,

304
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,360
the payoff is going to be so decadent and so rich and juicy.

305
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,480
The anticipation, like you guys are going to be so hard

306
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
for the third time that Travis does this bit.

307
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,520
But to answer- Hippo. Yeah, a hippopotamus.

308
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
A hippopotamus, you say?

309
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,360
No, actually, reaching up to 10 times the length of their body,

310
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,320
the barnacle has the largest penis in proportion-

311
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,760
The barnacle's not really an animal.

312
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,560
It's a rock that gets stuck to ships and it's annoying.

313
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,040
It's a needy rock. It's a needy rock.

314
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,920
Okay. Now, according to the book, does it fart?

315
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,400
What is the only mammal that doesn't fart?

316
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,880
It is worse than I thought it was going to be,

317
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,240
but I will say-

318
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
Duckbill platypus.

319
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,080
I'll do hippo again.

320
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,720
Hippo again. No, it is the sloth.

321
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,400
And if things are working normally,

322
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,560
the methane produced by their gut bacteria

323
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,320
is absorbed into their bloodstream

324
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,240
and eventually breathed out.

325
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,360
Cool.

326
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,880
I would like to change my answer to my wife.

327
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,760
Oh, yeah, man.

328
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,640
Oh, okay.

329
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
I would like to change Justin's answer to my wife.

330
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,080
Now, if faced with particularly dry air,

331
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,040
the desert snail can hibernate for up to how long?

332
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,840
And this will be the last question for this round.

333
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,480
There's one more.

334
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,520
A year?

335
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
There are so many different amounts of time.

336
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,400
There's a lot, yeah.

337
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I can think of like five different amounts of time

338
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,360
just off the top of my head.

339
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,880
I'm going to say they could hibernate for two years.

340
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,320
For three years.

341
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
Damn, if we had had one more brother,

342
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
he would have fucking gotten it right on the nose, huh?

343
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

344
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,200
Now, final question.

345
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,040
According to scientists, other than human beings,

346
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,560
what is in, you can name any one of the four,

347
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,120
what are the four other species that go through menopause?

348
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,320
Dogs, cats, owls.

349
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,800
It would be short-finned pilot whales, beluga whales,

350
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,720
narwhals, and killer whales.

351
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,000
Unbelievable.

352
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
And humans.

353
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,440
Unbelievable.

354
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
What a weird list to be a part of, huh?

355
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
That is a strange list to be a part of.

356
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,880
And that was Play It Long at Home.

357
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,440
I hope you all had fun and maybe learned a little something.

358
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,840
Can you at least tell me if it's going somewhere?

359
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,920
And maybe next time we'll answer some questions about,

360
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,760
I don't know, your favorite stories.

361
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,120
Why do you do that, Trout?

362
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,680
Why do I do what, Griffin?

363
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
Create little fun ways for people-

364
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,640
It's not even that this segment is like bad.

365
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,480
It's that it's like nothing.

366
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,800
Well, I want people to just have a little moment

367
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,320
for them to feel like they're part of the show.

368
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,000
You know, because-

369
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,520
Okay, you-

370
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
I want them to be able to play along at home.

371
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,080
You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding

372
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,040
of like the relationship of observer and like creator.

373
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,640
Well, you know, it's like how Mr. Rogers would often

374
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
like just direct address the audience

375
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,160
instead of talking to the other people.

376
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
And like, we're always talking to each other.

377
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,840
And I'm saying, where's the part

378
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,320
where we talk to people at home?

379
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,440
But they're not talking to us.

380
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,120
Okay, Travis, what are they saying right now?

381
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,440
They're saying that was a great quiz.

382
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,600
And I learned a little something that was fun for me.

383
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,720
And while I was playing the quiz, I drew a little picture.

384
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,660
So-

385
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,760
You shouldn't have to come up with ways

386
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,680
to entertain yourself during your podcast.

387
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
It's not a great look, Travis.

388
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,320
You know, I entertain them

389
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,160
and inspire them to draw a little picture.

390
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,600
Okay, moving on.

391
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,640
It's not because they were bored.

392
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,600
It's because they were inspired.

393
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,280
They had a, they really enjoyed it

394
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
and they learned something at home.

395
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,280
What if episode-

396
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,320
Because they played along.

397
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,120
What if episode 500 was just an extended clip of play along at home?

398
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
And it was our most interactive episode yet.

399
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,560
It'll be our, whatever it was called, Bandersnatch.

400
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,960
What was the name of the fucking Black Mirror episode?

401
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
They'll be our interactive experience.

402
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,720
I think it was Snoochie Boochie.

403
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,920
I think it was Bandicoot.

404
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,680
I have been invited to a nudist party.

405
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,840
It is a totally non-sexual thing.

406
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,120
The clothes don't come off until after we eat.

407
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,560
And I don't know what I should wear.

408
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,280
Should I go over the top or tone it down?

409
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,840
Good question.

410
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
That's for mooning in the Midwest.

411
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,140
Okay.

412
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,360
I will grant, and it is fucking every,

413
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,240
it takes everything in me to grant your premise

414
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,680
that this nudist party is a totally non-sexual thing.

415
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,320
It probably is for most.

416
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,820
Right.

417
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,240
Right.

418
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,760
But I'll grant your premise.

419
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,160
They can't do-

420
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,200
Just so we can move on.

421
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,320
They can't take a drop of blood from everybody as they enter

422
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,400
and stick a hot wire into it to see who is the thing.

423
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,120
And by the thing, I mean the secret horny.

424
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,760
Because there's probably one and there's no way of knowing.

425
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,640
I think what we can assume from the non-sexual thing

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,680
is that this is not an eyes wide shut sex party.

427
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
No, no, yeah, yeah.

428
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,560
People will simply casually be nude.

429
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,400
There's no stigma here.

430
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,560
People want to have a nude party that's not, you know,

431
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,360
that's non-sexual.

432
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
It's all about being free, being loose.

433
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,480
I'm into that.

434
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,600
For me, I think my hang up is that the clothes don't come off

435
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,280
until after we eat.

436
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,080
So let's talk about-

437
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,840
That's the last time I want to do that.

438
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,640
Oh, really?

439
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:52,880
Yeah.

440
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,680
Because I was just-

441
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,800
Huh.

442
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
It can be a hot dripping meat situation,

443
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,080
so maybe they don't want to get singes or stains.

444
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,200
A lot of utensils around, I find that intimidating.

445
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah, man.

446
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,280
But I don't-

447
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,440
Although I do like the thing that if a little sauce

448
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,880
should manage to dribble its way off of my chin

449
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
and onto my shirt, I can just be like,

450
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,520
oh, the fuck do I care?

451
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,080
Yeah, right?

452
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,120
This thing's coming off.

453
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,800
I might as well throw this in the trash.

454
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,320
What do I care if it's in the trash?

455
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,720
I think it's less about the proximity to eating time

456
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,320
and more that there is a prescribed naked changeover.

457
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,120
Do you know what I mean?

458
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,120
Yes.

459
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,960
There's like this party evolves.

460
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,080
They like jump it up at 7.35 as soon as they're done eating.

461
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,440
I feel like in this scenario,

462
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,160
I would be the guy to lose his nerve and just be like,

463
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,920
I could actually go for another dessert.

464
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,480
Hey, should we order pizza too?

465
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,720
Let's get some za in here.

466
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,600
I'm fucking ravenous still.

467
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,560
You see Randy over there.

468
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,480
He's snarfin' it the fuck down.

469
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
Yeah, that's the secret.

470
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,600
That's the horny right there.

471
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,400
So here's the thing.

472
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,160
I get nervous doing something I've never done

473
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,840
and not because I haven't done it before,

474
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,360
but because I don't know the processes.

475
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,840
I can't even imagine the levels that would spike for me

476
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,800
and something like this.

477
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,040
Because for example, I was just sitting here thinking,

478
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,640
when the time comes, do you all get naked in the same room?

479
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,080
Yes, exactly.

480
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,320
Do you go separate places and come back nude?

481
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Okay, if you go to separate places and come back nude,

482
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,640
are you legally prohibited from saying ta-da

483
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,560
when you walk into the room?

484
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,600
Is this a concern?

485
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,480
Do you wanna be the first person there or the last?

486
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,920
Do you wanna find the best seats

487
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,040
or do you wanna come in last and make a show of it?

488
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,080
Here's the one thing I can say concretely.

489
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
If you're going to have a successful

490
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,880
non-sexual nudist party,

491
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,040
when everyone walks in, they must be handed a card

492
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,360
and the card has a place for a signature at the bottom

493
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
and it says, I, and you write your name in,

494
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,400
do solemnly swear that when it gets to the part

495
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,440
where we all have to bend over and put our clothes back on,

496
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
I will not look at anybody's assholes.

497
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,720
Because I think that that would be the,

498
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,440
even if it was like the chillest time,

499
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
everybody's like loving it, enjoying it,

500
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,480
there does have to be a point

501
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,800
where everybody picks their clothes up off of the ground

502
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,320
and you will have to bend over.

503
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,000
And that would be the moment where I'd be like,

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
well, here's my asshole.

505
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,560
I really hope no one, I'm glad we all signed cards

506
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,000
that said no one could look at it.

507
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,800
I have to amend the language, Justin.

508
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,160
It's gotta be, I will try my darndest

509
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,600
not to look at anyone's asshole.

510
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,240
Because I think that there's going to be like

511
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,600
just a second of, oh no, I looked, I'm so sorry,

512
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,720
I broke the code.

513
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,160
And there's gonna be a lot of people

514
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,120
who as soon as you make them sign a promise

515
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,880
that they won't look at anybody's assholes,

516
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,160
they may not have even been planning on scoping no holes,

517
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,120
but as soon as they say they can't, yes.

518
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,240
So let's get back to the actual question though,

519
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,920
because this is a good question.

520
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,320
Do you come in in like a loose fitted,

521
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,840
like almost like a painter's, you know, like bodysuit

522
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,000
that's like one zipper and you're out?

523
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,720
Or is this like, I need many pieces

524
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,280
and I'm going to slowly throughout the course of the meal

525
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
remove my gloves and then my jacket

526
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,000
and then the vest and then the ascot.

527
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,160
It's not a burlesque show.

528
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,280
I certainly don't think that's a burlesque show.

529
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,800
But do you want to seem overeager?

530
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,440
I'm worried that the one zipper bodysuit

531
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,880
is like zip zip and it's like,

532
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,800
whoa, look who's already naked.

533
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,040
I feel like the norm at parties like this

534
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,160
is that there is like a zone of nudity

535
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,320
or a zone of doing it if that's the thing, right?

536
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,160
But the idea of it just being a general nude house party,

537
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,080
those have to happen too.

538
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,720
And you can't drive up to the house

539
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
and be nude.

540
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,160
You can't get out of your car nude

541
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,600
on the sidewalks that the taxpayers pay for, I don't think.

542
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,160
My guts tells me that what you want

543
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,840
is to cloak whatever it is you're working with.

544
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,400
Like you, I feel like you have to have

545
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,200
the element of surprise somewhat.

546
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,680
Good, bad, indifferent, everybody's beautiful.

547
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:22,000
I think you do have to have a little bit of like surprise.

548
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,160
This is what I was working with the entire time.

549
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,520
Did you even guess?

550
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,800
Because I bet you didn't.

551
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,760
So are you suggesting like one of those bikini t-shirts

552
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,880
that has a body painted on the front of it?

553
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,640
Is that what you're suggesting?

554
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,080
Yeah, I guess I'm suggesting that

555
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,080
or something loose fitting might be a less sort of wild

556
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,000
assumption to take from what I just said.

557
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,320
Might I recommend maybe along those lines,

558
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,840
cloaking what you're working with,

559
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,400
a late 90s starter jacket with maybe a football team.

560
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,840
Like very puffy, very oversized.

561
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,720
And you look at it and you're like,

562
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
oh, I had no idea Doug loved the Steelers so much.

563
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,960
Oh, what's that?

564
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,160
Doug's got a six pack.

565
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,760
Or.

566
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
Okay, what about this?

567
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,000
Or he takes it off underneath,

568
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,560
he's got a San Diego Chargers tattoo.

569
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,060
What?

570
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,640
Excuse me?

571
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,680
That must be embarrassing

572
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,520
because they're not even in San Diego anymore.

573
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,160
Yeah, he got it so long ago.

574
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
You could also dress it really tight

575
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:26,320
and then have it sort of unspool as you unzip.

576
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,840
I don't know if that's physically possible

577
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,680
and it would be mighty uncomfortable.

578
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,000
But you know, it's all about the reveal, the prestige.

579
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,360
What about a bunch of balloons?

580
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,120
I don't know, Trav.

581
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,960
You wear a bunch of balloons?

582
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
Inside your shirt.

583
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,040
Okay.

584
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,960
So they don't know.

585
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,680
Hey, his body looks like the grapes

586
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,600
from the Fruit of the Loom commercial.

587
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,560
No, no, no.

588
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,200
You take it off, balloons fly up to the ceiling

589
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
and there's your nude body.

590
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,620
Cool.

591
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,520
It's good.

592
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,320
Man, I bet this must be a thing of like

593
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
after when everyone puts their clothes on

594
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,760
and then you just have a long talk about

595
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,520
who had the best prestige.

596
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,160
Yeah.

597
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:12,640
Yeah.

598
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,800
Yeah, so.

599
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,600
Well, anyway, that probably answers your question.

600
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,680
We would love to talk more about the subject

601
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,520
that we're imminently qualified to address.

602
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,080
But for the moment, we must adjourn to the Money Zone.

603
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:36,580
Griffin?

604
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,920
Yeah?

605
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,440
I've been trying to recruit for a while.

606
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,080
I just yelled.

607
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,560
I'm sorry.

608
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:40,960
I yelled.

609
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,440
I don't know why.

610
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,880
That's okay.

611
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,840
No, it was dramatic.

612
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,640
I liked it.

613
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,720
I've been trying to recruit for a while.

614
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,360
Okay.

615
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,400
And I don't know how to do it.

616
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,280
I'm trying to build, let's say, a defense force.

617
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,760
Like highly skilled agents that I can send on missions.

618
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,600
Right.

619
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,840
To say right what was wrong.

620
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,920
Yeah, I don't know that Zip Recruiter,

621
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,600
I mean, they post lots of job sites, right?

622
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,360
So they may be able to help you put together

623
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,200
a sort of A-Team situation,

624
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,040
if that's what you're suggesting.

625
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,600
I wasn't even thinking A-Team at the time,

626
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,320
but now, yeah, something like that.

627
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,960
I mean, a codable co-founder, Gretchen Huebner,

628
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,000
needed a game artist for her education tech company,

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,320
and she went to ziprecruiter.com, posted her job,

630
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,400
and found the right person in less than two weeks

631
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,040
using their powerful matching technology.

632
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,640
So I don't see why you couldn't find a few,

633
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,320
you know, ragtag soldiers of fortune.

634
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:42,800
Yeah.

635
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
Do you think that when Gretchen Huebner hired that person,

636
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,560
Gretchen was like, I need you to do some design stuff,

637
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,680
and also maybe steal some plans for a missile.

638
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,360
Maybe, but there's only one way to find out,

639
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,080
and four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter

640
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,160
get a quality candidate within the first day.

641
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
I know that seems like a non sequitur,

642
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,960
but I did need to say it.

643
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,520
It's the smartest way to hire Zip Recruiter is,

644
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,800
and right now Zip Recruiter,

645
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,720
you can try it for free at our web address,

646
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

647
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,360
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

648
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,120
Now Justin, if I was looking for a way to advertise

649
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,360
my team of soldiers of fortune,

650
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,360
who are going around righting wrongs

651
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,440
and stopping bad people.

652
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:38,640
Travis's extrajudicial sort of action team.

653
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,040
Yes.

654
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,480
Yeah, but because like for a while now,

655
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
I've just been writing it out on note cards

656
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,320
and taping it up on like a telephone poles in my area,

657
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,920
but I feel like maybe that's not the best way

658
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,320
to advertise my goods and services

659
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,800
or to promote my physical or online business

660
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,080
or sell products and services of all kind.

661
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,560
Are we calling your extrajudicial action team

662
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,760
a service or a product?

663
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,240
Well, you know, it starts as a service,

664
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,160
but then we can brand and maybe do a little merch.

665
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,120
Oh, that's fun.

666
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,400
Yeah, I love that.

667
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,360
The best place to do all that is gonna be Squarespace.

668
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,680

669
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,080

Everything's optimized for mobile right out of the box.

672
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
That's another way of saying phones.

673
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
A lot of people have asked.

674
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,280
Analytics, they help you grow in real time

675
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,840

676
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,240
You just let Squarespace handle all of it.

Squarespace, keep it secret, keep it safe.

688
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,960
Hey everyone, Alden Ford here

689
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,400
with the cast of Mission to Zix.

690
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,360
Hello.

691
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,760
Our fourth season premieres on February 19th.

692
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
And for those of you who aren't familiar with the show,

693
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,440
we decided to ask one of our characters

694
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,920
to give you a quick recap of what's happened so far.

695
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,080
Say hello to the clone trooper, AJ.

696
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,520
Who are you people, what's happening?

697
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,120
Okay, AJ, put your gun down.

698
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,360
AJ, can you just tell us what's happened

699
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,760
in the Zix quadrant in the last couple seasons?

700
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh, well, we destroyed the emperor.

701
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,080
Oh, really?

702
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,640
Okay, great.

703
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,920
Yeah, I mean, I think, I think so.

704
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,200
We knocked him into a chasm.

705
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,520
Mr. Robot Man and Bart's ship crashed through a window

706
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,200
and Dar and Baby Horsehead and I took out

707
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,640
like a bunch of bad guys.

708
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,760
Papa filled his destiny and the lizard was there too.

709
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,800
Okay, great.

710
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,280
I guess I was sort of asking what the show is like.

711
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,320
Oh, you mean like it's an improvised serialized

712
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,480
workplace space opera featuring brilliant sound design,

713
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,520
incredible guest stars,

714
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,080
and an epic hilarious tale of fresh versus whack?

715
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,720
Oh, yeah.

716
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,200
Wow.

717
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
Where did you come up with that?

718
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,160
Jesse Thorne told me to write that on my palm.

719
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,720
Okay, all right.

720
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Well, Mission to Zix season four debuts

721
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,800
on February 19th on Maximum Fun.

722
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,280
Check it out.

723
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,640
Celebrity wine, why not?

724
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Celebrity wine, why not?

725
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:08,720
Celebrity wine, why not?

726
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,480
They've got a passion for grapes.

727
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,160
They think beer is for apes.

728
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,160
Celebrity wine, why not?

729
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:15,760
Good.

730
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,120
So this is Celebrity Wine, Why Not?

731
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,960
It is a sort of a trivia game show

732
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,360
and it's just about celebrities and their passion for wine.

733
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,880
Rather than put you all through incredible challenges

734
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,720
that ask you to pass, ask you to match celebrities

735
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,160
with their wine flavors or vintages,

736
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,600
things that you would have no way of knowing,

737
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,000
I have constructed a five-question quiz

738
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
about celebrity wines that I'm going to-

739
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
Should people play along at home?

740
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,760
No, I think actually to differentiate-

741
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,480
I would ask if they not.

742
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah, please fucking don't play along at home.

743
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,440
Please don't.

744
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,880
Yeah, because that's mine.

745
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,240
That's Travis's thing.

746
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,680
Here's our first question.

747
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,880
Knocking Point Wines is co-owned with Walla Walla natives

748
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,160
Kevin Zenter and Andrew Harding and this actor.

749
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,120
Multiple choice, Paul Giamatti, Stephen Amell,

750
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,240
Linda Fiorentino.

751
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,880
I feel like Giamatti is so on the nose.

752
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,600
It's a trap.

753
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,960
Yeah, it's a Giamatti trap.

754
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,720
It's a Giamatti snare.

755
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,080
Who was the second one?

756
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,000
Stephen Amell.

757
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,040
Is that Arrow?

758
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,800
Paul Giamatti and Linda Fiorentino.

759
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,640
Those are our three choices.

760
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,520
I'm going with Linda.

761
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,240
I'm going to go with Arrow.

762
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,680
Well, Griffin, you're very smart,

763
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,080
seeing as Knocking Point is the place

764
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,440
where you knock your arrow.

765
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,920
It is, in fact, Stephen Amell.

766
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,080
So he named it that because it's like a cool thing

767
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,800
that his super-

768
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,760
Because it's like an arrow thing.

769
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,800
His badass superhero thing.

770
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,680
Because it's like an arrow thing.

771
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,040
It's kind of like his thing.

772
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,320
It's like-

774
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,360
Congratulations.

775
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,080
So far the score right now is Griffin won, Travis.

776
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,360
Have you guys ever had Val Kilmer's kick-ass bat wine?

777
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,160
It's super good, and the Joker hates it.

778
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,400
Little Jonathan Winery is a collaboration

779
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,880
between this entertainer and Central Coast winemaker,

780
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,840
Allison Crowe.

781
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,720
They make a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.

782
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,360
Who runs it?

783
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,200
Give it to me one more time.

784
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,480
Little Jonathan Winery is a collaboration

785
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,840
between this entertainer and Central Coast winemaker,

786
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,800
Allison Crowe.

787
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,120
They make a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon.

788
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,160
Who is the entertainer?

789
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
Is it Lil Jon?

790
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,920
It is, in fact, Lil Jon.

791
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,400
Congratulations, Griffin McElroy.

792
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,360
Lil Jon makes a wine called Lil Jon.

793
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,920
Fucking good.

794
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,240
It's actually the funniest thing he could possibly be doing.

795
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,600
Congratulations to you, Lil Jon.

796
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,040
Question three.

797
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,600
There are five.

798
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,600
Right now the score is two to zero.

799
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,480
Okay.

800
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,680
You could say that Chateau Miravelle wine was owned

801
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,800
by Mr. and Mrs. Wine, until time, circumstance,

802
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,320
and dare I say it, fate intervened to make that sub-joke

803
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,680
meaningless at best, and unfeelingly cruel at worse.

804
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,560
Who among us can say why a relationship between two

805
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,640
beautiful, talented, and seemingly generous people

806
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,200
would fall apart?

807
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,320
Perhaps the lesson is that no matter your inner or outer

808
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,280
beauty, relationships are a fickle thing, and not for us

809
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,040
on the outside to take the measure of.

810
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,040
No matter how many people you have,

811
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,840
no matter how many times a couple has been caught

812
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,680
in the twinkle of the paparazzo's lenses,

813
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,400
this year Chateau Miravelle will release a rosé champagne.

814
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,720
That would be Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.

815
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,320
Congratulations, Travis.

816
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,880
Thank you.

817
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,240
Your score rockets to one.

818
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,000
That thing that you just said though,

819
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,200
is that like printed on the bottle?

820
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,720
Because that was a bunch of wild shit.

821
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,800
No, this is the question I wrote to try to cover up the fact

822
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,000
that it was kind of an easy one.

823
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,240
Okay.

824
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,680
Well, don't say that.

825
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,200
It's the first one I got.

826
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,520
You can't be like, Travis got a real gimme.

827
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,520
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

828
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,560
between Jessie Bongiovanni and this entertainer.

829
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,440
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

830
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:23,840
between Jessie Bongiovi and this entertainer.

831
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,680
I'll repeat it one more time.

832
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,280
Hampton Water Wine, a rosé blend, is a collaboration

833
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,480
between Jessie Bongiovi and this entertainer.

834
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
Is it Jon Bon Jovi, Justin?

835
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,160
It is Jon Bon Jovi.

836
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,080
Your score's rocking, Travis.

837
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,000
You have blasted off to tie it with Griffin against all odds.

838
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,960
Okay, in my defense, as soon as I started laughing, I got it.

839
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,320
I just couldn't form words.

840
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,200
Oh, fuck.

841
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,920
Venatore is a single vintage Chardonnay based sparkling wine.

842
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,720
Who created it?

843
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,480
Now for this one, there are two hints, okay?

844
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,240
Okay, you can use a hint if you wish.

845
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,280
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

846
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,200
Venatore comes from the Latin for hunter.

847
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,800
There's a second hint that you can use.

848
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,040
Is the second hint gonna just completely blow wide open?

849
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,960
I don't actually think so.

850
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,520
All right, give it to me.

851
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
But it will be funny for the comedy podcast.

852
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,840
This actor said about his wine,

853
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,760
I'm so proud of this awesome juice I was able to be a part of.

854
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,160
Okay.

855
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,480
Now I will give you a third clue, and this one might break it open.

856
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,960
If Travis misses this one, he will be kicking himself.

857
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,680
Huh, Venatore, a single vintage Chardonnay based sparkling wine.

858
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,560
Venatore comes from the Latin for hunter.

859
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,920
He said about this wine, I'm so proud of this awesome juice

860
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,120
I was able to be a part of.

861
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,960
Ryder Strong.

862
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,720
No, Travis, it's Jared Pilecki.

863
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,220
Damn it!

864
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,280
Of supernatural fame.

865
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,120
That is the sound of you kicking yourself.

866
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,960
I am kicking the shit out of myself.

867
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,960
And he is so proud of this awesome juice he was able to be a part of.

868
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:17,440
Sorry, Travis.

869
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,640
Pilecki, by the way.

870
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,160
Okay, you've given half a point for the correction.

871
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:22,800
Travis wins.

872
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,680
Yay!

873
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,760
Celebrity wine, why not?

874
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,920
Congratulations, Travis McElroy.

875
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,800
From nowhere, from nothing, you have risen to take the celebrity wine, why not crown.

876
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,440
That was close.

877
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,240
Celebrity wine, why not?

878
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,040
Celebrity wine, why not?

879
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,800
They've got a passion for grapes.

880
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,480
They think beer is for apes.

881
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,880
Celebrity wine, why not?

882
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,080
That's powerful juice.

883
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,600
That was a powerful fucking segment.

884
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah, thank you.

885
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,080
Thank you.

886
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,000
I was really, I was really proud of it.

887
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,040
Hey, I got a Yahoo here.

888
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,480
It was sent in by a bunch of folks.

889
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,800
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm gonna call Joe Asks.

890
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,480
And we know the answer to this one.

891
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,400
Oh, good.

892
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,520
I like a nice slam dunk.

893
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,680
Yeah, but I think it's worth talking about.

894
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,180
Okay.

895
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,280
If you stink at golf, can you just throw the ball?

896
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,540
Yeah.

897
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,360
Is that against the rules?

898
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah, if you do this at the PGA Masters, the big show, the big beautiful game,

899
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,000
they are going to, you will get, you will be penalized.

900
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,500
Yes.

901
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,560
And I think they do that by, you know, adding strokes to your current score,

902
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,600
or now you don't get to, now you're catty, you don't get a catty anymore,

903
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,080
so you gotta carry the things yourself.

904
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,580
Yeah.

905
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:48,740
I think it's pretty ridiculous.

906
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,380
I think it's pretty ridiculous and frankly kind of embarrassing to think that

907
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,380
if you're not good at the game, if you're not good at like hitting the ball with clubs,

908
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,940
that you can just pick it up and throw it, right?

909
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,440
Yeah.

910
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:01,400
Well.

911
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:08,580
But, but, but what if you could do that?

912
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,700
Well, here's what they don't tell you.

913
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,060
And I learned, I took individual dual sports in high school where they

914
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:19,540
taught us about golf, and this is a little known, I'll tell you, a little known rule in golf.

915
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:24,420
You can do it, but once you do it, everyone else gets to do it too.

916
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,980
You break the, it's called breaking the seal.

917
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:27,480
Correct.

918
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,500
Once you break the seal, everybody, so you gotta watch out for if your opponent can throw things

919
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,540
super far.

920
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,040
Exactly.

921
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,160
Right.

922
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:39,540
If you think you are the strongest throwing golf person,

923
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:43,780
and you are the strongest throwing golf person, do it.

924
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:44,280
Right.

925
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,100
But if you like, I saw, you know, Jenny the other day throw an egg really far,

926
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,420
that probably translates to this.

927
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,420
And it's not just about how far you can eat this golf ball, it's also about the precision game,

928
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:58,820
right?

929
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:02,820
It's about your approach and it's about, you know, you go up against somebody who is on the Bozo's

930
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,780
grand prize game.

931
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,260
Mm-hmm. They're gonna be draining buckets left and fucking right.

932
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:13,300
Um, and maybe you want that, maybe you don't, but I do think that if you stink at golf,

933
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,700
you can just, you should just be able to throw the ball.

934
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,380
You can also kick it.

935
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,380
That I don't like.

936
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,540
You don't like the kicking rule?

937
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,660
No, I don't like that.

938
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,700
Golf ball's not good to kick because it's little, and so it's like easy to miss it,

939
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,540
and it's hard so it can hurt the foot.

940
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,340
But picking it up and throwing it, like, that's got a good hand feel to me.

941
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,340
Like, a golf ball leaving my hand with tremendous force, I like that.

942
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,340
You know what I like?

943
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:45,060
It's rare to see this, but when, like, a powerful golfer gets up, hits the ball real good with the

944
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:50,580
club, and it goes a real long way, and then a real pipsqueak gets up there and everyone's like,

945
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,820
well, they don't got it, and they kind of lightly tap the ball, and the ball starts rolling and

946
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,380
everyone's laughing because of how lightly they tapped it.

947
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,500
But then, through a series of, like, it bouncing off stuff and little hills.

948
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,420
Just an organic Rube Goldberg machine.

949
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,100
Right, a bird picks it up thinking it's an egg and realizes it's not an egg.

950
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:12,580
They get a hole in one, and I like when that happens.

951
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,820
That's basically the Legend of Bagger Vance.

952
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,020
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

953
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:21,620
It happens in Bagger Vance, happens in Greatest Game Ever Played, Happy Gilmore,

954
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,700
happens in all the best ones, Caddyshack.

955
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,220
The Shia LaBeouf one.

956
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:27,540
That's the Greatest Game Ever Played, thank you very much.

957
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:27,780
Sorry.

958
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,820
I own that on DVD.

959
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,540
What about the- oh, yikes.

960
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,900
What about the thing they do where they use the stick?

961
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,460
Uh-huh.

962
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:37,940
What is that?

963
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,340
A club.

964
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,060
A club, thank you.

965
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,260
When they use it like a pool cue, I think it's like in Tin Cup or Happy Gilmore, one of those,

966
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,700
like, is that okay?

967
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,340
Is that permitted?

968
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:46,900
Oh, yeah.

969
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:51,300
In Tin Cup, he does one drive with a baseball bat.

970
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:51,700
Yeah.

971
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,980
Certainly, that's not okay, right?

972
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,420
That should be able to use that.

973
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,100
There are no rules in golf.

974
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:57,780
Oh, wow.

975
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,460
There's probably a few.

976
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:05,220
I think if you can get up to it, you should be able to throw your opponent's ball backwards.

977
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,260
That is true.

978
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,060
But then it's a sneaking game.

979
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,780
Did you know that if your opponent gets between you and the hole,

980
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,940
you're allowed to drive your ball through their chest?

981
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,820
You can do that.

982
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,860
You can plow right through them.

983
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,780
No, let's stop joking around.

984
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,980
And no court in the world can convict you.

985
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,340
It's international waters.

986
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,420
But no joke, you should be able to pick the ball up and throw it, I feel like.

987
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,260
Especially if you get in the sand.

988
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,580
Like, you know how when you're watching, like, the Masters and they get in the sand,

989
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,460
and then they spend, like, 30 minutes in there, just, like, hitting sand over and over again.

990
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,420
And it's annoying to fucking watch that.

991
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:43,780
I want to see somebody hit it on the green part, thank you very much.

992
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,140
If my ball gets stuck behind a tree, can I chop the tree down?

993
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,200
Yeah.

994
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:50,420
Yeah, absolutely.

995
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,700
Yeah, absolutely, but you have to use the tree as your club from that point on.

996
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:57,220
Now, what if I hit the ball and it lands in someone's sandwich?

997
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,620
Do I need to hit the sandwich?

998
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,580
No, they'll eat around it and then you have your ball good to go.

999
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,780
What if they're a slow eater?

1000
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,260
What if it goes in Shrek's swamp and it's like, I don't want to bother that dude.

1001
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,940
Like, he's mean.

1002
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,060
You could just ask Dunkey to get it back for you.

1003
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:18,020
What if it lands on a big, mean guy's foot?

1004
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,180
Like, it did happen in Happy Gilmore.

1005
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,420
Yeah, what if it lands on a dog turd?

1006
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,700
What if it lands on Poopy?

1007
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,300
Like, it happened in the movie and you splatter it and it gets on Bob Barker,

1008
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,700
and I'm over here busting my fucking guts up.

1009
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,140
Do you guys think we get enough credit for our sports humor?

1010
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,820
Because I feel like, I'm sitting here thinking about it,

1011
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:45,700
like, I don't feel like we get enough credit for how good we are with turns of phrase

1012
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,740
and different puns just from our wealth of sports knowledge.

1013
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,780
Especially considering Griffin sent us this question about three weeks ago

1014
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,860
and we've been researching and researching.

1015
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,980
It worked in the room, I don't know, man.

1016
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,220
Here's another question I have from our listeners.

1017
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,580
How can I go big and go home this year?

1018
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,340
I don't know that this will work for the program.

1019
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:18,180
I am now of an age, I am 36 years old, I have two children, I still want to party,

1020
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,500
but I do want to be done by like 8.30, 8.45.

1021
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,700
So this question from boss is, because I don't have a clean read on it,

1022
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,220
how can I go big and go home this year?

1023
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,140
So both go big and go home.

1024
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:38,100
I mean, I guess we should just say leave early and then sit in silence for seven minutes.

1025
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:40,340
But that's not big, that's just going home.

1026
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,420
Where's the big part?

1027
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,820
I want to make a big splash and then leave.

1028
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:51,220
Make 2020 the year we stop using doors.

1029
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,700
Ooh, okay.

1030
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,180
Tell me more about this.

1031
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,500
When God opens a window, Boz scuttles through it,

1032
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,340
in and out like the cool friend on Clarissa.

1033
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:05,540
Sam.

1034
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,220
Only, no, Sam, thank you.

1035
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:10,020
Only windows, no doors.

1036
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,380
That is so big.

1037
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,420
And then if you do that, if I'm like at a party

1038
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,660
and I see somebody open a window and climb through it

1039
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:22,020
and then just fucking bolt, like run away as fast as you possibly can.

1040
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,380
Let me think about the other things I'm going to be talking about

1041
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,580
at that party for the rest of the night.

1042
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,180
Oh, that's right, it's nothing.

1043
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,100
Yes, it's nothing.

1044
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,180
You're the hit of the party.

1045
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,940
And if you can make it out the door to go home,

1046
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,380
or make it out the window to go home, no one will see you leave.

1047
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,660
They'll assume you were there, they're like,

1048
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,860
but I was by the door all night and never saw Boz leave.

1049
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,940
You could be in conversation for three minutes at a party,

1050
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,300
and then if you at some point turn, run,

1051
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,380
and just fucking tiger leap out an open window

1052
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:54,820
to the safe ground below.

1053
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,180
It has to be ground level.

1054
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,020
This isn't jackass, folks.

1055
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,220
You could set up a crash pad.

1056
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:00,520
Yep.

1057
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,740
Another good way of doing this is

1058
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,260
if it's a place that just has one restroom,

1059
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:12,580
you do the Ace Ventura thing, but before you use it,

1060
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,180
where you say like, do not go in there when I'm done with it.

1061
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,140
And then you go in and shut the door, and you do lock it,

1062
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,700
and then you do climb out the window and go home.

1063
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:27,300
And then people will be like, yeah, that's Boz.

1064
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:31,940
They just like went to the bathroom at this party one time.

1065
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,020
They were in there for three and a half hours.

1066
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:36,100
We never saw them again.

1067
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,100
We never saw them again.

1068
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,940
Here's a different one you could do.

1069
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,220
I just want to take that and kind of tickle its belly a little bit.

1070
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,580
Make it smile. Make it smile.

1071
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,340
Here's the thing.

1072
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,460
You walk into a room and say,

1073
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,980
woo, do not go in there like Ace Ventura,

1074
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,820
but the room you have just walked out of is nowhere near the bathroom.

1075
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:57,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1076
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,540
So that is one that you could do that people would not see coming.

1077
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,420
Justin, can I take that and just tweak it just a little bit?

1078
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,020
Turn up the knob just a little bit.

1079
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:07,940
Yeah, yeah. Crank it.

1080
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,220
Do that same thing, but-

1081
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,580
Hit the nos, baby!

1082
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,540
Do that and progressively move from room to room

1083
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,780
until you've herded everyone out onto the porch.

1084
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,660
And then you leave and maybe put like a big tent up over the house

1085
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,580
and say you're fumigating.

1086
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,180
This is why this is condemned.

1087
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,860
In the 90s, there was a period where every condemned home

1088
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,020
had a police officer stationed outside just repeatedly saying,

1089
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:37,140
do not go in there.

1090
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:37,540
Woo.

1091
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,340
Woo.

1092
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,020
It got a little mechanical eventually.

1093
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,660
But hey, that's all the time we have for our podcast.

1094
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,420
We hope you enjoyed yourself

1095
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,660
and we certainly appreciate you listening to it.

1096
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:50,420
If you are in the Cincinnati area, you should come and see us.

1097
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:52,260
There's still a few tickets left available.

1098
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,940
I think if you go to bit.ly forward slash 20 funny,

1099
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:59,540
you can get tickets to see us February 19th at the Taft Theater with Sawbones

1100
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,940
or February 20th, we're doing the Adventure Zone at the same venue.

1101
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,420
That link again is bit.ly forward slash 20 funny.

1102
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:12,020
Also, so as we mentioned earlier, our 500th episode is coming up

1103
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,980
and we wanna hear from people whose questions we have answered

1104
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,100
to get updates on how that all turned out.

1105
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,660
So if you had a question answered on the show,

1106
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:21,780
not just send in a question,

1107
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,180
but actually we like answered it on the show,

1108
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,580
email us at mbmbam at maximumfund.org

1109
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,220
and put in the subject line 500 app update

1110
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,940
and let us know how it turned out.

1111
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,700
If you followed our advice or if you didn't, anything like that.

1112
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,820
Let us know.

1113
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,140
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1114
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,060
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1115
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,380
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1116
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:51,620
You can just go get that wherever music is sold.

1117
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:55,060
And thank you to maximumfund.org for having us on the network.

1118
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,780
Go to maximumfund.org, check out all the great shows.

1119
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,980
And while you're there, get ready, get pumped, get psyched

1120
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,820
for the Max Fun Drive.

1121
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,700
It's coming up soon.

1122
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,540
We just recorded our bonus episode.

1123
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,740
It's a wild one and you're gonna love it.

1124
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:13,220
And it's a hell of a thing.

1125
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,820
And we'll tell you more about that as we get closer.

1126
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:19,220
But until then, hey, how about a final Yahoo?

1127
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:19,780
Do it.

1128
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,660
I love that, Griffin.

1129
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,620
This final Yahoo was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1130
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,420
Thanks, Adrian.

1131
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,340
It's Yahoo Answers user anonymous.

1132
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:29,780
So I'll call this one Sham Asks.

1133
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,740
What do you make of Gordon Ramsay?

1134
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,380
My name is Justin McElroy.

1135
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:42,740
I'm Travis McElroy.

1136
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1137
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:45,460
This has been my brother, My Brother and Me.

1138
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,420
Kiss your dad.

1139
00:57:46,420 --> 00:58:05,620
Let's go around the lips.

1140
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,220
Maximumfun.org.

1141
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,580
Comedy and culture.

1142
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,780
Artists owned.

1143
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,820
Audience supported.

1144
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,940
Hey, I'm Jared Hill, co-host of the brand new Maximum Fun podcast,

1145
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,660
Fantai.

1146
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,260
And I'm Travelle Anderson.

1147
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,340
I'm the other more fabulous co-host.

1148
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,180
And the reason you really should be tuning in.

1149
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,540
I feel the nausea rising.

1150
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,660
To be Fantai is to be a big fan of something,

1151
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:30,980
but also have some challenging or anti-feelings toward it.

1152
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,100
Kind of like Kanye.

1153
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,620
We're all fans of Kanye.

1154
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,620
He's a musical genius, but like, you know.

1155
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,820
He thinks slavery is a choice.

1156
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,580
Or like the Real Housewives of Atlanta.

1157
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:40,660
Like, I love the drama, but do I want to see black women

1158
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:41,620
fighting each other on screen?

1159
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:47,860
We're tackling all of those complex and complicated

1160
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,500
conversations about the people, places, and things that we love.

1161
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:53,060
Even though they may not love us back.

1162
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,860
Fantai.

1163
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,820
Maximum Fun.

1164
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:12,260
Podcast, meow.
