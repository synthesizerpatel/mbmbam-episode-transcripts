9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,040
none of you had shown up we could we could be watching Twin Peaks yeah I

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,480
would have been it would have been weird as we were watching the tickets sell for

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,480
this if it was just like still zero tickets sold well Twin Peaks is on that

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,200
night yeah we got that going for us I wanted them to buy the tickets but then

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,920
and it's real real slow though and I know you're wondering like right after

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,360
the scene where Andy steps on his wiener and falls in a big garbage that's David

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,160
hmm different now there's a man with the log I don't know it's just a big man

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,800
made of logs it's and he's got a psychic log girl and it's very different it's a

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,040
superhero thing David Lynch he's the master you gotta give him that shot for

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,160
Laura Palmer's back what and she's fine

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,920
I never explained I said to silence my phone and while I was doing that I got a

28
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,560
notification from my calorie counting app that was like hey you haven't logged

29
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,080
your dinner today and it made me realize that we had Lucy's fried chicken for

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,240
brunch and then we had fly right fried chicken for dinner we're gonna die yeah

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,440
so when I put that into the calorie app I'm gonna get like a notification that's

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:17,880
just like man you're not gonna try why do I have to be here so this is a this

33
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,120
is a weird question does anybody not listen to our show before okay cool and

34
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:31,320
you're weirdly excited so what we do on the shows we take questions from real

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,880
people just like yourselves and we turn them alchemy like into wisdom and we're

36
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,640
gonna start doing that well in a second after Travis interrupts apparently the

37
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,760
last third of the show we will also take questions from the audience yes but

38
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,280
there is one rule and that one rule is no bum sorry to the six of you who said

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,600
you hadn't heard the show earlier that must have been really scary for you yeah

40
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,480
the audience is gonna be less scary they promise so here's the first question

41
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,600
when my girlfriend wears a backpack she leaves it completely unzipped we live in

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,520
a city and I think someone will eventually just reach in and take

43
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,360
whatever is in there when I've addressed this with her she's responded with it's

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,440
easier to get things out when it's unzipped or don't tell me how to live

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,880
my best life how can I convince her to zip up her backpack or am I in the wrong

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:37,640
that's from debated in DC I've never are you here hey is she here and did she

47
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,560
bring a backpack all right all right she is here no backpack I've never

48
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,120
everybody I think who's listening to the show knows sort of my stance on taking

49
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:58,360
things but that said I was in a production of Oliver and you played I

50
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:05,800
played Oliver and I did he was I did I did pick a pocket or two it's a song I

51
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,800
remember that but I don't do that you give me a little bit of where is love

52
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:20,200
do you think is flawless cockney still it's really good that's really nice

53
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,480
Griffin but I don't do that shit in real life I just do it at babies are us and

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:32,640
stuff anyway but if I saw a backpack unzipped I couldn't help it just like I'd

55
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,560
assume it was one of those like bait cam things yeah but then an army vet saw

56
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
that her backpack was in there and you'll never believe oh shit John

57
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,840
Quinone steps out of the backpack like no tip to be fair to your girlfriend in

58
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,960
regards to the it's easier to get thing out of it that is true it's true

59
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,080
everyone yeah oh thank you oh it's like when you see those books outside of a

60
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,160
bookstore that are like for sale for like a dollar and it's like oh they want

61
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,040
you to take these yeah these are to be stolen there's no one standing outside

62
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,480
with those books those books are free if you bring them inside to pay for them

63
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:18,600
their reaction is all right maybe this is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy

64
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,880
where if something is in there and she's willing to let it just sort of fall out

65
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,120
yeah I just sort of flop out of there because it's open she doesn't care if it

66
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,800
gets so yeah I had said life-changing tidying up

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,520
is it smart joy no put it in my back back then yeah okay I don't really play

68
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,240
Yu-Gi-Oh anymore I'll just put these cards in my backpack my dump bag oh how

69
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,160
is your girlfriend or person that is here I guess I could just address your

70
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,400
so much more I'm looking into darkness how are you wearing a backpack that

71
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,160
having it unzipped makes it easier for you to get in it oh yeah notice kangaroo

72
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,640
style or regular it's one strap okay so it's a it's like a cool message like

73
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,360
spin it around like a bass guitar yeah it's like a Yu-Gi-Oh holster at that

74
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,200
point you just have a bandolier of shit you don't care about what if this guy

75
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,960
who vetted zippers came back to life and you were the first person he saw

98
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
be can you the house that's on for a second I just want to see a quick show

99
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,840
of hands on whether or not this question specifically is a sex thing and please

100
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,800
raise your hand if you think that this person is asking about a sex that's

101
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,800
maybe as 50-50 split I'm as surprised as anybody keep your hands up dirty birds

102
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,600
okay I'm gonna say this though there's a weird okay when they sold you guys your

103
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,480
tickets was there a like question on the website that was like pie stuff and if

104
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:18,640
you said yes you had to go to the balcony cuz y'all's 100% over there if

105
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,000
you want to fuck pies you go in the skies okay you can turn the lights off

106
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,200
now I'm getting a run by how attractive they are I saw this hysterical movie

107
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:41,840
once where there was a pie and a young man

108
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:50,400
and his name I swear to God was stiffy and he did the damn thing to it and they

109
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,080
called it the pie movie or something so can you give me a beat my beat recount

110
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:05,160
well it opens with stiffy doing the damn thing and I imagine at that point most

111
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,520
of the people just left the theater because they thought it was gonna be a

112
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,960
fun Don McLean thing he did did he do the is that what the Don McLean songs

113
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:22,640
about I hope so you think people get their noses broken a lot that way with

114
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,240
the pie thing because it seems like you'd be so overzealous about like

115
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,560
finally I got to do this thing I'm always wanted to do that you would slam

116
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,640
it so hard you break that break the nose I mean with like a pecan pie yeah how

117
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,840
many people how many people do you think a year die from pie to the face more

118
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,880
more than you think more than you think how many people do you think died

119
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,720
because someone didn't think about whether to use a hot filling pie or like

120
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:51,040
a cold cream oh you gotta be careful you'll never get that out

121
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,000
even the song cherry pie is about horny pie stuff for is it a simile just about

122
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,360
pies it's a cherry pie smash it in my face in my mouth and eyes pretty good

123
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,200
pretty good it's hot stick is sweet gonna smash it with my feet oh no wait

124
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,880
you you've gone astray where now they should have another one called very

125
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:31,800
weird out hey listen I didn't mean to yuck any yums there if you're into

126
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,560
what's up copy with you I know there's no judgment here it must be a hard world

127
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,440
out there and I'm here for you okay but nobody else is here's another question I

128
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
work in a middle school and use a room that is shared by several other

129
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
employees sometimes I have to leave my materials in there but usually it's safe

130
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,040
however my favorite pin which has a quote on it from the hit Broadway

131
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,120
musical Hamilton Hamilton went missing I assumed a student had taken it or thrown

132
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,160
it away but later that week I saw my boss using my Hamilton pin how can I

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,520
give it back without seeming like a dick and that's from missing musical

134
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:19,920
merchandise kill him somebody says Wow whoa it's a super musical but and I'm

135
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,680
now worried that like tomorrow this boss is gonna end up dead for completely

136
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,040
unrelated reasons the charming boys on stage said not to kill anybody don't

137
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,640
kill him if you're a reporter that's the story okay everybody tweet that out are

138
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,200
you here a person who had their pencil on yes that was actually sorry that was

139
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,840
actually a wailing cry of sadness they're here and they're having their

140
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,080
soul ripped from their body by a mystical gem

141
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:58,160
so just did a fatality on somebody in our fucking audience I mean let me ask

142
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,360
you this well what Hamilton do he would write his way out with his own fucking

143
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,920
pin that he would go get back from this person you could do that you go to him

144
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,680
be like hey I I'm gonna write my way out but there's one thing all right don't

145
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:21,440
have a pen help me out oh I solved it go to them see the pen note the pen say to

146
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,560
them oh you into Hamilton then the trap is set yeah cuz then they'll have to be

147
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,160
like yeah so much that I got a pen and lie or to and if they do that then you

148
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,160
gotta ask for what lyrics favorite song like their favorite bit from it like uh

149
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:49,440
mr. president huff huff my shorts if you think I couldn't even do one like fake

150
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,080
bar of a yeah but what if it turns out they aren't also just a super big like

151
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,440
I mean odds are they're probably a pretty big a little niche number that

152
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,080

podcast within a podcast

205
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,660
the headline of this USA Today story and I'm putting USA Today on blast on this

206
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:48,040
one too it's no you're not at Panera McDonald's introduces new artisanal

207
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,640

okay try trying something new huh well fuck you fuck you McDonald's yeah no

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,600
you're not Panera what they're saying is that you could eat a sandwich at

210
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,240
McDonald's and be tricked into thinking you're at Panera which is like if that's

211
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,200
all I thought you said no you're not Panera you know you're not at Panera

212
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,920
okay I don't think you hit that at enough that's um hey if that's your

213
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,840
range that's a pretty wild range of thing I mean it's no Panera it's

214
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,160
McDonald's but it's no Panera and that would also imply that you walked in just

228
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:53,200
you like no one is full it's McDonald I saw another story where I was looking

229
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,640
for this one that said that McDonald's pledges to have fresh beef quarter

230
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:05,840
pounders by the middle of 2018 so we're just gonna spend a year kicking it your

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,040
old meat that you've alerted us to those motherfuckers said they're gonna

with more food forward ingredients what hey guys I got a new thing we should try

238
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,960
to think about first and that's food we by the way I should take a quick sidebar

239
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,280
I did get to try these in a test market in Columbus and what the fuck wait no

240
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,040
this is unprecedented we the quote continues from Chris we need to bring

241
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,160
more food news like this in order to appeal to millennial customers who are

242
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:26,000
seeking who are seeking new taste experiences these days okay there's pico

243
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,760
on one of these sandwiches sorry there's a pico element on one of these bad boys

244
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,120
that is a new experience of McDonald's salsa boy I love being born in the late

245
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,000
80s to early thousands it makes me want McDonald's salsa what the fuck's wrong

246
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:52,800
with me I can't buy a house but boy what's a McDonald's a salsa CBS

247
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,000
irrationally hates me but that's okay cuz I can numb that pain with my good

248
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:05,000
McDonald's salsa you know this is the end of the quote and it's I'm pretty

249
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,600
sure it's a threat you should expect us to step up our level of menu innovation

250
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,640
in the u.s. in the years ahead that's coming for you Justin McElroy yeah

251
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
that's a fun thing of like to think that I'm gonna spend the next few years

252
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,160
somewhere in my head like I wouldn't when McDonald's steps up their

253
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,920
innovation I'm ready for it because they did warn me that for the years ahead

254
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,080
they're gonna be dipping their toes in and this was a news story published in

255
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,760
USA Today yeah this is a drag this is all I'm quoting directly McDonald's move

256
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,280
is the Panera ization stop of the more down market chain no more for value and

257
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,880
convenience in creative flavor combinations hey USA Today thanks for

258
00:25:51,880 --> 00:26:00,400
the elevator pitch on McDonald's go on and it's cheap too do you think that

259
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,240
that journalist walked into the editor's office and was like I've got an idea for

260
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,800
a story you'll never believe what McDonald's is up to

261
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,480
this is there more fast casual is a stolen market share from the fast food

262
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,340
segment said Jack Russo as senior analyst who covers McDonald's at

263
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,320
Deborah Jones cool job cool job when you see that's a competitor you think well

264
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,920
we can't completely transform who we are but we can steal some pages from their

265
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,800
playbook and then this guy goes into like why they why they can't make them

266
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:42,740
too good cuz it'd be expensive just like mom's kitchen that's too much money no

267
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,200
you get the weird pico de gallo can I do this other Yahoo yeah this is also

end that's there's an extra and he gets his wiener out during the basketball

302
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:34,640
scenes I don't think that is what I do think that hey there's a wiener in team

303
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,800
you just said I don't think that only happens liar or idiot no it's there's a

304
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:47,120
wiener in team wall wait what Michael J Fox is a teen wolf and he's about to go

305
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,560
in for a dunk and you look in the background and there's like kids sitting

306
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,800
on the bleachers one of them's just like here's my wiener forever okay I said

307
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,340
don't like don't obviously don't do that like we've been we've all been extras at

308
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,720
some point or other and that's it goes against the whole extra code you don't

309
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,060
see zombies and walking dead just like

310
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,000

Bridges yeah thank you thank you I thought so and I want to make this

313
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,920
observation do you think Bo had a moment when they called him for that role and

314
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:31,520
thought like do you mean Jeff because my brother Jeff Bridges basically is

315
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,160
already a werewolf like who's a more of a werewolf in Hollywood right now than

316
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,420

you say sure get it I often get asked what happened and almost as often that

391
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:22,560
question is followed up with saying a variation of too much jerking off

392
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,160
we did it everybody we did it Mike Mike that's all right that's our Oscar my

393

important if true

411
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,880
that episode of Seinfeld suddenly makes so much more sense so they weren't

412
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,120
actually masters of any okay okay cuz I was wondering where the domain was so

416
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:31,360
Davenport thank you true it is sadly germane yahoo answers user VA 2906 asks

417
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:37,000
what would it be like if humans were in a constant state of orgasm would it even

418
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,600
be possible to drive a car

419
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:59,240
somebody's yelling yes yes so I'm thinking you would actually probably

420
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,200
just establish that was your new baseline right like you would get you

421
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:14,120
eventually would you get used to it it's good to see you hey hey Frank you

422
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:29,600
ready go to sleep no are you hungry yeah this is a great point why did the car

423
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,160
question is so irrelevant it's like do you want to go to the movies and see

424
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:47,240
avatar not at all I'm good that's and that's what that bands all about that's

425
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,480
what ten roof rusted means what is it no it does it means I'm always orgasmic

426
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,400
wow that's some deep code they've got going on there you if we would have

427
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,160
never invented anything we wouldn't have invented the car certainly certainly not

428
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,480
no we wouldn't have invented it would have been like hey Carl I found out if

429
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,160
you rubbed some wood together it gets real hot I don't give a shit I'm good

430
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,540
I'm fine no it's cool we can make fire and cook our meat so we stop getting so

431
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:29,680
sick sounds like a lot of to me we all diet 17 it's fine that's fine it's 17

432
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,960
good ones okay wait what I've been this reverse mirror world when humans

433
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:53,080
orgasm was the only time they had like a moment's peace let's see it just be

434
00:42:53,080 --> 00:43:20,200
like what a great sandwich and then somebody be like I just I have to do

don't it's not a TED talk please don't line up behind them I'll call out from

466
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
the left side okay I see somebody at the end pointing to

467
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:48,520
themselves yes you yes in the hoodie yes yes you've done it hi what's your

468
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:55,360
name hi Alexa I work remotely and we have lots of conference calls with

469
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:03,640
people that I don't interface with mm-hmm some of them are older and don't

470
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,760
use normal terminology and one of the women on my team refers to people who

471
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,000
are not very intelligent as who has

472
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:25,360
so refers to dumb people as who house yeah like this who ha okay I'm so

473
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:32,440
delighted right now is there a question are you just like my co-workers so cool

474
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,480
no I feel obligated to say something hey look in that deep dark truthful mirror

475
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,560
do you really feel obligated to say something because if you did wouldn't be

476
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:55,160
asking us yeah look at me right now you don't do you what would you say that's

477
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,000
a really delicate question yeah it is a really delicate request yeah I think

478
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,800
that we live in a world where sometimes joy can be hard to come by and if you

479
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:10,800
if you ruin this font of pure light for people you have to live with that for

480
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,600
all of your days is what I think this is an important person this means something

481
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:25,080
if you work with a person who says things like who has or erroneously uses

482
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:33,160
the term bust a nut which we've talked about before and you change them and

483
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,280
that you've taken something from me you know cuz I might run into that person at

484
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,680
Trader Joe's one day and literally bump into them and they're like hey watch out

485
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,960
you who are maybe so angry I'm gonna bust a nut and I'm like thank you does

486
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,000
that fix everything just right just ride the wave just enjoy it it's great keep a

493
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:41,480
half years okay and years and so like I feel like I have to justify when I'm I'm

494
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,400
a younger person and so people are like oh that's so sweet you've been together

495
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,160
five years it's like well actually yeah we've been together 11 years because we

496
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:53,680
met yeah no it counts it's a big thing sure you know how can I kind of shorten

497
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:59,080
that say it's seven years yes what the difference that's a great point Justin

498
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:03,560
you just fucking let we're married a hundred years what yeah I've been

499
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:09,240
buttoned and I'm the oldest person on earth yeah or two Benjamin buttons

00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,800
aren't you glad we found each other you didn't see that in the movie he didn't

501
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,840
even look for another Benjamin button he was like I found a non button this will

502
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,120
be sad at the end I bet

503
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,640
are you a button by the way your bedroom button you are you have to tell

504
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,880
legally it's a trap just say you've been together for 11 years I if you said that

505
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,960
I wouldn't be like well married or dating how long have you actually been

508
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:53,080
a year or two there been a year in the middle where things were like and where

509
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,920
you're like don't count it as one of the years kind of one foot in one foot sort

510
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,360
of back in the cut a little bit where you can just kind of not really no no

511

so I think your king was bad yeah hey listen relationships are hard you've

512
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,160

513
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,880

518
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,120
a response from that we've been together five years now and his mom refers to a

519
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:59,920
lot of things that's who has not not correctly so here cause cult she calls

521
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,280
things in the last three days go on I really really want to correct her but he

522
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,140
says just let it go yeah I don't know if I should just let it go as she's my

523
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:26,440
mother yeah I think she's doing it on purpose

524
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,280
oh yeah our play thank you Travis that is of course the

525
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,080
correct answer yeah you're under psychic assault making words sound funny is

526
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,480
funny it's a thing that you do to entertain yourself she knows it's

527
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,080
collages she's the person who's been in the world for a number of years but she

528
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:55,480
says kolach keys cuz why not we're all gonna die someday so say shit wrong I

529
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:00,080
saw that word for the first time on a sign yesterday so maybe not everybody

530
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,160
is it college comes what now keep telling me I'm sure I'll get it right

531
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:12,280
here in a second I just call them what they are super banging pigs in a blanket

532
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,960
sounds good no listen there's nothing to be game here I mean there's like

533
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,800
literally nothing to begin just like let it slide cuz there you it is a no-win

534
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,380
scenario for you to try to correct this person just let it happen I know it's

535
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:29,680
painful but it's not your problem also nothing you have to worry about does

536
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:34,480
that and that was a neutral one I know I didn't help it was part of the course

537
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:41,240
okay sorry sorry we'll get a chance time I see somebody wearing a white short

538
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,040
sleeve shirt on the end on the oh wait there's two in the fight there's three

539
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:56,000
now fuck oh god they're multiplying he mean you might have oh yeah but the

540
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,920
blonde hair yes you've done now hey sorry that got really I didn't realize

541
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,760
how many people wearing white shirts that wanted to ask questions we're

542
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,400
sitting at the end of the aisle I would have thought don't worry okay what's your

543
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:16,080
name I'm Mads hi what's up okay so I work at a summer camp and I'm gonna be

544
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:22,600
actually I leave on Thursday for like three months oh sure goodbye yeah so

545
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:28,120
last summer I had to go by my last name it's kind of weird last name and a bunch

546
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,880
of the younger kids like the youngest kids we get are like six or seven or

547
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:33,960
whatever and they're like stay there for three nights and they all gave me a

548
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,200
really embarrassing nickname because some of like I had another girl on

549
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,440
staff who had the same first name as me so she got first name dibs for some

550
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:51,480
reason that sucks so all the little kids started calling me Rhino mom whoa what

551
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,800
goes with my last name I don't know it's stupid so I want to be cool this other

552
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,520
girl's not on staff this summer and how do I become how do I rename myself I

553
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:06,120
want to rebrand yeah how old are these kids again um they range from like six

554
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:16,680
and seven to like 18 yeah you can tell an 18 year old like don't call me Rhino

555
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,960
mom you're 18 you know empathy at this you wouldn't okay so you're you're cool

556
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,280
good good good good can I tell a quick sidebar real quick one time I was

557
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,080
filling out a job application to be a camp counselor cuz I thought I'd be

558
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:37,360
pretty good at it a bunch of laughter thanks you hurt my feeling I was filling

559
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:42,840
it out and I swear to God I hit a point in the application where it said this is

560
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,760
not your opportunity to experiment with growing facial hair and I said fuck this

561

564
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,240
all the staff members to call me either my first name or my last name so it's
