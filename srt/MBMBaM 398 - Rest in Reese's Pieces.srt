1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,280
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, the advice show for the

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,080
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,200
It's an exciting week for martial basketball. We got us, we, the herd, me and the guys,

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,080
got into the finals, the NCAA basketball finals for the third time ever and won our first

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,880
ever NCAA finals game. Hey, go herd. We are marshal. You know what? I've been thinking

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,680
about it. We are marshal. Last night, the herd was thoroughly drubbed by WVU to the surprise of,

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,560
oh, probably a few diehards, but like not me personally because I kind of suspected that,

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,520
that, you know, that full court press. You know, but we thundered, we thundered right to second

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,280
place in that match and that's how I like to think. In each basketball match, there's a first

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,160
place and a second place and you can't feel too bad about second place. But I don't bring you guys

16
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,960
here to talk about. What are we talking about? I don't want to talk about being in the paint and

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,120
dunkaroos and all the great basketball lingo. I want to address something that I don't know how,

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,680
it's kind of weird that we haven't addressed on this program before and I wanted to bring it

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,720
before you now. Are you two, my brothers, aware that the name of the coach of the thundering herd

20
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:19,360
is Dan Dan Tony? Wait, question. Are you aware of the fact that the coach of the thundering herd,

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,200
the basketball team in our hometown, and we have never brought this up, the man's name is Dan

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,880
Dan Tony. Okay, is it Dan? Yes. Separate word Dan, separate word Tony, like Tony, Tony, Tony?

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:43,680
No, it's as though his name is Dan, first name Dan, last name, capital D, apostrophe, capital A,

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,680
N-T-O-N-I. It's like a fantasy version of if his name wasn't just Dan Dan Tony.

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,240
He's an adventure zone NPC who we had a hard time naming.

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,880
This is like a Bond James Bond kind of thing. Well, no, it'd be a James Bond.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,600
That's right. Dan Dan Tony. Dan? Dan Dan Tony. Dan. Dan Dan Tony.

28
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,360
He's three men, and that's what makes him so great at coaching basketball. As we all know,

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:26,240
a full basketball team is three people, and he can just sort of divide. His Alar is so strong.

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,680
He divides his mind into three parts, and one is thinking about passing. The other one is thinking

31
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,680
about catching and shooting. The third one is thinking about blocking the defenders,

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,440
and he's a whole team in there in that brain. You seem a little off Dan Dan Tony.

33
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah, Dan too is thinking about lunch. You know how it is.

34
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:56,240
Now, I wanted to say that if he was the head of a crime family, he would then be Don Dan Dan Tony

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
is one thing I wanted to say is he would be Don Dan Dan Tony. Now, if he was the head of

36
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,000
a professional crime family who fought his way there by achieving a high rank in a martial art,

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,880
then he could be 5th Don Dan Dan Tony.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,920
But that is his plan as I've gotten.

39
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,960
But also, if he had written a Broadway musical that won some kind of award, he could be Don

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,840
Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

41
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:39,920
That is very good. He could be 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

42
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,400
I think that's all the Dan Dan Tony I have.

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,200
You think we could get more? Do you think we could get more?

44
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:59,680
If he was also a hat, you could say to someone Don 5th Dan Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner.

45
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,200
Yes, that's one thing you could say.

46
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,800
If he was in an early 90s hip hop group that created the hit single If I Had No Loot,

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
he could be and also was the other shit in the joke that I've already forgot.

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,280
He could be Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
I think that's as much as we can squeeze in there.

50
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,640
If you were only permitted to wear him at daybreak, then one thing you could say is

51
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,880
at Don Don 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

52
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,000
That's it, end of joke.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,400
And if that was a little bit too much, then you could say yours again, Justin.

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:57,280
Okay, at Don Don 5th Don Don Don Don Tony Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

55
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
And tone it down. Tone it down.

56
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,280
That's too much.

57
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,080
All right, so that was a very good joke about a college basketball coach

58
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,240
who is probably going through one of the worst days of his life right now.

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
But hey, he should feel good about their performance.

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
Nobody expected him to get that far.

61
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,000
Congratulations to the herd.

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Congratulations to at Don Don 5th Don Don Dan Dan Tony Tony award winner of Tony Tony Tony.

63
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:28,960
Tone it down.

64
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
So should we get the advice or we could talk more.

65
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,040
We I'm interested in talking more about college basketball if we want to sort of circle back

66
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,480
to the who's remaining in the NCAA tournament and just check out.

67
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,120
Thank you to everybody who submitted their questions for our special project.

68
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,600
We think that's going to be episode 400 probably.

69
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,880
Maybe yes.

70
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,520
We did a weird we had a weird day last.

71
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,880
We had a weird day last week and you will be privy to it all.

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,120
But for now it's 398.

73
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,480
So let's just ruminate in the the castle of sand that we've built for ourselves.

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Here we go.

75
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
Now I will just a quick preference.

76
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,040
This first question was of a question question, but I feel like it's it's fairly universal.

77
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,640
So I included it here in our regular episode.

78
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,280
I've made a habit of designating Saturday as my personal day of rest and self-care.

79
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,200
So the Bible says Bible says Bible says do that.

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
Bible says treat yourself on the Sabbath.

81
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, it's been great, but sometimes I struggle to turn off my power switch robot.

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,800
So I still want to robot alert everybody shut down the show.

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,440
I still want to look at my emails, look through Twitter for horrible news, do chores and read

84
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,280
watch things that I feel like I'm supposed to read slash watch instead of things I actually

85
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
enjoy.

86
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,120
I know some cultures have rituals that mark their day of rest, but I don't want to be

87
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
appropriate.

88
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,760
I do, however, want to send my brain the signal that it's OK to be chill for a day.

89
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,320
Suggestions as from tired and jittery in Jersey.

90
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,880
Can you buy a second phone?

91
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,240
That's sort of off-court buddy, a weekend phone, a weekend phone for Saturday and Sunday.

92
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,880
And on this phone, you delete a few essential apps.

93
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,160
The first you want to get off there is Twitter, of course.

94
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,720
And then if you really want to go whole hog, maybe just go ahead and take that off the

95
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,800
old working week phone as well.

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Holy shit.

97
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
I've just had a million dollar idea.

98
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,200
Maybe a billion dollars.

99
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
You could just let Griffin finish his bad idea, apparently.

100
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,960
His non-million dollar idea.

101
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,400
Well, Griffin gave it to me.

102
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,920
Just let yours accrue some interest.

103
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,080
Let me finish my six dollar idea.

104
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,560
OK.

105
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,600
The second app you want to delete off your phone is phone.

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Nobody needs to get a hold of you on Saturday.

107
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Nothing important ever happens on Saturday.

108
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,640
And then I, to be honest, I had other stuff, but I feel like the wind's really been taken

109
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,440
out of my sails.

110
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
This is my weekend phone.

111
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
It doesn't do phone.

112
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
It doesn't do Twitter.

113
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,840
And it has all the different kinds of Angry Birds installed right on it.

114
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,000
And they're happy birds because it's weekend.

115
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
I even got a legal download of Flappy Bird on here.

116
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,920
My cousin Rick put on it for me.

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
So thanks, Rick.

118
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
So here's my idea.

119
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,400
It's an app for your phone.

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,760
That is like Twitter.

121
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
But when you go to it, it just generates good news and tells you there's nothing going on

122
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
and go back to what you're doing.

123
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,040
And I call it Fritter.

124
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
This is, this is, so two things.

125
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,080
One, you think that the valuation of this idea is one million dollars.

126
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,360
Maybe even two million.

127
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,120
The second thing is that you thought it was worth interrupting my six dollar.

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,920
Well, because think about it.

129
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
So you get the impulse to check Twitter, right?

130
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
You go to Fritter and it's just like, yeah, nothing's happening.

131
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,040
So like you get, it's kind of like, you know, the nicotine gum of Twitter.

132
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,600
So you get your fix of going and checking Twitter.

133
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,400
But it's just all good news and like nothing's going on.

134
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,360
And you're like, oh, okay.

135
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,080
And then you can go.

136
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,080
And maybe Fritter also just like you program in times and it just shuts down.

137
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,320
It puts your phone in airplane mode from like a certain time to a certain time.

138
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
And you can't unlock it.

139
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,340
Yeah.

140
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,560
I mean, there's lots of ways that we can handle this.

141
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,920
We could just do a version of Twitter that every time you click on a tweet,

142
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,520
interact with a tweet or whatever, a Venga bus starts playing,

143
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,440
but it gets twice as loud with each sort of interaction you have.

144
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,800
And after a while, it'll destroy your home.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
It'll destroy the sound waves coming from your phone will blow up your house.

146
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,480
And so you can't, you just will be like, okay, that's enough.

147
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,960
I looked at three tweets and it's already like, I can't, I'm done.

148
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,640
I can't, I'm done.

149
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,200
There's nothing.

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,880
Is that the name of that song?

151
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,520
Yes.

152
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,880
I didn't know it had a name.

153
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,020
Yeah.

154
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,400
I just thought it was like one of the old ones.

155
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
It's just like a, wait, what?

156
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,200
Like one of the old ones, like Cthulhu.

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,800
Okay.

158
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,120
I love how hard you hit that word.

159
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,840
I've been sick.

160
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,200
Yeah.

161
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,040
You got to take care of yourself on the weekends.

162
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,560
I just looked, I've gone five days recording this on Monday.

163
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,400
I've gone five days without tweeting.

164
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,480
God almighty, it feels good.

165
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
Hey y'all, hey y'all listen.

166
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,600
I love interacting with y'all on Twitter and I love hearing from everybody.

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,680
And I read what you say from time to time.

168
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,720
Everybody delete Twitter from your phone right now.

169
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Stop listening to this and get rid of it.

170
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
You will be fine.

171
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,720
Do it on your computer.

172
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
You do it on your computer, but you come to Twitter when you're ready for it.

173
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Don't let it be like fucking in you, on you, around you, inside you,

174
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
in your lungs, in your brain, fucking 24-7.

175
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
That was one of my favorite things about being on the cruise, being on the Joku.

176
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,040
It was like my hand would go to Twitter and it was like the universe,

177
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,120
the cruise was saying, no, I'm not going to let you do this, Travis.

178
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm not giving you internet right now.

179
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:12,320
And I would instead interact with my friends in real life and like my wife

180
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
and myself and the world around me.

181
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,760
Gross.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,480
I know.

183
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
You would interact with.

184
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,520
I interacted with myself.

185
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,040
All right.

186
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
What do you mean?

187
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,880
Sea pervert.

188
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,080
One thing that also will actually help with this,

189
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,400
I don't know if you're into meditation at all,

190
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,960
but that could really help to give you control back over like the impulse.

191
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,720
Like to, it'll make your actions a lot more deliberate, I think.

192
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Even like 10 minutes of focusing on your breathing in and out in a relaxed position,

193
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,880
you're going to be a lot less compulsive, I think,

194
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,960
because a lot of what you're reacting to is like just lizard brain habit

195
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
that you do during the week.

196
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
So I think try a little bit of meditation to start today

197
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,560
and you may find you have a bit more control over the impulse to do some of this stuff.

198
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
And also plug your phone in and walk the hell away from it.

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,840
You'll be, the other shocking thing is how frequently like my desire to look at Twitter

200
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,720
is outweighed by my desire to not stand up.

201
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,880
It wins out every single time.

202
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,440
We need to, I feel like maybe recalibrate

203
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,640
because we just did a bunch of really good advice there and not jokes.

204
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,200
And people kind of, and they expect us to be like forward.

205
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,400
Dan Tantoni.

206
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
Forward on your phone and then you won't want to touch.

207
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,040
I assume they're still laughing about the Dan Tantoni stuff.

208
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,560
They needed some time to catch their breath.

209
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by level 9,000 Yajuru Drew at Drew Davenport.

210
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,560
Thank you, Drew.

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,720
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user,

212
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,680
but I'm going to call them Tony Tony Dan Dan asks.

213
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
That sounds like a fun nickname for Tony Danza.

214
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,240
Tony Tony Dan Dan asks.

215
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Magic to have a brother or sister.

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,760
And this is the first one of these I think I've ever seen

217
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,840
that doesn't have a fucking question mark at the end of it.

218
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,520
And it's freaking me the fuck out.

219
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,360
I thought that was automatically generated.

220
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,480
I do not know how this person has hacked the Yahoo Answers service

221
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
to get rid of the question mark,

222
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,800
but it just says magic to have a brother or sister.

223
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,160
Anyway, if you don't believe in magic, move on.

224
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,040
Wow.

225
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,800
How do you, how do you magically, how do you-

226
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm still here.

227
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:13,840
Yep.

228
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,040
How do you magically make your parents have a baby?

229
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
What spells can I use?

230
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,120
I see.

231
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,400
Magic to have a brother or a sister.

232
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,480
And you don't want to make a homunculus, of course,

233
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,920
because you could lose your arm, your leg, or your whole other brother.

234
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
And that's a, and I'm telling you-

235
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,680
But then you get a big like metal brother and that's fun.

236
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,440
It's not ideal, I'm just saying.

237
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,920
But he's like impervious to damage.

238
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah, but he can't, you know, interact with himself.

239
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,960
Listen, if you're trying to get a brother or sister,

240
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
you don't want to just do an even trade by,

241
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,880
you know, sending your other brother through the door.

242
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
Truth lasts forever.

243
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,960
That's true.

244
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,400
That's what I know about this.

245
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,520
So be careful.

246
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,760
You can give your, you could gift your parents

247
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,560
an all expenses paid weekend at beaches.

248
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,000
And that is a kind of magic.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,480
It's going to be worked on them in a big, big way.

250
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,080
Once they aren't worrying about buying their own cocktails,

251
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,520
the right sort of music comes on, the rhythm of the waves.

252
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,600
And I think your parents are going to be making love

253
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,920
before you know it.

254
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,840
And maybe use, magically use telekinesis to remove

255
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,560
from their luggage, their Jimmy caps.

256
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
Just right before they go out the door,

257
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,520
use that Matilda magic to just abscond with those Jimmy caps.

258
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,920
Hey, how come the kids never give the parents the talk?

259
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,200
You ever think about that?

260
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Yeah.

261
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,480
Yeah.

262
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,920
Just kid sits down and parent.

263
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,200
Listen, I want to tell you something.

264
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,520
It's going to blow your mind, dude.

265
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,200
Maybe you could also,

266
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,200
how old do you think that this question asker is?

267
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
Hmm.

268
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,880
I would rather not sort of,

269
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,880
I need to cover fire of a lot of different possible ages

270
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,320
that I could pretend I was assuming.

271
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
If they're young enough,

272
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
they could steal a baby and then not be tried as an adult.

273
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,560
So like-

274
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,440
That's not magic.

275
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,160
That is not magic.

276
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,880
That's not magic.

277
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Well, if they did like,

278
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,400
press a vegetation to steal the baby

279
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,320
and did like some like,

280
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,680
look over here, poof.

281
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,720
And then they were gone with the baby.

282
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,360
That's magic.

283
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah.

284
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
Yeah.

285
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,720
And then what they say to the parents

286
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,640
when they bring home this baby that's not theirs?

287
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
I found it in the fairy glen.

288
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Okay.

289
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,200
So that's not gonna fly.

290
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,360
Well, if the parents don't believe in magic,

291
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
they can move on.

292
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Are you sure you want a brother or sister?

293
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,400
Listen, I have a five week old.

294
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,000
It's a lot.

295
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,120
Are you sure you want to put that on your parents?

296
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,560
Like they have,

297
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,960
you talk a big game about wanting a magical brother or sister,

298
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,600
but like,

299
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
are you gonna put in the hours

300
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
to like change the diapers and everything?

301
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Question asker.

302
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,520
I'm not sure that you are.

303
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,400
No, of course not.

304
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,280
That's not magic.

305
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,680
But Justin, don't you like having brothers?

306
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,400
No, I do.

307
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,680
They're very profitable.

308
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,200
My whole career is based on this whole fraternal energy

309
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,080
that we've built here.

310
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,280
And I'm, and if you guys,

311
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,960
if anything happened to you guys,

312
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,440
I don't know how my net worth would ever recover.

313
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,840
That's a weird thing to say if you're deep in debt,

314
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,160
isn't it?

315
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,960
My net worth.

316
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you think that musical artists who create doing it songs,

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
like how does it feel by D'Angelo?

318
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,080
Untitled, how does it feel?

319
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,200
That is a kind of spell to create more brothers and sisters.

320
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,880
Yes, D'Angelo is like a bard.

321
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,720
Music engages like every part of your brain.

322
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
It's the closest thing to magic that we have here on this planet.

323
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah, I mean, that song in particular

324
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,680
just grabs me right by the donk, right by the donk.

325
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,800
We always put it in our pre-show playlist

326
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,240
and I'm not positive what we're trying to achieve with it,

327
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
always being in there, but.

328
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,760
I mean, it's a slammer and it's a jammer

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,560
and there's no denying that.

330
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,720
Yeah, but we bookend it with like,

331
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,240
you know, fun song, fun song, doing it song, fun song, fun.

332
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,600
Like, well, yeah.

333
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Well, yeah, I mean, Justin's into some weird like fucking ska zydeco

334
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,160
that is just a real hog slayer.

335
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,760
So we put that in there right after the how does it feel.

336
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,840
Just remind people they are at a comedy show

337
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,200
and it's not an appropriate place

338
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,040
to magically create a new brother or sister.

339
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,200
But if during that time period, like, what is it?

340
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,480
Untitled is what, four and a half, six minutes long?

341
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,440
It's like six minutes long.

342
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,960
Yeah, six minutes long, yeah.

343
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,080
That's fine.

344
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,760
That's like, you're good.

345
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,600
More than enough time.

346
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,920
I'm deeply uncomfortable.

347
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,800
How about another question?

348
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,400
You got it, baby.

349
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,880
My mom and I often go out to eat together.

350
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,600
I enjoy spending the time with her, except one thing.

351
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
My mom insists on bringing her own condiments

352
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,800
and I don't just mean ketchup packets.

353
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,300
Bruh.

354
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,240
As if that would be acceptable.

355
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
If we're going to a place like Arby's,

356
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,280
she'll bring Ziploc bags full of her own pickles.

357
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,400
Bruh, why do you want us to dunk on your mom?

358
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
Why do you want us to dunk on your mom?

359
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Why have you done this to your mom?

360
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
Tomatoes she doesn't like the ones they have.

361
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,040
Oh my God.

362
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
And the things like salad dressing, ketchup,

363
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,040
barbecue sauce, et cetera.

364
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
She'll often bring sauces from other fast food places

365
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,160
that she likes better.

366
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,640
Bruh.

367
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,080
She also brings baggies full of candy and cookies for dessert.

368
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,560
Oh my God.

369
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,360
Why do you offer your mom up as tribute?

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:29,680
This is-

371
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,440
She says that this is all perfectly normal

372
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,760
and no one in the restaurant will notice her doing this.

373
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
It's not they do.

374
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,920
It's not perfectly normal.

375
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,720
She knows that.

376
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
Your mom's fucking with you if she thinks it's normal.

377
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,560
Your mom's welcome to do whatever she wants.

378
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,400
She's an accomplished lady and a mom and a hardworking woman.

379
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,160
She knows that this is messed up.

380
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,600
Should I be embarrassed to be seen with this picnic arrangement

381
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
or is she right that it's no big deal?

382
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,200
Help!

383
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
That's from Condiment Crisis in Tennessee.

384
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
There's, oh my God.

385
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,720
There's two parts to this.

386
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,520
One, your mom is a flavor pioneer

387
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,560
and she's on some next level shit and-

388
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,160
Why don't they have pickles at Arby's?

389
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,600
What are you gonna fucking pair roast beef with a pickle?

390
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,320
No.

391
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,600
Because they're so restrained otherwise at Arby's, Griffin?

392
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah, okay.

393
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,120
They have, we have the meat.

394
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,640
We don't have the old vegetables that we got all vinegary and weird.

395
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,920
Okay.

396
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
Your mom's on some next level shit.

397
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,560
I will not deny that.

398
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,040
They're like, they're but for the grace of God.

399
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,920
I would absolutely love to bring,

400
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,760
you know, some McDonald's ketchup to the BK

401
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
because their ketchup is a fucking joke.

402
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,800
I get it.

403
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,320
That's the first thing.

404
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,560
The second thing though is that this is a social crime.

405
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,280
This is not, this is not how we do things here.

406
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,480
Around these parts, we don't bring pickles to Arby's.

407
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,560
As much as I would love to, we can't.

408
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:53,360
And we, one person cannot sort of,

409
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,520
that does not represent a groundswell to a social crime.

410
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,400
Groundswell to sort of change the societal norms

411
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,640
under which we have all been crushed.

412
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,720
And the Arby's Corporation has invested a lot of money

413
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,160
in making sure that their dishes taste good

414
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,240
to the highest number of consumers.

415
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Like, where do you get off going behind Arby's back and being like,

416
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
I think one thing would be pickles.

417
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,520
Like, no, you don't actually.

418
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
But what if Mr. Arby's sees that?

419
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Mr. Arby's sees the pickles and is like, pickles.

420
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,280
Of course.

421
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,320
Oh, it's a nothing you do situation now.

422
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,000
But then it's like this embarrassing thing

423
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
because Arby's don't have pickles.

424
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,760
Where Arby's is like calling McDonald's like,

425
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,400
hey guys, this is hard for me,

426
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,880
but like, where the fuck do you get pickles?

427
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,480
Where do you get them pickles?

428
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,320
Where do you even get pickles?

429
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
Which, which part of this?

430
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,120
Okay, that's why they won't offer pickles, by the way.

431
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,280
They just don't know.

432
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,240
They take forever.

433
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,960
We try to do it.

434
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,120
We put a bunch of cucumbers in a barrel

435
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
and it takes forever.

436
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,200
We don't know what we're doing.

437
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
We don't have time for that.

438
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
We don't have time for any of this.

439
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,720
Which, which aspect of this is more upsetting?

440
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,560
Bringing something that the restaurant

441
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
like Arby's doesn't have

442
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
or bringing something they do have

443
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,960
but you like your version better.

444
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
So bringing pickles, they don't have pickles,

445
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,920
but bringing tomatoes because your tomatoes are better.

446
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Which one of those?

447
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,680
This is, this is mommy's special horsey sauce.

448
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,480
I can't, I can't decide which one,

449
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,160
if I was an Arby's employee

450
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,320
who took a lot of pride in my work,

451
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,160
which one I would be more upset by.

452
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,840
You would not get the opportunity to see both.

453
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
Cause if I see one, either objects we do not have

454
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,440
or objects we do have that you prefer elsewhere,

455
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,160
I would have called the police after the first one.

456
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,720
You know?

457
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,160
Maybe it's that you think

458
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,840
like McDonald's tomatoes taste better on Arby's sandwiches

459
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,800
but Arby's tomatoes taste better on Subway sandwiches

460
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,800
and you're just rotating your tomatoes around.

461
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,160
Get it together, guys.

462
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,320
Teamwork makes the dream work.

463
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,040
Call each other.

464
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,560
You got the wrong tomatoes.

465
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,720
It's a, it's a parent trap situation.

466
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,760
I, I actually find myself the most disturbed

467
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,360
by bringing her, like the idea of being in Arby's

468
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,840
watching someone finish their Big Montana

469
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,160
and then reach into their bag to,

470
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,400
it's like the Arby's waiter comes over like,

471
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,440
we all done here?

472
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
And like, can I bring you anything else?

473
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,680
Can I get you anything else?

474
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,920
No, actually it's time for dessert.

475
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,040
And then just extracting a bag of hard candies

476
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
and that your mom sits there and eats

477
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,080
in the middle of Arby's.

478
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
That's very upsetting to me.

479
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,200
I think, I cannot admit, I cannot admit.

480
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,880
Okay, your mom knows what she's doing

481
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,920
and this may be all to irritate you, which is great.

482
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,720
Very good for me.

483
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
Here's the, I also just want to dispel one thing too.

484
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,320
When your mom says that no one will notice,

485
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,200
I've worked many, many jobs in my life.

486
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,840
And after a while, any new, any new information

487
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
that comes into the place that you work,

488
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,600
you immediately latch on to,

489
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
because it's different than everyday else.

490
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,640
So I guarantee the crinkle of a plastic bag opening,

491
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,600
zip, like they are, they are honing in on that

492
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,280
like a Peregrine Falcon.

493
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,400
That is, that is, that is drawing all of their attention

494
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,280
and they were going to talk about for weeks,

495
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,520
the person who brought pickles into Arby's.

496
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,280
I don't think you should rob culture of your mom.

497
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,240
Like, I think that like if I was seated across the,

498
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,480
I mean, I would never eat inside an Arby's.

499
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,160
I don't understand, I don't understand it.

500
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,920
But if I did eat in Arby's and I saw a woman

501
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
using her own condiments in a,

502
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,040
and extracting pickles from a baggie she brought from home,

503
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,760
that would like be all I talked about for the next two days.

504
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,600
And your mom is giving that gift to people every single day.

505
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,520
Like she's just grinding it out

506
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,680
and making other people's lives delightful.

507
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,360
And like, I don't understand why we're always rushing

508
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,080
to sort of sand the rough edges down off of humanity

509
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,320
when it's not hurting anybody.

510
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,880
It's just a delightful thing for everyone to enjoy.

511
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,520
Maybe just enjoy these eccentricities of your mother

512
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,600
because like this is a fun thing

513
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,080
that makes your mom special to you

514
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,560
and not something that like you need to change about her

515
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,880
to make her more bland.

516
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,680
But she's not stealing from the Arby's.

517
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,960
And even if she was,

518
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,560
now she's some kind of, you know, Arby's cat burglar.

519
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,200
And that's also interesting in its own way.

520
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
Or maybe just bring like a privacy curtain

521
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,520
that you can put up and then whatever you do,

522
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,280
vis-a-vis pickles and homebrew condiments behind the curtain

523
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,600
is nobody's business but yours, your mom's and God's.

524
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,000
There's gonna come a day when Arby's is out of ketchup

525
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
and they don't have any.

526
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,680
And it's gonna be very embarrassing for Arby's

527
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,040
and the people there in Arby's.

528
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,120
And your mom's gonna be like, hey, boo, do not trip.

529
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
And she's gonna extract four different catch-ups

530
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,400
for you to enjoy.

531
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,720
And on that day, your mother will be the hero of Arby's.

532
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
Now, will she share with other people?

533
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,720
I'm sure she would.

534
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,120
She's a very generous, particular woman.

535
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,200
I'm sure she will share.

536
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
But that day, it will all make sense.

537
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
That will be your signs.

538
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,840
That will be your swing away, Russ.

539
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,160
This will be why it all makes sense

540
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,280
and why it's all been happening

541
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,320
leading to that exact moment when your mom's the Arby's hero.

542
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,800
I do wanna say, I remember hearing on the news

543
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,240
when KFC ran out of chicken, your mom came in

544
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,560
like some sort of legendary samurai

545
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,960
and came in and was like, let me get some chicken.

546
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,160
They're like, we don't have any chicken.

547
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
And she was like, oh, it's fine.

548
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,680
And then she pulled out a big old hefty bag

549
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,080
full of raw chicken meat that she carries with her

550
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
because she prefers her raw chicken meat to KFC's.

551
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,600
And that is the story of how she became

552
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,720
the new Colonel Sanders.

553
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,200
Sorry, Reba, it was a short run,

554
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,720
but Greg's mom here needs the hat.

555
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Does Colonel Sanders wear a hat?

556
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,840
We're not even sure.

557
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,920
When it's sunny, a lot of people don't talk about the fact

558
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,840
that Arby's will fry up whatever meat you bring them.

559
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,120
A lot of times after a big day, no questions asked.

560
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,400
A lot of times when I have a big day of fishing,

561
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,320
I'll bring in my catch of the day

562
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
and what kind of fish?

563
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,280
What? Delicious rainbow trout.

564
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,800
And then I'll gut it right there on the floor of the Arby's.

565
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,480
I'll lay out some newspapers.

566
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,360
It doesn't do anything, but I wanna look polite.

567
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
I'll gut it right there.

568
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
I'll slop the carcass onto the counter

569
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,800
and I'll say, fry it up right for me, Curtis.

570
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,120
Because Curtis is my guy at the Howgrier Arby's.

571
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,120
Fry it up right for me, Curtis.

572
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,640
And no questions asked.

573
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,560
He will season it to perfection.

574
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,000
He will scale it to an extent.

575
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,960
You are gonna get some scales because it's still Arby's.

576
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,760
It's just Curtis.

577
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,200
It's just Curtis.

578
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,240
He's doing his best.

579
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,520
He doesn't do this a lot, but then they'll fry it up for you

580
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,560
and make a great seafood dinner for you and your family.

581
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,160
Man, I am thinking Arby's right now.

582
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah, no, I am kind of fucking hungry.

583
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,080
This always happens to me.

584
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
Arby's, how about that sponsored episode?

585
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
Yeah.

586
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,040
Can you get at us, please?

587
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,480
Come on.

588
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,600
Everybody tweeted Arby's.

589
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,480
I know they're down.

590
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,400
I know they're down to clown.

591
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,480
When the Adventure Zone arc, when the Balance arc ended,

592
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,920
they tweeted about it with a little image they made

593
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,720
of Arby's props dressed up as our characters.

594
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,400
They definitely are down to clown.

595
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,880
They know our style.

596
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Give us some money to talk about Arby's for an hour.

597
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,840
Come on.

598
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,720
Come on.

599
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,920
The problem is we've been giving them

600
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,680
all this free advertisement.

601
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,440
We've got to withhold from it.

602
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,080
You know what?

603
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,040
400 to 500, no Arby's mention unless we see that cheddar.

604
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,560
Fucking lockout.

605
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,240
Shut it down.

606
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,640
Or pay us in a mountain of freebie coupons

607
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,280
that we can give away to listeners at live shows.

608
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,200
I will accept that payment if you just sent us

609
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,320
a mountain of coupons.

610
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,360
Anyway.

611
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
No, I would love money, actually.

612
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,320
Money would be great, too.

613
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
Half and half, 50-50.

614
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,280
Because I think there is a sort of revenue split

615
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,240
we do with Max Fun.

616
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
And if we show up to Jesse's door with a fistful

617
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,480
of Arby's coupons and say, like,

618
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,560
did we do it good this time?

619
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,840
I think he would be very disappointed.

620
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,800
I know, Jesse.

621
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,480
He's going to go fucking hog wild.

622
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,040
Get some motts sticks, some potato cakes.

623
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,840
Some Buford's.

624
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,400
Couple Bufies.

625
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,320
He's going to take his entire beautiful family

626
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,640
to an all-you-can-eat buffet at Arby's of his own creation.

627
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,240
Um, anyway.

628
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,160
Dad's treat.

629
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,400
This one's on the McElroy's.

630
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,800
Everybody get all the beef you can handle.

631
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,560
God bless us, everyone.

632
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,280
Uh, let's go to the Money Zone.

633
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:02,720
Yes, absolutely.

634
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
Hey, I want to tell you about MeUndies.

635
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,640
These are mine.

636
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,840
They're my undies.

637
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,040
But you can have them.

638
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,840
You can have them, too.

639
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,280
They're a great balance of comfortable fit

640
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,240
and exciting prints.

641
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,520
They use a sustainably sourced, naturally soft fiber

642
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
that starts with beechwood trees

643
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,440
and ends with amazingly soft fabric.

644
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,480
MeUndies adventurous prints are all limited edition

645
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,320
and new patterns are released every few weeks.

646
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,120
go to MeUndies.com slash my brother.

655
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,600
That's MeUndies.com slash my brother.

656
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,720
I also want to tell you,

657
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,800
I want to tell you about Squarespace.

658
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,840
Squarespace.

659
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,880
Okay, here's the thing.

660
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,800
I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

661
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,640
I use it for a lot of different projects

662
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,400
and you've probably heard me talk about that before,

663
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,760
but don't tune me out.

664
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,440
Please, please keep listening

665
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,800
because Squarespace is great.

666
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,840
It's so intuitive, easy to learn, easy to use,

667
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,760
and easy to make a really amazing website

668
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
that's going to impress both your friends

669
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,160
and also professional people

670
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,240
who are maybe looking to hire you or pay you for things.

671
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,280
You can publish blogs or other content.

672
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,200
You can sell products and services.

673
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,480
You can announce an upcoming event or special project,

674
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,400
which is something we use it for a lot.

675
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,520
And it has beautiful customizable templates

676
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
that help you create,

677
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,040
that are created by world-class designers

00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,680
and everything is optimized for mobile right out the gate.

679
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,160
So you don't have to do any kind of special arranging

680
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,560
or worry about how it's going to show up on phones.

681
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,840
It's easy.

682
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,520
And they have built-in search engine optimization

683
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,120

692
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,080
I want to tell you all about Ready Set Comedy.

693
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,800
It gives listeners advice on everyday situations.

694
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,000
Wait a fucking second.

695
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,960
Hmm.

696
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
You can find us wherever you listen to podcasts.

697
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,680
I can't stress this enough.

698
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,120
No one else is doing this.

699
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
We're very original.

700
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,680
We did not steal this idea.

701
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,080
Listen to our very unique podcast, Ready Set Comedy.

702
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,440
It's one of a kind.

703
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,360
Okay, we may have borrowed it slightly,

704
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,400
but it's still very original.

705
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,640
Well, not the very first,

706
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
but we didn't know that when we started.

707
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,960
Fine, we straight up stole the premise from a Bim Bam.

708
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,040
And it says, so very sorry.

709
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,000
So that's Ready Set Comedy who stole our shit.

710
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,760
You can find them wherever podcasts are

711
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
and in court with us soon.

712
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,240
So we'll see you all in court.

713
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
I have a Jumbotron message.

714
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,080
This one's for Liz Ard and it's from a secret fan.

715
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm very nervous now.

716
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
Let's read the message.

717
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,280
Thanks to the members of the trash heap

718
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,120
for being a bunch of ridiculous nerds

719
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,160
over the past year and a half.

720
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,280
I hope the future is full of memes, role-playing discussions,

721
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,480
and even more memes until we achieve world domination

722
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,640
in the name of our glorious lizard queen.

723
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,120
Oh no.

724
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

725
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,800
I mean, finding out about the glorious lizard queen is rough,

726
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,920
but when anytime an anonymous message shows up on the show,

727
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,920
I get very nervous, but this was pretty benign.

728
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,960
So thank you for that.

729
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
This next message is from Joseph

730
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,160
and it's for Tyler and the TSG family.

731
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,480
Shout out to my boy Tyler and all of my TSG family

732
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,680
for introducing me to the brothers through Monster Factory

733
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,160
because they've gotten me through some very tough times.

734
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,040
Also Tyler, you're a freak and I'm gonna eat you.

735
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Probably an inside joke.

736
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,520
But if it's not, get out of there, Tyler.

737
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
Tyler, run, run, Tyler, run.

738
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,560
And TSG family, get out of there.

739
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,280
Get out of there.

740
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,400
The whole crew.

741
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,000
Hey guys, this is Adam Conover.

742
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,720
You may know me from my true TV show, Adam Ruins Everything.

743
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,600
Well, guess what?

744
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,720
Now we're doing a podcast version right here on Maximum Fun.

745
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,440
What we do is we take all the interesting, fascinating experts

746
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,520
that we talked to for just a couple of minutes on the show

747
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,920
and we sit with them for an entire podcast.

748
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,720
Really going deep and getting into the fascinating details

749
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,680
of their work.

750
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,320
Find Adam Ruins Everything wherever you get your podcasts

751
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,920
or at MaximumFun.org.

752
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Here's a Yahoo that I got from level9000.

753
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,720
And maybe we don't want to do this one as anonymous user.

754
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,080
I'm gonna call him Rod asks,

755
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,920
on the podcast, my brother, my brother and me,

756
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,600
how do you tell which one is talking?

757
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh.

758
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,240
I've listened to many episodes and clips of my Bim Bam

759
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,960
and watched the show and I can still never tell who is talking.

760
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,200
If I'm actively trying, I can distinguish Griffin,

761
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,920
but I have never once known if it is Justin or Travis.

762
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,400
Please, I know fans mind this forum for content.

763
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,800
Is there a hack or a guide or anything?

764
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,640
Well, I think maybe one of the issues people run into is

765
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,920
I also don't know which one of us is talking at any given time.

766
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,280
And that's why I interrupt so much.

767
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,040
Cause sometimes like Justin will be talking

768
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,320
and I'll think that's me talking.

769
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,200
It's just you.

770
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah.

771
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:02,720
And that's-

772
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,600
I'm not going anywhere.

773
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,560
I shouldn't interrupt myself.

774
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah.

775
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,600
What am I saying?

776
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,480
This is garbage.

777
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,440
This is a bad joke.

778
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,840
Griffin, here's the first thing I'll say,

779
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,920
it doesn't fucking matter who cares.

780
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
It really, it really doesn't fucking matter.

781
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,840
It doesn't matter which one of us is talking.

782
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,000
Yeah, this is a widespread problem.

783
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
We're very, yeah, we get this all the time.

784
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,080
Like we're very rarely giving in order instructions

785
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,320
on how to like fix your kitchen sink or something

786
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,560
that would necessitate proper order

787
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,640
and you really being clued into who the advice is coming from.

788
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,600
Just like, it doesn't fucking matter.

789
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,800
I do get tweets that's just like,

790
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,320
dude, your whole mango shit,

791
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
that was a real funny run, dude.

792
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,640
See, but at least that's on the same show

793
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,240
because I get tweets a lot that are like,

794
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,600
I love you on Sawbones.

795
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,440
And that's not me.

796
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,000
I also don't do Monster Factory or quality control.

797
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,680
That's Justin.

798
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,920
Damn, dude, what do you do?

799
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,080
Someone once tweeted that they don't listen to Schmanners

800
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,520
because they don't like me.

801
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,200
And it's like, well, hold on a second.

802
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,960
Don't listen.

803
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,600
Give it a chance.

804
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,560
I'm not on that shit.

805
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,080
I don't know if we want to do this one.

806
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,440
I would love to hear, no,

807
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
I have to hear what people have answered.

808
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,480
Oh, there's no answers.

809
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,920
So that's bad for us.

810
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,520
That's not good for our brand, I would say.

811
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,520
Here's another Yahoo.

812
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,960
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

813
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,520
Thank you, Adrian.

814
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,680
It's Yahoo Answers user Blue who asks,

815
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,800
is there anything you're not allowed to write on a headstone?

816
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,400
Can you say, and then there's four asterisks here,

817
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,840
so I'm gonna assume it says piss

818
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,400
or any other swears on a headstone.

819
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,160
What about any sexual references?

820
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,760
Is it all right if it's only implied?

821
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,000
For example, oh, gross.

822
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,480
For example, least exciting hole I've ever been in.

823
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,240
I'd prefer a real answer because I'm genuinely curious,

824
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,600
but if you have a funny reply,

825
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,680
I'm not gonna rain on your parade, dude.

826
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:06,160
What can you put on, what can you not put on a headstone?

827
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,560
Cause I've never seen one where you're walking through

828
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,920
and it's just like, you know,

829
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,600
Billups, January 14th, 1930 to 2005.

830
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,520
And then it's like, you know,

831
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,240
Jermichael and then a couple of dates and then you walk

832
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,560
and then there's one that's just like ass.

833
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,920
And that's all it says.

834
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm dead.

835
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,840
Oh, fuck.

836
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,040
Can you put whatever name you want on there?

837
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,840
Like, could I just put like Elvis Presley on mine?

838
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,680
Oh, that's really fun.

839
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:35,920
Right?

840
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,280
And then people will be walking by like,

841
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
oh, these are so, huh?

842
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,720
Wait, there's no, there's no way, right?

843
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,000
It could be like that, what's it called?

844
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,680
Lentricular pattern where like,

845
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,640
depending on what angle you're looking at the headstone,

846
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,520
it says different stuff.

847
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,720
So you look at it from the left and it says like, you know,

848
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,480
Elvis Presley, but then from the right side,

849
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,440
it's like, nah, I'm just kidding.

850
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,160
It's Travis.

851
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,120
Nah, just Travis.

852
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
But major look.

853
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,520
One thing you want to avoid is timeliness.

854
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,560
Like you often will see headstones with big barcodes on them

855
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,760
and they say like, scan this with your cue cat for free coupons.

856
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,720
It's like, nobody has a cue cat anymore.

857
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,280
And nobody even listening to this podcast knows-

858
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,040
Knows what the fuck you're talking about.

859
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,440
How much do I have to pay to make my headstone a poke stop?

860
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,400
Is that still a thing?

861
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,320
Remember me.

862
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,160
I know how to make the kids remember me

863
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,040
by handing out free potions and poke balls.

864
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
When you come and pay your respects,

865
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,080
there's a Lugia boss fight happening

866
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,080
at Travis's final resting place.

867
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,200
Come on teens, gather round.

868
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,120
I dropped a lure at Travis.

869
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,200
He died as he lived.

870
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,360
Surrounded by teens staring at their phones.

871
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,120
That's a good one.

872
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Can you do Calvin pissing on the adjacent headstone?

873
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,800
Oh my god.

874
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,440
It's so good.

875
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,720
Like an eternal flame, but with water or piss.

876
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,080
No, I'm not saying literally spray the headstone.

877
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,040
Not like a fountain.

878
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,520
No, erosion would be a factor at that point.

879
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,120
We don't actually want to erode.

880
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
That seems rude.

881
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
But it would be less rude as if the cartoon boy Calvin

882
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,200
was pissing on Billups tombstone immediately next door.

883
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,200
And then the Billups family would come and say like,

884
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,760
did you just fucking see this?

885
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,480
Did you fucking see this shit?

886
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
They can't do that, right?

887
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,120
Well, there's no law in the books.

888
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,520
So I've bought the plot of land, right?

889
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,360
Maybe I go buy it today.

890
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:46,960
Can I build a tiny house on it now with just a trap door

891
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,480
in the living room when you start to feel real close?

892
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,200
Yeah.

893
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,800
And then I just drop out the bottom.

894
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,320
And then my tiny house becomes my Ozymandias tombstone.

895
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,680
Look upon my tiny house.

896
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,920
Can I get a vending machine that is constantly restocked

897
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,160
with Snickers bars, and whatchamacallits,

898
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,880
and handicapped's hottest fries, and Takis,

899
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
but also just little pamphlets just sort of describing

900
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,920
my sort of adventure?

901
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,160
Those would be a couple better, I'm assuming.

902
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
No, they would be 35 cents.

903
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Same price as a bunch of mints, but I

904
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,920
got to cut a profit some way.

905
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
Got to restock this thing, don't I?

906
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm just saying you're walking through the graveyard.

907
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,880
That's hungry work.

908
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,840
And then you see one, and you don't get a lot out

909
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,480
of the tombstones.

910
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,200
You pretend to.

911
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,000
It's just like, oh, Frederick, long life, probably

912
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,360
in a couple of the big wars.

913
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,600
What a great life.

914
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,120
But really, you're just thinking like,

915
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,600
I wish this tombstone was full of whatchamacallits

916
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,280
and Snickers bars.

917
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,720
I'm here to satisfy.

918
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,880
Forever.

919
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,520
Forever.

920
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
That would be a good thing to put on your tombstone.

921
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm here to satisfy.

922
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,040
Or maybe it just has treasure with an arrow pointing down.

923
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,960
And a question mark.

924
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,000
So that way it's like, are you sure?

925
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,640
Is it worth it?

926
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
Maybe come back when it's dark.

927
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,600
Dig me up.

928
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,960
Get me out of here.

929
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,960
Here is another question.

930
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,520
I went to surprise my friend by going to their house

931
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,640
since I haven't seen them in a while.

932
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,280
But instead of them, I scared their mother half to death

933
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,200
and learned they were out in a movie.

934
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,160
Now I've been sitting in their bedroom for four hours

935
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,040
waiting for them and I think their family thinks I've left.

936
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,280
I'm afraid to suddenly walk downstairs to take my leave

937
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,120
and scare them again as well as make them think

938
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,560
I was just snooping slash loitering

939
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,760
in their child's bedroom.

940
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,640
How do I leave?

941
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,840
Should I suck it up and go downstairs?

942
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,600
Wait till everyone is asleep to leave?

943
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,200
Stay the night and leave when everyone has gone

944
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,920
in the morning?

945
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,240
Help.

946
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,880
That's from Confined in Cleveland.

947
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,000
What have you done?

948
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,600
What have you done to me?

949
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,480
What have you done to me?

950
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,240
Griffin is there now.

951
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,040
Now I'm there.

952
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,880
I'm in the room too because you put me there

953
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,760
by making me hear this and now I'm in the moment

954
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,520
and I'm feeling everything you're feeling

955
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,080
and it's a nightmare.

956
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,440
How could you do this to Griffin?

957
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,160
Why can't we ever get a question that's just like,

958
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,360
why can't we just get a question that's just like,

959
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,720
I went to a candy store and they were having

960
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,120
an everything's free sale and then I'm there

961
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,800
with my mind astral projecting into the listeners experience

962
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,320
and I'm like, candy tape.

963
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,160
Maybe we should just do one episode

964
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,600
that's all people sending in like,

965
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,720
I found myself in a social, like a social situation

966
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,760
and I handled it and it wasn't a problem at all

967
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,360
and you don't need to worry about it.

968
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,440
And then I'm there and I'm role playing

969
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
what it would be like to be able to handle

970
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,840
literally any social situation expertly.

971
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,840
I just, I'm confused about the timeline.

972
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,160
Okay.

973
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,720
You got there, the mother was like, ah.

974
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,200
Yeah, were you trying to sneak into the house?

975
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,640
It's div up, ah.

976
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,440
And then you're like, hey, I was here to see Flinchin

977
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,360
and they're like, I'm sorry, div up,

978
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,720
Flinchin's at a film and then were you like,

979
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,760
I'll wait in their bedroom.

980
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,720
Like, I don't understand how you got to the point you're at.

981
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,320
Did you sneak behind the mother

982
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,920
while she was making a sandwich?

983
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,960
Like, I don't understand how you got into this situation.

984
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:17,920
Okay, because, I'm sorry, divim.

985
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,600
Here's divim, was it?

986
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,400
Here's the problem.

987
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,120
It's divim.

988
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,520
Divim.

989
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,960
Divim and Flinchin.

990
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,760
Divim.

991
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,920
There was a moment where the mother in question

992
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
probably awkwardly said something like,

993
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,760
would you like to wait for them?

994
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,120
And what you should have done is said, no.

995
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,560
No, I do not.

996
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,800
Because I have things I could be doing.

997
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,240
No, just tell them I stopped by and tell Flinchin

998
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,480
to give me a call when they're back.

999
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,920
The other thing I need to know about this is,

1000
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,840
all right, did you go like down the block

1001
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,440
or is this like a grand gesture,

1002
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,360
three-hour road trip kind of thing?

1003
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,240
Oh, good question.

1004
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,920
That is very confusing to me.

1005
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,280
I gotta understand what you would say

1006
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,200
unless you didn't have anywhere else to go.

1007
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,120
Folks, don't surprise people with presents.

1008
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,320
Remember what we were just talking about

1009
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,520
with social situations?

1010
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,680
I don't think it's great.

1011
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
It's not great for me personally

1012
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,680
if anybody on planet Earth showed up out of the blue

1013
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,200
and was like, hey, I'm foisting this social situation on you.

1014
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,120
You have not in any way girded yourself

1015
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,480
or prepared remarks, but now it's happening now.

1016
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,440
I was trying to think-

1017
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,040
That's not a good zone.

1018
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,200
I was trying to think if like,

1019
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,600
at first I thought, well, Justin, hold on,

1020
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,560
because if like David Tennant or Oscar Isaac showed up

1021
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,800
and was like, hey, I'm gonna hang out with you today.

1022
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,040
But no, because I would be unusable as a human.

1023
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:45,760
Exactly.

1024
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes.

1025
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,360
Right, you're not prepared.

1026
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,040
I wouldn't be prepared for it.

1027
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,440
Yeah, no, don't do this.

1028
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,520
If ifs and buts were candies and buts,

1029
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,440
then this situation would never have happened.

1030
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,880
But the problem is that it did,

1031
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,240
and they're there, and now what?

1032
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,240
Okay.

1033
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:00,960
And now what?

1034
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,560
Your only option is to put on Flinchin's clothes,

1035
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,480
come downstairs and convince the family

1036
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,440
that you are Flinchin.

1037
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,640
Talon and Mr. Flinch.

1038
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,000
Hey, mother, it was a delightful film.

1039
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,920
I really enjoyed it,

1040
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,680
but I've been in the loo for the past hour

1041
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,360
and now I'm going out for a stroll.

1042
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,080
No questions.

1043
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,000
No questions.

1044
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,280
I'm wearing this hockey mask for hockey.

1045
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
As you've almost certainly surmised,

1046
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,200
I'm playing hockey.

1047
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,400
Later.

1048
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,360
Mother.

1049
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,560
Bye.

1050
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,080
This is a new voice I cooked up, mother.

1051
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm trying something with my personality, mother.

1052
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,400
Bye.

1053
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,520
I'm going to toss,

1054
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,640
I'm tossing on the iced skates with my great friend,

1055
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,720
Divim, and then you duck under the table

1056
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,040
and take the mask off and some of the clothes off

1057
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,240
and you pop back up like, that's right, Flinchim.

1058
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,680
We're going to go and show the penguins who's boss.

1059
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,400
That's right.

1060
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,880
We're playing the Pittsburgh Penguins in hockey.

1061
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,960
Maybe you could, okay.

1062
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,800
This is good.

1063
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,360
Crack open the bedroom door so nobody can see you

1064
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:14,800
and just shout downstairs, mother, it's Flinchim.

1065
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,280
I've been enjoying the company of Divim

1066
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,760
for quite some time and he is now to retire to his domicile.

1067
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,360
You'll see him in a moment.

1068
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,480
Don't be frightened.

1069
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,360
Be prepared.

1070
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,440
Be prepared for his presence.

1071
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,400
This is the worst imaginable situation, I think.

1072
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,560
It's hard for me to think of worse ones.

1073
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,280
Okay, Divim, somewhere around the end of hour one,

1074
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,280
you had to start to think a lot.

1075
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,600
You had to start to question it, right?

1076
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,680
How did you get the four hours?

1077
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,640
I don't understand how it went so long.

1078
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,840
Did you fall asleep?

1079
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,040
Flinchim's got one of those caspers.

1080
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,040
Soft, you sink right into it.

1081
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,760
Does have the right amount of bounce though,

1082
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,040
so maybe I shouldn't say that.

1083
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,840
Well, that's the right amount of sink and bounce.

1084
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,560
True.

1085
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,520
How about another Yahoo?

1086
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,640
Sure, yeah.

1087
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,600
Yeah, here's one who was sent in.

1088
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,320
It's a person and it was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

1089
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,040
Thank you, Adrian.

1090
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,680
It's from Yahoo Answers user, oh man, Naruto asks,

1091
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,120
and the avatar for Naruto is Goku,

1092
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,200
so I'm wondering if I should actually read this one at all.

1093
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,800
But it's a good question,

1094
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,200
but clearly if somebody calls themselves Naruto

1095
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,960
and their avatar is Goku,

1096
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,040
it makes me assume some things about their personality

1097
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,280
and whether or not they actually want to know the answer.

1098
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,720
Now, which one is a Goku?

1099
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,440
Goku asks, how did the person who invented the clock

1100
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,840
know the time?

1101
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,560
Oh, shit.

1102
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,440
So, back to Ardometrius or whatever,

1103
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,880
he's probably some old fuck just like,

1104
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
all right, I did it.

1105
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,120
It's got 12 numbers, little gears going around,

1106
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,800
and then when a little number points at one of the 12 numbers,

1107
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,320
that lets you know what the hour is.

1108
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,160
The bigger sort of arm on this one

1109
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,000
will tell you how many minutes it is.

1110
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,720
And why didn't we just also include minutes

1111
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,920
from 1 to 60 on the clock?

1112
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
Well, we wanted it to be hard for Griffin to tell

1113
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,760
what the time is even when he's 30 years old,

1114
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,320
but so here it is, the clock,

1115
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,880
and somebody's like, ah, cool, so what time is it?

1116
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,400
And then the person was like, well, fuck.

1117
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,440
I do not know what the time is.

1118
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,320
Can I just make that up?

1119
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,400
Because it's feeling like I got that three o'clock feeling.

1120
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:50,560
Shit.

1121
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,760
I've got the three o'clock blues.

1122
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,920
I think it's around then.

1123
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,400
Maybe they just started at like 12

1124
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,840
and that's where our whole shit started.

1125
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,000
Like, it's actually right now,

1126
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,200
whatever time it is when you listen to this, 3 p.m.,

1127
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,360
but your clock says whatever time

1128
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,800
because this old fuck just like started it at 12.

1129
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,400
Do you think he tried to work backwards?

1130
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,520
Like, well, let's see.

1131
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,160
I'm feeling pretty tired

1132
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,240
and I had a five-hour energy drink

1133
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,200
like five and a half hours ago

1134
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,440
and that was at, actually, there wasn't time then either.

1135
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,080
I actually don't know what to say.

1136
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,040
This old fuck, this fucking creep

1137
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,520
was probably just like, here's the clock.

1138
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,640
I just decided it's three o'clock, 12 hours in a day

1139
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,960
once it gets back to three o'clock again, it's a new day.

1140
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,840
And then they let it run and they were like, hey, bud,

1141
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,640
it's like totally different.

1142
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,640
It's three o'clock again, totally different outside.

1143
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,160
It's like real dark, I'm real sleepy, so what's the deal?

1144
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
And then this old piece of shit was just like,

1145
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,360
yeah, it's three, two, the sequel to three,

1146
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,200
you get two of them in each day.

1147
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,160
Okay, so you're just having fun with it at this point then.

1148
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,640
Yeah, it's the second three, you get two of them.

1149
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,600
Yeah, why did we start that back?

1150
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,160
Why not just a clock with 24 numbers on it?

1151
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:12,880
What the fuck?

1152
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,960
Why are we so cool

1153
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,600
that we only have room for 12 numbers on our clock?

1154
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,800
Grow up, old fuck.

1155
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,480
What the fuck? Yeah, put in 24 numbers.

1156
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,960
Like why wouldn't that be easier?

1157
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,120
This is, you're not talking about the,

1158
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,920
there are most countries do it like that,

1159
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,800
but I don't think that,

1160
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,600
I don't think their clocks have 24 numbers on it still.

1161
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,440
This is what I'm saying, it's like,

1162
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,200
why do I have to pay attention to whether it says AM or PM

1163
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,520
on my alarm clock slash coffee maker?

1164
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,360
Why can't it just be like military time across the board?

1165
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,880
It's 1.20 or it's 13.20.

1166
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,120
Because there's nothing sexy about like,

1167
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,560
my birthday is starting sharp at 17.

1168
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,240
Don't miss it.

1169
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,160
Why not? I think that's great.

1170
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,040
I'm gonna have dinner at 18, you guys be there.

1171
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,160
That's less confusing than wondering

1172
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,320
if my friend is having dinner at 6 a.m.

1173
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,520
What time does your show start?

1174
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,020
20.

1175
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,920
We are children.

1176
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,640
We are fools.

1177
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,480
Cause that is probably how they do it.

1178
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,200
Come on down to the comedy show, it's at 20 o'clock.

1179
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,240
How is that worse than just saying eight?

1180
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,960
I can't count above 12.

1181
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,040
Cause it sounds ridiculous.

1182
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,880
My show's at 20.30.

1183
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,280
It starts a little later than you would expect.

1184
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,960
Not 20, 20.30.

1185
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,520
How did they know what fucking time it was?

1186
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,640
It probably was noon.

1187
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,400
It probably, they had sundials and shit.

1188
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,320
And so when the sundial was like, there's no shadow,

1189
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,000
then they're like, okay, this is the middle one.

1190
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,120
This is noon.

1191
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,240
But the view just went off.

1192
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,240
So that, and that's an hour.

1193
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,440
It starts at 11.

1194
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,520
I know the view, I don't know what time is

1195
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,880
cause I just invented it.

1196
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,200
I know the view comes on at 11.

1197
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,160
So if the view just went off, it's gotta be close to noon.

1198
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,360
Let's all just decide.

1199
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,400
Let's all just go with noon.

1200
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,880
The end of the episode of The View, first one,

1201
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,920
like 800 BC, Meredith Vieira is like,

1202
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,720
all right, clock man, get ready.

1203
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,680
It's gonna be noon.

1204
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,120
We're gonna wrap it up.

1205
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,640
Three, two, one.

1206
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,600
Hi, this is your local news.

1207
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,880
We come on after The View.

1208
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,440
At noon, apparently.

1209
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,840
But top story today, it's noon.

1210
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,840
It's wild, dude.

1211
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,120
We did it.

1212
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,480
Breaking news, it's, oh wait,

1213
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,320
I'm getting an update from the booth.

1214
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,000
It's now noon-o-one.

1215
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,920
Wait, what, we don't say it like that?

1216
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,360
Okay, 12-o-one.

1217
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,240
Listen to me.

1218
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,160
Hey, Victoria, did you hear?

1219
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,360
12-o-one.

1220
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,160
That doesn't, now I get why the date line,

1221
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,840
the international date line starts at The View.

1222
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,720
I get it now.

1223
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,640
I was always confused as to why they kept that episode

1224
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,120
of The View in the archives in Greenwich.

1225
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,160
And now I know that that's where they keep

1226
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,440
that episode of The View saved.

1227
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,280
So if anyone's clock ever gets off,

1228
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,560
they can just set it to that episode.

1229
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,000
I mean, UTC, the Greenwich Mean Time,

1230
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,920
is it starts right at Whoopi's house.

1231
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,080
Which is very convenient for Whoopi.

1232
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,880
If Whoopi's late to work and The View gets started late,

1233
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,880
all time, it's fucked.

1234
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,440
The world spins off its axis, yes.

1235
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,320
And it's a lot of responsibility, but I trust her.

1236
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,840
Hey, Whoopi, stay, please, I made omelets.

1237
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,840
Please just stay for breakfast this one morning.

1238
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,720
It won't be the end of the world.

1239
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,560
It might be.

1240
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,680
It might actually be.

1241
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,520
It might actually be that.

1242
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,200
That explains why that one time when Whoopi was late

1243
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,000
and it still started on time,

1244
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,400
all of our cartoon friends had to go find her

1245
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,120
and bring her back to fight that giant owl.

1246
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:44,960
That's right.

1247
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,400
That's exactly how I remember it as well, Travis.

1248
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,920
Let's, listen, thank you so much

1249
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,440
for listening to this episode.

1250
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,240
A lot of the things we said weren't true.

1251
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:58,840
So we'll leave those to you to sort of sort through.

1252
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,080
Can you spot them gum shoes?

1253
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:02,160
This is true.

1254
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,480
We're doing some shows in the next few months.

1255
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:07,120
And we would love it if you would come

1256
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,480
and join us for those.

1257
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,840
We're gonna be in Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, Detroit,

1258
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,840
Columbus, Phoenix, Orlando, and Atlanta.

1259
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,840
And we would love it if you would come join us.

1260
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,040
If you go to mackerelshows.com forward slash tours.

1261
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,880
Is that right, Travis?

1262
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,720
Tours, plural?

1263
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,640
Tours. Tours, plural.

1264
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,680
Then you can go buy tickets to those.

1265
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,680
The Dallas and Houston shows are coming up real soon.

1266
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,880
So please go buy tickets for those right now

1267
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,080
and ensure your quality seating.

1268
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:38,840
All those shows, no matter what anybody tells you

1269
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,280
from now to the end of linear time,

1270
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,880
will start at 7pm no matter what.

1271
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,880
I also would say some of the shows are sold out.

1272
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,920
And I've seen people tweeting about like,

1273
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,720
apparently scalpers buy tickets

1274
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,400
and then charge an arm and a leg.

1275
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,600
There is literally nothing we can do about that.

1276
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,640
I wish we could fix it.

1277
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,560
That's why we do the pre-sales and stuff

1278
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,680
to try to combat that.

1279
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,360
And we just, unfortunately there's nothing we can do.

1280
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,360
But there's something you can do,

1281
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,640
which is buy all the tickets now

1282
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,240
so scalpers can't get their grubby hands on them.

1283
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,960
And then sell them for a profit.

1284
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,040
Then sell them for an arm and a leg.

1285
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,040
We want our listeners to profit from scalping.

1286
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,880
We have a new merch store also.

1287
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,720
If you go to mackleroymerch.com,

1288
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,320
you can find our new store.

1289
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,400
We partnered up with DFTBA on this one.

1290
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,000
Got a bunch and cool new items.

1291
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,320
There's a Munch Squad shirt.

1292
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,560
There's a Shrimp Heaven Now poster

1293
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,000
that is absolutely gorgeous.

1294
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,920
And a bunch of other stuff too

1295
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,360
that you can find over at mackleroymerch.com.

1296
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,040
So go check that out.

1297
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,440
If there's an item you don't see on there

1298
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,200
that you would love to have,

1299
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,600
email request at mackleroymerch.com

1300
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:44,480
and the people who make those sorts of decisions will see it.

1301
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,200
So please do that.

1302
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:51,200
I also wanna say I'm going to C2E2 in Chicago,

1303
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,720

1304
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,640
April 6th through the 8th.

1305
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,680

Speaking of Max Fun, I should say,

Snakes everywhere, who asks.

1369
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,120
What is the Dougie?

1370
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,080
And why does my mom want me to teach her how to?

1371
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:32,640
Will I get in trouble if I don't?

1372
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,240
Please help.

00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,000

Kiss your dads.

Square on the lips.

1379
00:58:43,300 --> 00:59:05,120
Hey girls, do you want to say, hey I want to?
