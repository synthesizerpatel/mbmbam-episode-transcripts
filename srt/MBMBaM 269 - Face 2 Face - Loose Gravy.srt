1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Hey, you've already been out here, you've already experienced this crowd.

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm very comfortable with the energy of this room.

3
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
That's why I switched into my Tybee Island shirt.

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,640
It's island time.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,140
Yeah.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,720
So that's that's code for I can say fuck now.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,760
I feel like this is the this is not only the nicest building we've ever performed in.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,640
This is the nicest building I've ever been in.

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
And I'm I'm like 80% sure that's the first time anybody's ever said a curse word in this building.

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
Yeah, not the last.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
No, most certainly not the last.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
Uh, this is my brother.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
My brother and me in an advice show for the modern era.

19
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,640
Yeah.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,040

00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,280
Yeah, can we get more monitor?

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,880
We're literally so far away from each other.

25
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,480
This gigantic, beautiful stage.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,400
I'll save you.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,520
I know this looks weird.

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,560
Like, why are those three guys in the picture you took?

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
Why are they so close to each other?

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,000
They have the whole stage to their auras have to blend doesn't do that fleet with Mac.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,640
Can we can we start the podcast off by just detailing just how many times we've just completely

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,200
fucked up being in Canada, just like from literally the word like I made you guys promise

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,800
this wouldn't turn into like the can you believe it's different like the Canada, the Canada

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,840
the Canada chapter of the big john's bathroom reader but like holy shit we have screwed

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,320
up literally everything can see the best example I can give is when we crossed the border and

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,480
everyone in the car was amazed that suddenly things were different right it was like holy

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:38,720
shit I can go 100 miles an hour yes Canada rules that we saw a gas station and Travis

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,800
was like it's 119 that's crazy and Justin was like no that's not even the good part

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
Justin said well yeah they would have no reason to use gallons it's pints what and everyone

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,080
in the car was like oh yeah yeah it sounds about right yeah in my defense the guy at

41
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,360
Hertz told me that got you we had uh we have a theme on our program sort of a recurring

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,520
gag that uh we don't know how to find marijuana anymore and we made it something of a tactical

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:21,040
error in performing shows in places where it is cool as a cucumber and as easy to get

44
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,800
as cucumbers are yeah to just buy it so uh we we met some folks last night and one of

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:38,560
the gifts that we received a couple of times was jazz cigarettes yes yes was weed now this

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,960
is very exciting to us hooray because we're not cool very cool it was very cool the only

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,560
thing was we realized we're crossing the Canadian border that is not cool and pre pre-tension

48
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,440
set in like this is the idea of like tomorrow this will be a problem yeah so we needed to

49
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:10,320
smoke all of this tonight we didn't we didn't we got we tried we got close got sleepy but

50
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,960
here's the thing right we were so like i wanted you don't say we it was you you were no leading

51
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,760
up to the event we were all very worried about border crossing like they would peel back

52
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,720
one of like the floor mats and just find a weed yeah that we had forgotten about and

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
then we would go to like guantanamo bay this paranoia didn't just extend to marijuana and

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,320
marijuana-based products uh i didn't we have little meat sticks for our baby that i threw

55
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,880
away because i know you couldn't bring meat that's the level of like by the way you guys

56
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,200
are missing out on so america is we had to get out of there because it was getting pretty

57
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,600
real uh but we do meet pretty good and i can't believe y'all don't get to to sample that but

58
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,800
i was so worried about like i had all my paperwork when we get to this border and i

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,880
i am now using that term loosely dude at the border travis gets out it says there's seven

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,000
of us and he hands them the three passports that he had and he said uh only got three here

61
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,920
and travis reaches back and hands him the rest of our passports and then he looks at our passports

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:26,240
and then we drive through so he did not corroborate the alcohol in there and i was like i don't think

63
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,800
so no no no it went like this do you have any tobacco or alcohol um no

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,480
that did not warrant a check the fact that one of my passports is for a baby the dude did not

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,880
even look in like is that a baby so when he was like turn off the engine and step out of the car

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,800
we just like jessica everybody out which which which do you want us to go to american jail or

67
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,000
canadian jail please god put me in the direction of the nearest jail could not have been less

68
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,240
interested did not like we couldn't like i i imagine travis like leaning back the man needs

69
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,720
four more passports dig dig out four more from our box give me american passports give me four

70
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,920

87
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,400
about our breakfast out situation in the future his usual mo is to order the biggest most average

88
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,320
breakfast they have on the menu that is the travis mcgroy special and not like a huge burrito

89
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,600
or omelet or whatever but just the item that boasts the largest amount of eggs bacon hash browns

90
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,800
and toasts how do i explain to my boyfriend now that we've moved to the big city he should branch

91
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,960
out into other delicious breakfast options that's from very excited in vancouver very excited are

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:41,120
you here you're here oh that was the saddest uh egg man are you here no he is here can you just

94
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:57,840
i tell you you're right and she's wrong oh there you know what's really hard to fuck up eggs bacon

95
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,200
and toast yeah really hard to mess that up you know it's really easy to mess up great burrito

96
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:14,800
yeah eggs bacon and toast yeah listen but crepes are great listen that's true but like breakfast

97
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,880
is like one of the most utilitarian meals of the day right it exists i mean don't get me wrong it

98
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,640
can be delicious i've had great ones miss ower over here somewhere i know breakfast can't be

99
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,800
awesome but mostly it exists so that you're not cranky by 11 a.m yeah right you could say that

100
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:44,880
about all meals though if you think about it that's true griffin my the reason i celebrate

101
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,360
eggs bacon and toast is that is as a tactical choice if you don't necessarily know what the

102
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,400
day shall hold it is the best tactical breakfast option you can make there are many times you will

103
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,320
look who in this room and i do want to see a show of hands on this one who in this room has looked

104
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
at a breakfast or brunch menu and seen the french toast and thought fuck i'd like to eat some french

105
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,680
toast but then realized that the rest of your day is about that fucking french toast as soon as you

106
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:22,400
consume it's like well catch you guys at three and have you ever seen someone finish a breakfast

107
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,520
burrito like finish it not like they the kitchen slices it in half to say and this is the garbage

108
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:35,120
job they everybody at the table gets excited when somebody else gets the french toast because

109
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,720
there's like i know they're gonna have some bites left at the end it's gonna get into breakfast is

110
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:53,040
crazy i mean if it makes you happy then i think go for it i think this is this reminds me of the

111
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,200
question we got out of the guy that only ordered chicken nuggets at restaurants and it's like

112
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,800

126
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,480
grinch post transformation or pre-transformation not was this question submitted before the grinch

127
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:09,920
was released because yahoo answers was just a twinkle in mr jefferson yahoo's eye back in 19

128
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,120
whatever whatever no i mean are you talking about like i really like the bad boy i can change him

129
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,880

i just carved the roast beast and all i get is a handshake

133
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:47,040
oh i cannot believe she's had this much of a problem with this question being deleted yeah

134
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,840
so i look at the related questions and the top three nope scratch at five are what would happen

135
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:00,480
if i hugged and kissed the grinch so this person has been on uh the warpath and some yahoo moderators

136
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,680
like not again no how many times no i think we've just discovered is that mrs grinch is a yahoo

137
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:16,000
moderator there there is a mrs grinch and she is very active on yahoo not my husband no way kiss

138
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,800
kiss of my man how dare you he's my husband i love him his heart's too big there's only room for one

139
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,760
in here i'm a big lady well there could be room for three if there was room for one before no

140
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,440
well griffin uh sorry but that would argue that there was room for one in his heart before it grew

141
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,840
three sizes and i think we all know that there was not before he did not feel love in the way

142
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:49,040
that we do i'll be back with you guys in a second because he had max who loved him sure and he did

143
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,160
not care for max he was very no debate there but then his heart grew for sure and he gave some

144
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:03,040
roses to him so now his heart is barely big enough for a small definitely definitely i have more in

145
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,240
my published work backstage my roommate carelessly ate my last can of soup when i texted him about

146
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,480
it he replied with an honest apology and explained that he buys the same kind of soup

147
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,200
you may thought it was his fair enough i typed the following message in my phone no worries

148
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,800
however as i hit send he sent a second message saying that he would replace my soup for me

00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,480
here's a yahoo here's the yahoo cinema jacob locker thank you jacob coming out of retirement

204
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,440
jacob locker it's by yahoo answers user tim who asks how to kill time in a cheap and sleazy motel

205
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,600
i'll be stuck in a sleazy motel for about 30 to 45 days

206
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,280
it sucks yeah you know what now that i think about that's a long stay yeah it's a long

207
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:29,440
and also a very vague time for 30 to 45 days yeah that could be 50 percent longer

208
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,800
you never know how long it's gonna take for the police to stop looking for you

209
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:44,400
you they're an unpredictable bunch cops it sucks it's noisy almost all the time and the

210
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,320
guests are creepy and grim looking no en suite bathroom bed bugs yes

211
00:22:50,320 --> 00:23:03,600
yes bed bugs almost certainly yeah uh i can't afford other options right now suggestions

212
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,960
30 to 45 days gotta kill time the first time griffin read this question i thought he was

213
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:19,120
saying like on the matter of a suite bathroom the answer is no on bedrooms no no bed bugs wait so

214
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,840
bed bugs yeah yes we can he shares a bathroom yeah yep he's got his own bed bugs yes

215
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,600
the other guests i don't know why he puts that in close are grim looking ghosts

216
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,360
he might be in purgatory yeah sure yeah everything about this question leads to but you've always

217
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:52,000
been here right or he's in the movie identity uh can you spend the 30 to 45 days digging a tunnel

218
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,720
into the bathroom because that fucking sucks that it's not connected to the place where you sleep

219
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,320
or maybe just reno the place flip that hotel yeah yeah 30 to 45 days you could get a lot

220
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,680
done a lot out of that oh you're coming to stay at our hotel you're gonna want to be in 10

221
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:17,600
yeah trust me there's a zen garden in there yeah they have a koi pond uh marble cabinets

222
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,960
some built-in bookshelves it's real marble countertops let's turn this into our cabinets

223
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,880
are not a thing my little cabinets is the height of a luxury i'm very disappointed the two of you

224
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:36,960
that i have to call myself on marble cabinets that's in a morgue but not anywhere else you know

225
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,160
what you can start a morgue business you start a more big here's another thing you got 30 to 45

226
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:49,040
days time to bring back the concept of a hotel detective we got a lot of young people here

227
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:58,640
happened at the motel six but this guy in room four is coming for the crime and he's

228
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:06,960
monk from that show monk he's in the new show tony shalhoub has seen better days tony shalhoub and

229
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,440
monk too the sequel to monk he's in a hotel room there used to be a literal job that existed as a

230
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,320
hotel detective where you just were on call if people lost their keys yeah or like needed to

231
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,840
follow somebody i guess there also used to be a show called monk and a show called rescue rangers

232
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,880
and both of those are pertinent suggestions you must understand all these things or nothing else

233
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:38,240
will make sense all the best jokes require 30 to 45 seconds of backstory just a footnote at the

234
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:46,160
bottom hey true believers this is the reference read another question just i'm feeling like this

235
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,000
is going to be a real club banger my husband steve and i got married at the end of july and

238
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,160

pictures of the same thing on instagram so i didn't want to post more than that of your wedding

240
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,800
now that we're about to get our professional pictures back for the photographer would it

it says simulated flavor we want to be straight with y'all this ain't real poutine we had a great

267

gift it's a great gift this is oh good it's our snack demo segment that we do on every episode

268
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,040

comedy show you want me to good delicious i'm not gonna those two will bullshit you i won't

276
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:54,240
for sure for sure it's by an anonymous user no name will calm evan asks you did evan asks

277
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,600
how come some ghosts are cool and some are jerks

278
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,240
i've been in a number of places where the vibe was weird and people always got negative from

279
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,280
being around it then sometimes i'm in places and it's really positive and again it feels

280
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:17,600
weird but it's supportive while in the negative experience you hear and see weird stuff you get

281
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,680
to sleep faster in positive ones but how come some buildings presence can be negative while

282
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:30,880
others positive so they walk through the positive one and they're like whoa whoa something i should

283
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,280
take up stand-up comedy yeah that's probably why most people take up like stand-up comedy

284
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:44,480
go go i felt a cold spot and also i love you too yeah why okay it is hugely upsetting to

285
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,320
me the idea that i don't care if the ghost is positive or negative they said you get to sleep

286
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:58,720
faster yeah i do not need to go to sleep with the idea of a ghost like i'll be here all night

287
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:08,240
and forever find my bones and the best one but listen only when you get around to it no rush

288
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,040
no rush dude i know you're busy chill out dude i'm a new ghost i've been only on the game for

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,680
for you why is this person yelling at me on the headset does that happen in video games yeah

292
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:45,040
definitely listen i'm confused by the question in so many ways but they say a number of places

293
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:51,440
the vibe was weird this makes me think like the literal building is a ghost like the building was

294
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,200
murdered in a high passion and has unfinished when you tear down a building and it still had

295
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,560
stuff to do like i still had hats to sell i was gonna be an orphanage just give me time

296
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,760
you know you put one orphan in a building you're a weirdo

297
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,960
you put a hundred in a building it's an orphanage i don't get it

298
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:23,520
i guess some people are cool and some are jerks right and then they die and become ghosts that's

299
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,240
usually how it works that's the thing i'm actually more worried about why there would be ghosts who

300
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:35,840
are cool yeah where those who are jerks yeah that makes sense to me i'm angry i'm dead i can't do

301
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,120
shit i'm but a ghost who's just like hey man you know what are you gonna do jkl or jkd jkd just

302
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,360
keep dying just keep dying like a ghost is like you know what i've made peace with my situation

303
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,440
this is me i'm a hollow bastard that's the problem though you can get too complacent yeah that's why

304
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,960
they're stuck they're too nice you gotta be hungry to get off this coil you gotta you gotta work put

305
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:08,720
the work in it's getting fucking dark no i mean i'm just saying it's another you want to do like

306
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:15,440
ghost crossfit pain is weakness leaving the body that you left when you died how is there not

307
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,280

388
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:36,640
right but somehow you still make a lot of money so here's my we're making some learnings and

389
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,600
i don't want to accidentally get a job right so how do i not get a job like you all

390
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,320
you think you'll just wake up one day like shit it's nine o'clock what happened i gotta be

391
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,160
somewhere that's how i got that's how i got my first job i walked into the tcby on eighth

392
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,520

394
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,720
that was great i actually did get my first few jobs accidentally because my dad was like you

395
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,360
know they're hiring a blockbuster and literally here's the thought i put into it i like blockbuster

396
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,080
when it applied 16 years old didn't even occur to me that like

397
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,080
well it sucks i gotta be there all the time and i'm not making honestly that much money

398
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,440
um and i stole a copy of fight club and got fired

399
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,360
fight club what are you gonna do what are you gonna do happens the best of us uh rilo

400
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,480
might i suggest making money on the internet yeah yeah yeah real top notch it's really easy

401
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,760
here's what you do one be mark maron well can you do that by as a thing

402
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,640

jobs are what you make them oh no people no i disagree no no no people no no no disagree

404
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,800
let me finish this thought and see if you don't go with it let him say this dumb thing

405
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,560
take the thing take the thing you love yep just keep doing it no but ask someone to pay you for

406
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,840
it wrong one and two are good but three is not good just ask someone and they'll go i mean i

410
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,520
crossed crossed the border to do the hat trick was it what can i ask what can i ask question

411
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,960
was it worth it what is what we're right the doing all of the travel yeah

412
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:11,440
yeah where's the conviction okay what's your question rachel okay uh i work at a popular

413
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,800
grocery store in a not very large town you're telling me you don't look up yahoo answers for

414
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:24,480
a living you just made our advice you're right it looks stupid so when i'm out and about in town on

415
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,960
my own time and i run into regular customers that i'm friendly with uh-huh how can i politely

416
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,080
extricate myself from the conversation because i'm not being paid to be nice to them right

417
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:45,280
then how do you have how do you have can i tell you the thing this is this is literally a thing

418
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,080
like i have heard from so many bartenders where like they'll just be like in the neighborhood

419
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,800
where their bar is and meet the person that they want tips from so they're very nice to them and

420
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,080
it's like hey how's it going while they're like walking a dog and it's tough because you'll see

421
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,240
them again how do you when they come into the store how do you know the people that come through

422
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,200
like i've been working there for a long time and it's like a neighborhood store and you speak to

423
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,520
them and i speak to them it's like oh it's celery steve conversations yeah yeah well that's what

424
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:22,320
you can i hey how's the gluten intolerance going that's right that's that's that is less superficial

425
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,360
than 90 percent of the conversations i have oh shit this is what you do you use the knowledge

426
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,800
you have of their purchases against them until they get uncomfortable and stop talking to you

427
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:43,360
in public how's the infection clearing up hemorrhoids still a thing huh but a lot of

428
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:48,160
laxative last time is that taking care of itself where are you going see you at the store

429
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,760

450
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,480

451
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,720
i live in one of them according to probably most of the people in this room

452
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:37,840
sis whoa brady don't act like that in the teacher's lounge it's just it's saskatchewan that's where i live okay i like that one

453
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,720
that's good because i was just about to say what a great province that probably it sounds a lot

454
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,080
like sasquatch yep i like it cool i like it too you know what you could do brady you could uh

455

456
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,440
what lock the doors from the inside to keep drug dealers out and then you tell the principal like

457
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,600
did you see i shut off the fire did you see what i did i shut off the fire escapes i locked on the

458
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:14,480
doors so the drug dealers can't get in it wasn't a licensed activity but i'm trying to show initiative

459
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:21,680
i saw a buzzfeed listicle the other day oh you just know this is gonna be a good story

460
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:28,480
sorry i saw a buzzfeed listicle the other day and it was like these 23 sexy substitute teachers make

461
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,120
us wish they were permanent teeth this is not a fucking goof by the way this is a realistical

462
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,520
which i thought was fucked up these guys are just trying to do their job can we not says

463
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:45,040
the guy who just objectified in substitute teacher's hands for three minutes he spray

464
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:53,120
keeps gesticulating though here's here's what you could do brady uh the next time your class is in

465
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,400
session get all the kids to stay on the desk and be like my couch my captain but you know

466
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:05,200
but wait to do it until the principal comes by so just like just stay put wait i'm willing here he

467
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,520
comes here it comes i bet that those movies and tv shows are misleading and when a principal sees

468
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,800
a substitute teacher working real hard they're like no that's exhausting yeah i want to teach

469
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:22,240
your cousin does the shit and then drinks during lunch so you can maybe try that yeah maybe give

470
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,280
less shits yeah okay if the teaching thing doesn't work out you got all the money you

476
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:17,760
what's up well unfortunately exquisite fancy delight never took off i'm sorry but anyways

477
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,960
my question and i did send it to you but just in case oops um it got lost in the mail that's okay

478
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:33,360
okay a couple months ago friends and i were out for dinner and an enormous argument erupted over

479
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,720
the habits of men who go to the bathroom were the worst by the way yes especially

480
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,600
in a lot of ways were the worst especially in that specific way well that that was the

481
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:52,960
female's opinion but among the males there was a huge argument about whether you unbuckle and

482
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:59,680
undo or whether you just undo and whip out at you mean at the urinal yes not like the sink yeah

483
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:08,000
yeah because that's more clear cut yeah but anyways now this argument has spread among our

484
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,720
friends and every party we would go to there are raging fights and it started to spill over

485
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,000
into the girls because there was a listicle on buzzfeed what the fuck see it's ruining everything

486
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,400
yeah this one was about where you put how you put your bra on the 27 hottest substitute dogs

487
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,800
do most of them put the bra on by like stringing it between two surfaces and diving just running

488
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,840
through well naturally awesome i assume everybody's doing it awesome my question is

489
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,840
what can i do to distract people when these arguments start it's thank god thank god that

490
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:48,720
that was the question and not so what is it you whip it out you unbucked because we're in like

491
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,560
i would not have answered the question otherwise because this is like a classic opera house

492
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,320
basically and i cannot talk about my bathroom stuff you don't want to bum them out that would

493
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,480
be too easy if you're just like how about all this stuff going on in the middle isis am i right like

494
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:16,240
you can't do that i think they know what isis is in canada sure sure but you i'm saying don't do

495
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:26,080
that well you did you did you did do just that um you could get something better going like cake or

496
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:36,960
pie that's more divisive okay raise your hand who's cake who's pie it's not even a thing you

497
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:44,400
guys not have cake in canada yes they too but we have completely run face first into the big john's

498
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:56,880
element um why is this cultural imperialism by the way what we're doing up here yeah okay i just

499
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:05,200
call it manifest destiny different thing my dude i don't think so um the reason we're not doing a

500
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,560
good job at answering this is that i didn't know that there was a debate about the other thing

501
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,520
and but talking about that would be counterproductive wouldn't it that would

502
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,400
kind of be like your worst nightmare so we'd be adding to the problem oh no this is great

503
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,160
you force the two sides to cross are you so it's like you make the women discuss whether you should

504
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:32,400
unbuckle and undo you make the dudes discuss how you put on a bra and then you just watch the chaos

505
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:41,520
yeah some fancies just want to watch the world burn that's what i've always said fancy ladies

506
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,080
justin i just justin i want to congratulate you on not doing your michael kane impression i know

507
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,960

together or leaving events together they assume that we're dating uh oh shit that sucks oh no

516
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,880
that's very bad that's the worst it could be is your twin so bad

517
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:17,120
oh i think what doesn't mean is we're not weird dean that sucks dean i'm sorry dean

520
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:41,120
shit you would never date somebody with such bad taste in podcasts is this worse than if no it's

521
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:47,600
worse than anything dean i thought about it super quick could you do staggered entrances

522
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,720
staggered entrances but don't talk to each other at all during the event that's important what's

523
00:57:52,720 --> 00:58:05,280
your twin's name hana hana hana um i don't know why it's still very bad you're just gonna have

526
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,640
i mean does it help at all that we haven't said anything helpful but just like we're giving you

527
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,600
some level of commiserate like that's we don't usually do usually we like try to help out a

528
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:35,440
little bit or at least say something funny but that's just bad you do get a power move if they're

529
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:42,000
like are you two together and you're like that's my twin that person will give you anything you're

531
00:58:48,240 --> 00:59:00,240
me now boss steve now i'm the ceo thank you dean thank you dean yes come on down come on down

532
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:14,400
keep clapping i can't abide silence hi hello what's your name elisa elisa which has something

533
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:21,440
to do with my question actually okay good thank you for the preface so my name is somewhat hard

534
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,360
to pronounce i didn't have any problem with it i did it perfectly when you read it how's it spelled

535
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:35,920
it's spelled like elisa with one s okay so with a y or an i with a y a l y s a that's a trap and my

536
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,520
last name is somewhat hard to pronounce it's don't say in the podcast that's too much information

537
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:49,440
we kept not the word i just said i communicate as many of us do through email sure i work in a

538
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:55,920
business where word of mouth is super important and i meet people who have heard about me through

539
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,520
somebody else or they've gotten an email from me and they think my name is elisa and it's really

540
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,920
awkward for me to try and sure fix so my name is starting to get out there in my business which is

541
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:15,040
really exciting but it's not really my name yeah right elisa what do i do i so we have the last

542
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:20,640
name mcelroy and people have been pronouncing it mckelroy my entire life or mclory is a really

543
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,120
popular way or for whatever reason it's very difficult here and so i've got into the habit

544
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:34,240
when i say my name which i know people can't spell i will say mcelroy m c e l r o y as soon as i say

545
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,560
it so when you meet people start training yourself to immediately say elisa as you meet them like ah

546
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:46,080
hi i'm elisa say your name right off the bat don't give them the opportunity to mispronounce it

547
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,960
because then it's weird yeah but if they're just like wow elisa's really forward in her introduction

548
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,160
let me try and ease your pain with this and this is gonna sound cool but i want you to really dial

549
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:03,520
in with me here you compare to some of the other questions tonight it sounds like maybe count your

550
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:09,280
blessings because there's no listen i want you to really think about this because there was that guy

551
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,720
who didn't have his soup and he was very sad and then there was a guy with the just beautiful

552
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:23,920
flawless hands and i forget what his thing was about and then dean's thing was the worst that's

553
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,280
true by and large you're doing okay yeah maybe try to get more permissive about it just all

554
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:36,800
right so you you prefer elisa right that is my name that's like the main crux of the whole thing

555
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,880
okay you prefer elisa what if you open yourself up to some other possibilities

556
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:48,000
maybe there's a personality for elisa tell people call me elisa call me elisa just don't call me

557
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:56,080
late for dinner and then stare them dead in the fucking eye until they turn and you are in control

558
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:00,880
what's ironic you're actually 45 minutes late for dinner and they have fucking nothing

559
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,400
so did that help

560
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,280
thank you elisa i feel like maybe we've run out of steam a little bit

561
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,160
this has been really really fun yeah i thought we came to canada for this give yourselves a hand

562
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:29,440
uh we want to say thank you uh before anything else to the chant center yeah this is an amazing

563

564
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,640

565
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:45,440
good they looked at what we did and looked at this room and said okay it's hugely irresponsible

566
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,480
but i'm glad that they did it we have to scrub the walls to get our goof stink off of it

567
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,720
uh thanks to billions uh who who booked this these these shows for us yep we wouldn't do
