1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very special,

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,240
very personal episode of My Brother, My Brother and Me. We have an announcement to make

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:04,880
uh to begin this uh episode and um gosh guys I don't really know how to well I mean we we've

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,960
consulted a lot of our family and friends and a lot of people we really respect and

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,560
I think it's time that we just you know it's 20 dirt it's time we come clean it's 20 that's so

10
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:26,160
true Travis it's 20 dirt it's time to dig it up come clean we have been doping there it is beginning

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:37,040
in June of 1998 basically over a decade before we would begin the show in preparation

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:47,680
to record this program we have been injecting bull semen into our buttocks nature's funniest animal

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:02:00,400
nature's funniest liquid uh directly into us um every day every hour for the past 15 years I am

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:09,600
I am fucking chock full of bull semen and like it it's I sweat the stuff and it's

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:16,240
right do you know how the human body is like 75% water at this point Griffin is like 72% bull

16
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:25,440
semen right um it's why I can't really run I ambulate slowly but it's because I'm very viscous

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:34,320
inside um and he he basically can't go to a dairy farm they will go hide he basically if he walks

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,680
runs through with hands outstretched he can impregnate 10 to 15 cows a second yeah they get

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:49,680
it's amazing they they will try to get on top of this and now I'm flattered now a lot of people ask

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,160
how you get into this sort of there is a an underworld I guess and I'm I'm I'm worried about

21
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,960
outing people but I guess well let's use let's use code names then we'll say schmorton schmorris

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,680
okay schmorton schmorris got us into it and uh he was one of the first that really turned us

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:20,320
onto it and dan kennison basically sam kennison but he's dead so like yeah yeah and uh what's

24
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,080
that other angry guy shouty kind of shouty fucking everybody likes him because he said a bunch of

25
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:35,920
raymond things on him bill you know comedy bill bill cosby yeah that's it so bill cosby

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:46,800
i'm so full of the pussy but that's how we started we didn't we couldn't take the injections

27
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:55,200
phil william cosby was my comedy coach in high school sure and we were trying to make state for

28
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,880
comedy comedy stay and he says uh you know that show the state that's what that's what it's about

29
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,080
he says you look he did it but in a bill cosby voice how would that sound

30
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:21,120
um you gotta get a leg up on the competition and so that's melting at the end of it that's when i

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:30,480
started well he was so so just jam ram jammed with cum and like um so like that's how i got

32
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,480
started was pressure from from coach cosby yeah uh listen guys let's put this note we will continue

33
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,760
to inject ourselves with bull can you guys believe that they didn't induct anybody to the comedy hall

34
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:50,320
of fame this year yeah yeah just because of all the jizzing we've been you got to retire from

35
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,920
comedy for five years and i can't think of anybody well and the problem is is like even after that

36
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,000
when you break comedy records they're still going to put an asterisk next your name right but not

37
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,800
only that but there are so many great comedy champs out there that don't jizz like bobcat goldthwait

38
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,800
he's oh yeah he was a staunch anti-jizzer right you could make the argument that that jerry

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,600
seinfeld retired from comedy decades ago right and uh and he's still out there never jizzed you

40
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,280
can't no way has he never jizzed julia louise drivers was telling me that she tried to get him

41
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,000
to yeah and he just shut her down and then canceled the show he was like i'm sick of the

42
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
pressure and he canceled it but we're not canceling this show we're gonna move right on

43
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,160
let's uh let's get our first question up in the mix this one comes to us from uh uh i would i

44
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
would also point out we never actually introduced ourselves but i mean at this point people come on

45
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,960
i'm justin i'm i'm i'm travis i'm gonna say griffin you wanna switch i've been fucked up

46
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,600

47
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,760

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:14,960

49
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,520
happened i did uh we did did these shots that i learned from epic meal time called the gordon

50
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,120
bombay where you take a shot of bombay gin and then have everyone call you gordon for the rest

51
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,320
of the night fuck those guys are funny they are jizzing they are jizzing to the fucking max and

52
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,560
like i am worried about where like their health is i hope that they come maybe they'll come to max

53
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,120
funcon someday and just like eat but that would be bad because it's in an isolated environment

54
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,480
it'll become like a like a doner party kind of thing yeah right they'll eat all the food and

55
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:58,000
then they're just like a meal time cannibalism yeah turn into hunger games um uh i left my

56
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,120
college town a couple years ago the old gang is slowly starting to break up one member of the

57
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:09,280
gang is the one who got away and i never confessed the fact that i've been crazy for him since we

58
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,240
met several years ago i've already moved away from our college town and only go back to visit

59
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,880
he'll be moving away within the year should i risk our remaining long distance friendship to

60
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
get it off my chest i know 20 does was the year getting it but i'm not sure what to do in 20

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,800
bakers does um how could we be from gmail any fucking clearer about what you're supposed to do

get out the shovel scoop it and poop it get it out there you you this relationship

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,120
is a long distance relationship which is to say it's not one right yeah you might as well like

65
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,080
the first uh three quarters of of that question was just like it's dissolving it's dissolving

66
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,160
it's dissolving it's dissolving what do i do fuck it fuck it check take a shot maybe he

67
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,960
feels the same way is it too late to change the name of the year to 20 fuck yeah it is it really

68
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:19,120
rick really really is ricky is it ricky is the year of dj can i learn dj with my mouth i i say

69
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,760
i say just do it now there are two different ways to do it option a is you know the the

70
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,080
confessing of your love and say hey i've always option b is to say hey confetti

71
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,240
option a confetti i always loved you

72
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,480
just rip taylor him right let's have rip taylor go do some toupee humor

73
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,880
then option he'll get it he'll get it he'll know what's up and then option b is to say

74
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,080
i just matter of fact like hey devon by the way i've always dug you all right see you later side

75
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,920
note sorry quick addendum editors editor's note asterisk nobody's ever loved anyone named devon

76
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,920
man anytime we goof on a day there's always one guy is like

77
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,120
ah that's me i i'm really worried that there's a devon out there is like you got me

78
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,760
i am alone that one is good i am alone that is a good one you guys got me um

79
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,280
um yeah i mean you know it's it's long this this i know this feeling i know this feeling

80
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,880
of like everyone's starting to move away in a friend group starting to to bifurcate and perhaps

81
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:40,400
even trifurcate uh but but that's a great time to shore up some of the ones that matter to you the

82
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:50,800
most and if this is uh a guy that you care about then i mean why not i'm always gonna we're always

83
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,320
gonna tell you to to to go for it and stuff like this i mean friendships are nice but especially

84
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,320
long distance friendships it's a perfect situation you never have to see the guy right if it doesn't

85
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,520
work out you're never gonna see this fucko he's gone i mean honestly the worst the worst that

86
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,760
is probably no the worst that could happen is like an asteroid falls from the sky but like

87
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,160
the worst that's probably going to happen is if he doesn't reciprocate the feelings

88
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,040
it may be awkward for like a month or two but i mean you guys have known each other for a while

89
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,040
now and it's long distance so it's not like you have to awkwardly see each other that is that is

90
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,160
not it'll be fine again that is not how that's gonna go down it's he's not gonna say no he's

91
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,400
gonna also see the plate tectonics shifting the two of you away from each other this is

92
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,520
at any given point in your life there are like 10 people who this is your last chance to fuck them

93
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,560
oh you're painting a can't hardly wait situation i don't know what the fuck you're talking about

94
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:56,160
okay i'm saying that it look around look around you really look around you this only works if

95
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,440
you're like outside but look around you because the only thing in this room is uh my cat and my

96
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,080
sensi okay i might pretend that this is out of 30 rock okay have you hugged your mug today okay

97
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,120
well you guys can make pretend to do this with these things but i'm saying like you're on a bus

98
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,360
and you just got to the diversity stop and there goes six people just got off the bus you are never

99
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,560
going to have another chance to fuck those six people again or that sensi candle or that have

100
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,720
you hugged a mug today mug so they're like the six feet maybe there'll be the six people you

101
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,760
fucking heaven that's possible it's hard to say but i'm assuming you ride the bus a lot and

102
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,560
therefore come in contact with this situation thousands of times in your lifetime so it's more

103
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:49,840
like like the 650 000 people that you i actually have a i not a joke uh i i actually do think this

104
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,000
way on occasion not about sex though but about uh like if i'm in a in a place i've never been

105
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,360
in a place i've never been before and i'm moving through it you know like say an airport or

106
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,560
something like that as i'm passing those those people it is almost certainly the only time i'm

107
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,840
ever gonna see them it is intoxicating right basically well no what because the way i think

108
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,040
about it is that basically as soon as i avert my eyes from those people they're dead basically

109
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,440
like they're dead that's actually how i operate in just everyday life just when i don't see my

110
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,960
friends they're dead whenever i'm not talking to you guys you're dead so it's my world that

111
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,680
only exists within a six-foot circle around so like when babies start to figure out like

112
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,120
spatial understanding uh-huh that's just like no object permanent you just skip that one we

113
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,480
tried to play peekaboo with travis it just screams it just screams wildly where are you

114
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,440
what the fuck just there was a man there was a man named clint this sounds like a pretty good

115
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,920

157
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,840
you know but what's less thoughtful is if you get it for for that purpose but then you instead of

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,280
saying you just take out the word turn right and you replace it with i love you susan will you be

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,200
better gill oh sorry gilbert sorry the sorry the gilbert that listens to this show we sincerely

162
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,560
apologize listen is it appropriate to chime in when someone's getting heavy praise for something

163
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,680
you did most of the work on or are you supposed to catch the praise giver in private and then let

164
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,400
them know the real deal or are you supposed to just let it go that's from feeling gypped in japan

165
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,120
that's okay i don't know why we got a good question that's offensive that's an offensive

166
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,760
name but anyway feeling traveler in japan i think they prefer travelers feeling romanied

167
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,080
feeling romanied nomadic fortune tellers okay that might be that might be racist hold on i think we

168
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:59,120
crossed backwards secret werewolf curse lingered here's the problem is it's it's like a lose lose

169
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,000
lose situation it really really wicked is that's why the dude is supposed to say like hey i that

170
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,200
it wasn't just me this is a this is not a one-man team yeah i think that's i think that's fourth

171
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:19,040
option is you confront the the praise given later and be like hey uh what the fuck um all you did

172
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:26,080
was get the coffee and i did 16 hours of work you got you got a logic trap this guy like while

173
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,080
everyone's praising and be like oh great do it again right now in front of all of us let's see it

174
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,680
here are the twigs do it what what possible thing could someone be praised for with twigs

175
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:49,360
shitty birdhouse okay that's called a nest you dumb ass build a nest again bird i did that that

176
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,480
bird didn't build that nest i did check the nest that's my saliva holding those twigs twigs when i

177
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,120
am a dad the one i will tell my children everything the truth about everything but the one thing i

178
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,640
will tell them that is not true is that i made every nest so they see a nest of the tree i made

179
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,600
it their dear old dad was the guy when they asked what you do for a living like well every day i

180
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,040
take my briefcase full of twigs and i go out for eight hours a day and make nests the city pays me

181
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,320
to do it those uh those grackles really do look comfortable you're right daddy did that daddy did

182
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,400
that for those grackles you could call people who own birdhouses slumlords my dad's building

183
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:40,640
organic housing so here's the issue with this option one you interrupt and say um excuse me uh

184
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,920
boss man i did all the work that's the worst you look shitty that's the worst one don't do that

185
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,240
unless no way benefits unless unless you do it in a fun way like when he's like i put this

186
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,320
presentation together and everyone's clapping and you go and i helped like like the shake and bake

187
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,480
ads like the old shake and bake advertisements and people will get a real kick out of it and then

188
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,320
the boss will turn to to michael's and be like michael's is this true and he'll be like oh yeah

189
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,880
yeah johnson's johnson's definitely helped your last name is johnson your last name is plural

190
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,960
my father founded the big johnson's t-shirt company

191
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,160
i'll be damned if i let it sit and follow the likes of you uh listen uh the the these are all

192
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,400
bad yeah i think the only one don't talk to the person in private because then like that looks

193
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,720
really really bad because it looks so shady and like underhanded but like hey um i didn't want

194
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,520
to say anything earlier right oh but he didn't do all the work i did the i i mean i don't think

195
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:56,640
it's a terrible idea to go to the to the person and say like listen we've both worked on this it

196
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,440
would mean a lot to me if you but then he'd be like oh oh oh what about this you go to him and

197
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,080
say hey i really appreciated all the things and the nice things you said about the project we

198
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,320
work really hard on it i didn't get a chance to earlier but i just wanted to say thank you i

199
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,200
really appreciated the acknowledgement oh no that's like a crazy thing but i kind of that's

200
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,320
really manipulative yeah you act as though dude also called you out and then he's like uh could

201
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,520
i yeah congratulations that's a pr i like that travis i'm actually into that could i do that for

202
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,640
anything though sorry like if i go to like a live theater show and like everybody's clapping and be

203
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,200
like guys thank thank you guys thank you so much for just acknowledging all of our hard work up

204
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
there we get up there every day just trying to make you laugh trying to make you cry trying to

205
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
make you clap you can always pretend to be the director no one knows no we're the writer who

206
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,000
knows who wrote a play really well unless you're unless it's like a shakespeare show which went

207
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,240
good luck that was me every time i see shakespeare when everybody's clapping i i like they shout

208
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:13,040
and i shout like they shout like bravo i'm i'm shouting like author author because i hope one

209
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:21,520
time he's like what shakespeare you're saying yeah you hope one time that one out of out of

210
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,840
let's say the 30 times you've seen a shakespeare show he arrives he arrives just in time he he

211
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,800
splits up through the floorboards very spooky goes to shakespeare and he's like you did a good

212
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,560
job with my play okay and and the reason he comes is because you just imagine i have shakily

213
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,200
supported his art form maybe 20 or 30 times i'm so glad i was able to reach one special boy in this

214
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,360
room only one person appreciated my play and then what if later that night you're watching

215
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,880
along came polly on dvd at home and he pops out of the tv like i did this one too like i don't

216
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,840
think you did really this one's based on othello is it is it really you know if you hung out with

217
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,120
shakespeare's ghost he would try to claim everything is some permutation oh yes the

218
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,640
incredible mr limpin it's very much like hamlet think about it really shakespeare it kind of

219
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,920
seems you know what is like mine is oedipus rex i'll hold on there because you that one is definitely

220
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,280
not you but wouldn't it be great to be hanging out with him in like 10 things i hate about you

221
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,200
come on and he's like this was come on they got it they improved it they nailed it i thought

222
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,760
i was gonna make a joke about i always get confused if that woman's name is elisa

223
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,800
olenik or larissa olenik can anyone come it's larissa the one thing i know is that the secret

224
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,000
world of alex mack was based on two gentlemen of verona think about it because the one gentleman

225
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:03,120
can dissolve into a pool of water it's not water griffin sorry it's it's ectoplasm she's a ghost

226
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,760
how about a yahoo can i keep talking about shakespeare's ghost i'm really into it do you

227
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,640
think he asked everyone if they have boz lerman's number so you can call him and tell him he's a

228
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:22,000
dick i did i did like leonardo de caprio but everything else was just leo leo was great and

229
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,720
that john leguizamo don't get me started what a delightful hispanic hold on hold on shakespeare

230
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,080
i like the movie about the more who teaches keanu how to fight

231
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,880
do you mean the matrix and did you just say the more could you not it's laurence fishburne

232
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,480
shakespeare you know he would claim to make up most words too anytime you used an impressive word

233
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,800
he would have to slip in there you know i i coined that in hamlet eight hamlet eight hamlet the eight

234
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:07,040
hamlet eight that was it was never produced i just finished the manuscript when i died i can

235
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,240
show you where i hid it if you want oh no okay it's just it's just an empty castle for two and

236
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,760
a half hours and then somehow is a good day to hamlet i don't know i don't think it was a good

237
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:27,120
name uh uh okay griffin now you can thank you i think i'm done talking about shakespeare's ghost

238
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:35,840
cool i went to stratford upon avon uh for our honeymoon and uh i got a big kick out of when

239
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,160
we got back pretending that there were more places named after shakespeare's plays in the uh in the

240
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,880
restaurant areas than there were because there was really no i i wanted steakspeares there were no

241
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:57,360
tie-ins what no tie-ins no tie-ins no no oh you know a subway would be great but they call it

242
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,440
as you like it you can just get the sandwich however you want okay griffin now i'm really

243
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,800
done i don't think i don't think i can trust you anymore i promise all right um this yahoo answer

244
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:17,280
was sent in by ryan lowen thank you ryan it's by yahoo answers user friendly zombie who asks

245
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,080
is it legal to smoke weed in space if an astronaut is out of any country would

246
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,480
nasa have any legal recourse if you smoked a bowl in the space shuttle i think it's the

247
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,240
kind of thing that they say not to do but everybody does it oh yeah i think the bigger problem is

248
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,160
less the smoking than the fire i think that you do get into some issues i think they'd probably

249
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,560
be okay with the weed if it wasn't for the you know open flame in a thing made of explosions

250
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,320
i think is less than ideal that's actually what happened in apollo 13 dude sparked a bowl

251
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,400
and they had a problem man that sounded so natural try this when you just said sparked a bowl

252
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,320
i could tell you griffin i've been practicing you sounded like a real grade eight chief chiefer

253
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,200
um you know you could just you can make this easier on yourself don't go to space to spark a

254
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:27,440
bowl go go to the south pole no country oh that's true that's a fact you just go to the south pole

255
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,400
and get like fucking lit just build a big like build the gazuntite institute down there at the

256
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,520
south pole and everybody can just like get high and patch adams can can fix people up and there's

257
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,360
no lawyers cops or toes because they all fell off your fucking foot because you're on the south

258
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,680
goddamn pole what are you treated the gazuntite institute you know what a lot a lot of any

259
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,160
anything related to freezing to death i have like probably the best at gangrene right now

260
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:03,040
like if you get gangrene don't even trip because i i do have that under control i have a better

261
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:11,280
place okay you're fucking attic or anywhere anywhere nobody's ever glow in the dark stars

262
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,400
post them up on the ceiling you're in space all of a sudden you're in space you don't need to

263
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:23,920
fucking nobody's ever gotten busted for doing weed fact fact because every time a cop catches

264
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:32,640
someone kept doing weed they're like ah kids you do getting it you guys having fun being young

265
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,560
enjoying it enjoying get out of here you're right get out of there enjoy that don't smoke it again

266
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,520
but if you do it's fine we've had a lot of fun here today but i do think we need to clarify that

267
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,040
i don't think this question asker was desperate to find a place he can smoke pot and space was his

268
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:58,080
last refuge like there's there are many other steps i think to before you you you like resort

269
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:05,440
to in a cave right you could always smoke in a cave underneath a camel why i mean why not it's

270
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,840
easier to get to you than space it's just a place on the earth is what you're saying yeah i'm just

271
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,760
i'm just thinking of places i could have said under a table but that's not as fun if the president

272
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,480
united states of america sparked up a j uh-huh in the oval office you know he does why do i know

273
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,520
he does what because he legalized it legalized it i don't he didn't though he's actually been

274
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,400
cracking down he said he was gonna legalize it he put a big old check mark on that bill

275
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,840
i yeah he was like approved approval what's the opposite of a veto is it an approval it's an

276
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,520
approval but i think you may be um confusing legalized marijuana with unmanned drone strikes

277
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,120
again i think you got it twisted maybe he gets high off unmanned drones oh that's the fucking

278
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:57,440

322
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,800
there's like that's extreme restraints.com there's probably a like a completely unpleasant ribbed

323
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,880
anal douche uh but this one looks great looks like modern art you could put this on a shelf

324
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,080
looks like modern family looks like the dyson back it's like that baby from modern family

325

330
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,800
up needing more so go on and get a few a lot of people hear the word i feel like uh dane cook

331
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,280
has taken the word douche and turned it into something oh i thought you're gonna say that

332
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,000
people hear the phrase anal douche and they think of think of dane cook well i feel like i feel like

333
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:34,640
people have take co-opted the word douche or anal douche although that's less popular um i'm turning

334
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,360
into like a bad thing but i don't think that we should i don't think we should do that for a

335
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:48,080
pleasurable and what if what if we rebrand and we go with douche hmm it sounds it sounds international

336
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,680
which i do like i mean it probably is international in origin i i think that's probably there is

337
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,200
probably some sort of european country that discovered that there is a lot of detritus

338
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,920
up there yeah but since it's a tool for cleanliness we can assume it wasn't france

346
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,560
to marry me my only problem is that her sister five years older if that matters got engaged

347
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,680
recently and her wedding will be this summer getting engaged was kind of a big deal for her

348
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,680
and i'd feel a little guilty distracting from her wedding with excitement of another engagement

349
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,240
should i wait till after the wedding to propose or just not worry and go for it before and that's

from griffin mackerel weird oh fuck listen listen got it it's actually from prudent pros prudent

supermarkets sleep they're trying to get the diapers into the cart right you get like one

394
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,720
package at most the thing is you gotta put all of them on at once why do you have to do that

395
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,480
that's the best way to sneak them into the house and then put your like big put your like a big

396
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,000
dog sweatpants on your starter jacket and your starter jacket fluffy i don't think i oh you know

397

you should do say your extreme couponing and that you got these you got you bought three you buy

398
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,080
first of all once you pull this heist then you never have to do it again because you bring home

in the diaper because i already had it on i don't know why i put it on i'm continent but if i was

439
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:32,080
you were a baby but having your own poopy on your butt sucks that's so a trade-off with adulthood

440
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:38,720
it's sort of like a benjamin button is that when you poopy in your diaper it's going to be on your

441
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,280
butt you're going to hate it and let me also say this as a person a lot of my friends are having

442
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,920
kids and i'm kind of surrounded by babies and kids now babies are awesome and people like to

443
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,760
take care of them and and and baby them until they don't anymore until the kids start screaming

444
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,640
until it becomes a thing it's not that awesome to be a baby hey listen i need some advice

445
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,560
i work long hard days and when i get home i just need some time with myself i'm married and have

446
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:10,480
one son as much as i absolutely love them i just need me some me time the only way i can get away

447
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:16,640
is in the shower here's my question how can i spice up shower time once in a while i have a

448
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,760
shower beer oh no are there other ways to treat myself that shower guy from the southern gulf

449
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:27,520
islands and he sounds awesome he sounds like what about a full-on shower wet bar i don't know

450
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,720
shower wet bar i feel like i should be asking him for advice yeah why stop at a shower beer

451
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,000
have yourself a shower manhattan okay that's nice that's good because the actual recipe

452
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:46,080
for the manhattan is i believe uh a tablespoon of bitters and then uh sweet vermouth and then

453
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:52,160
two and a half cups of lukewarm shower water delicious and then you just drink that right up

454
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,200
there is a cocktail you could make with shower water i mean by definition anything's a cocktail

455
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:04,720
if you're drunk after but you you could make a cup come up with a cocktail that uses shower water

456
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,000
and that's like the height of luxury i mean it mixes it right you know you put on like a hard

457
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,600
spray and mix your cocktail that's what you call the drink the hard spray hard spray i love it

458
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:23,520
you could uh put it on the a massaging shower head on there and that's hours of fun what do

459
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,160
you mean you can put on your butt it feels real clean after because you spray your butt out when

460
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:34,160
