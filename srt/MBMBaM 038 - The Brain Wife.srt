1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,600
Welcome to our new friends, welcome to old friends.

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,200
You've made it once again to my brother, my brother, and me, an advice show for the modern

7
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,280
era. I am your host Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,320
And this is a new era. It's a bold new day, as you heard from our theme music. This is familiar.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not too familiar, but it will still be pretty much the same. So it's not exactly like

10
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,640
the song, but you get the message. It's nothing like the song. It's a good song.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,520
It's a good song. It's a good ass song. Long mentors gave us permission because we are now

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,120
fancy, fancy gentlemen. Now, what could have prompted a move like this? Is it the worry

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,520
of lawsuits from an extremely powerful and rich musical group like ABBA?

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,920
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. That's 99% of it is my fear of death in prison.

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,640
You think we will die in prison because we don't have the rights to use that song. And here's the

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,240
weird thing. ABBA not so good by returning our phone calls. We try our best, but no dice. But

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,960
but but we do want to signify a change because we have it's kind of a big deal today. It's it's

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,280
exciting news. If this is the first place you're hearing about it, it is. It is still pretty

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,560
exciting, even if you already know my brother, my brother, me. Has joined. With the maximum fun

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,640
network Voltron, like we we are the left foot of the maximum fun robot, right?

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,600
Could we also be like Megazord? I mean, does it have to be Voltron or can we go into like

22
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,920
Mighty Morphin Power? I'm more comfortable with Mighty Morphin Power.

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,160
Ideally, we would be like Dragonzord and we could be like our whole other mech,

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,560
but I don't think I'm not going down this road with you guys. There are new people listening.

25
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
I don't know. I'm just saying we pull out our magic green ranger flute and we summon the

26
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,600
Dragonzord. I don't have to make a big deal out of it. I can't do this with you. I can't do it.

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,720
Oh, you're thinking more of like a white saber, too. Like the Red Ranger.

28
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,680
Not one word. I'll quit. I swear to Jesus.

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,920
No, this is an advice show for the modern era.

30
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
And a Power Rangers fan cast.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,480
And a Power Rangers fan cast. We used to do VR Troopers, too, but that one ran dry.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,960
If we get into Beatleborgs, I quit.

33
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,520
We had a brief big bad Beatleborgs phase, but we grew out of that pretty quickly.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Now it's pretty much just advice and Power Rangers and tattooed teenage

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,560
alien fighters from Beverly Hills.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,960
It's the same for our pizza cats. We're all about that shit.

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,880
But no, this is an advice show. We take your questions and questions from

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,400
various sources throughout time and space, and we transform them alchemy-like into wisdom.

39
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,560
So I know that if you're new to the show, or old friends, then you've probably got a lot of

40
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,680
questions and we will deal with those at the end of the show and try to address those.

41
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,080
And of course, we welcome you to get in contact with us.

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
But practical upside is, it's all good stuff.

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,320
It's a really exciting thing for us personally,

44
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,640
but it's not going to represent a big change to the show.

45
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
It's still going to be the same thing, pretty much.

46
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,720
I said, we are contractually obligated to stop talking about Power Rangers.

47
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
It was like the first thing that they said.

48
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,160
I don't know what it is. It's just that the Max Fun Network and Bandai have just this

49
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,000
long-standing grudge. I can't even recall where it started, but-

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,080
Rancorous is how I discuss the relationship. It's rancorous. It's full of rancor.

51
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Max Fun also wanted us to change the name of the show to Chuckle Fraternity, but we

52
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,920
shot them down on that. So we're already taking-

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,760
We are replacing Travis, but that is sacrifices, you know what I mean?

54
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,760
We're currently at the point where Jesse Thorne standing in for Tom Hanks would

55
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,680
tell us to change our name from the Oneaters to the Wonders.

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,960
You know what? I've had a good run.

57
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,800
Yeah.

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,320
I mean, you served a very important purpose on this show as Gilbert Godfrey's placeholder.

59
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
Spoiler alert, that is who we're replacing with.

60
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
We've gotten a lot of notes on the show,

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
and most of them have to do with that it's just not grating enough to the ears.

62
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,320
Sonically, it's too pleasing.

63
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,280
They want it to be sonically unpleasing. So we're just going to get Gilbert Godfrey on

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,680
One Week We Might Have Tom Waits. Just people who are just generally unpleasant to listen to.

65
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Snooki, making sure to tune in.

66
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,400
In fact, one episode, just no McElroys at all. Just Snooki, Tom Waits, and Gilbert Godfrey.

67
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,440
God, listen to that show.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,640
God, it's wonderful.

69
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
We got a Yahoo answer from-

70
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,920
That's my Tom Waits.

71
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,120
How it is? That's good. That's very good. All right.

72
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
To be fair, that's also your Tom Hanks.

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,600
Pussy footin' around. Let's get into the wisdom, into the knowledge, and let's open it up.

74
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,760
This comes to us from FormSpring.

75
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Hey, MBMBAM, I have a problem falling asleep every night.

76
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,960
If I go to bed at 10, I end up falling asleep around one or two,

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,640
and I usually have to get up early, meaning I only get, at most, five hours of sleep every day.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,320
What do you guys do to fall asleep faster?

79
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,160
Yeah, this is our high-energy, maximum-

80
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
This is our high-energy opening, Travis.

81
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,600
How do you fall asleep?

82
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Well, everyone sleeps.

83
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,720
Give me something that we want to appeal to everybody.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
If you did this intentionally, you're a genius.

85
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,920
If it's an accident, you're a dumb-

86
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,120
Guys, falling asleep.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,920
So far, I would say just listen to this particular episode of our podcast.

88
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,560
Step one.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,760
Welcome.

90
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,520
Well, okay.

91
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
First, jerky.

92
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Just jerking so right.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,240
I feel like we're on a first date right now.

94
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,120
I feel like we're on a first date with somebody that we met on the internet,

95
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,720
and, like, I don't know, everything we say, like, you're gonna just assume-

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,840
The first words out of your mouth?

97
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
That's just what we're all about.

98
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
You sit down at the table, it's like, hi, I'm Paul, jerking it.

99
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
What?

100
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,360
That's a weird intro, Paul, but let's go with it.

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,080
I think if you are still on board by the end of the episode, then we've got you for life.

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
If you've already tuned away, it probably wasn't meant to be.

103
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,640
Let me go ahead and change course here and give some advice.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,400
Oh, no.

105
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,760
No, first and foremost, what's important is to change your habits before going to bed.

106
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
Do not read in bed.

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,880
Do not watch TV in bed.

108
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
The bed is a place for sleeping.

109
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
If you train your mind to getting used to doing other things in bed,

110
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,920
it'll be harder to fall asleep.

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,560
Wait, nothing?

112
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
Well, you jerk it.

113
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
That's not it at all.

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,560
That's not, like, a good-

115
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
That's actually really wicked bad advice.

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
That's, like, bad advice.

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
That's what any sleep therapist will tell you.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,000
That your bed is a sleep temple that you can't do anything else in?

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,480
Well, sleep therapists tell you to have sex in the kitchen?

120
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
Like, is that what you're saying to me?

121
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,560
No, I'm saying when you're getting ready for bed, not for the sexy time,

122
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,120
but when you're getting ready for bed, get ready for bed.

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,480
Don't, you know, go to bed and then play video games for an hour.

124
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't watch TV.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
You know, you can sex it up in there.

126
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,920
But, you know, when you're going to sleep-

127
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,720
Just don't make that noise.

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Just go to sleep.

129
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
Do not make that noise while you do it.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
So wait, wait, wait.

131
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,080
Let me get this straight, Travis.

132
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
What you're saying, and you're claiming to be backed up by medical science.

133
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
Yes, yes I am.

134
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,120
That when you get into bed, you should lie perfectly still and just wait.

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,080
Is that what you're saying to me?

136
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,400
Travis, did Travis learn how to sleep in prison?

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,280
Because that's what it said.

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I'm not screaming to stop.

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,240
You should just go to sleep.

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,360
I can't, I don't have a switch like that.

141
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,200
I have to fucking trick my body into not being conscious anymore.

142
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,000
My body wants to be awake so much.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
But you also drink like bottles and bottles of NyQuil every night.

144
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,240
No, no, cause that's a slippery slope.

145
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
Get down that road.

146
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,840
Like my body knows that when I'm asleep, I'm basically dead for like eight hours.

147
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,080
Sure.

148
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
And that's, you know, not only terrifying, but wasteful.

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
There's a lot of things I could be doing with my dead time.

150
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,120
So yeah, I have to like trick it.

151
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
I have to like, I have to like sit on my legs for a while until my legs fall asleep.

152
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,600
And the rest of my body is like, yeah, might as well just go for it.

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,280
You think about the world we live in today.

154
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,720
It's 2011.

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,520
At any moment I could press a button and have any

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,920
television program or book read to me by the author or movie or anything at my finger.

157
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,360
How am I supposed to sleep through that?

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
Like think about all the amazing things I have at my disposal.

159
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,440
How can I convince myself that sleeping would be better than that?

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,440
Oh, so we're going the opposite way.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,960
We're just telling him to like, forget it.

162
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,480
Forget sleep.

163
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,040
Make do with that five hours and maybe do something with your life.

164
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,280
Have you guys ever tried to drink warm milk?

165
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,240
It's foul.

166
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
It's fucking gross.

167
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
You have to like, first of all, you got to chortle down that skin that forms on the top.

168
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,840
Like you have to break the, the what's that thing called?

169
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,240
The seal, the Muffet, the Muffet.

170
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,800
Yeah, it's called the Muffet.

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,040
Yeah.

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,920
You got to break the Muffet.

173
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,200
Um, yeah.

174
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,920
And that's, that's not a pleasant, that's not a pleasant taste at all.

175
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
And everybody knows that's where the sleeping is.

176
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,320
You got to drink the skin or if you don't drink the Muffet, if you don't drink the Muffet,

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,120
you'll be up for hours.

178
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Can you buy, can you buy piecemeal Muffet?

179
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah.

180
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,560
Yeah.

181
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,440
They're dehydrated.

182
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,520
But really the only place I've ever seen it though is at Cracker Barrel.

183
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,400
Yeah, they do.

184
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,560
You know, it's like in the old timey paper wrapping and you're going to

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,040
Sure, sure.

186
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,440
You place some checkers, um, you, you eat some liquor sticks and then you

187
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
The great, the great irony is of course that anybody would ever eat at Cracker Barrel and

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
not want to sleep instantly.

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
That's like you need it.

190
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,600
Um, but, uh, so, so eat your Muffets, go to Cracker Barrel and never read in bed.

191
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
I think it's a pretty good takeaway.

192
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,720
Um, I've been happily married for three years, but I've been noticing something that I no

193
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
longer think is a coincidence.

194
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
I've been getting a lot more attention from ladies ever since I got married.

195
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,280
I was never a real lady killer in the first place.

196
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,840
That's good.

197
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,280
But I did all right since I've been married.

198
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:14,560
However, I've gotten flirted with much, much more than I ever did when I was single.

199
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
What's up with that?

200
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:16,720
Mike.

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
So Mike is Mike's now killing, killing ladies.

202
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,040
Yeah.

203
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,640
That's really cool because, um, as a chronically single male, uh, that's like the one thing

204
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,360
that I have.

205
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,200
That's like the one leg up is that like I have the opportunity to do that if I wanted

206
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,480
to, but I don't and you do and you can't use it.

207
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
So that's cool that you're just so, you just have this embarrassment of lady attention.

208
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,760
That's, I'm really happy for you, Mike.

209
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,720
Griffin, have you, have you considered putting a ring on it?

210
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,360
Um, that's some, that's like that Adam, the Adam Sandler is making a movie about that

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,280
and I try to live my life avoiding any phony baloney Adam Sandler movie scenarios.

212
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,000
Except for the time that I sold you that magical remote control.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,640
There was that.

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,160
And I did, I did go back to elementary school at the age of like 25.

215
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,600
So, um, yeah.

216
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
No, I'm really worried during that time period, by the way.

217
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,360
Yeah.

218
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,080
And that was the only, that was only to recruit for your jump rope team.

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,880
So I don't think that it's not the same thing.

220
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,640
Well, I here's, here's my thinking on this is that it's not that I would like to believe

221
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,600
enough in humanity that it's not that every woman is attract instantly attracted to a

222
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
guy because he is married.

223
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,240
But I think it's more that you become more comfortable.

224
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,400
You're not trying to impress anyone.

225
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,000
I mean, you've already got, you know, your significant other, so you're not working at

226
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
it, which instantly makes you more attractive.

227
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,840
So true.

228
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,400
That's it.

229
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,280
A hundred percent.

230
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,120
If every single guy listening to the show can take away one thing, it is if you just

231
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,520
relax and stop working, it makes you so much cooler.

232
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,600
Like women will like you so much more if you're not trying to impress them.

233
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,640
Brain married.

234
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,440
That's what I call it.

235
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,480
You gotta be brain married.

236
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,960
I like that.

237
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,000
I like that a lot.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,640
How deep, how deep does that, that inception go though?

239
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,160
Like, I mean, I need to obviously a name for my brain wife, right?

240
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,040
I would need a name and like a story of how we met, how I met my, how I met my wife.

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
How I met your brain mother.

242
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,200
I'm saying I can, I can invent an entire scenario around a person and then not let anybody know

243
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
about it except for me.

244
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,920
I can do that.

245
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,520
Like I've played Dungeons and Dragons.

246
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm totally capable of suspending entire, you know, worlds in my mind's eye.

247
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
Those two skills dovetail so nicely.

248
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,520
Because I know that when I'm trying to stop impressing women, the first thing I do is

249
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,880
talk about Dungeons and Dragons.

250
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:39,760
Hi.

251
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,200
And that, and you know what?

252
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
A lot of people try to keep this, their brain wife secret.

253
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,840
I say, yeah, open with it.

254
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,480
I say, hi, my name is Griffin.

255
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,400
I have an imaginary wife and a great skill at playing Dungeons and Dragons.

256
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Would you like to dance with me?

257
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,480
And you know something?

258
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,400
My favorite December's album is The Brain Wife.

259
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,840
So I just wanted to, I thought I'd kill that conversation.

260
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,280
Thanks, Griffin.

261
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
Yeah, you did it.

262
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,120
Mission accomplished.

263
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,560
You guys want to hear a Yahoo?

264
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,520
I would love to.

265
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,400
Yahoo Answers.

266
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
Can you tell us about those, Griffin?

267
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Yahoo Answers are, they come from a website that is also called Yahoo Answers, and they

268
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,280
are written by the dregs of humanity.

269
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,960
And we take them and we make fun of the people who ask them.

270
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,600
That's not true.

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,400
We help them.

272
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Griffin, don't break the solution for me.

273
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,920
I do believe that everybody who asks a Yahoo answer question is beyond help from anybody.

274
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,600
Okay, do it.

275
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,880
This one was sent in by Matty B.

276
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,840
Thank you, Matty B.

277
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica, who asks, help with my own urban legend?

278
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,400
In my English class, we're having this huge project on urban legends.

279
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,160
My job is to create my own urban legend, but I'm having trouble making a good plot.

280
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,120
I need suggestions.

281
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,160
I can write romance, horror, suspense, supernatural, par, et cetera.

282
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,120
Wait, what?

283
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,080
I don't, maybe golf, golf themed urban legends.

284
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,440
I don't understand.

285
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
So I would prefer one of these topics in it.

286
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,840
I know there are non scary urban legends out there, but I like creepy.

287
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,400
It can possibly happen to you stories.

288
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,280
Does she, does this urban legend have to be about her?

289
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,320
I don't know if it has to be about her or her.

290
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
What is the name of this emailer, this asker?

291
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,640
Jessica, which is nearly impossible to make.

292
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,920
She must, she must have been early on the Yahoo answer stream.

293
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
She was able to get Jessica as her username.

294
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,200
Oh, that's a pretty sweet username.

295
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,320
I hear people are just selling those off now for like six figures.

296
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,040
It's pretty cherry.

297
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,840
Jessica, the legend of Jessica.

298
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,080
And then hiding in the backseat, here's Jessica.

299
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,680
Like that's not really scary, is it?

300
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,200
Well, maybe, maybe we can find some inspiration and some answers.

301
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,560
What do you, what do you think?

302
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,320
Let's just dip in there and see what happens.

303
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Answer one says a bad storm comes and everyone is safe, but one young teenage boy.

304
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,080
At the same time every morning, weird things happen where his death took place.

305
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,040
It begins to attract more and more kids from his school, especially those who were close to him.

306
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Things begin to get stranger and stranger.

307
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,840
Now that's my favorite part in every horror story is when things begin to get stranger and stranger.

308
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,840
Those who were close to him decide to use a Ouija board to communicate with him at that same time,

309
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,840
the same day, a year later.

310
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,000
Unfortunately, they learned that it wasn't him the hard way.

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,200
Wait, wait, hold on.

312
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Best thing I, best thing I could spring up at this time.

313
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,320
Maybe you can work with it in other people's ideas.

314
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,120
Wait, wait, wait.

315
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,320
The kid lived, I thought.

316
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,440
Did it?

317
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Because a bad storm came and everyone was safe except for one young teenage boy.

318
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,560
Please try to get to, yeah.

319
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,240
That is the worst urban legend I've ever heard.

320
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Hey, it's the best thing that they could spring up at this time.

321
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,560
But the whole point of an urban legend is that you tell it to somebody and they go,

322
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,200
oh yeah, I think I know someone that that happened to.

323
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
Like who's going to listen to this?

324
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,760
Like, oh yeah, I remember when that one young boy was in danger from the one storm,

325
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,360
even though everyone else was safe.

326
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,120
But then a year later they used a Ouija board, but it turned out it wasn't him the hard way.

327
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,400
What?

328
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
I think it's got stranger and then later stranger.

329
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,880
What things?

330
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,280
Have you noticed how strange this toast is?

331
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
Yeah, I also noticed that this cup was strange.

332
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,040
Everything's getting stranger and stranger.

333
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
It's getting really strange today.

334
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,080
Hey, hey man.

335
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,400
My favorite Stephen King book is the one where my favorite line of his was,

336
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,640
and then the guy went to a place and this scary thing happened.

337
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,720
And it got scarier and scarier.

338
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,840
They thought it was a scary thing, but it was another one.

339
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,340
Boo.

340
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,680
The hard way.

341
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,920
Ghosted shit.

342
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,320
What's the easy way to figure out that a ghost is a different ghost?

343
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
Like find a note?

344
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
So wait, did they think-

345
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,560
Okay, so they try to get in touch with this little boy, Jessica, on the Ouija board.

346
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
And it turned out that he-

347
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,800
Is it that he didn't die or that there was another ghost hidden?

348
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,640
I think there was another ghost.

349
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
He definitely died.

350
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,680
This is all just a really great spectral coincidence because,

351
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,680
I mean, ghosts have to hang out where they die, like forever.

352
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,160
Right?

353
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,280
Ghosts can't just wonder unless they have Beetlejuice powers.

354
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
But even then, they couldn't leave the house, right?

355
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,040
Or else they got eaten by the dune sandworm.

356
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,800
I haven't seen that movie in a long time.

357
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,800
So I guess two ghosts got killed at the same place,

358
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,240
and one was significantly scarier and stranger and stranger than the other one.

359
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,440
I don't know.

360
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,960
This obviously needs some workshopping.

361
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,080
How about answer two?

362
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
Who says, with my creative mind, I will help you.

363
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,140
Oh, good.

364
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:52,820
Oh, God. That's good, Eddie.

365
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,220
This old woman lives in an old house with an old husband,

366
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,420
and at night you can always see a candle lit in the top window of the attic.

367
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,820
It is said they practice the occult.

368
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,220
I heard it through the grapevine that these old, old dudes-

369
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,340
Did you hear it through the grapevine? People say they hear moaning and screams coming from the cellar and home.

370
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,180
Are you hearing screaming?

371
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:24,660
I am.

372
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,780
I can't tell if it's coming from their cellar or from the-

373
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,860
Let's go in and investigate, because I don't know if it's from the lower part of the house or the upper part.

374
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,340
The cellar is not part of the home proper.

375
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,780
I think we can all agree.

376
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,900
A cellar is basically a second bullshit home that you keep buried underneath your regular home,

377
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,580
because you're so embarrassed of it, because it's just one big stupid room.

378
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,900
Did you guys notice the moaning and screaming that comes from their cellar or home?

379
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,740
Yeah, I heard that they practice the occult.

380
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,420
And also, there's a candle in the window.

381
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,420
Why did you bring up the candle?

382
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,340
This is the best story ever.

383
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,420
We're talking about occult. Why did you bring up the candle, bro?

384
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,220
Screams and stuff, and it turns out there's a candle in their window.

385
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,420
Guys, it's about to get stranger and stranger. Just buckle up.

386
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,300
Okay.

387
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,500
After about 20 years, the woman and man disappear.

388
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,700
Okay.

389
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,220
The purchaser of the home finds a secret door in the cellar.

390
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,860
He also finds marked graves.

391
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,740
Wait, wait, wait. The seller of the- the person who sold the home to him?

392
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,860
Oh shit, this is getting-

393
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,780
Yes, there was a secret door hidden inside the body of the real estate agent who sold this spooky,

394
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,420
spooky home.

395
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,940
He also finds marked graves.

396
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,700
There have been children disappearing for years in the town.

397
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,300
Maybe you could have mentioned that earlier.

398
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:41,220
Uh, and when they dig up the graves, they only find three of the 14 missing.

399
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,260
Where are the rest?

400
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,500
Why are there three there?

401
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,300
Right.

402
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,660
They say the rest were buried in the backyard.

403
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,580
They dig up the backyard to no avail.

404
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,980
This is boring!

405
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,740
Wait, wait, what?

406
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,660
Here's some other shit that has no significance.

407
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,940
Did you hear the one about the guys who went in the forest looking for the monster?

408
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,060
There was no monster there, but still, it was pretty creepy.

409
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,780
Yeah, they got really- got close to his friends.

410
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,140
Another- another secret door in the attic is discovered.

411
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,740
What's it?

412
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,220
There-

413
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,260
There's a candle!

414
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,980
There are the bones and skulls of the remaining 12 children.

415
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,900
The old people have disappeared, and to this day, might be your neighbors.

416
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,700
It is-

417
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,740
I know my neighbors.

418
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,380
They are not-

419
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:26,980
I- I don't-

420
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:34,100
I don't- it is said with the occult, they were in- they found a way to live forever.

421
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:34,340
Good luck.

422
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,540
Are you still going on with this?

423
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,900
Yeah, that's it.

424
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,380
Okay.

425
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,340
It ends with good luck.

426
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,900
Here's a quick- a quick lesson in- in urban legend.

427
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,100
Urban legend.

428
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Kid was sticking his head out a window, a car was passing with a dog sticking their

429
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,060
head out the window, the kid knocked the dog's head off.

430
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,420
That's an urban legend.

431
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
Yeah, or like chupacabra.

432
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,020
Like, these are all good urban legends.

433
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,980
Not-

434
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,540
Fucking-

435
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,420
And then they look in the basement, but they couldn't find anything.

436
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,740
There was an old house with old people in it, and there were screams in it, and also

437
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,140
a candle, and then 20 years passed, and people bought it, and they found three out of 14

438
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,100
missing kids, and they thought they looked in the backyard, but nope.

439
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,220
Got an attic.

440
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,740
It's bones and shit.

441
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
They're not your neighbors.

442
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,860
The thing that's- that's fucking me up is the- okay, where is the graveyard?

443
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,740
Is that clarified?

444
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,100
I think it's in-

445
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,220
The marked graves?

446
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,500
The secret door in the cellar?

447
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,700
No, no, no.

448
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,500
The graveyard that they find with the gravestones and stuff.

449
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,100
Yeah, it's in the secret door in the cellar.

450
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,020
Okay, okay, so, okay.

451
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,300
So wait.

452
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:41,940
These old people basically have been killing kids for sacrifice, and they- they went to

453
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,020
their basement after they killed them and dug 14 graves and put like, marks up and stuff,

454
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,260
right?

455
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,220
They only put- they only put three dead kids in there.

456
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,700
Yeah, so they were planning on being far busier than they had planned originally.

457
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,260
Is that- or he got lazy, like, Carl, will you please take those dead kids out of the

458
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,780
attic and bury them in our cellar?

459
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,700
I mean, that's- that's the thing, isn't it?

460
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,860
First of all, first of all, one thing I just put together-

461
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,060
I did it already, June!

462
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,300
They dug up the graves and only found three of the 14 children missing, but they found

463
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,260
12 kids worth of bones in the attic.

464
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,780
They found an extra kid.

465
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,380
That's 15- that's 15 dead kid bodies, like-

466
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,020
Where did this extra kid come from?

467
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,900
I don't know, just check it.

468
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,700
Where did these numbers come from in the first place?

469
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,620
This guy's typing on y'all here answers.

470
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,740
There's like 14 kids, I guess.

471
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,500
If you grew up in this fictional town, you would- you would know about the 14 missing

472
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,140
kids.

473
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,060
I think- I think we can just assume that.

474
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,100
This is like, lost.

475
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,460
I want to know more about this.

476
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,020
This is-

477
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,980
Here's my issue.

478
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:42,980
You have one issue.

479
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:43,860
I have one issue.

480
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,980
I have one plot point, one hole that- that my- my comprehension is falling through.

481
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,860
They have 11.

482
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,140
That is this.

483
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,180
All right.

484
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:58,580
So they look in the cellar where there were screams coming from, and they find three of

485
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:03,460
the bodies, and they find the rest in the goddamn attic where no streams were coming

486
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:03,860
from.

487
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,580
The screams were either coming from the cellar or the home.

488
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,780
They don't mention the attic.

489
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,380
Why are there bodies in the attic?

490
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:15,460
And like, from what I understand, these people, these occultists, were old as fuck.

491
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,540
Like, how are they going to carry 12 kid- 12 super, super dead kids up three flights

492
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,100
of stairs, assuming the house is two stories tall?

493
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,740
Have you ever- ever tried to carry a dead kid?

494
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,500
Because it's like cord- like, it is-

495
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,260
It's heavier than you would think.

496
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,500
Like-

497
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,460
They go limp.

498
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,980
Like, they go wicked limp, and you've got to-

499
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,900
They do not help whatsoever.

500
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,260
No, they're not pitching in.

501
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,420
Why would these people not get a sing- I wish the town would all chip in and get these

502
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:48,340
people like a nice, you know, single level, maybe a wheelchair ramp, something a little

503
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,220
bit more accessible, so they can kill kids and not have to put their old, old joints

504
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,740
in- in such disrepair?

505
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,100
This is just really bad planning.

506
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,060
I- I expect more from our- our nation's elderly.

507
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,140
Hey, my bim bam, I have this friend on Facebook who comments on almost every single post people

508
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:11,060
put up, and it's usually just stupid, meaningless things like lull or smiley faces.

509
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:16,020
He's starting to get really on my nerves, and I know other people are annoyed too.

510
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,860
I don't want to confront him about this, and deleting him as a friend seems too harsh.

511
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,220
Any advice?

512
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,340
Oh, man.

513
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:24,580
Man.

514
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,500
Deleting him as a friend, how will he ever recover?

515
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,980
I know, and you don't want to confront him either.

516
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,660
Brad, if you're not going to confront a Facebook friend, you're going to have to deal with

517
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,340
the fucking lulls, my buddy.

518
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,540
Yeah.

519
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,660
This is America.

520
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,100
This is one of those, like, it's almost like a trick question where him doing it isn't

521
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,340
that bad, and you telling him to stop doing it isn't that bad.

522
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,580
It's fucking Facebook.

523
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,540
It's Facebook!

524
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,900
Nothing matters!

525
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,540
Just don't read his stupid comments!

526
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,900
Yeah, either ignore it, because it's fucking Facebook.

527
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,580
Nothing on the internet that you do matters, especially not on Facebook.

528
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah.

529
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,120
Now, if he was coming over to your house every day and, like, knocking on your door and saying

530
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,640
lull and running off, by all means, kill that man.

531
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,400
No, no, that'd be awesome.

532
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:11,900
Whatever.

533
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,560
I would love that.

534
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,680
I need that friend in my life.

535
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,640
What if you could have him, like, behind your couch, so you're talking to your brain wife,

536
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,680
and you make a really good zinger, and he just pops up, lull, and then hides that way.

537
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,320
I'd take it back.

538
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,280
That would rule.

539
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,320
It would be awesome, right?

540
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,280
He just makes a smiley face with his face, and then goes away.

541
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,400
And he just gives you a thumbs up and says, I like this, and then goes away.

542
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,200
Who's at the window?

543
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,960
There's somebody at the window.

544
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,120
It's Frank.

545
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,920
He's smiling.

546
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,560
He's smiling at what you just said.

547
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,080
He's just letting us know that this video we were talking about is really funny.

548
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,920
There's some people like that on the internet that just, they're incapable of either creating

549
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,440
or finding things that are awesome, so they just, you know, they react to them, but they

550
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,880
do it with two to four keystrokes.

551
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,640
That's like all the energy that they have in them.

552
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
And that's fine.

553
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,720
Those people have their place.

554
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,200
I appreciate the economy of that, because if he was getting on and every single thing

555
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,960
everyone posted, and he would type out a paragraph describing why he enjoyed that thing and why

556
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,840
others should enjoy it too, dude, just put a smiley face so I can ignore it and move

557
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,240
on with my life and get back to Farmville, you know?

558
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,640
Like is a good button.

559
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,320
Tell him to start using like.

560
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,240
Tell him that you, tell him that you give 10 cents to charity every time he clicks like

561
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,040
on something and it just, and doesn't comment on it.

562
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,680
Let's go a little more life affirming.

563
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,080
We have a, we have a special question.

564
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,360
Who did, who did this one come to us from, Griffin?

565
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,240
This one was sent in by one Mr. Jonathan Anderson.

566
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:46,840
Okay.

567
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,560
And you know what?

568
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,680
It's such a special occasion.

569
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Let's let Jonathan ask himself.

570
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,480
What do you think?

571
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,040
Go for it.

572
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,200
Hey guys, this is John from Brooklyn and I'm in need of a bit of advice.

573
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,480
I've been dating my girlfriend Katie for the last four years.

574
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,080
We met at college and have been madly in love ever since.

575
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,840
I recently dropped stacks on a engagement ring for her, but just can't think of the

576
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,440
best way to do it.

577
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,040
Can you guys tell me how to, how I should propose to this, the love of my life?

578
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,320
Thanks guys.

579
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:17,800
Bye bye.

580
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,720
A fine question.

581
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,360
Uh, a difficult, uh, a difficult thing to do, do well.

582
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,760
Um, we have, we've actually answered this question before, uh, but it was a, it was

583
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,360
a total phony joke.

584
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,720
Uh, and this time, unless Jonathan's running the short grift on us, I think it's legit.

585
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,480
Yeah, I think it's legit.

586
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,280
Welcome.

587
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,880
What a treat for our, uh, uh, maximum fun friends, our new maximum fun friends that

588
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,000
they are here for our very first, very real wedding proposal.

589
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,400
Now, uh, maybe we could just walk Jonathan through this step-by-step.

590
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,120
Yeah.

591
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,600
I mean, he's in the moment right now, like listening to our voice.

592
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,400
This is, this is the most magical moment of his entire life.

593
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,920
Take a knee left or right.

594
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,640
Doesn't matter.

595
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,280
No, right knee.

596
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,440
Cause if you take a left knee, go right knee.

597
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,760
You know how the divorce rate is 50 50.

598
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,360
It's because the knees.

599
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,920
Yeah.

600
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Yeah.

601
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,920
So go down to the right or it's over.

602
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,160
Right.

603
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:11,960
Okay.

604
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,760
Now you're going to reach in your pocket and make eye contact.

605
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,120
This is very important.

606
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,240
Don't fall over.

607
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,320
Don't fall over cause then you'll be a joke.

608
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:19,560
Yeah.

609
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:19,800
Yeah.

610
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,200
And look at her straight in the eye.

611
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,920
I hope if she has eyes, let's say she has eyes.

612
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,080
Okay.

613
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
Look her straight in the eye.

614
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,440
Okay.

615
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,720
No, like, no, not like that, Jonathan.

616
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,760
You're looking too serious.

617
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,680
Like, look, it's a good, it's a good moment.

618
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,040
Have like a half smile.

619
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,360
Half smile.

620
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,960
Like a half, like knowing smile.

621
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,560
That's good.

622
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,200
That's good.

623
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,680
That's good.

624
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,000
Now sweat a little bit more than you are right now.

625
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,400
Yeah.

626
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,600
Can you give your hair a little must just to give it some rakish charm?

627
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,160
There we go.

628
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,560
That's good.

629
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:45,800
Great.

630
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,760
All right.

631
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,960
He's already done it.

632
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,600
We just done it.

633
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,640
We took too long.

634
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,120
No, no, no.

635
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,240
He's still, he's still in the moment.

636
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,600
He's going step by step.

637
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:52,840
Okay.

638
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,680
Now you're going to pull your hands out, but you're going to do this like clamshell kind of thing.

639
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,040
Where you're like, you're covering something up in your hand.

640
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,760
What could it be?

641
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,360
And it's a candy.

642
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,720
It's a Werther's original.

643
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,160
Catch her off guard first.

644
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,200
She won't see that coming.

645
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,800
And then explain to her that you got her a picture of a ring.

646
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,520
It's a ring you got off Craigslist and a picture of it.

647
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,840
Cause the guys that brought it by yet, but he seems straight up.

648
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,880
No, you have a ring.

649
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,280
Get the ring out.

650
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,920
You open the ring, but open it sort of close to her face.

651
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,120
So it looks bigger.

652
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:24,760
This is key.

653
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,600
You got to do this.

654
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
You got to do it just that way.

655
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,640
Now pull back a little bit cause you're freaking her out.

656
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,880
Yeah.

657
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,760
Now, and hopefully she's crying at this point.

658
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
Oh, she's openly weeping.

659
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,320
Okay.

660
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:35,560
Good.

661
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,680
It's happy tears though.

662
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:37,480
Okay.

663
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,520
Do we know her name?

664
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,080
Katie.

665
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,640
It's Katie.

666
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,200
Katie.

667
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,680
Katie.

668
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,680
Look at this boy, Katie.

669
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,640
He is here for you.

670
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,760
He's chosen the most romantic way that I could think of to ask you to be with him forever and

671
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,720
ever and ever and ever and ever.

672
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,880
And I straight up, I mean this with all respect.

673
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,400
You're not going to do any better.

674
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,280
No, no, no.

675
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,960
He's the best you're going to do.

676
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,520
Look at it.

677
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,640
Jonathan Anderson.

678
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,360
Are you kidding me?

679
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,960
That's the most powerful.

680
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,360
That name is just, that's, that's a virile name.

681
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,880
It's full of guys.

682
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,400
It's full of Vim and vigor.

683
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,240
You can't get any better than that.

684
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,520
His knee is starting to hurt guys.

685
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,880
We got to bring this up.

686
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,120
We're going to put on some mood music.

687
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,200
Justin's going to put on On the Wings of Love.

688
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,480
We're going to edit that in right now.

689
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,000
I definitely won't forget to do that.

690
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,200
Okay.

691
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,640
So now, oh, that's good.

692
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,520
That's going real good.

693
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,360
Now, Jonathan, look her in the eyes.

694
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,480
We're going to give you like literally three seconds to say something special.

695
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:29,720
Go.

696
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,800
And then, okay, now ask her.

697
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,360
Do it.

698
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,080
Katie, come back.

699
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,000
Katie, no, wait.

700
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,200
Hey, Jonathan.

701
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,680
Listen.

702
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,040
Hey, wait.

703
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,600
She's back.

704
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,080
She's back.

705
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,400
Okay.

706
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,440
She rethought it.

707
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,320
She rethought it.

708
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,400
It looks like, that looks like a big yes.

709
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,800
So congratulations.

710
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,960
This is a weird way to do this because we have no way.

711
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,240
He said he was going to send in their, send in their response.

712
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,840
God almighty.

713
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,480
God, I really hope it's yes, or this one thing is just so sad.

714
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,200
Jonathan, listen.

715
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,120
If it's not a yes, you can never let us know.

716
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,320
We couldn't take the rejection, honestly.

717
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,840
What do you think he said?

718
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,960
How do you think he phrased it?

719
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,880
How do you think he said?

720
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,400
I think he just said, I'm sorry.

721
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,920
I'm so, so sorry.

722
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,880
Seemed like such a good idea before, but now it seems like a really bad idea that I had.

723
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,240
Let's not tell the kids.

724
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,920
Write us in five years and we'll help you come up with a story for how it really happened.

725
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,360
What if he just said, like, get at me, he just put that ring out there.

726
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,920
I was just like, hey, get at it, get it.

727
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,120
He looks at her.

728
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,040
He's like, Hey, weirdest first date ever, right?

729
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Hey,

730
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,280
congratulations.

731
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,760
You too.

732
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,120
I'm sure, I'm sure it went well.

733
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,240
Or condolences the other way.

734
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,760
Yeah, one of those two.

735
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,000
Hey, how about we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we,

736
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,200
we break up the flow a little bit with a, with a Yahoo.

737
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,600
Okay.

738
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,000
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

739
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,120
Thank you, Jonathan Bartram.

740
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,240
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Donnie J.

741
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,320
Who asks, do aliens go to heaven and hell also?

742
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,040
There is no way earth is the only planet with life out of billions of planets.

743
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,880
So does aliens from other parts of the universe go to hell and heaven also,

744
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,720
or is it only strictly for humans?

745
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,160
We've addressed the, the concept of, of, um, you know, extraterrestrial spirituality in a previous

746
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,080
episode, uh, where we established that each planet does in fact have its own Jesus.

747
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,880
Uh, so everybody knows that.

748
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,640
I think that it only makes sense that other planets would have their own heavens too,

749
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,880
because I don't want to sound like a bigot or nothing.

750
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,880
I don't want to spend eternity with a bunch of, a bunch of off worlders, which is, uh,

751
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:54,600
as everyone knows the, the racist term for outer space.

752
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,560
Here's the thing though.

753
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,000
This is what you're forgetting.

754
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,560
If by alien, you, you are implying that is someone from another planet coming to our planet.

755
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,640
And as everyone knows, if you die on this planet, you're under the jurisdiction of Earth God.

756
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,000
Of Earth God and Earth Jesus.

757
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,240
Yeah.

758
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,440
A lot of people, a lot of planets will actually like, if you're an alien and you

759
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,600
do something really terrible, like you'll make a run for the border and then try to

760
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,960
die when you cross it.

761
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,320
Cause Mars Jesus, Mars Jesus and Mars God will follow you right to like the border.

762
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,920
You know that asteroid belt between the two?

763
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,200
It'll follow you right there.

764
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,200
And then it's sort of like smoking the band, like throw his hat down.

765
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,240
Like, Oh God, got away again.

766
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,440
And then you got to go die on Earth.

767
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,080
And then Earth.

768
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,560
But Earth heaven beats the shit out of Mars heaven.

769
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,560
It beats the shit out of basically our whole, the whole Milky Way thing that we have.

770
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Earth is totally the best.

771
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,200
I think we can all agree.

772
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,640
Well, if you come from Mars, yeah.

773
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,240
But if you die on Earth and then go to Earth heaven, a lot of people think it's a step

774
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,720
down because they they're still making coffee from pots instead of like those pods, like

775
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
single serve up in Earth heaven.

776
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,080
But to be fair, have you guys ever visited Neptune heaven?

777
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
That's the party heaven.

778
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,080
Is it really?

779
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,040
Is that party heaven?

780
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,360
Yeah.

781
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,120
That is the party heaven.

782
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,080
Don't get me wrong.

783
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
Their infrastructure is shit.

784
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,160
Like there's no clean water and the bathrooms suck.

785
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,120
But it is a rave 24 seven.

786
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,840
It's a very, it's a very cold, moist planet.

787
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,160
So I think that I, I guess that raving is really all they have to do there.

788
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,920
You know, if you drink a tube of fluorescent while you're in Neptune heaven, nothing happens.

789
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,800
It's like the best thing.

790
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,400
If you drink a glow stick, you mean?

791
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,360
If you drink the glow stick.

792
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,800
Yeah, exactly.

793
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,360
No grip.

794
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,720
A tube of fluorescent.

795
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,840
That's why the words wouldn't come.

796
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,200
That's what they call them in the UK.

797
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,840
Yeah, crazy.

798
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,080
Give me a tube of that fluorescent juice.

799
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,520
God blimey.

800
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,560
Oh, good.

801
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
That's great, Travis.

802
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,680
We're showing off our talents on this, our first maximum fun episode.

803
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,280
Quick, Griffin, play the spoons.

804
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,480
We, no, but you, do you know what happened when they declassified Pluto as a planet?

805
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,680
All those spirits were injected into the inky blackness of space.

806
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,040
Good work, scientist.

807
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,840
Thanks, scientist.

808
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,960
You sent a bunch of souls to oblivion forever.

809
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,640
Yeah, Pluto Nash is actually about him looking for the spirit of his grandma

810
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,240
Ma to rescue her from the abyss.

811
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,800
That's true.

812
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,440
That's science.

813
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
All joking aside.

814
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah, finally.

815
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,320
This is, this is why the space race is still so, just so vitally important because we've

816
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,560
only spread the word of Earth Jesus to the moon and that's, that's it.

817
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,920
The rest of it, I mean, we shoot satellites with Earth Jesus's message, like into the

818
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,200
stars, into the heavens, but, but I don't know.

819
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:50,680
I feel like that's not as effective as, you know, an actual astronaut armed with the,

820
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
the good book and maybe a few chick tracks.

821
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:00,600
So, just support NASA with all your money because it'll help save aliens from going

822
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,720
to hell forever.

823
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,040
You don't want aliens to go to hell and Mars, hell, forget about it.

824
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,120
Mars is already basically hell and then you add on the fact that it's hell.

825
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,000
Well, you don't want any slice of that.

826
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,000
I take city buses to and from my college campus and last month I noticed a dollar on the floor

827
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,560
above my feet.

828
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,040
Since no one was near me and no one seemed to be freaking out over lost money, I decided

829
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,920
to take it.

830
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,400
I feel that if I had asked any other passengers if it was theirs, any unscrupulous individual

831
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,480
would have claimed it was theirs, regardless of whether it was or not.

832
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
What's the proper etiquette in this situation?

833
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,400
Is it better to ask around or is it a reward for the first person who knows it on the ground?

834
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Sincerely, victim of circumstance, victim of circumstance.

835
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,360
What year are you living in that a dollar is worth thinking about?

836
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Yeah, I wouldn't even pick it up.

837
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,000
I tear it in half.

838
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,120
Have you seen the economy?

839
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,760
It's not only the tremendous physical effort that goes into bending down and retrieving

840
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,160
an item from the ground, it's, you're basically, you're selling your own shame whenever you

841
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,120
pick up money off the ground.

842
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,200
You are selling your shame because you should be ashamed because you're like a dog, you're

843
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,280
like a plebe, you're like a peasant picking up whatever scraps of currency that people

844
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,720
have left lying around for you.

845
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,800
It's shameful and I don't think that a dollar is a good exchange rate.

846
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
I wouldn't do it for anything less than ten.

847
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,320
I read in Monocle that the rich are, have been taking up throwing money on the ground

848
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,080
and waiting for poor people to pick it up.

849
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,120
Yeah, like for sport.

850
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,840
So that, you don't want to be the puppet in the game, like in Hard Target with John

851
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,400
Golf Van Damme, where you're playing a rich man's game.

852
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,160
Like you want to, you want to be your own man who doesn't bend over for money.

853
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Now fiver, all right.

854
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,720
Fiver is, a fiver is, I don't know, it's a gray area in my mind.

855
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,560
I say one, fuck no, coins, don't be a, don't be a child, don't even think about coins.

856
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,360
See, I disagree with that, if it's a quarter, I'll pick it up.

857
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,120
Cause who doesn't always need a quarter?

858
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,720
That's the thing man, parking meters, I always need a quarter.

859
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,040
Yeah.

860
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,600
And who doesn't always want some gum and you're like, who has coins?

861
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,640
No one has coins.

862
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:03,880
Yeah.

863
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,800
You're basically, it's a future, it's an investment in future gum if you pick up a

864
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,000
quarter, a dollar that you can't even get a soda with a dollar bill anymore.

865
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,200
Quarters are still useful.

866
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,920
You know what I do?

867
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:13,960
What?

868
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,560
I just pick people's pockets.

869
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,080
Just take it right out of their pockets.

870
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
Charles cuts out the middle man.

871
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,400
Yeah.

872
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,320
They're probably going to drop it anyway.

873
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,640
Yeah.

874
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,920
They want you to have it.

875
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,000
They want you to have it.

876
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,760
Now, pennies don't get me started on pennies.

877
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,040
If you give me pennies as change, like at the Costco or the Speedway, I will throw them

878
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,600
back in your face.

879
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,840
I think bending over to pick up a dollar is a hundred times worse than picking up a penny.

880
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,120
What is mathematically?

881
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,360
Yes.

882
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,640
Thank you.

883
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,600
What is the largest amount of money that you guys have found just like lying around in

884
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,000
the wild that you didn't have to work for?

885
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,840
You just sort of, you happened upon it and you made it your own by way of your actions.

886
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,640
I found $64 once.

887
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,840
I found $60 in an envelope at King's Island on a church trip.

888
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,840
And I think the good earth Jesusy thing to do would have been to give it to the lost

889
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,200
and found so it could be returned.

890
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,320
Because you know, you're a kid.

891
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,360
You put your money in an envelope when you go to a theme park because you don't have

892
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,080
a wallet yet.

893
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,720
But man, no.

894
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,520
Please tell me you did that.

895
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,320
Oh, I put that.

896
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,160
Oh, that shit went right in my pocket.

897
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,600
I bought a fanny pack with that money.

898
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,720
Ironically, if that kid has made that investment, he wouldn't have dropped his money.

899
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:23,960
Yeah.

900
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,320
Well, no, I took the money.

901
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,160
I took the remainder of the money and put it right in the fanny pack because I was a

902
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,280
pretty streetwise young kid.

903
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,720
You're a sucker.

904
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,360
I'm no sucker.

905
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,880
And I wore it with the buckle on the front so that nobody could snap it off on me.

906
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,160
Nice try, kid.

907
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,960
I found $64 at work and I did the right thing and I gave it to my boss and said, someone's

908
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,160
probably going to come asking for this.

909
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,120
And they didn't.

910
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:49,800
Which meant 30 days later, my boss just like randomly handed me $64 and was like, oh, here's

911
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,240
this, by the way, no one picked it up.

912
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,480
And it was like the sweetest like, hey, thanks for doing the right thing bonus.

913
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,080
But I don't think you get that same response from a dollar.

914
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,600
Like if you went up to the bus driver and said, excuse me, dear sir, I believe someone

915
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,080
dropped this.

916
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,600
Please hold on to it for me for 30 days in case someone comes to claim it.

917
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,000
Sure.

918
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,440
No, just go out and buy, I don't know, a pop.

919
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
What can you buy for a dollar?

920
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,440
When you're at work, you don't really have a choice in the matter, do you?

921
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,040
Because I could just like when I worked at GameStop, I could just like open up the register

922
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,720
and be like, oh, I found $2,300.

923
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,000
What do you know?

924
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,760
I guess it's mine now.

925
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,080
So I guess what we're saying is steal.

926
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Yeah, but don't like go look and by the way, this is not rocket science.

927
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,200
If you find a larger amount that's actually worth your investment, pick it up.

928
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,680
See if anybody, look around, see if anybody's like giving you the stink eye and then say,

929
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,120
did anybody lose some money?

930
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,720
And they have to tell you exactly how much it was.

931
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,400
Yeah, just don't say that somebody lose $64 so someone lose money.

932
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,240
Because everybody will say, yes, right.

933
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,120
I would never do that.

934
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm sorry, I would never do that.

935
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,440
If I find money on the ground, it's mine.

936
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,400
And I'll tell you why.

937
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,520
It's because I lost my wallet at Camden Park, which is weird because I just told two theme

938
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,960
park related stories in the same breath.

939
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,000
But like, I lost my wallet, okay?

940
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,920
And there were maybe $8 in it because I was just a little baby boy.

941
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,720
But I did have my learner's permit in there and like some other like important shit.

942
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,280
And nobody turned my wallet in.

943
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,560
They kept it for the $8.

944
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,720
The immense hassle I had to go through to get it like a new learner's permit and like

945
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,640
a new, I had like my social security card.

946
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,800
I had some shit in there, some important shit.

947
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,640
And it was gone forever over $8.

948
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,520
That's just that made me the angry shell of a person I am today.

949
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,040
If I find any money or any object on the ground, it's mine.

950
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,520
Sorry.

951
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,040
So it's like pay it forward.

952
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,480
It's pay it backward, actually.

953
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,520
It's pay it inward.

954
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,400
Excuse me?

955
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,440
It's pay it inward.

956
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:48,280
If somebody does something shitty to you, you do three shitty things to the rest of the planet.

957
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,120
You feel better about yourself.

958
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,240
You don't feel better about yourself.

959
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,680
You just get angry and angrier.

960
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,320
And then at the end-

961
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,120
So you feel worse.

962
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,960
In the end, you kill Haley Joel Osment.

963
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,600
I wanna watch that movie.

964
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,360
But that's the termination of it all.

965
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,240
All the wickedness that you've been building up, it all dies with him.

966
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,360
He dies for you.

967
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,840
Haley Joel Osment died for all your minuscule sins, like he being $8 from-

968
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,120
He was Pluto Jesus.

969
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,120
He was Pluto Jesus.

970
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,480
Do you think the way I'm talking right now, and I have been talking for the past two minutes,

971
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,560
is like how all criminals got started?

972
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:21,960
Why?

973
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,120
Why and why did you murder that family?

974
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,480
Because I lost my wallet at Cannon Park and never returned it in.

975
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,160
Eight goddamn dollars.

976
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,200
Eight goddamn dollars.

977
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,520
I had to go to the DMV, pay like 35 bucks, take the fucking test over again.

978
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,560
It like completely ruined my entire day over $8.

979
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,240
It's not worth it.

980
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,520
Apparently it ruined your life.

981
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,600
You're a bitter human being.

982
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,920
Yeah, you're really angry about this.

983
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,040
Do we wanna do one more Yahoo question or should we wrap it up?

984
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:48,840
We absolutely do.

985
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,280
Okay, break me off something.

986
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:50,920
You must have something.

987
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,480
Oh, man.

988
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,680
Oh, do I?

989
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,400
This one was sent in by Shonin413.

990
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,120
Thank you, Shonin.

991
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

992
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,600
Who asks?

993
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,160
Okay, I need to perform a colonoscopy to myself.

994
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,080
I need a colonoscopy performed on me, but unfortunately in these economic times,

995
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,600
I cannot afford a doctor.

996
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,360
I'm pretty sure I could do it myself, but what should I get to perform?

997
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,920
The only store near me is a Home Depot, so the tools need to be from there.

998
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
What items should I get?

999
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:27,320
I have a very low budget, so don't pick anything too expensive.

1000
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,360
You're gonna need a rubber hose.

1001
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,640
You're kind of tying our hands.

1002
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:39,000
I want a homemade colonoscopy, but I got maybe like eight bucks that I can drop on this.

1003
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,320
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park.

1004
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,160
I found it in a wallet at Camden Park, and now I'm gonna spend it on a butt camera.

1005
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,720
Can you help?

1006
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:52,600
Now, I can't imagine the kind of yoga one has to go into to operate a self-butt camera.

1007
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:57,080
The tech required is outrageous.

1008
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,720
I would say the smallest camera that I own is my iPhone 4, and even that is gonna be,

1009
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:03,240
if you'll forgive the term, a stretch.

1010
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,640
The thing that bothers me is not just that he doesn't just want to do a home one.

1011
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,120
He wants to do a home one on the cheap.

1012
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,000
You can't say, I'm gonna be cutting.

1013
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,800
Yeah, you're already cutting the biggest corner.

1014
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,800
There are no other corners to cut.

1015
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,160
It's like oblong now.

1016
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,240
You can't no longer cut corners.

1017
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:25,960
You're out of them.

1018
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm all about pioneer spirit.

1019
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm all about DIY.

1020
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,480
I'm all about looking up shit on the internet and then doing that shit without getting help

1021
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:40,040
from other people, but this is a bridge too far, dawg.

1022
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,880
Yeah, yeah, it is.

1023
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,000
I love value.

1024
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,760
Like everybody who knows me, they say, Justin Bargenhauer, that's what everybody calls me.

1025
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,360
This is too much.

1026
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,080
You've gone too far.

1027
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,280
And nine months ago before we started doing this show, I would have thought this was a joke,

1028
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,040
but reading the answers, it's a real concern.

1029
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,040
Yeah, it's a real concern.

1030
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,680
Take a flexible hollow half-inch diameter flex hose about two or three feet long.

1031
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,640
Take a webcam housing off around the lens and circuit board.

1032
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,840
Run a cable attached to webcam lens and circuit board through the hose.

1033
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:19,000
Insert circuit board into flex hose and mount camera lens even with the tip of a hose.

1034
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,600
Grind a flashlight lens down into the diameter of the hose.

1035
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,760
Plug your computer in and turn the webcam on.

1036
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,600
Ram the device up your ass and look for the-

1037
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,200
Step six, kill cell.

1038
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,400
Can I make a humble suggestion of maybe sell your fucking computer and get a colonoscopy?

1039
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,520
Like as long as we're leaking outside the box.

1040
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:49,400
Can we start a fundraising drive to get this dude to a colonoscopist?

1041
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:50,440
Why is this your-

1042
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,880
Why is that the plan?

1043
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,600
How about-

1044
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,920
How about what are some ways I can get some more money?

1045
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,840
I guarantee if you went to any doctor and said,

1046
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,640
I'm thinking about giving myself a self-colonoscopy unless you do it for free,

1047
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,240
the doctor will do it for free.

1048
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,240
I'm gonna hurt myself in my butt really bad if you do not come give me a hand here.

1049
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,440
I'm gonna give it to you straight, doc.

1050
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,720
You can either A. give me a free colonoscopy

1051
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:22,040
or B. dig a homemade colonoscopy camera out of my butt hole in two hours.

1052
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,880
You decide.

1053
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,560
This is how we're gonna get healthcare.

1054
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,960
This is how we're gonna get healthcare pushed through Congress.

1055
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,280
Everybody calls their local representative and says,

1056
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:38,680
hey, I'm about to irreversibly damage my rectal wall if you do not get this shit approved.

1057
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,480
Hey, Obama.

1058
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,160
Hey, Obama.

1059
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,200
I'm gonna hurt myself.

1060
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,680
This one's on you, bro.

1061
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,080
Yes.

1062
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,800
Yes, we can stick a webcam up our assholes.

1063
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,240
Good news, I appear to be cancer-free.

1064
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,880
Bad news, I'm never not defecating.

1065
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,680
Anytime you see me, I basically-

1066
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,920
I broke whatever flange or cap is supposed to be there.

1067
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,640
Dear Yahoo Answers, I'm never not defecating.

1068
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,320
Can you give me some homemade solutions?

1069
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,960
There's only a home depot near me.

1070
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,840
I need to be able to stop having boundaries at this point.

1071
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,160
But good news, I can Skype from my anus, which is pretty cool.

1072
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,160
That is really nice.

1073
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I own a new hit website.

1074
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:26,760
Never not defecating is also my favorite podcast.

1075
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,720
It's one of my favorites.

1076
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,160
Jimmy Fardo, there.

1077
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,520
What do I care?

1078
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,640
What do I care?

1079
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,480
It was just right there, I'll just snatch it out.

1080
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:43,240
So this has been, my brother was so sorry.

1081
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,960
You came aboard, you trusted the recommendations of people who you've come to know and love

1082
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,360
over these years, and this is what it has gotten you.

1083
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,560
Maybe, if nothing else, you've learned a valuable lesson about trust.

1084
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,280
I want to hear Griffin's very last question that we'll use to finish the show, but

1085
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,960
some housekeeping stuff.

1086
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,400
You can always find us at mbnbam.com.

1087
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,760
We will always be there.

1088
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:05,640
There you can find all the methods for asking us questions.

1089
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,520
Mbnbam at gmail.com is our email address to get in contact with us.

1090
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:18,360
We have a Twitter account at mbnbam where you can ask us questions there, or you can,

1091
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,120
we love it when people tweet questions using the mbnbam hashtag without that at at the

1092
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,240
beginning so everybody can see it.

1093
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,960
Our quotes from the show, people like to do that sometimes, and we always really appreciate

1094
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,680
it.

1095
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,960
We have a forum spring, it's formspring.me forward slash mbnbam.

1096
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:40,520
We haven't mentioned it in a while, but we do have the phone number, which is, Griffin?

1097
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,480
It's 203-ma-bim-bam-1.

1098
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,040
So, real quick, so that's for the new folks.

1099
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,360
New folks, thank you so much for joining us.

1100
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:59,560
Please, if you like what you heard, subscribe on iTunes or, you know, I guess, Zune or whatever,

1101
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:05,640
Blackberry or whatever other methods you like to use to listen to your podcasts, and please

1102
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,680
come back next week.

1103
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,240
We put a new episode up every Monday.

1104
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,720
Very rarely do we miss one, so make sure you come out for that.

1105
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,200
You can also follow us on Twitter.

1106
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,400
I'm Justin McElroy.

1107
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,640
I'm Travis McElroy.

1108
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,520
And I'm Griffin McElroy, but you can always suss that out.

1109
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,520
Yeah, you probably sort that out yourself.

1110
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:29,480
So, people who've been with us before now, I know that it might seem, you might be a

1111
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:30,040
little worried.

1112
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
So, let me get the most important thing out first.

1113
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,560
Nothing's going to change.

1114
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,080
Everything's going to be the same.

1115
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,120
Except for everything.

1116
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,560
Nothing gold can stay, Ponyboy.

1117
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,200
Well, we did change the theme song.

1118
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,080
That did change.

1119
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,520
Yeah, that did change, but the show's going to stay the same.

1120
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,080
Our website, you will see, will move over to Maximum Fun.

1121
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,320
You'll still get to it through nbm.com, but we're going to move the website over there

1122
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,880
and the forums over there, which I know that's kind of like, oh, we've already been posting

1123
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,840
stuff, but everything can be the same there as it was.

1124
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:12,440
Our two families, there's so much overlap that I think that everyone's just going to

1125
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,400
get along really great.

1126
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,800
It's like cheaper by the dozen, right?

1127
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:17,240
It's like cheaper by the dozen.

1128
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,200
Or step by step.

1129
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,600
It's like step by, oh, that's so much better, Travis.

1130
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,000
Thank you.

1131
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,120
It's like step by step.

1132
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,760
You're welcome.

1133
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,440
And like our family-

1134
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,320
I call Cody.

1135
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:25,880
I'm Cody.

1136
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,440
We are the Patrick Fuck.

1137
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,320
Hi, I'm Patrick Fuck.

1138
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,240
You might have heard of me from the boosted hazards.

1139
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,680
What's that dude's name?

1140
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,360
Tom Wopat.

1141
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:42,600
No.

1142
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,560
Patrick Dempsey.

1143
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,840
Patrick, no, fuck.

1144
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,680
The guy from step by step, the dad.

1145
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,240
I know it.

1146
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,280
I just don't want to tell you.

1147
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:50,760
Duffy.

1148
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,000
Okay.

1149
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,680
We're the Duff and-

1150
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,520
We're the Patrick Duffy's and you are the Suzanne Sommers.

1151
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah.

1152
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,480
And we would like to welcome all of our new listeners that found us through maxfund.org

1153
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,680
and also all of our listeners that have never taken a chance to check out, you know, Jordan

1154
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:12,280
Just To Go or Sound of Young America or any of the other ones.

1155
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:15,000
Stop what you're doing right after you finish this podcast.

1156
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:15,240
Yeah.

1157
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,760
Run, don't walk and download.

1158
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:22,200
Don't walk and download, we got started doing podcasts because of listening to the Max Fund

1159
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:22,600
Network.

1160
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:26,680
So really go subscribe to all of their shows and listen to them.

1161
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,600
We promise we will not get jealous.

1162
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,200
We not like that.

1163
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,040
We have an open relationship with you.

1164
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:41,240
You're going to see, we're going to have new merch and stuff and all that will be revealed

1165
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,800
at a later point how we're going to be handling that.

1166
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,240
But because we don't know.

1167
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,000
Oh, and also we're going to start doing promotions on the show, which if you've heard other shows

1168
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,640
on the Maximum Fund Network, then you know how those work.

1169
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,720
If you want to do a personal or commercial message, we can definitely do that for you.

1170
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:06,040
If you want more details on price or how to get started, you can email Teresa at Maximum

1171
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:06,440
Fund.

1172
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,800
That's Teresa with an H.

1173
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:14,840
Uh, and, but it's not going to be, you know, like, uh, it's not going to impede your listening

1174
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,240
pleasure.

1175
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:15,720
No, no, no.

1176
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,160
Promise it won't be, it won't be an annoyance.

1177
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,400
We'll make it, we'll make it funny for you.

1178
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,680
Well, we'll, we'll have some laughs.

1179
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh, don't worry about it.

1180
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,320
We made, we, we made a wedding proposal serious.

1181
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,120
There's a 50-50 chance it is not funny at all.

1182
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,880
So I'd say there's a 50-50 chance that we got fucking taken for a ride.

1183
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,920
You think?

1184
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,040
We got great, yeah.

1185
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:38,120
But if we didn't, congratulations, he's at home cuddling his brain wife.

1186
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,720
Don't use this to propose to your brain wife, please.

1187
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,720
If you have questions, this is not a joke.

1188
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,440
If you have questions, email us or concerns.

1189
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,720
You've been with us the whole time.

1190
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,120
You're worried about what, what, what the future holds.

1191
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,080
Uh, please email us.

1192
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,200
The only thing that we're probably not going to negotiate on is the music.

1193
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,000
Trust us, guys.

1194
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,520
We, that wouldn't be like, hey, they changed music.

1195
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,440
It would be like, what happened to Justin Travis?

1196
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,160
They're in jail.

1197
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,400
They're in Swiss jail.

1198
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,000
They were extradited immediately.

1199
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,960
So, so don't worry.

1200
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,480
Don't worry about that.

1201
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,400
But, uh, anything else, questions or concerns, um, or just congratulations.

1202
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,840
We, that's nice.

1203
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,400

1204
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,200
Shoot us a line.

1205
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,400
Let us know what's going on.

1206
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,760
Our call either way.

1207
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:30,760
And, um, thank you so much for your support over the months because it's been, it's really

1208
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,160
because of you guys, um, that we're still doing this.

1209
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:39,240
And the main reason we wanted to, to join up with Max Fun is just to expand to other

1210
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:43,320
people, introduce other people to the show, grow the family as it were.

1211
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,480
If you've seen the hit show, Sister Wives, it's basically like that.

1212
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,400
We're basically the newest sister wife.

1213
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:54,200
Um, but then again, on the new, the newest sister wife is the only one who's not, um,

1214
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,320
not gross looking.

1215
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,280
Not saying that that's a, that's a, that's a direct allegory to us.

1216
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,440
I'm just saying I just watched Sister Wives for the first time and man, holy shit.

1217
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,320
What a crazy show.

1218
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,440
That sentence, that sentence, that sentence for a ride.

1219
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,240
A good point.

1220
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:09,800
A good point.

1221
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,560
Hey, you guys ever seen Sister Wives?

1222
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,960
Hey, what's up with Sister Wives?

1223
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,400
Just last week for my sister wife, my sister wife and me.

1224
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:23,240
Uh, we're going to close out the show with, uh, a last question to sort of grow on and,

1225
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,000
and think about all over, uh, in the, in the ensuing week.
