1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:52,240
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Garden, the internet's number one resource for swinging,

6
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,000
adults, the swinging lifestyle, and all the all the stuff that goes in between.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,680
I am your pleasure guardian, Bruce Bruceon.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,800
I can't do this. And I'm Hank the Spank Tank Jankerson Jankersleyton.

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,160
Hank, we did we did talk about trying to keep the volume down. We have a lot of

10
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm excited about fucking other people's wives pussies.

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
Sure, sure, sure. It's understandable. Who could be why? Who wouldn't be excited about

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,960
here's your first hour. Here's first Hank Spank Tank Jankerson's pro tip.

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,240
Find the find the best but you can best to find the best but in the room and just get it and have it.

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,160
Of course, that is with consent. Maybe that but maybe that buts on a man. Hank came here to judge.

15
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,920
Well, we should all be open, I think, to different possibilities. There's a lot of

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,080
liberation in that and accepting. I think I walked in the wrong recording booth.

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,440
Well, we thought we will clear out soon. We know that the brother brother brother chat.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,520
Yeah, brother chat is supposed to be man. You're gonna want to get a squeegee in here,

19
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,080
man, before you start recording because there is gonna get there's some leaving brother chat is

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
actually the number two podcast for swinging adults and everything in between. So I'm sorry,

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,720
was it Travis? Yes, Travis. If you just step out of this recording studio, head down the hall,

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm sure you'll find the guys you're looking for. OK, click.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:40,000
Man, that guy with the suction cup shoes, he really freaked me out. I was trying to do a

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
little a little Prairie Home Companion sound effects. Some Foley. I liked it. This is my

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,120
brother, my brother, me, an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,320
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. No, stop the world. You messed up your name.

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,000
You said Trevor. I actually said Traver, but I'm your sweet baby brother,

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,120
Hank the Spank Tank Jankersleyton. You guys ever notice that Griffin and Hank the Spank Tank are

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,960
never in the same room at the same time? Interesting. Some people have noticed that

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,280
actually Griffin looks like Hank the Spank Tank Jankersleyton, but with glasses on,

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,400
which I'm beginning to see through their ruse. What we do on this show is we take your questions

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,640
and then we turn them alchemy like into wisdom. Let's get right into the queries.

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,040
Last week, I worked a really long 24 hour shift at my retail job. My boss, seeing my dedication,

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,000
decided to buy me lunch. He handed me his credit card and sent me on my way. I ended up spending

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,960
$17 on an amazing burger and fries. Now, mind you, this is NYC and it's a higher end burger spot.

36
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,320
My question is how much is an appropriate amount to spend when your boss offers to buy you lunch?

37
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,440
Did I spend too much? I don't want my boss to think I took advantage of his kind offer.

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,960
That's from Stuffed in NYC. Wait, wait, wait. First and foremost,

39
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,720
you worked a 24 hour shift? Yeah, with that in mind, like your boss is lucky that you didn't

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,200
just take him and then fart on the card before you gave it back because that's bananas.

41
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,600
The old stinky plastic. Blaster card.

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,800
The blaster card. Are you asking the technical or the real life? Because technically,

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,400
when he offers to buy you lunch, it's your choice and you can get whatever you want.

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,000
I think technically speaking, you committed a federal crime. You used somebody else's credit

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
card. That's an important issue. That doesn't even mean anything anymore in this day and age.

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,200
Really? Am I antiquated? No, honestly, the other day, my boss sent me to buy a projector for the

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:03,120
office and it was a pretty big purchase and I'm sitting there in paint stained jeans and t-shirt

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,880
and I'm like, I want to buy this very expensive projector with this card that is not the same name

49
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,600
as my ID, which you just checked and dude is just like, okay. I bought groceries the other day with

50
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,080
my credit card and it gave me the prompt to put in my signature and hit accept, but I just hit

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,000
accept and input my signature and it went through and I just felt like taking out my wallet and just

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,360
dumping it out on the floor and just saying, all right, everybody have at it because apparently

53
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,600
there's no security on these goddamn things at all. I took Teresa's card to go buy a video game

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,520
for Secret Santa present and Tudor looked at the card, saw that it said Teresa and was like, okay.

55
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,360
Why do we even care anymore? Yeah, why are you even trying? I don't think $17 is obnoxious for-

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,920
Who the fuck knows how rich their boss is in this world? Who knows? That's true.

57
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,040
Like every time I've gone out to dinner with a boss, they eat like a steak made out of bouillon

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,600
and it's like, okay. I didn't know that this is where you were, fungibly speaking,

59
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,960
but congratulations, Mr. 1%. Also, Tudor, when you get back, he's going to be like,

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,360
well, thank you for your 24 hour long shift, but I see here that you spent $17 on lunch. You're fired.

61
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,720
How good do you think that burger was though? Oh boy. I bet it had some blue cheese on it.

62
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Let's all theory craft what that burger was like because I'm imagining pure,

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,600
what's it called when they feed cows lobster and it butters up their fat meats.

64
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,160
It's when you make butter cow. Butter cow, butter beef.

65
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
Yeah, I bet it was pure fat Angus butter beef patty.

66
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
And then you got to have that apple wood. Isn't Angus butter beef the kid on Two

67
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,960
and a Half Men? You know, I hear he's super Christian now. They always have apple wood

68
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,320
smoked baked. I don't know what apple wood is. It's where you take a piece of wood and you

69
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,600
put an apple on it. And then they use that, they just burn that. Well, they take the apple out

70
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,520
first. It's wood that has been touched by an apple. Okay. That doesn't make much sense,

71
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,840
but I mean, I'm not culinary. Touched by an apple is my favorite TV show.

72
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,200
And it's all about like people whose lives are being ruined by sin. And then like an

73
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,200
apple shows up on the door, but it's completely stationary and doesn't talk or give out blessings

74
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,760
or anything. It just really makes them think. Like it makes them pause.

75
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,800
Who put this fucking apple here? I'm going to turn things around.

76
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,360
It's actually closer to early edition than it is Touched by an Angel because it's like

77
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,200
the apple appears and it's like, oh shit, if there's apples here, I got to save that

78
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:58,400
busload of kids tomorrow. That does not sound like a good show. What you guys are describing

79
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,600
sounds like an unenjoyable program. It only went about 10 episodes. It was on after a revolution.

80
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't want to think about how much you spend anymore. I'm bored of thinking about it.

81
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,440
I think you're fine. I think that you put in an extraordinary effort.

82
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,320
You're fine. Stop worrying. Your boss was trying to alleviate his guilt. That's the only reason

83
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,880
anybody does anything. Yeah. So you did him a favor by spending, getting something juicy

84
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,600
at night. I think it's not like outlandish. It's not like you spent $50 on lunch steak.

85
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,040
You live in a very expensive city and you got some food that costs a good amount of money.

86
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:41,840
If your boss didn't like it, maybe you should let you not work for 24 hours straight and violate

87
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,160
OSHA regulations. Maybe he shouldn't have done that.

88
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,840
Maybe he should have just let you go home and sleep.

89
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:54,160
Just let you sleep. You're so tired. How does anybody stay up for 24 hours?

90
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,920
I don't think I'm capable of staying up for longer than 12 and this person did double that.

91
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,680
My boss at the speed factory. This is from Walter White.

92
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
I don't want to talk about this question anymore. Okay. It's really bumming you out,

93
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,640
isn't it? Is it because it's bringing you back to your Halcyon retail days?

94
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,960
Yeah. It's just like 24 hours is such a long time to do anything.

95
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,000
There's nothing I want to do for 24 hours, ever. And this guy had to work at a retail

96
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,920
job. It's just bumming me out. You should have used that credit card to buy yourself a plane

97
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,880
to Jamaica. I had a girl once and all she wanted to do was party all 24 hours.

98
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
Party all the time.

99
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,120
And so I guess Eddie Murphy wrote a song about it. Anyway, let's go on.

100
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm not feeling very funny today, guys. I don't know what's happening to me.

101
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
Me neither. We could just try and do a really serious episode where you get

102
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,400
out really heavy. Just like real shit?

103
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,120
Yeah. It gets so deep. Deep and dirty.

104
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,000
Maybe a Yahoo would like, maybe we can say something funny about it.

105
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,480
I don't have any good ones of those either. Ah, shit. This is going to be a Dudsky.

106
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,040
This Yahoo was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily. It's by Yahoo Answers user Tom, who asks,

107
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,160
Do ghosts appreciate it if you leave them a little snack on the countertop?

108
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,240
Not like health food or vegetables or anything.

109
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,280
But you know, like a tasty snack, like Oreos or leftover dessert.

110
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,480
If you do this, would they actually eat it? And if they did,

111
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,880
then couldn't you show your proof to scientists that they are real wildlife?

112
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,520
Jesus Christ. That was a toughie.

113
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,120
Wouldn't it be great if like the only reason we have yet to prove the existence of ghosts

114
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,360
is because no one thought to leave them some cookies?

115
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah, that's true. Well, is that really what a ghost would be into?

116
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,240
No, because as we've all seen in Casper the Friendly Ghost,

117
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,560
they eat it and it's just going to fall out their bottoms.

118
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,880
Which begs the question, how do they even eat it in the first place?

119
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
Think about that. Think about that scientist who'd write up Casper.

120
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,080
If he can eat it with his mouth in his stomach,

121
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,160
should be also tangible to contain it.

122
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,280
Just some food for fucking thought, Casper writers.

123
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,680
Do you think Casper employed, you know how

124
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,760
sometimes military video games will employ a, you know,

125
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,440
some special ops guys to like confirm what they're doing is accurate.

126
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you think the producers and directors of Casper

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,120
were enlisted some paranormal experts that could give that,

128
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,440
that could check the accuracy of some of the things in the film?

129
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Clearly not.

130
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,720
I thought you're going to ask if maybe they employed like some ghosts to fact check for them.

131
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,320
I think they aren't real.

132
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,520
Here's the thing.

133
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
If a ghost ate a sandwich with his mouth,

134
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
then it would stay in his tummy, right?

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,040
Can we all agree on that?

136
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,400
If we're going to agree on anything about ghosts and I, of course, they're not real.

137
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,880
You're saying if he had the physical capability to chew and swallow,

138
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
if those mechanisms are working.

139
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
Okay, so if we're agreeing, then it's like an if A then B situation.

140
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,640
If the ghost is able to pick up the sandwich,

141
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Chew the sandwich, swallow the sandwich.

142
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,560
Then he has the mechanism to digest and then poop the sandwich.

143
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,400
If the ghost is unable to interact with the corporeal sandwich,

144
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,880
then of course.

145
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh my God, okay, so let's use ghost logic.

146
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,160
So let's use ghost logic and by ghost logic, I mean the movie ghost.

147
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,880
Because then when he finds himself in the heat of a terrible passion,

148
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,040
he can become part of our extant world.

149
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,640
You know, he can become tangible.

150
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,480
So here's the scenario.

151
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,760
Casper gets really, really angry about Obama taking away his guns or something like that.

152
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,320
And so in that moment of passion, he eats.

153
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,840
Casper the friendly but very conservative ghost.

154
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
Yeah, he eats.

155
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,520
Well, he's the ghost of Richie Rich, right?

156
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,840
And Richie Rich is obviously a one person ghost.

157
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,160
That's never been clear to me, but I think that's the case.

158
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,280
Yeah, that is obviously the case.

159
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,720
So in the heat of a terrible passion, Obama, then let's see the birth certificate.

160
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
And he gets really angry.

161
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,200
And in the heat of that terrible passion, he eats an Angus butter beef burger.

162
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,880
But then he eats it and then he cools down a little bit.

163
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:23,360
And in that moment of, you know, of chilling, of cold lamping, the burger falls.

164
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,560
So he's anger eating.

165
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,920
See, I would then I would think that the burger, though,

166
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,800
would then make the transition back to the like astral spectral plane with him.

167
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,560
Well, that doesn't make much sense to me, Travis,

168
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,080
because then if like he got angry about Obama, then for immigrants,

169
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,760
then like he could like grab someone's hand and then like chill on it.

170
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,840
And then like, would that person come with them to go to the Ghost Land Observatory?

171
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,080
Do you think that if Casper wants to eat a full meal, he has to like,

172
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,480
he has to watch Religious and just watch the whole thing and get angry and angry and angry at Bill Maher

173
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,440
and then and then he can finish his dinner?

174
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,080
He just looks.

175
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Even then, though, even then, he is still translucent.

176
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,720
So like, even if he managed to stay angry for the 12 hours, it would take

177
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,440
for his food to fully digest and be expelled.

178
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,960
Like you would see it turn to poopy.

179
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,920
That's something I was worried about with Slim Goodbody.

180
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,680
What if he had a recording right after lunch and the kids just had to

181
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,640
like watch in horror as his Reuben and egg cream turned into poopy?

182
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,200
Well, there's a lot of there's Justin, you are opening up a pretty huge,

183
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,560
a pretty huge door here for horrific, horrific things

184
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
that you could see Slim Goodbody doing through his skin.

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,600
What if the kids knew Slim Goodbody had lung cancer before Slim Goodbody's doctors did?

186
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,480
That's what I'm saying, they saw a mouse.

187
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,080
Uh, Slim, Slim, Mr. Goodbody, can you, I'm worried about,

188
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,240
I'm not sure that's just a cold Mr. Goodbody.

189
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
It looks like you got a tapeworm, Mr. Goodbody.

190
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,000
Mr. Goodbody, your clothes seem to be fitting you really loosely,

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,400
which is weird because your clothes are that you don't have skin.

192
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,200
So I don't know how that's working, but you look a little haggard.

193
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,920
What's sadder than a guy with no skin wearing a terrycloth robe?

194
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,560
Nothing.

195
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,800
Hey bro, cool epididymis.

196
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,760
I can see it.

197
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,880
I can see all of it.

198
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,520
The coils.

199
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,760
Is that Slim?

200
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,360
Is that a balloon of cocaine in your rectum?

201
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Wait, is Slim Goodbody a ghost?

202
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
What?

203
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,400
No, he's half ghost.

204
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,720
He's sure as fuck not alive.

205
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
He's got skin ghost.

206
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,960
You don't get to be vivisected and get to keep on being alive.

207
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,600
That's not a thing that keeps-

208
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,160
I think if that show were to take place in the real world,

209
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,800
it would just be a series of Slim Goodbody screaming

210
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,240
because he had been flayed alive.

211
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,080
Oh, it'd be a Saw movie, sure.

212
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,800
He's still doing the show well into his 60s,

213
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
but they keep having to redraw to make his prostate bigger.

214
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
No, larger than that, trust me.

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,480
And get my hemorrhoids.

216
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,520
Oh man, what a bummer this episode is.

217
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,040
What a bummer Slim Goodbody is.

218
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
Fucking Candle Knights is next week.

219
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,920
I guess we are just lowering the base level of where everybody's at

220
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
so that we can bring them right back up with Candle Knights.

221
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,040
This time of year, everyone's a little bit disappointed.

222
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:17,760
Yeah, it's true.

223
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,320
Just remember next week, we're not going to talk about prostates at all.

224
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,120
My boyfriend recently purchased an iPad.

225
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,040
We love the convenient technology of being able to look at internet memes whenever we like,

226
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,680
but lately he has been browsing on the pad until the wee hours of the night right next to me in bed.

227
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,720
I miss the end of the day conversation and cuddle time we used to share.

228
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,600
Is it rude to request him to limit his nighttime screen time?

229
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,880
He seems to think so.

230
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,200
That's from iPad replaced in Portland.

231
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,240
This is such a sad thing in the modern age.

232
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,240
But it's everything.

233
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,320
It's everything and everywhere now.

234
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,120
You know, there are nights I got Teresa an iPod Touch for her birthday.

235
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,440
There are nights now, you know, we just sit there and I'm on my iPhone and she's on her iPad or iPod.

236
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,560
And we remember the times when we used to just like talk to each other and enjoy each other's company.

237
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,600
Those times are dead now.

238
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,600
I do not think it is wrong of you to want boundaries.

239
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,360
I think that laying that out and saying like,

240
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:27,520
hey, I would really prefer that this be a time where we could like talk to each other and bond.

241
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,680
I don't think that that's inappropriate at all.

242
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
I mean, I think that it's...

243
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
I think what is maybe making this hard for you is that you feel like you shouldn't have to ask,

244
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,240
why does he not want to talk with you instead of get on the iPad?

245
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,240
And here's the truth, ladies and gentlemen, no one is as interesting as an iPad.

246
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,600
I don't want that kind of pressure.

247
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,920
That's true. I don't want to have to compete with that.

248
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Well, hold on, because I have a multitude of apps, you know?

249
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,200
Sure, you got some apps.

250
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
I make coffee in the morning, that's an app.

251
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,040
If there's a bug, then sometimes I can do something about it.

252
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,960
That's kind of an app, if you think about it.

253
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,400
There's an app, that's true.

254
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,920
I can go to sleep in the middle of the day pretty much anytime so that there's an app.

255
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,080
I mean, I'm not saying you don't have utility, Griffin.

256
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm saying that if someone says to me,

257
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,200
hey, here's a wall of information and games and fun,

258
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,840
and over here is someone who wants to tell you about their dogs.

259
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,080
I've got little hands so I can get inside of wine glasses and clean them out.

260
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,760
Okay, so you're like Ratatouille, basically.

261
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,560
That's another app.

262
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,720
That's what you got.

263
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
That's it. Shit, that's everything I can do.

264
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,240
I know, this is what I'm saying.

265
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,640
God damn it.

266
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
That wouldn't fill up the home screen.

267
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,800
Yeah, that's true.

268
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,560
Nobody wants to competition.

269
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,400
Do you know everyone who's been in every movie ever,

270
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
what year they came out and how much they grossed?

271
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,240
Sometimes I throw shit at birds.

272
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
Well, that's just kind of a mean thing that you do.

273
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
I slice fruit up.

274
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
Oh, yeah? That's pretty good.

275
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,720
There's not an app for that.

276
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,880
How about an iPad? What you got?

277
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
I have a piano that doesn't work,

278
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,960
but when I press the keys on it, I make fart noises with my mouth.

279
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,920
So there's another app.

280
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,440
I can basically make fart noises anytime, whatever you want.

281
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,760
On command, tone, length, frequency.

282
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,560
There's an app.

283
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,360
There's another one.

284
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,720
That one was fart noise with his mouth that could actually get you a free phone call

285
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,840
if you put it into a payphone.

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,640
That app is free.

287
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,080
That's a free app.

288
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,720
That's a free app.

289
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,360
You can just get that.

290
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,080
That's no problem.

291
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,920
Um, I can't tell you all the recipes, but I know like six.

292
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,760
I know spaghetti.

293
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,400
There's an app.

294
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I can make muffins if I got the mix of milk.

295
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,680
So there's another app.

296
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,640
Just count all the apps.

297
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,280
That's what I'm saying.

298
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,920
You have to, it's just like Jonathan Winters said in Rent.

299
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
Measure your life in apps.

300
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,040
And if you can't, you are competing with all the technology

301
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,800
that your boyfriend now loves more than you.

302
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,640
So like you've got a Jolene situation on your hands.

303
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
Only instead of a woman with flaming locks of auburn hair,

304
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,920
you are dealing with an iPad.

305
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,680
You've been Jolene, madam.

306
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,640
You got Jolene.

307
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,240
You've been iJolene.

308
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,200
You've been iJolene.

309
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
Seriously, it's coming at us all on all sides.

310
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
And if you can't download more apps to compete, then you're fucked.

311
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,600
You're going to lose them.

312
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,720
You, we all have to take little stands against this battle versus the robots.

313
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,680
And this battle to keep connected isn't like competing for attention normally

314
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,200
because nobody can compete with it.

315
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,200
We just have to use our superior human willpower before they get willpower soon.

316
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,760
Right.

317
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,040
You just got to find your strengths.

318
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,840
My GF will get deep into a game of chip chain, right?

319
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,320
She'll get real deep into some cut the rope.

320
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,440
And then, you know what, I have to stand up there and maybe I do like a little dance.

321
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
That's not something that the iPad can provide.

322
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,640
Unless you get on YouTube and you search for like a better dance than I do,

323
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,040
which is going to be hard to find.

324
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,360
Yeah.

325
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,320
You're going to be looking for a while.

326
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,040
Let's just put it that way.

327
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,440
Yeah.

328
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,960
Good luck searching for the right terms.

329
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,600
Tell him you got to be direct.

330
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,240
Say, listen, I miss the time we used to spend together.

331
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,120
He'll respect that.

332
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,720
He'll promise.

333
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
He will.

334
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,400
And if he doesn't respect it, snap it over your knee.

335
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,280
Oh, don't do that.

336
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,040
Snap it over your knee and get your relationship back.

337
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,160
No, Justin.

338
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,280
You got to put it in a position so he breaks it.

339
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,520
Yeah.

340
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,160
Okay.

341
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,760
So on the floor, you looking at it late at night, you leave it on his chest so that when

342
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,320
he wakes up, he drops it off the side of the bed.

343
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,600
Why?

344
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,800
What do you think they're made of?

345
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,980
Glass?

346
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,240
Candy?

347
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,800
Sugar?

348
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I mean, they are made out of a kind of glass.

349
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,600
Yeah.

350
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,880
They're made out of glass and metal.

351
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,040
I just don't think it's going to break if you throw one off your chest in the middle of the night.

352
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,600
And I do think the-

353
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,920
I've broken seven iPhones.

354
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,120
Well, dad broke one of them.

355
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,720
Dad broke one of them for you.

356
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,040
I have had indirectly broken.

357
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Yes.

358
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,800
You have been the owner of several broken iProducts.

359
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,240
Yeah.

360
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
It's easy.

361
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,360
I think you're planning to work, Travis, but I think you got to get the iPad like halfway there.

362
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,200
I think maybe you step on it a few times and then you put it on his chest.

363
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,160
I stepped on this and apparently my size six pumps.

364
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,680
Why does it say kids backwards on my broken iPad?

365
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
This podcast and the last podcast are by kids.

366
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,160
An attractive friend of mine lives out of state.

367
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,040
Why are you yelling?

368
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,040
I don't know, but he's coming to my college graduation in about a month.

369
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,440
A few days ago, she texts me to say that she is drunk.

370
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
She's up for having sex with me when she's here for my graduation.

371
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,080
Being that she was drunk when she sent these text messages,

372
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,160
what should my expectations be when I see her?

373
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,800
Is there a way I can tastefully bring up this topic again in the meantime

374
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,200
to see if the offer still stands when she is sober?

375
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Missouri loves company.

376
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,320
The answer is no.

377
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,840
Absolutely not.

378
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,560
You're actually asking the way wrong question.

379
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,400
In vino veritas, you know?

380
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,880
No, no, no.

381
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
Here's the thing.

382
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
It doesn't matter because I would actually posit that probably what it was

383
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,480
is she wasn't really that drunk, but she wanted to be drunker than she was

384
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
to bring up the fact that she wanted to have sex with you

385
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,840
when she came to visit your school.

386
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,680
She's into it.

387
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,520
But the problem is she gave you too much forewarning.

388
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,720
It's going to hang in the air for a fucking month now.

389
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,000
You taste that it's like some sexual discomfort in the room

390
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,600
because it's not going to be casual and easy when she rolls up in town.

391
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,880
It's not going to be like, oh, we had such a good time at dinner and things led

392
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,440
like you're both can be sitting there like so in your heads the whole fucking time.

393
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,160
And it's going to be the fucking time.

394
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,480
Yeah, you're not going to.

395
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,680
You're not going to enjoy her visit at all because every time it's like,

396
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,520
well, I guess we should head home, yawn, let's go.

397
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,880
Oh, can we fucking get breathalyzers put on all of our goddamn phones

398
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,520
and not so that when you get drunk, you don't text people things that you regret

399
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,240
because guess what?

400
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
That never actually happens in real life.

401
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,320
But just so that you don't text people things that you want to tell them,

402
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,760
but under any other circumstance wouldn't be OK,

403
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
except that you've had a few drinks now.

404
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,400
And so it's really cool.

405
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,120
Well, OK, I actually need to take umbrage with your first point, Griffin.

406
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,640
Two nights ago I had had a bunch of wine and I got on Twitter

407
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,800
and told people to vote for their favorite between rap music,

408
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:56,000
Lady Gaga, pizza and ribbon candy.

409
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,720
Right.

410
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,920
So but let's let's let's get real one.

411
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,520
Of course, pizza one.

412
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,040
Um, wait, pizza be all of rap music.

413
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,640
To be fair, the only vote I counted was my own.

414
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,160
OK, that's a thing that you would normally say, though.

415
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,440
That's it.

416
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,000
That's it.

417
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,880
I feel like that is a standard Justin Bonemont.

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
If you had gotten on there and then said, like,

419
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
drop some real racist shit about like Pacific Islanders,

420
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
then that would that would have been slightly out of character because you.

421
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,640
Samoa?

422
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,680
No moa.

423
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,400
Thank you.

424
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,560
Tongan, Tongan, Tongan.

425
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:40,880
So the Filipino, Filipino.

426
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,920
That would have been bad.

427
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,360
But that's not what you did.

428
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,480
Well, what I'm the ish is the people who who have like three sips of a smear

429
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
and off ice and then call up their best friends since childhood

430
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,200
and talk about, you know, how much they want to jump on the tip.

431
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,720
It drives me absolutely fucking bonkers,

432
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
and I'm glad that I don't have to deal with it as much in like my 25 year old life

433
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
as I did in my 21 year old life.

434
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,160
I think that you should just let things happen naturally.

435
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,000
She was drinking.

436
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,640
You were at a guy.

437
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,840
So that is your excuse there.

438
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,480
You were there.

439
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,120
I mean.

440
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
Is it possible she meant to send it to somebody like your name is Kylo

441
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,640
and she meant to send it to Kyle?

442
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Is that possible?

443
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,360
Maybe she pressed the wrong button.

444
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,600
Did I send this to Kylo or Kyle?

445
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,160
Oh, fuck.

446
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,000
I sent this to Steven or Sreven.

447
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,200
Happy graduation, Sreven.

448
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,560
I'm so proud of you.

449
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,200
Just be a cool cat there.

450
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,240
OK, I can confirm one thing definitively.

451
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,360
There is absolutely no way for you to text her

452
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,120
and say, so remember earlier when sex?

453
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
They were still penciled in for sex on your business, correct?

454
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,680
Is that gonna happen, please?

455
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,360
Hey, just getting.

456
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,040
I need time to get my wiener ready.

457
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,000
So let me know if this is still in the cards.

458
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,320
What's that?

459
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,760
I don't want to do the thing that I do by myself

460
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,200
if I'm going to do that with someone else that day or soon.

461
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,520
So write me back.

462
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,800
Please, sincerely, Sreven at yahoo.com.

463
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,960
I would say that the best course of action

464
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,600
is to just assume that you're not going to have sex

465
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
and it's never going to come up again

466
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,600
and that that was just a mistake and ignore it.

467
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,320
So then when it happens, it's awesome and spontaneous

468
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,040
and great.

469
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,440
But if it doesn't happen, you're not sitting there

470
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,600
the whole time like, so should I put my arm around her shoulder

471
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,720
or try to kiss her?

472
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't put that on yourself.

473
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,960
God, really, this fucking sucks.

474
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
Please, nobody ever goddamn do this.

475
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,280
It's so hard.

476
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,040
It's so hard walking the social and sexual minefield

477
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,240
that is your 20s.

478
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,560
Can we not complicate things by sending people cryptic messages

479
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:11,200
that may or may not, if they can figure out the wind talking

480
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,440
that you just dropped on them, maybe they'll get fucked?

481
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
Like, can we please not do that?

482
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,480
Why wouldn't you just wait till you go visit Sreven

483
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,920
and then just have sex with him?

484
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,160
Yeah.

485
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,880
Like, why ruin the end of the book?

486
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,160
Why are you giving them a trailer?

487
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Spoiler alert, Sreven.

488
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm going to fuck you.

489
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,040
I can't adults just have sex like the normal thing

490
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,840
and not make a fucking marketing campaign for it?

491
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,320
Hashtag fucking Sreven tonight.

492
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,960
Retweet, get this up on your social.

493
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,560
We're going to hit all of our key beats.

494
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,680
Did you RSVP the Facebook group for me and Sreven fucking?

495
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,120
We're going to get this narrative really moving forward.

496
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,800
Hashtag gonna make a magnet come loud.

497
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,200
We're exploiting guerrilla marketing, which don't ask.

498
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,640
It is highly dangerous.

499
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
You need to get a fucking guerrilla.

500
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,960
That's what I meant.

501
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:18,560
Money zone.

502
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,120
If you'd like to fucking guerrilla, you gotta be safe.

503
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,280
And the only way to do that is to go to extremistraights.com

504
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,240
and get one of their many, many, many, many, many

505
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
guerrilla tranquilizers that will let you make love

506
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,360
to all sorts of exotic animals.

507
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,960
It doesn't have to be a guerrilla.

508
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,880
You know, maybe you want to get a

509
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,440
Prince Albert chastity device for $89.95

510
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
and then you want to fuck a giraffe with it.

511
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,840
Well, that's fine.

512
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,040
You can just give the draft some.

513
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,000
Okay.

514
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,160
I do want to say I'm sorry the tranquilizers are not actually

515
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,880
on there, but the metal ring that goes around your penises.

516
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,520
I don't think you're allowed to fuck like zoo animals at the zoo.

517
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,640
I think if you go to the zoo, they don't let you just go hog wild.

518
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,600
Listen, listen.

519
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,920
They don't advertise that, Griffin.

520
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,280
It's not an average.

521
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,480
You know, there's a secret club in Disneyland that's only for-

522
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,280
Yeah, you trade-

523
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,960
It was like club 11 or something.

524
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,560
Club 30, 35.

525
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,760
I trade pins, right?

526
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,960
You trade pins, but at the zoo, you trade cock rings with-

527
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,840
Well, at extremerestraints.com, you trade money for something to fuck

528
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,720
and they've got everything you could want.

529
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
If you want to put a dick on a lady, they can do that for you for a very reasonable price.

530
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Justin, this is a season to be sharing.

531
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,200
That's true.

532
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,840
So this is a time to buy something for your lover.

533
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,720
Maybe something to please your lover.

534
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
Can you get a second dick for you?

535
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,720
Like you can have two dicks on it.

536
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,400
Here's what I'm going to tell you.

537
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm looking at it right now and the answer is yes.

538
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,320
All right.

539
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,000
With the Fetish Fantasy Hollow strap on, you can have sex,

540
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:16,720
do the thing that you do at the inn for guys, and then put this on and you're ready for round two.

541
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
You get a dick for your dick?

542
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,000
It's a prosthetic dick to replace the dick that doesn't work no more because it felt too good.

543
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,040
We heard you like dicks.

544
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,600
So we got you a dick for your dick so you can dick while you're dicking.

545
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,320
I don't think you put it, yes, no, correction.

546
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,280
It is hollow.

547
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,000
It is designed to put your dick in to give it a little relaxation.

548
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,240
How fucking deep does that Matryoshka doll go?

549
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,200
Can you keep putting dicks on the dicks on the dicks on the dicks forever?

550
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,440
I think so.

551
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,280
I put a dick on your dick, on your dick, on your dick, on your dick.

552
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,840
Oh God.

553
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,280
It's basically like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers of dicks.

554
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:53,840
Like it's Morphin Time and your bad broken dick that felt too good.

555
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,080
So it died is replaced by a synthetic dick.

556
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,280
I don't understand what your blue Ranger of dicks and then it becomes like the green Ranger of dicks.

557
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:11,200
So you can get that for $31.99 except, except with the middlest coupon code,

558
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,840
you're going to save 20% on that and anything you buy at ExtremeRestraints.com.

559
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,640
So get over there, buy something for your lover.

560
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,040
And, and maybe they don't, maybe your lover doesn't want to get fucked with a fake dick.

561
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,760
Maybe they want to have someone read a book to them.

562
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,400
That's cool.

563
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:49,040
That's cool. We got something for them too.

564
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:54,400
Guys, we have a very special message from Marco from Gallia who says,

565
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Hey Marco, I hope your birthday is a good one and that you'll dress sharp for your

566
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,160
fancy schmancy birthday dinner, maybe in your new gray suit.

567
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,320
And don't forget to shave your head smooth.

568
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
Your friends love you from Gallia and company.

569
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,280
Maybe you should just like let him do his own like stuff.

570
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,880
He wanted to wear his new blue suit.

571
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah.

572
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,120
Let him, let Marco do Marco.

573
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,880
Let Marco, maybe he wants his head to get kind of shaggy and rotten.

574
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
And he wants to shave like his basketball number in the back.

575
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,000
Yeah.

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,160
It's a whitening bolts.

577
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,440
We got a message for Hudson.

578
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,880
Curie, Curie, Curie.

579
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,000
Let's go with Curie, Curie.

580
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,920
This message is from Cody and he says,

581
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Welcome to the world Hudson.

582
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,080
Your new super friend, Cody is happy to meet you.

583
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,600
By the way, congrats to Chris and Christina.

584
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,640
So this is a baby.

585
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,920
No, you assume it's a baby.

586
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
It could be an alien.

587
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,520
No.

588
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:45,840
Okay.

589
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,040
It might be a more situation.

590
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,480
Welcome to the world.

591
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,000
Welcome to the world.

592
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,440
Guys, this is a little baby.

593
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,480
You don't know that it could also be an alien baby.

594
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,160
And it could be the best of both worlds.

595
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,640
Literally.

596
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,040
It's a funny joke.

597
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,520
Travis.

598
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,880
Glad you said it out loud.

599
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,080
Who's this message for?

600
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,440
The Chowboys.

601
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:07,760
Yeah.

602
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,000
It's from Ian and Ian says wishing you a very merry

603
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,680
crimbus and a fiscally responsible candlelight.

604
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,080
I hope that you all find rats in your presents.

605
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,200
Merry Dillfmas.

606
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,600
How many holidays is this group of super friends celebrating?

607
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,680
The super friends Chowboys, I think they're celebrating

608
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,280
everything and also have in jokes for every holiday.

609
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,440
The note that are narrow casting, I think is how you would describe.

610
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,600
Because it's easy to read Dillfmas and think,

611
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,440
Oh, it's like the opposite of MILF.

612
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,000
It's a Dillf.

613
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,720
It's a dad.

614
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,320
But really, it's all about Dillf, right?

615
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,920
Oh, God.

616
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,360
The worst holiday.

617
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,320
Thanks, Chowboys.

618
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,400

622
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,480
Is this the first time I've ever just like fucking done it?

623
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,280
And not even asked you guys if you just, I don't know.

624
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,560
You're finally getting it in $20.

625
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,280
I don't fucking give a shit.

626
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,680
With just 21 doing it days left.

627
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,400
Um, everyone's gotten it done, right?

628
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,200
Everyone's done it.

629
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,720
This is important.

630
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
This clock, she's ticking.

631
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,760
Just ask her, dummy.

Thank you, Ira.

634
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,600
It's by Yahoo answer's user.

635
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,160
Oh, God.

636
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,640
Now, is this Ira Ray?

637
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,780
Huh?

638
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,360
Is this Ira Ray?

639
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,960
Ira Ray.

640
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,840
Okay, go on.

641
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,720
Who did you think it was?

642
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,400
Jimmy Ray.

643
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Oh, God.

644
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm sorry I couldn't alley-oop that for you.

645
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,640
Thanks.

646
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,200
We'll try again.

647
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:45,440
Okay.

648
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,560
Is that Ira Ray?

649
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
Who wants to know?

650
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,520
Is it Sling Blade?

651
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,520
That's not the lyric.

652
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,400
Shut up.

653
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,280
Please shut up.

654
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,000
Please, please, please shut up.

655
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,360
Yahoo answer's user, alcoholism is my new hobby, asks.

656
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:03,760
Okay.

657
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,640
Does anyone else's spouse do karate in the shower?

658
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,480
I poked my head in the shower and my husband froze immediately in this strange pose.

659
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,200
I asked him what he was doing and he looks at me and he says karate.

660
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,880
Like it's the most normal thing in the world to do karate in the shower.

661
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,120
Anyone else's spouse do weird things in the shower?

662
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,360
Of all the things you could catch your spouse doing,

663
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,520
I wouldn't put karate at the top of the weird list.

664
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,680
By the way, if he's standing in the shower

665
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,760
propping himself up with one hand and jerking his soapy wiener off,

666
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
that's not karate guys.

667
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,840
He did not learn that move from Chow Yun Fat.

668
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,000
Guaranteed, guaranteed.

669
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,920
He might've learned it from David Carradine.

670
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,080
Nope.

671
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,360
Oh man.

672
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
Oh man.

673
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh golly.

674
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,320
Oh good golly.

675
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,560
Um, how, first of all, extremely dangerous.

676
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
Super duper dangerous.

677
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,480
Super, the most super.

678
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,760
Unless you have those fish on the bathtub floor.

679
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,240
Oh yeah.

680
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,200
Then you're safe.

681
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Uh, excuse me, Home Depot clerk?

682
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,320
Uh, yes.

683
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,120
I was looking at the plastic bathtub fish.

684
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,720
Are these karate rated?

685
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,360
Are these rated for karate in the bathtub?

686
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,200
When I do a flying sweeping crane kick, how are these going to treat my feet?

687
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
Cause I need to simulate-

688
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,240
I've been hurt before.

689
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,680
I need to simulate the natural battlefield flooring, you know?

690
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,320
But if you can learn to karate in the shower though, you can karate anywhere.

691
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,560
Yeah.

692
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,840
Yeah.

693
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,320
It's like how Yoda made Luke Skywalker run around with a Yoda on his back so he could

694
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,120
jump super high.

695
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,640
Wait, what?

696
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,880
In the Star Wars.

697
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,600
Um, I don't think my, I don't think my spouse or my betrothed does karate in the shower.

698
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,680
I don't think, I don't think anybody does weird things in the shower that I know.

699
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,520
My shower is too small to do awesome things in.

700
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,320
Mm-hmm.

701
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,040
I need a bigger shower.

702
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,200
When you guys visit someone who like lives in a big house and they have like a big shower

703
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,040
with like two heads and like maybe there's a chair in there, do you just assume that

704
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,160
they're fucking freaks?

705
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,080
You just assume, maybe that's just me, but if I see somebody who has like gone through

706
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,760
all the effort to like put a big shower in their house, I just assume that they needed

707
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,560
a big shower in which to express themselves sexually on each other in a wet place.

708
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:25,920
Yeah.

709
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,800
Or a kill room.

710
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
Well, well.

711
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,960
If you're rich, there's a point of richness where the only thrill is taking human life.

712
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,120
To feel someone's life run out in your hands.

713
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,400
If you can feel their life run out in your hands and onto the polished marble of your

714
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,040
giant bathtub, then you have truly lived.

715
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,160
And I would also like to take a moment to thank Extreme Restraints for sponsoring the

716
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,800
show and allowing us to reach that level of richness.

717
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,160
Yes, when you guys go to someone else's shower at their home and you're a guest in their

718
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,840
home and you probably brought your own accoutrement, your own shampoo, or maybe you didn't.

719
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,120
I never do that.

720
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,720
Do you use that as an opportunity to just like just try it?

721
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,880
Just sample, see what's out there.

722
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,080
Yes, of course.

723
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,600
A couple different kinds of shampoo.

724
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,440
There's always like weird scrubs.

725
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,200
I do this in my own bathroom.

726
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't know what some of these scrubs are, but I'll, you know, I'll try it out.

727
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,760
Ooh, is that a coconut husks?

728
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,600
I also do the same with their medication.

729
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
Yeah, sure.

730
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,720
That looks tasty.

731
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,360
I want to eat that.

732
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,840
Sometimes I'll just like, I'll kill them.

733
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,080
And then just like, I just assume, I'll just assume their life, you know?

734
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

735
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,000
I'll just like take, I'll just like take charge.

736
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,600
Because really, when you smell like someone, you're basically walking a mile in their

737
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,360
shoes and their smell shoes.

738
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,880
I really do never bring my shampoo anywhere.

739
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,880
And like, I'll get indignant about it if I stay at somebody's house and they like don't

740
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,000
have conditioner.

741
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,760
Like, oh, thanks guys.

742
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,480
I'm just, you know what?

743
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm just going to go.

744
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,880
There's, I saw a puddle out on the street.

745
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,800
I'll just splash around in that for a while.

746
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

747
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,640
What a nightmare.

748
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,320
Oh, you have hand soap in the shower and you use that for, I didn't know that you were

749
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,000
a giant hand, sir.

750
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,800
I didn't know that your body was made up entirely of hands.

751
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,760
So that's cool.

752
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
I guess that's what you think of me.

753
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,040
Why don't you just spit on me over and over again until I'm wet enough and clean enough?

754
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:35,520
You've already metaphorically spit on me by not offering me the finest shampoos and conditioners.

755
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,520
Or just any shampoo and conditioner.

756
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,360
I think it's just because I get so excited when I put on a new shampoo, you know?

757
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:41,920
Sure.

758
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,400
What's it?

759
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,080
Maybe this will be the one, you know?

760
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,880
I am in dire need of your assistance this holiday.

761
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,800
Read family centric season.

762
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,440
My boyfriend and I have been friends for six years together for three and have lived in

763
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,880
sin for the last 1.5.

764
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,000
I don't see his family very often, but when I do, things seem a bit strained.

765
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,720
Thing is, I'm not sure if his parents don't like me or if they're just stoic.

766
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,440
How can I suss this out without stepping up to one of them over the punch bowl and saying,

767
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,200
Hey, we cool?

768
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,640
That's a good question.

769
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,120
We cool? That's Outkast from Indiana.

770
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,560
Are we good?

771
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,920
They probably like you enough.

772
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,640
How do you know that, though?

773
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,840
I don't.

774
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,960
It really depends on if you have...

775
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,520
You gotta adopt the speak when spoken to sort of deference to their family and tell like

776
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,840
you can figure out how to worm your way in there.

777
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,760
And sometimes it takes longer than other times.

778
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,160
But I think it... I've always been of the opinion that like if the person you're dating

779
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,120
is cool, then they probably have some level of coolness in their family that you can tap

780
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,160
into, you know?

781
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,000
I think everybody's family just wants their child to be happy.

782
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,560
Right.

783
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,960
So if you make him happy, then I don't think they'll have a problem with you.

784
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,000
It could just be, and this is, I have seen this many times, they could just be kind of

785
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,840
an uptight, stressed out family, you know?

786
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,960
Like they could just... You could be feeling a lot of family dynamics.

787
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,640
And I also feel that there may be people out there going now, well, not everybody just

788
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,760
wants their person to be happy.

789
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
Some people's families are awful.

790
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,320
Possible.

791
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,840
But if that's the case, then what does it matter whether they like you or not?

792
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,440
Like it's win-win.

793
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,240
Either the family is cool because a cool person came from it or a cool person came from it

794
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:38,800
in defiance of how uncool it is, in which case you don't lose anything by them not liking you.

795
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Now, have you ever heard people talk about like getting really stressed at the holidays

796
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,080
or like this kind of thing stresses them out?

797
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,240
Like, and spending time with the in-laws and that's stressing them out.

798
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,360
That is, I mean...

799
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,880
That's a human experience.

800
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,400
That's what you're experiencing right now.

801
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,320
Like it's not an uncommon thing.

802
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:00,560
It's like we are comfortable with the people we live with because we've decided that that's

803
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,240
a situation we can handle.

804
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,560
But when you start inviting people you don't live with in your home, nobody really wants that.

805
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,800
Yeah.

806
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,560
And I think there's always a level of this.

807
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,000
Like, you go stay in anyone's home, even if it's like your best friend and you always

808
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,480
have to put on a little bit of a layer of like, well, I'm going to be more polite and

809
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,640
more conscientious, more clean than I am in my own home.

810
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Like you don't get to just be yourself.

811
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,600
Add to that the layer of it being your significant other's family that you don't see that often,

812
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,880
that you don't know that well.

813
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,200
They're doing the same thing back.

814
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,080
Like, there's just a lot of pressure on both sides to be like, hey, be on your best behavior.

815
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,520
Be interesting.

816
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,080
Be fun.

817
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,200
Lean into it is advice that's always really, really good.

818
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,720
And just like maybe this Christmas, maybe you drop a few daddies in there.

819
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,600
Maybe a few mommies and a few daddies.

820
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,960
Start laying that seed.

821
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,080
Unky, bro-bro, sissy, sissy-sissy-siss.

822
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
Hey, sis, you want to go to the mall?

823
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,200
Sissy.

824
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,360
And you give them all that.

825
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,840
And then you jump to the other end of the spectrum.

826
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,160
And then maybe next year you can find a happy medium.

827
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm still not sure of your ability to make our son happy and keep him safe.

828
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,760
But for Christ's sakes, at least you're not weirding us out anymore.

829
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,160
At least you're not like that girl he was dating last year.

830
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,040
Oh, that was you?

831
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,600
Oh, shit.

832
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,320
Recently, two of my closest friends got in a fight that permanently ended their friendship.

833
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,600
While I've successfully stayed out of the conflict and managed to maintain my relationship

834
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,840
with both of them, it's still affecting me.

835
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,240
Since they can no longer be in the same room, I want to have a Christmas party,

836
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,160
but I can't figure out how to deal with inviting them.

837
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,400
How do I get out of the situation with my friendships intact?

838
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,840
That's from Baffled and Brooklyn.

839
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,560
Yay!

840
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,600
Guys, we have like a Sacred Order of the Water Buffalo thing going on.

841
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,000
I think it's time for a farce.

842
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,680
Oh, shit.

843
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,480
Nobody ever gets in these situations, and you need to be so thankful,

844
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,840
because now you have the perfect setup for a holiday farce.

845
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,320
Okay, so you're gonna have two parties.

846
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,520
Fucking, it's a Santa Claus party.

847
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,960
Everybody come dressed up like Santa Claus.

848
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,400
Nobody knows who's in the room.

849
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,280
Okay, I love it.

850
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,640
Maybe, maybe eventually it turns into like an Eyes Wide Shut.

851
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,760
Let's not think about that.

852
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,120
Well, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, this is a dual scenario, you guys.

853
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,440
Secret Order of the Water Buffalo, and you have an Eyes Wide Shut,

854
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,760
because maybe people have fun and they can't tell that they hate each other because they're exes,

855
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,880
but then maybe things get weird.

856
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,840
Maybe some dicks come out.

857
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,880
But then, you have your friend Barn, right?

858
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,920
And Barney's there.

859
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:36,400
Barney's there.

860
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,200
He's gonna help usher one of the bad friends around.

861
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,840
Correct.

862
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,040
But then Barn, you only know his name is Barn.

863
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,000
You've never met him.

864
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,320
No.

865
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,240
He's just a friend of a friend of a friend.

866
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:46,880
Named Barn.

867
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,080
Barn, and he shows up, and it turns out that Barn is not the Barn you thought he was,

868
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,840
so Barn doesn't know his ass from his elbow.

869
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:59,040
Okay, can we also say that on the invitation to this Santa Claus secret orgy,

870
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,000
that everybody has to be called Barn?

871
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,280
Oh yeah, and everybody's called Barn there.

872
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,800
Sure, I love it.

873
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,400
And then one person comes dressed as a Barn because they got confused by the invitation,

874
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,160
but he's just there for like the whimsical end of act one moment.

875
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,720
Oh yeah.

876
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:23,840
And there's a big plate of shrimp, and someone's allergic,

877
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,160
except everyone's dressed like Santa, so you don't know who.

878
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,680
And that person eats the shrimp.

879
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,160
I love it.

880
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
Because they also don't know who they are.

881
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,440
They get so enveloped in the Barn lifestyle that they forget their own-

882
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,040
Am I the one that's allergic to shrimp?

883
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,920
Are you the one?

884
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,480
I don't know, we're both dressed as Santa Claus.

885
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,520
Okay, I got it.

886
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,440
One of your friends is allergic to imitation crab, but you lie to everyone and tell them

887
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,640
it's real crab because you don't want them to know that your husband just got laid off

888
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,280
from his job.

889
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:51,920
Okay.

890
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,280
At the end, he's going to get a new job.

891
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,360
Okay, from the guy dressed as a Barn.

892
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,840
Oh man.

893
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,520
You know what's great is that because this question is from Brooklyn,

894
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,360
this is going to be like the seventh weirdest party that all of these people have gone to.

895
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:12,240
Yeah, we just got out of a very Skrillex Christmas where everybody shaved their head like Skrillex.

896
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,720
We were just having a party at an abandoned axe factory and instead of eggnog, they just

897
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,200
had eggs.

898
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,200
It was awesome.

899
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,720
I was aw- It was a pretty good party.

900
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,200
They had Christmas lights and Tony Bennett was there.

901
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,120
We lumberjacked for like 12 hours.

902
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,800
We were just lumberjacking.

903
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,960
Do you have a futon I can just crash on for a bit?

904
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,800
I'm exhausted.

905
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,840
To answer your question, what you have to do is you have to invite both of your friends

906
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,440
and then tell them both that the other one is also invited and then neither one of them

907
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,800
will come and you won't have to deal with it.

908
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,240
Make it their problem.

909
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,760
This isn't your problem.

910
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,280
Tell them that they're both invited and then they should probably patch things up before

911
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,680
the party because you're not going to have baby Desus's.

912
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,640
I invited Amanda and Amanda, I invited Susan.

913
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,520
If you guys show up to my party and start shit, I swear to God, I will kick you out.

914
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,880
So that's going to do it for us.

915
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,920
Thank you guys so much for listening to our program.

916
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:10,800
Next week will be our holiday special, Candle Nights, and we hope you'll join us again for

917
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,520
that because it'll be a family friendly program, something you can listen to with Unky Dan.

918
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,400
Are we?

919
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,240
We're still looking for questions.

920
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,400
Do we have Extreme Restraints on the calendar to be a sponsor?

921
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,040
Yes.

922
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,800
Oh my God, this is going to be amazing.

923
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,280
We gotta do a PG Extreme Restraint.

924
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,160
We'll figure it out.

925
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,280
Oh my God.

926
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:33,840
Tune in.

927
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,880
It's going to be the best.

928
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,120
And thank you for people tweeting about the show on Twitter.

929
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:50,400
Abald Wookiee, Jeremy Franklin, Swellers UK, Agent Eli, Iron Slayer 13, Poe Bro, MC Ginnin,

930
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,040
Geeky Lindsey, S&B Records, Ben Kerrigan, Insane Barry.

931
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,800
Are you going to sleep?

932
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,560
On that Christmas tree.

933
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,400
And then Justin faded away.

934
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,800
We'd also like to say thank you to all of our sponsors and especially to Audible.com.

935
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,240
And now I would like to do my impression of the girl that read our Audible commercial.

936
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:28,720
OK, let's hear it.

937
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:48,400
Oh, Travis, that was fantastic.

938
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,360
Man, that is a dynamite impression.

939
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,720
I've been working on it for four weeks.

940
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,560
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters for the use of our theme song

941
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,560
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

942
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,240
You can actually get John Roderick and Jonathan Coulton's Christmas album

943
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,760
One Christmas at a Time now available in all the stores.

944
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,840
Actually, I don't know what stores it's available in, but it's a good listen.

945
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,200
It will fill you with so much cheer.

946
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,360
So go look into that.

947
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,440
If you if you want One Christmas at a Time, just Google it.

948
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,400
Yeah, just Google it.

949
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,240
And I bet it will just it'll just turn up.

950
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:20,880
You know where it is?

951
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,160
You know where I can say officially it is?

952
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,960
It is on Amazon.

953
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,760
Yeah, OK.

954
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,040
Well, so you can get there.

955
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:30,160
Also in all books, a million and orders and then a couple of Pat Smart's.

956
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:30,880
Walton Books.

957
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,960
These are all things.

958
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,440
These are still exit retailers that you could go to.

959
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,600
And hey, everybody, thank you for the warm the warm wishes on my life change.

960
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,480
My life decision.

961
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,320
Yeah, it was really nice.

962
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,200
We got so much cool stuff in the mail, by the way.

963
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,400
We got some magic cards.

964
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,400
We got the Wisconsin Hustle.

965
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,280
It's a card game.

966
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,800
A guy dressed up as a pilgrim.

967
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,240
Burgess sent us a fine note.

968
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,560
Got a postcard from Des Moines from Rachel.

969
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,320
A postcard from cash strapped in California.

970
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:09,840
It's lovely.

971
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,920
So much cool stuff.

972
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,840
Kinjaman sent us a very nice note.

973
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,000
And I just really appreciate everybody because it really means a lot to get those little

974
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,320
notes.

975
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:26,480
We're at PO Box 54, Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

976
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,800
Edward Rogers sent us a note, too.

977
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,400
So if you want to mail us something of value, I would appreciate it.

978
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,680
Yeah, not just notes.

979
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,880
Not just garbage.

980
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,640
Sent us a nice present.

981
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,680
Precious rubies.

982
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,560
Got art that you made about us.

983
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,360
We really like that.

984
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,320
This Final Yahoo is sent in by Renee Laburn.

985
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,040
Thank you, Renee.

986
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:55,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user tepsi, who asks, what are the vegetables at Subway?

987
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,000
List all of them.

988
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,120
Don't just guess, please.

989
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,440
I'm just McElroy.

990
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,800
I'm Travis McElroy.

991
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,920
I'm Hank the Spank Tank Flankerjunk.

992
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,200
This has been the Pleasure Garden.

993
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,640
Kiss your dad.

994
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,240
Not for sex, Ruben.

995
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:22,240
Have sex time.

996
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,080
Hey, folks.

997
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,600
This is Kevin Allison of The State and the podcast RISK, where people tell true stories

998
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,520
they never thought they'd dare to share.

999
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,200
RISK is the latest addition to the roster of podcasts at Maximum Fun, and it is jam-packed

1000
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,720
with unforgettable stuff.

1001
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:53,520
Your favorite writers, comedians, even fans like you share x-rated stories, outrageously

1002
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,640
hilarious stories, tear-jerking stories.

1003
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,920
You won't believe how real and raw and surprising RISK can be.

1004
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,160
Both radio-style stories and stories told at our live shows, you've heard people say,
