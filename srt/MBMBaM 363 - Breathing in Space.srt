1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy. I'm gonna say

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,720
my name normal, so. I just like, if you string my name together, it sounds like Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
Oh, that's fun. Yeah, right? Are you boys excited to go to...

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,680
Which is what I just sort of, like, because I'm so familiar with it, I call San Diego Comic-Con,

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,000
the 2017 edition. Are you boys all hyped up to, for the comic, that new comic smell?

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,880
Excelsior! Excelsior is what I always say. Did you know that every comic-con attendee

13
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:41,200
in their visit will get a complimentary Stanley cameo? You gotta keep your eyes peeled,

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,440
but he will, maybe he'll be the one serving you chicken tenders in the conference center.

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,560
Maybe he'll be your driver, your Uber. Maybe he'll wake up and he'll be standing over you

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,920
in your hotel room. If you see an old man and you wonder, who are you talking to?

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
That is probably Stanley, because I kind of wonder, people in the Marvel movies,

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,480
like, who is that old man talking to? I've always got my head on a swiv,

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,640
looking for Stanley. Are you... What do you think Stanley's last name is?

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,200
No one knows, and that's what makes him such an exciting artist. So...

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,920
It's Lieber. I want to make sure we don't all dress up

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,280
as the same action hero, and so I was hoping we could take some time here for our Cosplay Corner,

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
which is a segment we haven't done in a while, huh?

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,040
Yeah. I was just wondering who you boys are gonna do.

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,760
I got mine all planned out this year. Okay.

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,480
The cape. But... Jesus Christ.

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
So I am going as the cape, which you may remember from the series The Cape,

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,480
but this is gonna be confusing, and I'm still sort of struggling with how to communicate this

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,600
vis-a-vis my dress. I've got 10 episodes of sort of, like, material to work with.

30
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Not much. Not a lot. A lot of time you want a richer canon,

31
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,000
so you can sneak a lot of Easter eggs into your garb.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,240
But I don't think they had time to really develop those, to nurture and incubate those eggs.

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,280
So the thing is that I'm cosplaying as the cape from The Cape.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,640
Not the cape, the character, but the cape's cape called The Cape.

35
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Lower case t, lower case c.

36
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,920
Right. The cape from The Cape, the cancelled TV series.

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,320
How's that grab you all?

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,440
Oh, it grabs me so good, just like The Cape didn't.

39
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,960
I have a really exciting one, and it's taken a really long time,

40
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,480
and I've spent, boys, thousands of tens of dollars.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm gonna be, I think, just Zachary Quinto.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,440
Nice.

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay.

44
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:05,120
Not as a Star Trek Spock or as a heroes guy, but just Zachary Quinto.

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,480
And I don't know if a lot of people, do folks do that typically?

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,040
Like, hi, I'm Will Wheaton.

47
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,240
And people are like, oh, it's so exciting.

48
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,440
Wait a minute.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,640
Like, no, you don't understand that.

50
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:14,880
No.

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,480
I just damn him.

52
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,480
Be a good year for your Elijah Wood cosplay, Griffin.

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah, I mean, every year's a good year for my Elijah Wood cosplay, Justin.

54
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,680
It's my life.

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,200
Do you think Zachary Quinto walks around in Spock ears just like,

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,960
ah, nanu-nanu, right, idiots?

57
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,680
Anyway, get bent.

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,640
That would be my entire comic-con experience.

59
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,560
Anybody got any cats I can eat?

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
Because, oh, that wasn't him.

61
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
That wasn't Spock who did it.

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,560
It was Alf.

63
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,240
It was Alf who did that.

64
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,360
Thanks for the money.

65
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
I'm going, my cosplay this year is, I'm gonna go as Superman.

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,040
But I'm going as Superman, like, right in the middle of changing from Clark Kent to Superman.

67
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,120
So I'm out of my Clark Kent clothes, but I haven't yet gotten into my Superman outfit yet.

68
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,840
Hmm, I think if you cosplay as Superman in one of these things, you should just be asked to leave.

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
Yeah, we get it.

70
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Yeah, Superman is cool.

71
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,280
We get it.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,240
It is the equivalent of dressing up as a ghost on Halloween.

73
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,200
Just because it's like, oh, oh.

74
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
What if I'm just super naked?

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,400
Well, yeah, yeah.

76
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,600
Hey, are we going to cosplay at, we're going to be-

77
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Let me be clear.

78
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,200
I'm going to shave my chest hair into the ass.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Now we're talking.

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah, so it'll be, and my bush.

81
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,160
Now we're talking about something real upsetting.

82
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
So we are actually going to be, I should mention now while I'm thinking about it,

83
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,640
we're going to be at Comic-Con.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,360
When is it?

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
Saturday, well, we're going to be there, like, you know, all the days.

86
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,200
But Saturday at noon, we are going to be at the first second booth representing the Adventure Zone.

87
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
So come say hi.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,920
Are we going to cosplay for that?

89
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,240
Are we?

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,440
Should we cosplay?

91
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,680
Yeah.

92
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
Ooh, probably.

93
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
That could be fun.

94
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,400
I mean, we will have done a live Adventure Zone the night before,

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,600
so y'all will definitely have your costume.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
And it will smell of show funk, so that'll be nice.

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
If you cosplay, be sure to come.

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,920
And like, if you see us walking around, I don't want any of this like,

99
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,640
I saw you guys, but I didn't want to bother you.

100
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,040
If you're dressed as a character from the Adventure Zone,

101
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,280
you come say hi, let us get a picture with you.

102
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,000
Or not.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I mean, like, if you want to say hi, just say hi.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Just come and say hi, there's no rules just right.

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,120
No rules here.

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Trav, have you been to Sandy or Comic-Con before?

107
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,320
I have, I went last year.

108
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,520
Okay, is it just, be straight with me.

109
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,600
You know me and my proclivities.

110
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,520
My special, my sort of whole thing.

111
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,120
Is it just going to be a full blown, pedal to the metal, McG's shit show?

112
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Like, is that what I'm anticipating here?

113
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,120
No, no, no, no, no.

114
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,240
No?

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,720
No.

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
It's going to be a medium pedal to the metal shit show.

117
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,040
But not full blown.

118
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,040
How many times am I going to run into Nathan Fillion in the bathroom?

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Because I know it's going, oh, that's too many.

120
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:07,760
That's too many times.

121
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,680
Why are you both going to the bathroom?

122
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
That's because he just stays in the bathroom.

123
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,680
Hey, do you need a mint towel?

124
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,640
What do you need?

125
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,680
I don't work here.

126
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,480
That's a good, both of you did real good.

127
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Nathan Fillion said, should we do?

128
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,040
Oh, we should also say right here at the top, we're also going to be on at midnight.

129
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
Oh, fuck.

130
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,440
The 24th, July 24th.

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,560
Don't ask when it's on.

132
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,840
You'll look like an asshole.

133
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,920
Yeah, but check it out.

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,520
Watch us, the three of us competing brother against brother.

135
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,480
It's the civil war of late night comedy shows.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,080
We don't really write jokes or do jokes ever.

137
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
So that should be a fun experience.

138
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,480
Yeah, please enjoy all of us trying to look comfortable as we appear on national television.

139
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,000
Can I hit you guys with this?

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,320
This is a true story before we get to our advice segment of the show,

141
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,920
the ever dwindling advice segment.

142
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,280
I was watching episodes of At Midnight and pausing after Mr.

143
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,560
Hardwick gave the prompt to see if I could come up with a joke.

144
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,600
Oh, man.

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,320
Isn't that sad?

146
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,000
So here's the one.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm going to give you guys the prompt and you have to come up with your own jokes.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,320
And I'll tell you what my joke is to buy you some time.

149
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,520
Okay, real quick, though.

150
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:23,920
I do.

151
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,720
I did just say, oh, man, not because of this segment you're doing,

152
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,920
but because I just had to confront the fact that you are going to call him Mr.

153
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,680
Hardwick while I'm in the room with you.

154
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,040
And it's bad for me.

155
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,280
Now, Chrissy boy is what he insists.

156
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,000
Okay, so the prompt was what Pitbull, if he ran for governor of Florida,

157
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,200
what would his campaign slogan be?

158
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,040
And here's who you have to beat in this lineup was Howie Mandel,

159
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,760
David Cockner, and I forget.

160
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
But Howie Mandel was the main one that I was like.

161
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,440
I would, the Sun Tzu said the first secret to war is to not get in it

162
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
with a combatant who you could never hope to beat.

163
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,080
And so I concede, of course.

164
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
Okay, so that is going to be your sort of play.

165
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Because the best I could do is I know you want me as governor.

166
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,840
And that's it. And that sucks.

167
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
I'm going to be so bad on TV.

168
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,480
Memory hurt.

169
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,760
There's a third person.

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,960
Me as governor?

171
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,520
Yeah, right.

172
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,880
Picture that with a Kodak.

173
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,400
So we're going to be really bad.

174
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,560
Comma, but I would like to be governor, please.

175
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Will Chris sue us?

176
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,880
People have been trying to get you on this show for a long time

177
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,200
and you stank it the fuck up.

178
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,840
And so the show got canceled because of how bad you did.

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Lots of people lost their jobs.

180
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
And so we need $10 million by next Tuesday.

181
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
Here was my joke.

182
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Pitbull's running for governor of Florida.

183
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
What's his campaign slogan?

184
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,040
I promise to personally eat every mosquito in the state, Pitbull.

185
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,080
Damn it.

186
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,360
All right, Justin.

187
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,160
Now, okay, 15 minutes is about what it's-

188
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,760
Ah, shit.

189
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,920
Some people link the edits.

190
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:11,920
All right.

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,960
You can carry us through this television experience.

192
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's do some advice.

193
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,560
Yeah, I'm happy to just get in there and just do the damn thing.

194
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,000
You guys ready?

195
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:22,880
Yeah.

196
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,440
Are you sure you're ready?

197
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Sorry, I'm looking for the question.

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,600
You did not have the email ready.

199
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
I work from home and one of the restaurants I go to for lunch

200
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,680
has a guest of the month leaderboard

201
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,080
with names and tally marks behind the register.

202
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,000
I go here at least twice a week.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
I have the rewards card and they know my order

204
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,320
without me having to give it to them,

205
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,400
but I'm not even on the leaderboard.

206
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
What do I have to do?

207
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,960
That's from Inconsolable in Irvine.

208
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
Man, you got to step it up.

209
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,480
You got to step up your game.

210
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,000
You got to be like that dude in Supersized

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,680
when he had a billion Big Macs and just get in there.

212
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Can this be the only restaurant you eat at?

213
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
What's this meal you always get?

214
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Is it perhaps a salad with all the major food groups in it

215
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
but it sort of covers the whole pyramid?

216
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
Because if so, you just go there

217
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
and you order that for every single meal.

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,040
All of a sudden you can rack up 21 a week

219
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,080
and that's going to get you there.

220
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,480
Maybe you need to make more of an impression.

221
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,680
Maybe a fun outfit.

222
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,480
Maybe you could be the Zoot Suit Panini King

223
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,640
and every time you come in, you're like,

224
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,840
hey mama, it's like guy or girl, doesn't matter.

225
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,000
Hey mama, I'm ready for my Panini

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
and then you do a spin around

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
and then when they hand it to you, it'll be really hot

228
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,040
or maybe it's not and you take a bite

229
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
and you're like smoking.

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah, you say, I've burned myself.

231
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,120
You know, a lot of people look down on

232
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
and remember poorly the 90s swing fascination

233
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,400
but I think the Zoot Suit Panini Kings had a lot of hits

234
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,320
and people just don't appreciate the work that they did,

235
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,920
the groundwork they laid, you know?

236
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,960
It's a shame that their bold style and vision

237
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,120
was completely lifted wholesale by the Panini Pop and Daddies.

238
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,040
Yeah, it led to the swing turf wars of 1999.

239
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,920
And we lost a lot of good-

240
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
Trombonists.

241
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,360
A lot of really good ska musicians.

242
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,320
Just kidding, I was just saying.

243
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,560
Get that roasted red pepper on there.

244
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,720
Check to make sure there's no hair.

245
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,280
Grill lines, grill lines.

246
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,680
Throw that thing on the little grill.

247
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,880
Who's your daddy?

248
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,440
Yes, I am.

249
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
There's another part of it right there.

250
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,840
Who'll be your daddy?

251
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
Just change the tense.

252
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,240
Who's your daddy?

253
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,200
Yes, I will.

254
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
There you go.

255
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,400
Okay, that's not even good.

256
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,160
Here's the thing.

257
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,480
What you've got now, which is nice,

258
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
is like you have a leaderboard.

259
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,680
So you need to find that person who's number one

260
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
and learn from them, train from them.

261
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,840
What Travis is suggesting is you

262
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,840
draft on them to use racing terminology.

263
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,040
So you just follow them.

264
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,880
And when they go to the Panera Bread,

265
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,320
you swing in there and you order double what they eat.

266
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,280
Yeah.

267
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,160
You gotta eat all of it or else it doesn't count.

268
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,960
Maybe some ink.

269
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,560
What does that mean?

270
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,920
Just get some ink.

271
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
Just get a tattoo that's like

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,560
number one fan of the Panini spot.

273
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,240
That's gotta get you on the board at least, right?

274
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
I don't like that.

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,400
But it's of the month, Justin, is the problem.

276
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,200
So you get that once, that's maybe June.

277
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,880
What do you do for like July and August?

278
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,280
You know what I mean?

279
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,240
Just keep getting the same tattoo over and over again.

280
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,280
That's crazy, Justin.

281
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I was saying I don't like how that

282
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
affects the healthy spirit of competition

283
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,480
that this place is trying to foster, right?

284
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,960
Like if fucking, you know, Peyton Manning gets a

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,640
I love the Super Bowl tattoo.

286
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
I don't think they should let him

287
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,640
just be in the Super Bowl because of that.

288
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,560
I think I want to go on record and say

289
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,440
I think that's wrong.

290
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
So we gotta be looking.

291
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,320
We're probably talking.

292
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's say we're looking at a top 10 list here.

293
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
You gotta assume you're probably 11.

294
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,400
You're in there all the time.

295
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,720
So maybe you pick somebody on the list

296
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,480
and August is just around the corner.

297
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,960
Maybe they're not gonna make it in this time.

298
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,840
Maybe they had a little accident.

299
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,360
And maybe they decided to get paninis

300
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
at another establishment.

301
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,240
Maybe they're eating paninis with the fishes now.

302
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,520
Because they went to that seafood restaurant.

303
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,440
Maybe they're splitting a panini with old St. Pete.

304
00:14:51,440 --> 00:15:02,640
Maybe they're having some mint paninis.

305
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,120
Our least popular option, but we're bringing it back

306
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,920
just for you, the panini spot fans.

307
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,280
Beat the heat this summer with a cement panini.

308
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,960
Lose those last few LBs.

309
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,880
Get your beach body right by trying.

310
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
Eating this rocks.

311
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,680
Eating rocks.

312
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
Do you doofuses want a Yahoo?

313
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,240
Sure.

314
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,200
Wait, what?

315
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,560
Here's a Yahoo from Sally.

316
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,880
You tricked us into saying we're doofuses.

317
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,400
It's from Seth Carlson.

318
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:30,880
Thank you, Seth.

319
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,400
It's Yahoo user Sally who says,

320
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
what would become of McDonald's

321
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,400
if they were just serving Happy Meals

322
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,440
with characters of Family Guy and South Park

323
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,640
for an older audience?

324
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,240
Wait, what?

325
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,080
What would happen?

326
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,280
What would become of McDonald's

327
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,800
if they were just serving Happy Meals

328
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,320
with characters from Family Guy and South Park

329
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,840
for an older audience?

330
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,200
I just want to say,

331
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,000
and we'll get to the actual meat of the question,

332
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,560
I love when people use what would become

333
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,640
or what has become as a phrase.

334
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,400
It just sounds so like Edgar Allen Poe.

335
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
It makes you sound like fucking Gandalf.

336
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:08,640
Yeah.

337
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,520
I want to go to McDonald's

338
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,160
and order a burger meal and fries

339
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,480
and still get that excitement that I used to get

340
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,320
when I would get a little beyblade.

341
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:27,440
But listen, I've put behind me my childish things.

342
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,080
Now I want Family Guy and South Park toys.

343
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,760
That irreverent humor.

344
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,200
The irreverent South Park humor,

345
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,440
and I love that, and you know I love that.

346
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,840
But I would be so excited to pull a little quagmire

347
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
out of my meal.

348
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
And I think that would be really, really...

349
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,800
And maybe he has a little button on it

350
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,280
and you press him

351
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,040
and he says all of his fun jokes from the show.

352
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Wait, is it the toys?

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
I thought the box art on the Happy Meal would be...

354
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,720
Yeah, Travis, it's a Happy Meal without a toy in it.

355
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,360
No, no, no.

356
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,080
This is why I did call you a doofus before we started.

357
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,840
But that would be good for adults

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,080
because as adults we know that there's not always a prize.

359
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,560
You know what I mean?

360
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,960
Sometimes you just do it because you have to,

361
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,320
because you're supposed to.

362
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,400
And if you do it and expect a reward, right?

363
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,680
Millennials, right?

364
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,520
Expecting a reward every time.

365
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,080
Sure.

366
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,840
And you don't always get the trophy.

367
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,760
Sometimes you just do it because you have to do it

368
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,400
because you have to pay your stupid electricity bill

369
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,440
because there's a lot of electricity

370
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,120
you can't power your Nintendo Switch.

371
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,320
And maybe the electricity bill is in the...

372
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,280
It's got Family Guy in South Park on the box.

373
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,920
And you know it's for adults.

374
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,520
And so you crack it open

375
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,800
and it's not that little joke burger that they serve to kids.

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,480
It's, you know, a big...

377
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,200
One of their weird fucked up artisanal burgers

378
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
with like frizzled onions

379
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,240
and that delicious McDonald's guacamole on it.

380
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,920
But then you dig inside

381
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,160
and maybe there's even a little bag, a little plastic bag

382
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,360
and it feels like there's a toy in it

383
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,240
and it does have, you know, Peter and Lois and everyone on it.

384
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,960
And you tear it open

385
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
and it is your electricity bill or your gas bill in there.

386
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
Maybe there's a little plastic bag in there.

387
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,040
You open it up and wait, it's your car keys?

388
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,080
Didn't you just have the...

389
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,360
You look up who just served you.

390
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,480
It's Chris Angel.

391
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,040
That's right.

392
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,720
You've just been mind freaked.

393
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,960
He's got your keys out of your pocket

394
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,480
and somehow got them into the toy bag in the McDonald's.

395
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,080
So we've basically covered the big three of adulthood.

396
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,240
A reverent humor.

397
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,760
Bill's Chris Angel.

398
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,960
Chris Angel.

399
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,840
I don't need...

400
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,360
The good thing about the toy,

401
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
the usual thing about the toy

402
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,720
is it's a good way to convince your kids

403
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,520
to eat their chicken grillers and apple slices.

404
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,880
I don't need extra motivation to eat the McDonald's

405
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,320
that I'm not allowed to eat.

406
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,920
By the way, McDonald's if you're listening,

407
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,560
some sort of bean-centric product would be

408
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,960
a hugely appreciated to those of us.

409
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,400
Meet Justin halfway here with some bean product.

410
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
Justin, I feel like you're selling the toy short

411
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,600
because it's also a good way to convince our dad

412
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,640
in the 90s that they might be worth something someday.

413
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
And so he needs to collect a shit ton of them

414
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,880
and then eventually I assume throw them away.

415
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
That, yeah, that already happened.

416
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,840
Oh, okay.

417
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,400
If you'll remember the drawer in the TV room

418
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,040
when we destroyed the TV room.

419
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,920
Oh, yeah.

420
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,160
Yeah, that drawer existed.

421
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,360
Yeah, that's a good point though.

422
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I don't have a bunch of room for a shitty little Cartman

423
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,600
in my home now.

424
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,720
And so maybe you crack open the box

425
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,120
and it's got all my favorite adult characters on it

426
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,800
and then I get the little plastic Cartman out of it

427
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,920
and he just sort of sits there

428
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,000
as some sort of weird lunch totem

429
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,600
as I enjoy my bad burger and then somebody comes

430
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,880
and they say, are you done, sir?

431
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,000
And I say, yes, and then they throw this toy away for me.

432
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,560
So I do not, I don't have to bring it into my house.

433
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,120
What if the toy was made of Jordan almonds?

434
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,040
Maybe just a nice palette cleanser.

435
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,860
Now we're...

436
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,760
The toy is just a Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

437
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Just a Ferrero Rocher.

438
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,600
Has anyone ever eaten Jordan almonds

439
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,160
that were not given to them as a wedding favor?

440
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
Probably at some point.

441
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
Think about it, really think about it.

442
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,520
The answer is no.

443
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
When's McDonald's gonna just start serving booze?

444
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,840
You know what I mean?

445
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,360
Come on, cowards.

446
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,280
I want my booze.

447
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,080
I want my fucking Eric Cartman toy

448
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
to be thrown away for me

449
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
and I want my guacamole burger with frizzled onions.

450
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,000
This is, we can't get into this.

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,920
I'm surprised we have not had a Munch Squad

452
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,360
about McDonald's sort of Chipotle turn here

453
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,680
here in the 11th hour.

454
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,240
I just, it boggles the mind.

455
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,400
Y'all want fancy shit from us, right?

456
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,120
It's like they discovered the Necronomicon

457
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,040
and it's like, you guys are dabbling in forces

458
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,360
that I absolutely do not trust you with.

459
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
Guacamole?

460
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
That's not a McDonald's.

461
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
That's not a McDonald's, unfortunately.

462
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,200
This is not a Munch Squad,

463
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,880
but I did wanna point out,

464
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,400
I just Googled Ronald McDonald

465
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,080
because I was like, where is that guy?

466
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,160
Have you guys seen Ronald McDonald for a while?

467
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,680
He hasn't, have you?

468
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
It's been a minute, right?

469
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,840
So here's the deal.

470
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
In 2016, do you remember everybody

471
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
was kinda tripped out about clowns for a minute?

472
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Did they pull him back a little bit?

473
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,240
They're, quote, mindful of the current climate

474
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
around clown signings in communities

475
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,160
and being thoughtful in respect

476
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
to Ronald McDonald's participation

477
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,840
in community events for the time being.

478
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,800
So your plan to make Ronald McDonald less terrifying

479
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
is to put him in the hole?

480
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,160
Hide him where we can't see him.

481
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,240
Put him in solitary for a few years?

482
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,560
We wanna be absolutely clear here.

483
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,840
Ronald's still there and he's everywhere,

484
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,280
but you won't see him anymore.

485
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,960
So enjoy, enjoy this.

486
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
Can I share something I just found

487
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,280
on the Ronald McDonald Wikipedia?

488
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah, please.

489
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,280
Everybody always talks about the,

490
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,800
oh, interesting fact, Willard Scott

491
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,560
played the original Ronald McDonald.

492
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,600
That's very, very interesting.

493
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
Back to back, 1975 to 1984,

494
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
and then 1984 to 1991,

495
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
Ronald McDonald was portrayed

496
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,000
by someone named King Moody.

497
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,680
All right.

498
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,080
Followed by Squire Fridell.

499
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,680
Excellent.

500
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,880
Are you shitting me?

501
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,960
I assume Squire Fridell worked for King Moody

502
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,120
as his squire.

503
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,680
This had to be, this was back to back,

504
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,840
King Moody followed by Squire Fridell.

505
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,880
Yeah, followed by Paige Johnson.

506
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,120
Right, like King Moody.

507
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,200
King Moody was fucking Ronald McDonald for nine years.

508
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah, and then they just took it away

509
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,000
because he-

510
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
They took his crown.

511
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,360
How about another question?

512
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,200
That sounds good to me.

513
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,600
Man, King Moody was also a man from Uncle Bonanza,

514
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,360
Bob Newhart Show, Chips,

515
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,800
Dragnet, Dismart, as Ronald McDonald.

516
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
There's a lot of product placement in those shows.

517
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,240
Okay, so here we go.

518
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,920
Okay, I just also wanted to let you know

519
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,320
that Ronald McDonald, King Moody,

520
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,040
Robert King Moody is his full name,

521
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,800
is the dad of William Moody,

522
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,560
better known as Paul Bearer.

523
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,680
Are you shitting me?

524
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,920
Get the shit out.

525
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,080
Are you fucking with me right now with this?

526
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,040
Star studded, star studded family.

527
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,520
The other day I bought some gum from Starbucks.

528
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
Once my coffee was gone,

529
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,320
I realized that I had left the pack of gum

530
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,160
back at Starbucks on the counter.

531
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
I didn't have a receipt,

532
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
and also it would be embarrassing

533
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,080
to go back just for a pack of gum.

534
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,480
I guess you didn't want gum that bad, huh?

535
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,320
Do you think it's okay for me

536
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,680
to just take one next time I'm there,

537
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
or would that be considered stealing?

538
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,520
And that's from Bad Breath because of forgotten gum.

539
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
This is one of those rare and wonderful circumstances

540
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,280
where stealing is better than the alternative.

541
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,440
We're just taking a thing is better than the alternative,

542
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,720
because the alternative is, hi,

543
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,200
I bought this last time, but I didn't get it,

544
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,040
so I'm gonna get it this time.

545
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,720
And then, I feel like you'll be immediately arrested for that.

546
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
If you steal and you get caught, you'll be arrested, right?

547
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,480
If you steal and you get caught, you'll be arrested, right?

548
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,360
Sort of Jean Valjean style,

549
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
like I need this gum for my family.

550
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,840
They breath, it stinks real bad.

551
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,360
They love xylitol.

552
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,480
Yeah, so I think you just gotta pocket this one.

553
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,280
And I think it's fine, because you paid last time.

554
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,400
And then if you get caught, you can explain the situation.

555
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,920
Morally, it's fine.

556
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,440
That will be a tough excuse to,

557
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,680
you won't get caught, you can't get caught.

558
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
Come on, really?

559
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,520
If you get caught, you deserve whatever you get.

560
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
It's an easy steal.

561
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
We're not as hardcore into stealing

562
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,800
as we were in earlier episodes.

563
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
We're all parents now,

564
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,080
and I don't think we can have the hard line on shoplifting,

565
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
which is pro, that we had.

566
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,840
Well, I got my bad bust,

567
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
and so I'm out of the lifting game.

568
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,960
Well, you got a bad bust?

569
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
I didn't know this.

570
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,760
Yeah, crate and barrel.

571
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
Yeah.

572
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
Crates or barrels?

573
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,280
Both.

574
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,440
I tried to shoplift a crate and a barrel at the same time.

575
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
Yeah, it was bad.

576
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
I tried to explain,

577
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
because they got me out of the door,

578
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,680
because I was carrying a big box made of wood,

579
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,880
and a big barrel made of wood,

580
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,840
and it was really heavy,

581
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,520
and so I was struggling and making a lot of noise.

582
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,880
A clamber, and I dropped the barrel,

583
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,960
and that made a lot of noise.

584
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,480
And then they got me at the door,

585
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,600
and they were like,

586
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,600
they said, actually, what the fuck do you think you're doing?

587
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,800
Which I don't think you're allowed to cuss,

588
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,600
and I did send a letter to the crate and barrel HQ,

589
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,880
try and get that person removed,

590
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,920
but I said I brought these here to get them serviced,

591
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,520
because I thought this was a crate and a barrel repair shop,

592
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,800
and I was turned away, and so I'm just taking them.

593
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,280
And they said, oh, go right ahead,

594
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,040
and then I walked out of the door,

595
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,560
and the barrel exploded.

596
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,640
It was full of C4, it was like a security measure,

597
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,680
so the barrel exploded.

598
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,560
And so that's how they got me.

599
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,080
Could you steal your pack of gum back one piece at a time?

600
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,120
Now I'm in.

601
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
Now you have my curiosity,

602
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,360
and now you have the rest of the quote from the movie.

603
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,000
Could you just slip a piece out of a packet,

604
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,440
and pop it in your mouth, and you get your gum?

605
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,800
And you didn't take a whole pack.

606
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,720
That's not even stealing, if you think about it.

607
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,000
One piece of gum.

608
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,880
Here's the thing, Justin,

609
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,040
you're gonna need a Rita Hayworth poster

610
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,800
to cover up the gum.

611
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,840
Yourself, your body.

612
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,960
To cover up your body and the gum,

613
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,800
and like a tiny gum pickaxe.

614
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,480
At Comic Con this year,

615
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm cosplaying as a Rita Hayworth poster.

616
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,520
I wear it, and then during one of the live shows,

617
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
you'll be like, Griffin's been quiet for a while,

618
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
and then you move the poster,

619
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,400
and I will have slipped out from behind the chair.

620
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
And Griffin's just swimming through two miles of shit.

621
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,560
Last time I went to Starbucks, I did the drive-through,

622
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,040
and on the, it was like a little metal shelf

623
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,960
for you to put your card on and stuff.

624
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,840
Outside the drive-through window, on the metal shelf,

625
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,880
there was a basket that had in it stuff like gum,

626
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
and the Rice Krispie Treats, and maybe a nice biscotti.

627
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,120
Would you assume that those were complimentary?

628
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
They were on a shelf outside.

629
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
They're not cooling a pie out there.

630
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I assumed they were complimentary.

631
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,440
Yeah, like when bookstores put the books outside

632
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
of the front door.

633
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,480
The ones they want you to steal, right, exactly.

634
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
I thought that was for stealing, and like I didn't try it,

635
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,480
but they confirmed for me that those were purchasable goods.

636
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,240
They're just trying to establish another point of sale there.

637
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,080
They're trying to establish a fucking bait car,

638
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,560
is what they're doing.

639
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,360
It's what it is, right?

640
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,080
Like Starbucks maybe has their head

641
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
on a pretty major swivel for theft.

642
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
I guess is what I'm saying,

643
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,200
is that's what gets him up in the morning,

644
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
is busting innocent people for stealing.

645
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,120
You could pretend you thought they were complimentary

646
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,000
if you get caught.

647
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,360
Oh God, that's so good.

648
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,720
You guys sell coffee.

649
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,600
I just thought this was part of the deal.

650
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,280
Oh, is this not for everyone?

651
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,680
So you just took a banana.

652
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,400
Well, yeah, you're fucking Starbucks.

653
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
Why do you have produce?

654
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,080
You tried to make $7 for a coffee.

655
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
And now we can now let's get into it,

656
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,120
because why are they charging so much

657
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,160
for this dang coffee at Starbucks?

658
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
It's a rich frame we've unearthed.

659
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,200
I can't believe we're the first ones to finally make it

660
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,920
to go through about how much Starbucks costs.

661
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,840
And what's the deal with their Christmas cups?

662
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,320
Yeah, go for it, Trav.

663
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,560
Not in my backyard.

664
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,920
Don't crack open the door to your skewed perspective

665
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,920
and then not throw that bad boy open

666
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,120
and let me look inside.

667
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,960
I might've used the wrong tone of voice

668
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
because I honestly was asking,

669
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,520
what is the deal with it?

670
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,880
I see people talking about it and I thought button issue.

671
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,080
What is it?

672
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,000
Yeah, if you go in there right now,

673
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
you can't find a single one.

674
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,920
Okay, cowards.

675
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
Yeah, war on Christmas, am I right?

676
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,440
The war on Christmas in July.

677
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,520
They're not satisfied by their one war.

678
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,760
They won a war on two fronts in two months.

679
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,120
What about summer Jesus?

680
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,600
You know what I mean?

681
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,360
When was summer Jesus born?

682
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,160
Do you think there would be a bigger conflict this Christmas

683
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,360
if their cups had said,

684
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
we fucking love Jesus,

685
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,240
the one true Lord and savior who came to earth

686
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,080
as a baby of virgin birth.

687
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,520
We're fucking crazy about him.

688
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,760
And if you don't believe him, you're gonna go to hell.

689
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
Check the cup, fuckers.

690
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,120
Where you saw the one pair of footprints on the beach.

691
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,240
That was summer Jesus.

692
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,080
That's where he hangs out.

693
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,120
He's always there getting beautiful tan,

694
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,960
learning how to boogie board to folks who need it.

695
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,280
Such a chill guy.

696
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,280
Should we go to the money zone

697
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,440
so we don't have to keep fucking stealing gum from Starbucks

698
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,920
and then maybe Travis will stop complaining about the prices?

699
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:11,760
Let's do it.

700
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,680
I would like to tell you about Squarespace.

701
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,840
Squarespace is an incredibly intuitive website design platform

702
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,560
that you don't need any special knowledge to use.

703
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,880
You don't need any kind of special training.

704
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,160
You can start today.

705
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,800
And I get like, this is not a joke,

706
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,640
no exaggeration, within the hour

707
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
you could have a website up and running.

708
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
I've done a bunch of websites on it already.

709
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,880
I actually just built one for a project

710
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,560
that me and some friends are working on here.

711
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Took me like 45 minutes.

712
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,120
And it's not just your basic GeoCities kind of shit

713
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,160
with dancing hamsters and under construction signs.

714
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,480
This is like a sleek professional website

715
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,640
that you can plug in merchandise

716
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,000
and links to shit and buttons and pictures and slideshows

717
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,360
and email and your own domain.

718
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,320
All of these things.

719
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,360
It's incredible.

720
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,640
If you want to see an example of this,

721
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
you can go to mcroyshows.com that we built on Squarespace.

722
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
I made griffomcroy.com

723
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,800
and I really liked how easy it was to use

724
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,840
and I set up a contact page that I did recently have to,

725
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,640
it's on timeout because I did start to get

726
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,320
basically daily emails.

727
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
I don't know if this is a coordinated attack

728
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,920
from people who just wanted to talk about VOR

729
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,880
and not so much talk about,

730
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
but just sort of like yell at me about,

731
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,240
just sort of yell it, yell the subject at me.

732
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,280
So that one is on timeout,

733
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
but they do let you put up a contact page

734
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,040
that will get VOR spammed.

735
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,080
And Squarespace provides award-winning 24-7 support.

736
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,800
They have a unique domain experience.

737
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,800

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,240
That's squarespace.com slash my brother.

742
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,080
I want to tell you all about Blue Apron

743
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,280
because I fucking love Blue Apron.

744
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
We've been using it for a little over a year now

745
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,320
and I learned how to cook.

746
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,240
I didn't know how to cook and I had Blue Apron

747
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,320
and now I know how to cook and I love cooking.

748
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,960
They send you for less than 10 bucks per person per meal,

749
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,720
they'll send you seasonal recipes

750
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,320
along with pre-portioned ingredients

751
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,080
that you can use to make delicious home-cooked meals.

752
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,360
I'm talking about stuff like seared chicken

753
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,160
and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers,

754
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,760
creamy shrimp rolls with quick pickles

755
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,800
and sweet potato wedges, fresh basil fettuccine pasta

756
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
with sweet corn and cubanelle pepper,

757
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,480
all kinds of amazing meals.

758
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,920
I seriously love this thing and you will too.

759
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,360
If you check out this week's menu

760
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
and get your first three meals for free with free shipping,

761
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,160
just go to blueapron.com slash my brother.

762
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,120
One more time, that's blueapron.com slash my brother.

763
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,640
We got some Jumbotron messages here

764
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,400
I'd love to share with y'all.

765
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,600
The first is from one of the guys

766
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,920
who brought you the True Tiles Kickstarter

767
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:06,240
comes heroeshored.com, that's H-E-R-O-S-H-O-A-R-D.com.

768
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,240
Head to Heroes Horde to buy beautifully rendered 3D tiles,

769
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,360
terrain and scenery for your tabletop or role-playing game.

770
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,200
Built by a lifelong D&D player,

771
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,840
these files let you pair old school gaming

772
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,120
with new school tech.

773
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,680
Buy and print the files you need

774
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,800
I bet it's supposed to be tiles.

775
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,320
I think it's probably supposed to be tiles.

776
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,440
What did I say?

777
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,080
Files.

778
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,920
It does say files in the copy,

779
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:30,240
but I think it's supposed to be tiles.

780
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,560
Well, you could understand my confusion.

781
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,120
But buy and print-

782
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,200
No, Justin, it says files.

783
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,240
Don't get me wrong.

784
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,840
I'm not correcting you.

785
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,280
I'm correcting the copy.

786
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,320
I think it's tiles.

787
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Buy and print the tiles or files,

788
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,080
whatever you want.

789
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
You can arrange them any way you like

790
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,640
to astound and confound your players.

791
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,720
Build the layout of your dreams with HeroesHorde.com

792
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,760
Can you spell it one more time?

793
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,480
Because both of those words could be spelled different.

794
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,040
H-E-R-O-S-H-O-A-R-D.com

795
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,480
That was beautiful.

796
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,440
That jingle was free.

797
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
Don't don't add us about jingles anymore.

798
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,400
Jingles are back.

799
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,880
Here's another personal message.

800
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,640
This one's for Cory Daniels.

801
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,560
And it's from Jacob Rich, who says

802
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,600
Readin' Garfield at the Elvis Warlock voice file.

803
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,280
We're not dancin' monkeys.

804
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,760
Are we going to fuck or what?

805
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,800
Griffin is.

806
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,360
Griffin is.

807
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I'm really glad Griffin used the voice

808
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,960
because if he hadn't that would have been just upsetting

809
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,440
to just hear out of Griffin in like a flat voice.

810
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,120
Yeah, let me give you an alternate take.

811
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,840
I think the first take was good

812
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,120
and I think that's the one we're gonna go with.

813
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,880
But are we gonna fuck or what?

814
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,760
Thanks for being an awesome friend and mentor

815
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,880
and getting me a job.

816
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,400
Love, your buddy Jacob.

817
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,480
Or perhaps love your buddy Jacob.

818
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:43,920
Love him.

819
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,840
Love him, damn it.

820
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,960
We have one more Jumbotron.

821
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
This is for Kristen.

822
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,440
This is from Steve.

823
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,360
Happy New Year or Post-Valentine's Day day

824
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,520
or World Rat Day or Canada Day or Birthday

825
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,120
or Thanksgiving or Candle Nights

826
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,800
depending on when the McElroys read this.

827
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,760
Love you bunches.

828
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,400
I love that 94% of this message was spent dragging us

829
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,000
for how bad we are.

830
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,920
Not a good use of your hundred dollars.

831
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,200
I think it's a pretty good use

832
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,080
because I feel very small right now

833
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,360
and you did that.

834
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,600
Following the news is hard and it sucks.

835
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
How do you know which stories are important?

836
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,040
Which sources do you trust

837
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,000
in this post-truth world of reactionary journalism?

838
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,880
I'm Brent Black

839
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,240
and I'm Travis McElroy

840
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,640
and we host a podcast called Trends Like These.

841
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,400
We cover trending news stories.

842
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,880
We debunk misleading clickbait headlines

843
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,760
and we always try to throw in a little bit of good news

844
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,360
in our quest for truth.

845
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,640
So join us every week on MaximumFun.org

846
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,400
or wherever podcasts are found.

847
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,160
I mean, here's one.

848
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:50,880
Here's a Yahoo!

849
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,240
And this one is sent in by Kevin Budnick.

850
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,880
Thank you, Kevin.

851
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,040
It's Yahoo Answers user David who asks,

852
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,120
when was it proven that you can't breathe in space?

853
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,520
No additional details.

854
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,660
Huh.

855
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,200
I like this idea.

856
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,280
Buzz and Lance hop off the spaceship,

857
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,600
step on that man.

858
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,080
And Buzz just like immediately is like,

859
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,640
crack and like takes off the helmet

860
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,920
and he's like, all right, let's look.

861
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,120
Oh, no.

862
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,560
Oh shoot.

863
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,400
Hey, he puts it back on real quick.

864
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,560
He's like, Lance, don't, it's weird.

865
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,440
You know how normally you can?

866
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,320
Well, you can't.

867
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,440
I couldn't.

868
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
I put, I popped it off because,

869
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,560
and this is going to be,

870
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,480
I just realized how uncomfortable

871
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,240
this is going to be the whole time, Lance.

872
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,360
Griffin, are you saying Lance Armstrong?

873
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,320
I am, aren't I?

874
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,840
That's not him.

875
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,520
That's not it at all, it's Neil.

876
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,560
It was Neil who did it.

877
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
But Lance Armstrong did say he did.

878
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,360
Oh, me?

879
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Fo sho.

880
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
I got up there, loved it.

881
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
Crazy about it.

882
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,320
Took my helmet off.

883
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,280
I was fine.

884
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,000
I was fine.

885
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,480
I don't know why all these other guys can't.

886
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,240
And that's how they got him.

887
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,280
I biked up to the moon.

888
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,720
People were like, yeah, yep, yep, yep.

889
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,600
Makes sense, makes sense.

890
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,320
He's like, got up there, popped off my stupid helmet

891
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,200
because I wanted to really relax and unwind up there

892
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
and have just like a lunar chill sesh.

893
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
And then I breathed just normal.

894
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,840
And they're like, wait a minute, Lance.

895
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,120
Jacuzzi.

896
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,360
Jacuzzi, I can't believe I fucked that up.

897
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,080
You did prove it though because everybody,

898
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,920
this is a fun fiction that I've just spun.

899
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,760
And it's also a fun fiction to say that Neil Armstrong did it.

900
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,320
But my question for all these space types

901
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,440
who've got their head in the clouds is,

902
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,520
has anybody ever really tried it?

903
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Has anybody ever really tried it?

904
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
And how do we know that it didn't?

905
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,400
Yeah, maybe this is like a flat Earth situation.

906
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
Well, no, God, please, God, don't equate it to that.

907
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,680
Please don't put that on me.

908
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,280
Where everyone's just like, the Earth is flat.

909
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,160
The Earth is flat.

910
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,680
But until you test it is what I mean.

911
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,200
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

912
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
Because we just assumed, we just assumed.

913
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,640
We looked up at space and we said,

914
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,160
that seems hard to breathe in.

915
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,920
And we all nodded at each other.

916
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,880
And that was it.

917
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,920
That's as far as we went.

918
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,640
You're like, who's ever stood in a vacuum?

919
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,680
Because here's the thing.

920
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,760
Maybe you got in a vacuum for a second and you're like,

921
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,400
hard to breathe.

922
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,040
But what you didn't count on was rapid evolution.

923
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,560
Like when you pick up a fish and you throw it on land

924
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,280
and suddenly starts walking around because it has to.

925
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,400
It's got to.

926
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,560
And that's what survival of the fittest is.

927
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
Is like, you either fit or you don't.

928
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,600
You know what I mean?

929
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,720
Like you gotta get fit.

930
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,480
Like Slim Goodbody's head.

931
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,080
You gotta get fit or die.

932
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,720
During all of his talks about evolution.

933
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,000
Yeah, rapid evolution, please.

934
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,160
Rapid evolution, X-Men style evolution.

935
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,320
I wanna get Elon on the horn and just say,

936
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
send me up, crack my visor for a minute

937
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,760
and see because there's a lot of scientific method

938
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,960
says you generate a theory and then there's a control group

939
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,680
and that can be one of y'all.

940
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,040
And you can keep your fucking helmet on

941
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,400
because I guess you don't like to live on the edge.

942
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,720
And also we're trying to prove a scientific hypothesis.

943
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,280
And then I'll crack it for a second.

944
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,480
Try to get a few good deep lungfuls.

945
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,560
And maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't.

946
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm just saying if we could all breathe up there,

947
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,080
I think we'd be up there already.

948
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,760
Well, I mean, look at this way.

949
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,400
Like I can't breathe underwater, but fish can.

950
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,680
You know what I mean?

951
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,080
So like the idea of like the way I breathe

952
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
is the way everything breathes.

953
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,560
Stinks, it's a shitty way of thinking.

954
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,120
Yeah, right?

955
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Like I'm not going to limit,

956
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,920
I'm not gonna be that oxygen focused.

957
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,880
I'm gonna say that maybe there's other ways

958
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,080
of breathing out there.

959
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,000
And like maybe the way I breathe is right for me,

960
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,360
but it might not be right for some, you know?

961
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,840
I say make a plan and God laughs.

962
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,000
Maybe you're planning that you will be able to,

963
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,800
maybe you won't.

964
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,080
Maybe you should just go to space and see how it goes.

965
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,960
When God closes the door, he opens a window

966
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,360
and you are sucked out into that infinite inky vacuum.

967
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,160
It's like my tattoo says, just breathe, you know?

968
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,400
Just.

969
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.

970
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,240
And so if I say to you, go up to space, check it out.

971
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,920
You might like it.

972
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,720
That's basically God speaking through me,

973
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,800
via Kurt Vonnegut into you, vis-a-vis dancing lessons.

974
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,200
Yeah.

975
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
From God through me.

976
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,840
So maybe you should just go up there

977
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,920
and fucking see how it goes, you know?

978
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,560
Yeah, explore like my other tattoo says.

979
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,160
Travis has got a lot of words on him.

980
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,520
I've got memento disease.

981
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,480
You know, the Lord works in mysterious ways

982
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
but most of the time through Justin.

983
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,560
How about another question?

984
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,400
Justin is God being manifest on earth.

985
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,680
It's weird about that.

986
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,760
It's weird but it's true and real.

987
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
I have just started regularly going to the gym

988
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,040
and I have a problem.

989
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,760
I don't really know when to leave.

990
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,840
Once I've done a bit of biking

991
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,760
and push some heavy things up and down,

992
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,640
I inevitably end up looking like a lost scared child

993
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,800
who doesn't know whether to stay and lift more

994
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,240
or just walk out.

995
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,840
I feel the buff eyes of my peers judging my indecision.

996
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,640
How can I know when it's time to pack my gym bag

997
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,280
and run away?

998
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,920
And that's from Indecisive in LA.

999
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,360
And I have a pretty easy answer for this one.

1000
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,760
If you can lift more, you must.

1001
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,000
When you're at the gym, you have to leave.

1002
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Take it from me.

1003
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,720
When you're at the gym,

1004
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,120
you have to leave it all on the tarp.

1005
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:58,880
That they presumably spread out for the sweat.

1006
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,160
Oh, they got to, right?

1007
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,200
I've never been to one,

1008
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,520
but please tell me there's a tarp.

1009
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,720
Sometimes it's just old newspaper.

1010
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,680
What else do they do with all their humors

1011
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,440
that fall out during exertion?

1012
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,080
Oh man, I hope there's a tarp.

1013
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,640
I hear a lot about leg day.

1014
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,160
So is it leg day?

1015
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,280
Did you do that?

1016
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,440
Then you should be okay.

1017
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,360
If you didn't do it for leg day,

1018
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,680
get back in there and leg day.

1019
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,680
Like, do you even lift like my other tattoo says?

1020
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,000
Jesus, Trev, you got to stop with these.

1021
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,880
You got to stop getting these.

1022
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,920
And I know I tried to talk you out of that 60 point, Pika,

1023
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,960
but you just had to go for it.

1024
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,760
Right across my butt cheeks.

1025
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,760
What you're suggesting, Justin,

1026
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
is that you just go until you're a stain on the bench.

1027
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,640
Well, that's what I think, Griffin.

1028
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,120
A true gym rat will tell you that you have to stay in the gym

1029
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,360
until you're asked to leave by the gym staff.

1030
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,600
Not because you're being disruptive or a problem,

1031
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,280
but because they're worried about you.

1032
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,240
It's like, hey, you've been here for three days.

1033
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
You need to go home, see your family.

1034
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,280
Maybe you can loudly announce as you're leaving,

1035
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,960
like, they're out of weights.

1036
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,560
I used them all up.

1037
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,680
Bye, everybody.

1038
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,720
I lifted them and lifted them directly into my mouth.

1039
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,920
I gained their strength.

1040
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,720
That's 20 more pounds of punching power.

1041
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,400
This is what you do.

1042
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,520
This is the thing that people do sometimes

1043
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,880
where they're like lifting and they're grunting

1044
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,960
and then they just like drop the weights on the ground.

1045
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,040
And this is very disruptive because it's like,

1046
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,080
there are people usually a floor underneath you

1047
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,120
just trying to run on the treadmill and watch Judge Judy

1048
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,720
and like you drop the weights

1049
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,880
and make them feel like the world is collapsing.

1050
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,840
It's not good.

1051
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,240
So instead, gently set the weights down

1052
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,920
and then just stand up straight,

1053
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,960
look surprised like you just realized this fact

1054
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,800
and yell, I'm done and walk out the front door.

1055
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,840
That's pretty good.

1056
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,800
You should probably also loudly announce an excuse

1057
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
that will placate everyone in the gym

1058
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,080
that is monitoring your movements.

1059
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,440
So as you're leaving,

1060
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800
you scoop your bag over your shoulder,

1061
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,760
say, hey guys, sorry, my Nana needs a ride.

1062
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,440
And then like put on your sunglasses

1063
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,120
and look over your other shoulder and be like,

1064
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,440
Nana problems, you wouldn't understand.

1065
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,640
And then go out the door.

1066
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,080
You put on your sunglasses,

1067
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,440
then you put on your Nana

1068
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,480
after you put on your sunglasses, runner home Yoda style.

1069
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,040
And that's also gonna get you sick gains.

1070
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
That's gonna get you sick Nana gains.

1071
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,040
And that's important.

1072
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,480
You gotta get them everywhere you can.

1073
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,880
What's the gym, I think it's Planet Fitness

1074
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,200
where if you do grunt and drop the weights,

1075
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,720
they actually like kick you out

1076
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,760
cause they try to create like a jerk free environment.

1077
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,600
I think it's Planet Hollywood.

1078
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,280
I think it's Planet Hollywood.

1079
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,240
You go and you crash,

1080
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,960
you destroy some Schwarzenegger onion rings

1081
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,240
and then you start pumping.

1082
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,160
No, I think it's Planet Fitness

1083
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,680
and that makes me never wanna go into a Planet Fitness

1084
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,040
because I imagine if I go

1085
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,640
and I do try to lift one of those big wonderful bars,

1086
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,840
there would be a considerable amount of grunting

1087
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,040
and probably some dropping involved.

1088
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:16,720
And then the whole exercise will be cut off

1089
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,440
before it really gets going.

1090
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,680
Don't worry about it.

1091
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:22,960
They have a chart that's like,

1092
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,120
is the grunt like, oh, I did it.

1093
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,400
Or is it like, oh, you fall down.

1094
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,000
And if it's that second one,

1095
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,240
you're good unless you've been injured

1096
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,400
and then they will have several burly people carry you out.

1097
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,040
I just imagine there's a lot of people doing

1098
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,000
spinning and yoga laddies and stuff like that.

1099
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,080
How I would, it would be very distracting for them.

1100
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,080
The sort of sounds and visuals

1101
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,160
that I would produce with one of those big wonderful bars.

1102
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,520
Just a lot of like.

1103
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
This is an interesting fact that I learned.

1104
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,800
I read it on, today I learned on Reddit.

1105
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
No one's ever died in a Planet Fitness

1106
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,160
because if you start to die,

1107
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,880
they just carry you outside past the parking lot

1108
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,240
and set you down.

1109
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,360
Oh.

1110
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah, so like in all the.

1111
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,600
Wait, no, I'm thinking of Disney.

1112
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,920
Sorry, sorry, run that back.

1113
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,200
I mean, for me,

1114
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,960
the gym is the most wonderful place on earth.

1115
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,460
So.

1116
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,600
I call it my magic kingdom.

1117
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,720
Well, thank God.

1118
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,180
What?

1119
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,120
Huh? Horses.

1120
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,560
I want to munch.

1121
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,060
Squad.

1122
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,680
I want to munch.

1123
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Squad.

1124
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,720
Thank you to Jack for submitting this one.

1125
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,200
This is big news, limited time.

1126
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,600
Gotta get in there and get it.

1127
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,040
Canada's birthday, 150th.

1128
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,600
You're going to eat Canada?

1129
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,320
No.

1130
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,080
The sesquicentennial was on July 1st

1131
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,800
and he was celebrating while Canadian original Tim Hortons.

1132
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,640
Now, what are they doing in Canada?

1133
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,960
I don't know, but they're forcing Canadian culture

1134
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,080
down the gull, the wading mall of America

1135
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,920
with some special items.

1136
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,160
Now, one is maple Timbits.

1137
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,800
They're bite-sized maple flavored donut holes.

1138
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,360
So you can get some of those if you want.

1139
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:28,240
Hey, no, Tim.

1140
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:34,320
Tim, you can't sell a menu item called Tim's bits, Tim.

1141
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,880
Timothy, you can't sell your bits, Tim.

1142
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,960
All right, I want donut holes just empty space.

1143
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:46,080
Come on down to Griffin's Pizza Zone and eat Griffin's nuts.

1144
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,040
All right, Griffin, you can't though.

1145
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,680
If you're sure.

1146
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,360
Why do they call them donut fillers, right?

1147
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,040
Because the hole's already in the donut.

1148
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,040
I'm going to take this one.

1149
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,320
I'm going to edit it right in after your Starbucks price discovery.

1150
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,280
If I dug dirt out of a hole, I wouldn't point at the dirt

1151
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,600
and say that's the dirt, that's the hole.

1152
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,680
No, the hole is the empty spot I made.

1153
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,360
Can I just get to my fucking thing?

1154
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:09,920
Yeah.

1155
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,000
The maple bacon ice cap.

1156
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,920
That's a frozen coffee drink

1157
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,480
topped with whipped cream, maple flakes, and bacon.

1158
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,000
You with me so far?

1159
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,600
Because we're about to take-

1160
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,720
Don't make me complicit in this.

1161
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,640
I don't want bacon floating around in my shit

1162
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,480
like boba bubbles or whatever.

1163
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,480
We're about to take a hard pivot here

1164
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,000
as we stop on by the poutine donut.

1165
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,800
This is a honey dipped donut with potato wedges,

1166
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,800
gravy, and cheese curds for $1.49.

1167
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,480
So you know how poutine's a thing?

1168
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,040
Yeah.

1169
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,560
And you know how donuts are a thing?

1170
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,240
And you know how Tim Hortons thinks America

1171
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,560
is a piece of shit, apparently?

1172
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,600
They're going to just put the poutine on the donut

1173
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,880
and then you pay them $1.49 and then you eat it.

1174
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,480
And I bet it's dope.

1175
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,800
It's only available for the month of July.

1176
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,160
And what?

1177
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,840
Who is perpetrating this?

1178
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,040
Well, let's check in with Philippe Atied,

1179
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,080
the EVP of Tim Hortons US.

1180
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,480
At Tim Hortons restaurants,

1181
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,400
we're proud of our Canadian heritage.

1182
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,160
That's why you're putting it on a donut?

1183
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,280
Sorry, that's me.

1184
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,200
And we want to share a piece of that in the United States.

1185
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,280
Our new Canadian inspired treats

1186
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,680
are a great way for Americans to get in

1187
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,360
on the 150th celebration of their friendly neighbor next door.

1188
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:32,560
Do you really think that that's an acceptable way

1189
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,280
of observing the sesquicentennial,

1190
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,160
the sesquicentennial of, one of those is right,

1191
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,600
Griffin just edited around it,

1192
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,880
of Canada is eating a gravy and French fry covered donut?

1193
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,440
Do you think that if you see a Canadian later,

1194
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,640
you're like, hey, I got in on that celebration with you.

1195
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,960
I ate the donut with gravy.

1196
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,560
Here's the sad thing I know though, Justin,

1197
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,960
is like we discuss it and in theory it's very troubling,

1198
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,880
but there will be people, many people,

1199
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,760
myself perhaps included that would see it

1200
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,200
and kind of sigh and be like,

1201
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,360
well, I guess I have to eat that now.

1202
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,960
Yeah, it's that fucking double down response of just like,

1203
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,040
ah, fuck, I mean, I have to.

1204
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,800
Okay, fine, fuck.

1205
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,800
I have a logistical question.

1206
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,000
How do they get the potato wedges on a donut?

1207
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,680
Because right now I'm sort of envisioning

1208
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,920
sort of like the crown of the witch king of Angmar situation

1209
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,040
of them just like pointing up like dangerous spires.

1210
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,600
I am looking at a picture of it on a plate,

1211
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,040
which is hysterical.

1212
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,480
It will never be on a plate.

1213
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,040
You may as well hand it to me over the counter into my mouth.

1214
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,760
And it looks like it's just been dolloped on top

1215
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,920
with all the like forethought

1216
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,560
that the creation of this dish would imply.

1217
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,880
I mean, it's a nightmare.

1218
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,040
Also, I should mention in the press release on this,

1219
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,400
sorry, this is a news story from the street.

1220
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,360
It says, poutine originated in Quebec

1221
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,760
and is typically French fries with cheese curds

1222
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,720
and gravy on top.

1223
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,880
Tim Hortons appears to be taking a leap of faith

1224
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,560
by putting this 1950s dish on a donut.

1225
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,640
Is it a leap of faith or is it pure unmitigated spite

1226
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,960
for their garbage neighbors to the south?

1227
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,800
Because that's what it feels like to me.

1228
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,160
I feel like I've lost some measure of faith

1229
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,120
after finding out that this is extant.

1230
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,680
I would fuck it up though, damn it.

1231
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,480
Yeah, yeah.

1232
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,640
Damn it, damn these, damn it.

1233
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,000
You win again, Canada.

1234
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,560
Why do I love food pranks so much?

1235
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,320
Why do I always fall for them?

1236
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:37,440
Always fall for the stunt.

1237
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,680
So folks, that is our show for this week.

1238
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,040
We hope you've enjoyed yourselves.

1239
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,560
Wanted to let you know, well,

1240
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,760
we mentioned we're gonna be at Comic-Con,

1241
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,280
so that's cool.

1242
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,800
We hope to see you there.

1243
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,560
If you're coming out to those shows,

1244
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,480
specifically the MBMBAM show on Saturday,

1245
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,200
please email us your questions,

1246
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,120
mbnbam at maximumfund.org

1247
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,240
and put San Diego question in the subject line

1248
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,200
so we know where you're coming from.

1249
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,560
I need lots of yahoos.

1250
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,840
Also, if you can please send me some yahoos,

1251
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,960
I would really appreciate it.

1252
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,440
Thank you.

1253
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,000
Thank you.

1254
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,480
Thank you.

1255
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,880
We also just put up pre-orders

1256
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,320
for our new graphic novel,

1257
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:24,320
The Adventure Zone,

1258
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,560
based on the first arc of our other podcast,

1259
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,440
The Adventure Zone.

1260
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,280
The Adventure Zone here,

1261
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,160
There'll Be Gerblins,

1262
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,840
is available for pre-order right now

1263
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,480
and we would love it if you would help us out

1264
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,600
by getting over there and pre-ordering that.

1265
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,400
You can go to theadventurezonecomic.com

1266
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,080
and pre-order it there

1267
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,640
and that would just be the best.

1268
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,400
And thank you to everybody who already pre-ordered it.

1269
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,320
We were the fucking number one book on Amazon,

1270
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,560
which is the most wild fact

1271
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,640
that has ever existed in the world.

1272
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,360
I don't know that we ever really talk about Adventure Zone

1273
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,320
that much on this show,

1274
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,160
but we're in the finale now.

1275
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,320
I think there's probably like two or three episodes left

1276
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,520
and we're gonna be wrapping up.

1277
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,200
If you haven't listened to it,

1278
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,160
I don't know how much of a Venn diagram

1279
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,200
I'm talking to right now,

1280
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,000
people who listen to this show

1281
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,600
and have not listened to Adventure Zone.

1282
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,240
I'm so proud of what it has turned into

1283
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,680
and I would encourage everybody to go and give it a shot.

1284
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,080
It starts out with us just kind of playing D&D

1285
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,040
and not understanding the rules

1286
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,920
and it's turned into something that is the creative endeavor

1287
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,200
that I am most proud of,

1288
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,720
of anything in my whole life.

1289
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,680
So please go give it a listen if you haven't tried it out.

1290
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,160
You got like a month to catch up before the finale

1291
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,080
and it's probably gonna be popping off on a major way.

1292
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:45,680
So don't let yourself be spoiled.

1293
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,240
Just get over and listen to all of the Adventure Zone.

1294
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,840
There's an episode 1.5

1295
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,320
that's like a shorter version of our pilot

1296
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,600
that Travis put together

1297
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,120
that is like an easier way to onboard.

1298
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,840
And then around like episode five or six

1299
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,800
is where it sort of takes off into its own thing.

1300
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,360
So yeah, go give it a listen.

1301
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,280
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1302
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,160
for the use of our theme song,

1303
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,320
It's a Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1304
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Go check that one out.

1305
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,080

that we do at Polygon are right there.

1315
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,600
Great, and we have one more question

1316
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,920
to sort of ruminate on in the coming week.

1317
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,680
Griffin, if you would be so kind.

1318
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:38,320
Yeah, sure.

1319
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,600
This one's sent by Brooks Oglesby.

1322
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,640
Heather Helm asks,

1323
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,200
did Nostradamus really write something

1324
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,600
about Gangnam Style getting a billion hits?

1325
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1326
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,440

This has been My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1329
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:11,360
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1330
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:41,360
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.
