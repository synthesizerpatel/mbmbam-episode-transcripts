1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,160
Welcome, my brother, my brother and me. This week, we're all about the supermoon.

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,160
What's up? It's like a moon and a half. Like, I got used to a certain level of, uh, I became accustomed

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,040
to a certain level of moon, but now, like, the standard, the, the, it's, it's, uh, it changed

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,680
the paradigm for moon, for moon paradigms. For me, personally, it was like that one scene from Bruce

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,080
Almighty where he pulls the moon down and then he, like, starts kissing on Jennifer Aniston.

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
Griffin, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I just want you to know I've been meaning to say something

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,800
for a while. I'm starting to worry about the amount of Bruce Almighty references you make.

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,480
Like, it's starting to be, like, like a constant stream of, like, Bruce Almighty.

13
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,160
I have to, I have to relate this Bruce Almighty story to you guys. When the supermoon happened,

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,720
my bride, my wife, looked at it and Sidney said, that looks like, uh, uh, that reminds me of that

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
scene in Bruce Almighty, and I told her I hadn't seen it, and she proceeded to, over the next seven

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,320
minutes, relate the entire plot of Bruce Almighty to me. I never egged her on. I never said, uh-huh,

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,040
do tell, tell me more, like, the whole plot, and then at the end, I said, well, that was everything

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,160
that happens in Bruce Almighty, I guess. I'll tell you, I'll tell you what's so surprising to

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,440
me about that story, Justin. Tell me. I'm surprised, not that your wife went through

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
the pains to tell you what happens, but that it took her seven whole minutes. I know. Well,

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,240
there's a lot of shit. He gets god powers from, from Morgan Freeman, and he fucks up with him,

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,160
and then he gives him back, and he learns lessons. Yeah, no, you're ignoring the lessons, though.

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,040
This, she went into some of the specific lessons that he picks up along the way, and then she said,

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
and now we're, and at the end, she said, well, now I guess we're all ready to see

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
Evan Almighty, which I don't plan on doing that, either. This is My Brother, My Brother,

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,480
Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I am, uh, the eldest McElroy, Justin. And I am Travis.

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,640
And, and I am, I, and I, Griffin. I wanted to, I wanted to sound like a knight. We take your,

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,640
uh, we take your questions, and we turn them into wisdom. Let's do it. My life sucks.

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
Oh. Here are a few examples why I feel that way. I'm unmotivated. I work at Target, and I never

30
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,920
have any money. I would like to go to school and get my education papers so that I can do more of

31
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,520
the things I want to do in my life. Problem being that I've been to school for a year and dropped

32
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,600
out both semesters in a row because of frequent gravity bong usage. My depression drove me to move

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,320
across the country, but I'm even more confused. What should I change so I can quit this wretched

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:23,200
job? Kyle. Kyle? Kyle, you just gotta step it back. You gotta walk. You know, you know that part,

35
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,160
footprints, where it's like, where there's a single pair, that's where I carried you?

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,440
If you look at your footprints, the parts where they kind of go astray and wander into the ocean

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,720
are where you set a gravity bong down. And then there's a Kyle-shaped indent in the ground,

38
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,440
that's where you fell down. And just took a nap for a while. Just took a nap for a while,

39
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,880
then you wandered into Target, the Target ocean. All of these things, unmotivated, that you just,

40
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,480
you know, you can control that. You work at Target, you can control that. You never have

41
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,600
any money, you can control that. Like, all of these things are within your reach.

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:03,600
There seems to be one keystone in place. It's this heavy gravity bong that he's using for doobers.

43
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,200
Do you guys know what a gravity bong is? Can someone explain that to me?

44
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,400
Sure. You jump off a building, and as you're falling, it's the most extreme kind of bonging

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,360
you can do.

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,160
I mean, I don't know what it means, but it seems like every bong is a gravity bong, right?

47
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,960
There's an anti-gravity bong.

48
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,520
No, there's like a-

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,880
See, that would be fucking rad.

50
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:34,240
It's like a, it's like a, you put a bottle of marijuana in a bucket, I think, and then

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,040
as the smoke goes up, there's a change of air pressure, and the bottle floats with the weed in

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
it. I don't know. I'm not a, I don't, I don't do this.

53
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,720
Is this real? Are you making this up?

54
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,160
Let me, I'm gonna throw you an answer that I think maybe, if you add two letters to an important

55
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,400
word in this question, you can change it. Maybe instead of frequent gravity bong, infrequent

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,760
gravity bong usage, I have an occasional, an irregular schedule of gravity bong usage.

57
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,640
You can still hit the graph every now and then, but not, not Monday through Friday,

58
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,880
and then twice on Saturdays, but every other Sunday.

59
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Just pretend, just say like, hey, did I do my homework? Well, it's time to gravity bong.

60
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,720
So that's it. You set up a reward system. Like, I just ran two miles, time to grav bong,

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,280
and then you grav bong, and then it probably cancels out, whatever.

62
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,680
But whatever you do, don't reward yourself before you do something like,

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
you know, I think I've decided to go for a two mile run.

64
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm so proud of myself. I'm going to hit this gravity bong.

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm going to have my dessert first.

66
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,120
Don't do that.

67
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,160
It's like sneaking a, sneaking a present on Christmas Eve, except,

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440
except you get high, I guess. You get high and you don't do anything, and then you work at Target.

69
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,480
Nothing wrong with working at Target, by the way. It's, I think it's the,

70
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,720
the most high class of all, you know, mega retailers.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,280
I think so, definitely. I met a wonderful girl.

72
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,200
They got Isaac Mizrahi stuff.

73
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, it's really nice. Some Todd, uh, what's that guy, Todd?

74
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,000
Oldum, Todd Oldum.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,400
Todd, Todd Oldum gear. I met a really wonderful girl with lots of wonderful

76
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,800
qualities and similar interests to my own, but there is a catch.

77
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
She's about seven years younger than me. I'm just out of college. We're both of legal age,

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,040
but I am still worried about the social implications of dating someone who's a good deal younger.

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,720
I don't want everyone to think I'm some creeper.

80
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,360
Would pursuing such a relationship be, uh,

81
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
condemnable or commendable? Scared of disapproving looks.

82
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,360
I'm trying to, this is like one of those brain teasers.

83
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,960
There's like, there are three brothers and one is, you know, Joey's older than Todd,

84
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,920
but younger than Roger. I'm trying to figure out what these ages are.

85
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,480
Let's say like somewhere between, if she's still in college,

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,040
it's gotta be between 18 and 25 or 22 and 29.

87
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,200
Either way, bro, you're not fresh out of college.

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,640
The freshness, the shine has come off that apple officially.

89
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,720
He might be just out of college,

90
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,200
but it might have taken him a little longer than it would for a regular Joe.

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
Maybe he's a doctor.

92
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,360
Maybe he's a doctor.

93
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,920
And if you're a doctor, like this is the expected behavior here.

94
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,800
Or maybe he's following the Kyle path through college.

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:18,960
Yeah.

96
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
Take that Kyle.

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,520
Kyle, you were taking a graphong hit while we said that and you choked on it.

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
You choked on your graphong smoke, Kyle.

99
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,280
So I, if you, if you take the existence of the universe as long as a football field,

100
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,920
the existence of humanity would be the width of one blade of grass at the very end of the end zone.

101
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,840
So when you think of it that way, seven years is scientifically speaking, nothing.

102
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,520
When you put it that way, I want to go

103
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,160
fuck everything that moves and jump off of a bridge because it doesn't matter.

104
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,160
Don't think of it that way.

105
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,320
Whatever you do, don't think of it that way.

106
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,400
Your life is meaningless.

107
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,600
Whatever you do is just a breath in the wind.

108
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,880
It is, you know what, in the great cosmic sense, maybe.

109
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,160
So if you are happy, if she makes you happy, go for it.

110
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,240
What's the point of us giving advice anymore if we're just saying

111
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
that we're blades of grass on a football field?

112
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,680
Life is empty of consequence.

113
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,400
Kyle, buy an extra gravity bong and do it twice as much, I guess.

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,080
Kyle, sell us your gravity bong.

115
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,160
I would say that the difference isn't the age and it's not even the maturity.

116
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,000
It's just like life experience.

117
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,760
And so I believe that the person that someone is when they're like 18

118
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,320
is a completely different person most of the time than they are by the time they're like 23.

119
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah, but like if you're talking action items,

120
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
was he supposed to dump her because she might suck in a few?

121
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,920
No, I'm just saying like that is why I think people disapprove of it.

122
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,600
I don't think it's inherently the age.

123
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
I think it's like you're taking advantage of someone inexperienced.

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,920
So like, you know, eff it.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,480
Here's the thing.

126
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,040
Here's the thing.

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah, right now, like seven years probably seems a pretty wide gap.

128
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,600
When you're 80 and she's 73, still no one wants to see you kiss.

129
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,760
I mean, that's all there is to it.

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm going to be honest.

131
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,320
I never want to see anybody kiss.

132
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,000
Really?

133
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah, like maybe in a movie or like at a wedding or there are a few acceptable occasions.

134
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,640
I was at a concert this past weekend at South Pass Southwest.

135
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,960
Yeah, and there was this couple standing in front of me like every like no joke,

136
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,040
45 seconds to a minute and a half.

137
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
They would turn to each other and just like kiss deep and hard.

138
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,480
And that's no good.

139
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,720
Nobody wants to see that.

140
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,200
So I guess the advice there is date her, but don't let anybody know about it.

141
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,720
Just keep it like a secret.

142
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Keep it like a deep secret.

143
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
Griffin.

144
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,600
Yeah, I got you.

145
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,640
You know what I need, Boo.

146
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,920
This one was sent in by Matthew Oden.

147
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,960
Thank you, Matthew Oden.

It's written by Yahoo Answers user Starhawk Mystery.

149
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Good.

150
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,400
Good start.

151
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,960
Go on.

152
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,400
That's an old family name.

153
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
Who asks this question is short, so don't blink or you'll miss it.

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,640
Okay.

155
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,040
How strong is a girl's bond with her horse?

156
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
Like she's like empirically like you want to put a number on it.

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,400
So you want to talk about like an dynamic force.

158
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
Can it take before it snaps?

159
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,440
Yeah.

160
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,120
And in Newton's, please.

161
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,920
Yeah.

162
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
What kind of gravitational pull is that horse putting out?

163
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,240
If I were to put that horse in a gravity bong, what kind of water displacement would there

164
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,400
be?

165
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,080
Eureka.

166
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
I've discovered.

167
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,440
I put a horse in my gravity bong.

168
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,280
I'm really, really high now, but I-

169
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,600
You put your gravity bong on my horse.

170
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,760
You put your horse in my gravity bong.

171
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
Too great taste to get this horse fucked up as shit.

172
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,280
My bond is pretty good with you, but if I could put my mouth on your snoot and suck

173
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,440
pot out of it, I would pretty much.

174
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,400
It would be like super strong, like really, really strong.

175
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,040
I don't know that there's a bond stronger than that between a girl and her horse.

176
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,160
Especially if she lost her virginity to it.

177
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
Unless like you sewed the girl and the horse together.

178
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,360
Yeah, that would be pretty strong, I think.

179
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,080
What is the strength of a bond between a girl and her centaur?

180
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
How about do you want to hear some answers?

181
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,880
Let's see what other people said, because there are 24 of them.

182
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,520
Oh, good.

183
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,880
Oh, good.

184
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
You know, that means that someone looked at it and said those 23 people are sort of describing

185
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
how strong a bond between a girl and a horse is.

186
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Let me see if I can get this more on the nose.

187
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,280
See if I can hone this down to the real truth.

188
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,840
If you love horses than as stronger as anything else in the world,

189
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,080
if they are money makers, then nothing is there.

190
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,920
So if you love horses but hate-

191
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
So like if the horse has a job.

192
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Yeah, so if you love horses but hate making sense,

193
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,960
then you'll probably be really into horses.

194
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,680
All the girls I know that have horses have small feet,

195
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
and they would rather ride their horses than ride their man.

196
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,200
So I guess a woman's bond with her horse is perhaps obsessive.

197
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,480
What kind of porn was this guy searching for?

198
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:28,800
Listen, no.

199
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,160
He stumbled onto this question.

200
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,600
Hey, listen, he provided us with empirical evidence

201
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,160
to support his his assertion that women love horses more than men.

202
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,520
And that is that they have small feet.

203
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,960
Are there any answers from horses?

204
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,720
Just one that says like, I'd like to stay out of this.

205
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,280
How about this?

206
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
No, I think this was written by a horse.

207
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,480
Very strong.

208
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,880
Jake and Christy act like mother and son.

209
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,720
No, really, they do.

210
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
He waits for her every night to get there,

211
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,040
and she brings him a peppermint candy and a carrot or apple.

212
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,200
Hey, how was your childhood?

213
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,560
It was pretty dope.

214
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,400
Every night, my mom would visit me,

215
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,280
and she would bring me a peppermint or an apple,

216
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
and then she would brush my hair and ride me.

217
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,440
So I guess it was a pretty good childhood, I guess.

218
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,840
Just like a mother and son,

219
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,640
she visits him nightly and brings him an apple.

220
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Guys, I think that this person is writing equestrian fan fiction.

221
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,760
I'm going to throw out the-

222
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,520
On the Yahoo Answers, like, comment section on a question.

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,160
This is officially the saddest thing that exists on the internet.

224
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,920
In this circumstance, not always,

225
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,320
but in this circumstance aside is really, really necessary.

226
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Who the fuck are Jake and Christy?

227
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,760
Who are Jake and Christy?

228
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,280
We don't know them just because you do.

229
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,160
That's not how the internet works.

230
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,400
And even better, if it was like a strange name,

231
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,760
if it was like, you know, Bloobity Blue and Schmackity Bad.

232
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,160
Okay, great.

233
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,960
It's made up people.

234
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,520
But Jake and Christy is like, do I know Jake and Christy?

235
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,360
Which one's the horse?

236
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
Which one's the horse?

237
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,160
Tell me that.

238
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
That's a good question.

239
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,960
Is Jake and Christy the horse's name?

240
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,240
Because that might be like an okay, like, racing horse name.

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
That would be pretty good.

242
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Because it's like the running speed of two people.

243
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Yeah, there isn't a word.

244
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
Horses are basically, if you think about it,

245
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,200
horses are just two people.

246
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,120
Yeah, they are.

247
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,040
Because they're two people with a long neck.

248
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,800
Are you thinking of like a Halloween costume?

249
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,000
Mm-hmm.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm thinking of like, no, no.

251
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm talking about the actual physiology of a horse.

252
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,280
Oh, sure.

253
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,880
Four legs, right?

254
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,360
Right.

255
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
Double-length torso, double-length neck,

256
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,000
double-length face.

257
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,360
Big teeth.

258
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,720
Teeth.

259
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,120
Yeah.

260
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,240
We have those.

261
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Jumping.

262
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,000
Four eyeballs.

263
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,200
Yeah.

264
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,840
What?

265
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,800
And two buttholes.

266
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,680
Yeah, Mr. Ed was a pretty weird shout.

267
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,920
There isn't a word, or a million words,

268
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,000
that could even come close to describing it.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,800
Is there not?

270
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,280
There are not a million words?

271
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,480
Let's see if we can drop a hundred right now.

272
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,760
Oh my god.

273
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,720
Strong, potent, meaningful, robust horseman.

274
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,240
This is my 20 novel series.

275
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,240
It doesn't about how much horses love women

276
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,520
and how strong their bond is.

277
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,880
It doesn't come close.

278
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
I wish it came close, but I can't seem to quite get there.

279
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,600
Maybe another million words.

280
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,680
Enough to really ram it home.

281
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Hey, have you ever read Secretariat?

282
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,280
Yeah, that bitch is like 700 pages long.

283
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,440
Nice try, author of Secretariat.

284
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah, nice.

285
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,600
No dice.

286
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,360
Not close and no cigar.

287
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
I don't feel comfortable replying thank you

288
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,200
when I have sneezed and someone says bless you.

289
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,040
I don't know why I should thank them,

290
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,280
since I have no affiliation with any religion.

291
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
It seems strange to be considered okay

292
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,600
to say bless you to anyone who sneezes.

293
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,960
I've tried just not sneezing, but sometimes it is impossible.

294
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,400
What should I do in this situation?

295
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,680
I usually say nothing.

296
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
JZ.

297
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:11,520
Why?

298
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,200
I would yell, how dare you?

299
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,400
You bitch.

300
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,360
I didn't know that we marketed our show to heathens.

301
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,480
I thought it was mainly religious.

302
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:22,980
Good.

303
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,640
Good people.

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,600
Good Christian people.

305
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,920
Why don't you just take the power that that blessing gives you?

306
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,120
Blessings are imbued with power.

307
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,320
You do understand that, right?

308
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,200
When someone says bless you, they're not just being congenial.

309
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,400
They're giving you power.

310
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,760
Power.

311
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,560
They're giving you abilities, I think.

312
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,680
They're giving you super abilities that you can use,

313
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
but only when the super moon's out.

314
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
Once every 17 years, you harness all the sneeze blesses you get

315
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,120
and you can channel them into energy balls.

316
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,840
Pyrokinesis.

317
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,160
I mean, why do you give a shit?

318
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,680
The person is doing it to be polite.

319
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,480
It's a social custom more than it is sort of a religious one.

320
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,800
It's derived from people thinking the devil is jumping out of you when you sneeze.

321
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,120
I don't think those people say that, believe that.

322
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,400
I don't think they think...

323
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Do you know the real reason for it?

324
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,840
That's the real reason.

325
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,400
That's not it.

326
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
It sure is.

327
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,960
Not quite.

328
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,240
What do you think?

329
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,800
I thought it was because when you sneeze, your heart stops and you die temporarily.

330
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,360
Like your heart stops.

331
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,480
You die for a second.

332
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,040
You can't...

333
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,360
Your heart can't beat while you're sneezing, so it stops for a second.

334
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,320
Okay.

335
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
And people say bless you in case it doesn't start back up again.

336
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,320
So then if you die, A, you get to go to heaven, and B, when you get there, you have super abilities.

337
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,800
That's also why anytime anyone sneezes, I yell.

338
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,840
I get a stereo.

339
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:52,960
Yes.

340
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,680
I just Wikipedia'd it.

341
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,640
There are apparently differing definitions.

342
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,600
That's one of them, though.

343
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,040
I don't think that people...

344
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,560
I mean, people were like supes dumb back in the day.

345
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,360
I understand that, but I don't think they ever thought...

346
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,560
I don't think they were ever wacky enough to think that when you sneeze,

347
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,480
a little bit of the devil jumps out of you.

348
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,000
That's what they thought.

349
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,680
Griffin, I hate to bring it to you, but that's absolutely true.

350
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Sure it is.

351
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
That it was a demon escaping your body.

352
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,560
Well, then why would they say bless you?

353
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,360
Why wouldn't they be like, hey, you got that demon out, high five me.

354
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,960
To keep the demon from going back in.

355
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
Well, then why didn't people just like cover their nose and mouth all the time?

356
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,320
Like to keep demons from getting in.

357
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
People back in the day were so fucking dumb.

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,800
They didn't know anything.

359
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,760
They're so stoops.

360
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
I think that you just say it and you take the compliment.

361
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,720
It's like we've talked about, I think before,

362
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,160
I don't know if we've touched on this before, but

363
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,000
if you're a meal where someone blesses the meal as part of their culture,

364
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,400
you don't wait till everybody has their head bowed in their silence room and go bullshit.

365
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,080
I'm out.

366
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,280
I'm out.

367
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:10,720
Or just wait till they're in mid-prayer and then cut like a totally raunchy dude or something.

368
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,760
You're respected.

369
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,040
You know, you don't just disregard it if it's important to those people.

370
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,400
And this isn't even a religious thing.

371
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,320
It's like, who says bless you for religious reasons?

372
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,240
Like when you sneeze, no one's moved by the Holy Spirit to say,

373
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
it's just something you say.

374
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
It's just a reaction.

375
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,920
In God, we trust is written on our money.

376
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
You don't like tear that up and throw it in the face of hope.

377
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,680
How many people do you think have been converted

378
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,520
thanks to just like a really friendly like post-sneeze like message?

379
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,920
Like a chew, bless you.

380
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,640
What?

381
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,440
I've got good news.

382
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm glowing with the spirit.

383
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,240
I have such good news.

384
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:48,880
Well, okay.

385
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,560
Listen, is this something we can market?

386
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,480
Is this something we can capitalize on?

387
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,800
Can we come up with a non-denominational like sneeze exchange that you can say

388
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,480
that both the sneeze recipient and the sneeze sneezer can say?

389
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,520
Let me hit you with this.

390
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,080
What about if someone sneezes, you look them down the eye and say, you sneezed.

391
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,200
Because that's what you're saying.

392
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,280
When you say bless you, you're saying, hey, I caught you.

393
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,560
Caught you sneezing.

394
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,680
What about this one?

395
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,480
I've seen better.

396
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,680
Now, see, I think we need to keep any evaluation out of it

397
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
because that's just going to be too complex.

398
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,680
This needs to be something you can just like bang.

399
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,920
Like it's something you just get out on the go on an airplane.

400
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,840
What about gross?

401
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,560
I kind of like that.

402
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,440
Gross.

403
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,480
Stop it.

404
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
What about can we try yucky?

405
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,520
Your snot's getting out.

406
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,800
Should we keep it monosyllabic?

407
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,560
Hanky.

408
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,200
New hanky.

409
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,440
Sleeve it.

410
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
Sleeve it.

411
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,080
That's good.

412
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
Next time for me, sleeve it.

413
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,000
Also, everybody knows that you're supposed to cough and sneeze into your elbow now, right?

414
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,800
Feels weird.

415
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,760
That's the thing to do.

416
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,080
All right.

417
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,040
So maybe instead of saying any one thing, we can just deliver tips to that person on how

418
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,800
they can sneeze better.

419
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:04,960
Yeah.

420
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,600
And then we can record it for like 45 minutes.

421
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,400
Podcast.

422
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:08,640
Done.

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,760
Jason, I'm going to give you one last bit of advice.

424
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,280
The next time someone says to you, bless you, look at them and go, no, bless you.

425
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,520
And then walk away as quickly as you can.

426
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,640
I'm not comfortable with this war on Christmas-esque thing that's going on in this podcast.

427
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:24,880
Yeah.

428
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,160
This war on Gesundheit.

429
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:33,360
You know all the blessing I need, Griffin?

430
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,880
You need the one you do before you eat dinner at a fancy restaurant so you look impressive

431
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,840
in front of all your friends.

432
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,480
That's really the only one you need because it gets-

433
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,960
Well, I also need a free trip to the money zone.

434
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:56,960
What?

435
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,440
Let's get paid.

436
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,840
I need a better liner.

437
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,000
The guys at Stop Podcasting Yourself, they have a fun little song they sing about paying

438
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,440
the bills and being grown up.

439
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,680
We sing a song at the end of our thing.

440
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,240
That's something.

441
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,360
And by we, I mean me.

442
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,040
This podcast-

443
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,920
You guys could really start pulling your weight during the jingles.

444
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,320
This podcast is bullshit.

445
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:26,640
Yep.

446
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,280
How do I know?

447
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,200
Because there's a much better podcast out there.

448
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
There are several, but we're going to talk about one that paid us to talk about it.

449
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,440
Yeah.

450
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,800
That's not why we're doing it.

451
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,240
You're ruining the fourth wall.

452
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,680
The Lion in Tweed is the story of a college professor of economics and sound studies who

453
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,280
plays folk music on the side.

454
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
He is also a lion.

455
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,520
I feel like that should be enough of a commercial right there because if you hear that and you

456
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:01,440
don't start heading to thelionintweed.com right now, then you're a monster, I think.

457
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,040
I like that it's pretty meta.

458
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:11,520
It's an episodic musical podcast of fictionalized life, like it's made up on so many different

459
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,840
levels about, you know, a lion.

460
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,600
Here's one of the selling points.

461
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Here's one of the bullet points we were provided.

462
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,840
It's a well-groomed lion stuffed into a corduroy blazer and bootcut jeans.

463
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,560
Okay, cool.

464
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,640
This is a skanky like threadbare lion you're used to.

465
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,200
This isn't like a Chester Cheetah.

466
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,400
We're not talking about like a rude dude with tons of tood.

467
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,360
We're talking about a guy you'd invite over.

468
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,480
This is a classy college professor that you can sit around with.

469
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,200
You can talk about Proust and maybe once the night comes up, hit that gravity bong because

470
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,240
you know how.

471
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,920
You and the lion, you know how professors are.

472
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,120
You know how college professors are.

473
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,560
There's artwork by a Renston Roundtree of the webcomic Subnormality and it describes

474
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,560
a new model of music on the internet with focus on the podcast as performance, kind

475
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,400
of like what Max Fun does with comedy.

476
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,200
I really dig that.

477
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
I always think like I love music.

478
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,680
I love podcasts.

479
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,400
I can't listen to both at once or it's cacophonous.

480
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
Yeah, it's just cacophony and they have blended the two.

481
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,280
They blended the two together.

482
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,920
I love this and you will too.

483
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,120
Go to thelionandtweed.com, follow him on Twitter.

484
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:30,320
He's at thelionandtweed or subscribe to the podcast on iTunes if it's just thelionandtweed.

485
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,040
Have you listened to the first episode that's up yet?

486
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,920
Have you listened to it?

487
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
I want to know how much, I listened to a few minutes of it when I was at South by Southwest,

488
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,280
but I didn't have time to really digest it.

489
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,400
How much devouring goes on?

490
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,200
Does he, how many people does he devour throughout the course?

491
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,600
I've yet to hear any devourments, devour it.

492
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
See, that seems disingenuous.

493
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
Like the podcast is really great and it's doing some groundbreaking things with music,

494
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,600
comedy fusion, but I need some wholesale devourment.

495
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,440
Maybe they wanted to include more of that, but while they were making the website,

496
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,520
it just got too hard or boring or maybe even frustrating.

497
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,400
Maybe there was a lot of a bunch of weird tech issues they had to deal with.

498
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,680
Maybe there were some problems with PHP, CSS.

499
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,640
HTTP?

500
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,400
I don't understand it.

501
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,360
I don't know how any of this works, but I do know, I do know one thing, Griffin.

502
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,160
What's that?

503
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,680
I know how Photoshop works.

504
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,640
Yeah, that one's easy.

505
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,440
I'm a Photoshop.

506
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
You want to put a baby's head on a man's body?

507
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,240
I'm there.

508
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
Man's head on a baby's body?

509
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,240
I got you.

510
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,800
Do you want to resort to grotesque surgery?

511
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,480
Do you want to take the cover to the movie Space Jam and cut my face out and put it on

512
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,600
the front of everybody else's faces on the cover of Space Jam?

513
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,640
Yes, I did do that already, so don't waste your time.

514
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:05,840
If you know how to use Photoshop, then you can use the Photoshop plugin called Site Grinder 3.

515
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,200
It's made by Media Lab.

516
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,320
Another Max Fun listener, Tom Summerall, makes this.

517
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,000
And it is just that.

518
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,880
It is a Photoshop plugin that lets you turn your Photoshop designs into finished websites.

519
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,000
Real, honest-to-God websites, not just like a picture you click on.

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,080
They've got content management, edit everything, e-commerce you can add, and soon you'll even

521
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,000
be able to make WordPress themes with it, too.

522
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,560
I know we don't.

523
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,520
Eventually, it will become sentient and kill you in your sleep.

524
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,480
Yeah, that's the thing.

525
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,920
I know we don't advertise bullshit, but this sounds like some phony baloney wizardry.

526
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,200
This sounds like a wizard who made it.

527
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,440
That's the last bullet point, actually.

528
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,320
Made up.

529
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,360
Made up by a wizard.

530
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Not extant.

531
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,640
I mean, it seems like you can't turn a Photoshop into a website.

532
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,120
Think about it.

533
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,200
You can't turn a fruit-by-the-foot into a digital picture frame.

534
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,760
That's the tagline, actually.

535
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,640
It says, hey, you dumb motherfucker, you can do this now.

536
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,840
Hey, dumb fuck.

537
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,960
You know how you go to websites?

538
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
You're like, I remember these.

539
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
That's last gen.

540
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,680
And you can even make awesome Facebook fan pages in Photoshop.

541
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,880
You go to medialab.com or sitegrinder.com and you can learn more about these.

542
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,160
Or go to thelineandtweet.com if you're hopping around the net.

543
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,640
Go to both.

544
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Treat yourself to both of these, and you might end up crafting a jingle that goes exactly like this.

545
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,280
This is going to be tricky because I got to...

546
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,480
Have a jingle that goes just like this.

547
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,520
Gotta mash them up.

548
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,800
This is a mashup.

549
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,080
I'm trying to lead you in here.

550
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,640
I want to give you one more time.

551
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,360
There's a mashup.

552
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,880
Girl talk.

553
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,660
Shit.

554
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:15,700
TheLionInTweet is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

555
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:15,940
Shit.

556
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,580
No, fuck.

557
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,060
Lost it.

558
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,660
All right, that's a good start.

559
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,380
Here we go.

560
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:27,700
TheLionInTweet is a friend indeed, and he's also a podcast too.

561
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:38,580
And a lion in time is a fine feline, but don't let him devour you.

562
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,460
I gotta do something about Media Lab.

563
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:57,060
I made a photoshop with me and my best friend Michael Jordan.

564
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:05,140
Actually, it was me and Michael Jordan and the cast of Space Jam.

565
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,260
It was called Me and Space Jam.

566
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,020
I gotta do another verse.

567
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,820
That's the second verse we actually talk about the shit.

568
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,340
Didn't even mention a thing.

569
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,060
All right, here we go.

570
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:32,420
I took me and Space Jam and I turned it into a website using Media Lab's site grinder technology.

571
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:43,220
You can visit it, visit it, visit it at griffonspacejam.com.

572
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,260
That was the worst.

573
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,740
For fear of dwelling too long in the buddy zone.

574
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,100
I have done so many of those.

575
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Griffin, what exactly is the website for?

576
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,980
What are you doing there at your Space Jam website?

577
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,540
Oh, is it just for your Space Jam fan fiction?

578
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,980
It's a story about me and Michael Jordan.

579
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,100
Listen, I got on a hot streak.

580
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,380
I was trying to find the exit off of that musical highway and I missed it.

581
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,820
And then I just had to keep going on the Michael Jordan Express.

582
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,060
You had no other choice.

583
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,100
What could you do?

584
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,660
Jesus, oh, man, I'm going there right now, griffonspacejam.com.

585
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,100
So thanks to our friends for helping us to support the show.

586
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,540
If you want to support the show and this and who wouldn't?

587
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,140
And Griffin's side projects.

588
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,860
Good luck getting that jingle into a commercial, by the way.

589
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,180
It's going to be like four minutes long.

590
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,020
Yeah, it's email Teresa at maximumfun.org.

591
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,060
That's Teresa with an H.

592
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,900
My friends never wash their hands after using the bathroom.

593
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,980
We usually get together and play video games.

594
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,700
So the thought of unwashed hands touching communal controllers is disgusting.

595
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,820
I know they don't because when I go to use it, the soap hasn't been touched and the sink is always dry.

596
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,820
Also, it's pretty obvious when you hear the flush and they walk straight out.

597
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,060
I hesitate to call them out on it because I don't want to embarrass them by asking them to do so.

598
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,140
Is there any way my friends can be encouraged to wash their genital germs off their hands?

599
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,900
I'm about to start wearing gloves to our hangouts.

600
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,100
Phil, Phil, first of all, I just want to celebrate the detective work that you're doing.

601
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,460
Yeah, way to go there, Monk.

602
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,180
Hey, get back from hosting Double Dare.

603
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,980
I would just call them on it.

604
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,940
I'd be like, hey, gross, how'd you wash your hands?

605
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,780
I think you don't want to be that guy.

606
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,380
I would say put a sign up.

607
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,140
Put a sign up on the bathroom door that says, hey, did you wash your hands?

608
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,820
All Phil's friends are required to wash hands before returning to game.

609
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,980
This means you, Derek.

610
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,860
Yeah, that way if you don't single them out, they can think it's somebody else,

611
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,500
but they can also be your mind to actually do it.

612
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,900
A nice sign would be good.

613
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,620
Let's trick them.

614
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,340
Maybe like an electric shock collar.

615
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,660
Oh, you know what?

616
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:20,580
What if you got some celebrities to help you?

617
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,740
And in this case, by celebrities, I mean us, who are celebrities

618
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,260
in the limited definition of our program.

619
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,060
Hey, Dirty.

620
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,420
Hey, Dirty Hands.

621
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,460
Hey, Dirty, you want to wash them up for me?

622
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,620
There, Dirty.

623
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,660
Make that your ringtone so you just play it for them whenever they come out of the bathroom.

624
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,060
Hey, Dirty.

625
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,820
It's Justin McElroy from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

626
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,060
Wash your hands, Dirty.

627
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,380
Lick your hand right now.

628
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,100
Bet you won't do it because you know what's going on there.

629
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,340
The one study I'd need science to do for me.

630
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,940
Science is wasting their time with a lot of stuff.

631
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,260
The one study I want to see is how often people wash their hands

632
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,180
when they're alone in the bathroom in like a communal public bathroom

633
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,700
and how many wash their hands when there's people in there.

634
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,900
It's got to be like 100% different, right?

635
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,540
Did you guys used to hate washing your hands?

636
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,740
I used to like not appreciate the act of and so I'd like, you know,

637
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,500
stick my hands under the water for like two seconds

638
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,060
so then flick, mud the water on the mirror.

639
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,620
I used, no joke, I used to hate washing my hands to the extent that when I would,

640
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,860
this was a long time ago.

641
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:29,140
I now understand the value of a good hand wash

642
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,660
but I used to just turn the water on

643
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,660
and then turn it off to make people think I wash my hands.

644
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,340
I was literally doing,

645
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,700
I was exerting as much energy as was required to wash my hands

646
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,980
but in defiance of societal laws, I didn't go through with the act.

647
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,020
I tell you, if a bathroom has a Dyson Airblade,

648
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,540
I'm about 90 times more likely to wash my hands because I love it.

649
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,580
Yeah, let's make washing hands fun again.

650
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,820
Yeah, thanks Dyson for doing that.

651
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,660
Here's the thing that you could do, Phil.

652
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,820
What if you started covering the inside doorknob to your bathroom

653
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,340
and some sort of unsavory material?

654
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:15,460
I don't know what it might be, maple syrup.

655
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,940
Because nobody wants to smell a maple syrup on their hands, right?

656
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,140
Like that's a bad smell to carry around with you all day.

657
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,180
So cover the inside doorknob and they touch it, maple syrup hands.

658
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,940
Oh, gotta wash them anyway.

659
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,100
You know what, try this.

660
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,060
Buy a new kind of like really fragrant hand soap

661
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,500
and then when they come out, say,

662
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,740
hey, did you check out the new hand soap?

663
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,660
Do you think that it smells good or smells bad?

664
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,100
Or I don't know if I like it or not.

665
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,300
And then you're not calling them out, but they get all embarrassed

666
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,860
because they didn't use any soap because they didn't wash their hands.

667
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,500
This is good.

668
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,660
I think you gotta call them out because that's gonna last for like a minute.

669
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,740
The pain, the anguish of embarrassment.

670
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,100
It's only gonna last for a little bit, but the last one will last a lifetime.

671
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:58,260
Yeah, and try to do it just one on one.

672
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,220
I'm not, who am I kidding?

673
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,260
He's not gonna do that.

674
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,820
This is also-

675
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,780
He's not gonna talk to him about it.

676
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,740
Excuse me, Derek.

677
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,180
Can I speak to you over here for a minute?

678
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,540
Can I speak in the kitchen, Derek?

679
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,020
Derek, we've known each other for a long time now.

680
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,460
We're friends, right?

681
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,860
I have a weird question that I'm not even sure we need to answer,

682
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,780
but when I was reading it, I enjoyed it so much that I want to share it with you.

683
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,020
Okay.

684
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:18,820
Okay.

685
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,300
I have a question that's been in my head all week.

686
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,940
The other day, I was trying to cut through an apartment complex,

687
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,900
the same one I usually do for a shortcut to get to the mall,

688
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,140
and a man was walking his dog through there.

689
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,740
When me and my buddy started walking through,

690
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,220
the old man asked us, are you going to walk through these apartments?

691
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,500
And we told him yes.

692
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,420
And he said not to, because there's a man with a gun who lives there,

693
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,460
and anyone who doesn't live there who passes by, he will shoot.

694
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,780
I told him it was illegal because it's an apartment building and he doesn't own it.

695
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,580
His only responses to all my questions from here on is,

696
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,540
it's private property in a very annoying tone.

697
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,180
We eventually left to go to the mall after 15 minutes wasted.

698
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,900
But I've been thinking about other arguments,

699
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,060
like what if relatives of a neighbor came by to visit and he shot them,

700
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,420
or a Jehovah's Witness came by and his head was blown to bits,

701
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,700
was he lying?

702
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,780
Or is this a really scary situation?

703
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,980
This man and the tenants who are threatening people need to be reported.

704
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,500
I would really like it to be true,

705
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,540
just because I want to picture the scene of like someone walking up to that guy's door

706
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,900
and knocking like, hey, just so you know,

707
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,100
my cousin is going to be visiting tomorrow.

708
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,980
He's five foot two, red hair.

709
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,940
I'll have him, you know, do the hands up and announce himself.

710
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,180
But if you could not kill him, that would be super.

711
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,740
Hey, can you do me this one solid and not shoot my cousin Brian?

712
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,300
He has red hair.

713
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,660
Please don't kill Brian on sight.

714
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,820
You should never murder anybody, right?

715
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,380
Like that's our number one piece of advice,

716
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,980
is that if you're about to murder somebody,

717
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,500
don't do it and go do something else.

718
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,020
I don't understand why you do it for something this small.

719
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,260
Yeah, it's a great question.

720
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,700
Hey, I have a Yahoo answer to cleanse our palate with.

721
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,420
Give it to me.

722
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,100
Just kidding, it's an eHow article.

723
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,900
Tricked you again, you dumb bitch.

724
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,580
Got me.

725
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,300
This one was sent in a long time ago, actually, by Jeff DeLong,

726
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,860
but I bookmarked it and forgot about it until now.

727
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,100
eHow article.

728
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,100
Let me see if I can find a difficult.

729
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,100
Oh, this one's moderately easy.

730
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,540
Good.

731
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,860
It makes no bigs, basically.

732
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,340
Don't worry about it.

733
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,540
Hey, no bigs.

734
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,180
You got this.

735
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,540
How to talk to aliens.

736
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,140
When you want to talk to aliens,

737
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,900
you need to telepathically call them.

738
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,740
Don't yell out your window, hey, aliens, I want to talk.

739
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,500
You probably won't get a response.

740
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,060
You need to approach this matter seriously

741
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,820
by following these steps.

742
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,320
Sure.

743
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,440
Step one.

744
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:45,640
Step one.

745
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,820
Meditate daily.

746
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,460
Keep your thoughts pure.

747
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,380
Like, like attracts like,

748
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,980
and you don't want to attract any evil aliens.

749
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,060
Focus on good, gentle aliens.

750
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,120
Okay.

751
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,620
Hey, who was that that was meditating

752
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,020
and brought down these fucking surly aliens

753
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,980
that are shooting us?

754
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,480
ID4 stuff.

755
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,020
Why did you meditate so hard?

756
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,220
Why did you meditate hard on angry things like ID4 aliens?

757
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,660
Know that aliens communicate telepathically

758
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,700
and can hear your thoughts.

759
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,020
Call them with clear intention.

760
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,700
Tell them the reason you're calling them.

761
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,180
Did you know that aliens can hear your everything?

762
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,220
Your every thought?

763
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,460
Every thought?

764
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,100
Everything you think aliens are just hearing it from space

765
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,460
and like, aw.

766
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,540
Aliens have to be bored as shit.

767
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,540
Quick question.

768
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,900
Like, what are you, what are you,

769
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,860
what is your reason for calling aliens?

770
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,940
Think of your reason beforehand.

771
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,260
Hey, aliens, what's up?

772
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,740
I guess I just want to talk to aliens.

773
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,340
I could have like a super good reason.

774
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,500
I think the reason for calling aliens

775
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,140
is the same reason why you'd write an eHow article

776
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,820
about how to call aliens,

777
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,540
and that is crippling loneliness.

778
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,060
Right.

779
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,540
Exactly.

780
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,460
Anywhere in that, anywhere in that article,

781
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,260
does it give you any steps on how

782
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
or when to welcome them to Earth?

783
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,260
Let's keep going.

784
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,740
We'll find out.

785
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:11,860
Okay.

786
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,660
Three.

787
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,740
Gaze at the stars from inside your home

788
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,940
or you may want to meditate outside in your underwear.

789
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,060
This will-

790
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,500
It'll draw the sexy aliens.

791
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,940
This will save them the trouble

792
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,220
of having to remove your clothes

793
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,420
so they try to abduct you.

794
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,780
Excuse me?

795
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,420
No, stop, guys.

796
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,140
What?

797
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,860
No explanation provided nor required.

798
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:33,940
Really?

799
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,420
Does it say that?

800
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:37,220
Hey, there he is.

801
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,060
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be straight up with you.

802
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,020
If anyone ever tries to abduct me into space

803
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,820
and they're like,

804
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,060
oh shit, he forgot to take his clothes off,

805
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,900
you're, yes, that's what I want.

806
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,580
I don't want to make it easier for them

807
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,340
to abduct me into space.

808
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:50,660
Yeah.

809
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,100
They'll dissect me and shit.

810
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,940
I wasn't gonna go to Earth tonight,

811
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,380
but if you look at Dylan down there,

812
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,980
I think he's ready for biz.

813
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,860
Like, you look at him,

814
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,260
he is DTF.

815
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,140
Dylan is down.

816
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,580
Is it just me or has Dylan oiled himself up?

817
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,100
Well, that'll make it way easier.

818
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,100
He is D-T-B-A.

819
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:08,900
Let's get him.

820
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,180
Oh, man.

821
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,580
But see, you make it too easy for them.

822
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,220
They don't like it.

823
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,500
Aliens, sex aliens, they love the chase.

824
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:21,940
Oh, yeah.

825
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:24,660
They also love little guys named Chase.

826
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,060
So your name's Chase and you're out there.

827
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,300
They're into it.

828
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,780
Persist in your daily meditation call

829
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,460
and eventually you will get results.

830
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,820
When the aliens appear,

831
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,340
you don't need to shake their hands

832
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,300
or introduce yourself.

833
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,060
They already know who you are.

834
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,100
They just want to fuck.

835
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,460
That seems-

836
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,740
Also, they can read your mind

837
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,500
and tell that you didn't wash your hands,

838
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,380
you dirty fuck.

839
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,260
Listen, this seems like a pretty big gamble to take

840
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,580
because if the aliens don't know who you are,

841
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,900
you are naked and also pretty rude.

842
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,740
Hey, we don't need names, do we?

843
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,260
Yeah, I guess.

844
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,540
Like, I'm an alien.

845
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,740
This earthling,

846
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,860
this earthling Chase0115 is nude and rude

847
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,980
and totally crude.

848
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,220
He's a bad dude.

849
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,820
He's a bad dude with tude.

850
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,940
Let's get him.

851
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,540
I think we should wipe this planet.

852
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,740
Let's get him.

853
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,860
Let's firewiper.

854
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,500
Let's fuck.

855
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,740
Let's get him telepathically.

856
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,540
I'm a fuck you ID4 style.

857
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,220
I'm a fuck you like Trent Spiner.

858
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,940
Is that his name?

859
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,540
Trent.

860
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,500
A Brent Spiner.

861
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,220
His brother is Trent though.

862
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,700
If I was an alien,

863
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,420
he'd be the first one against the wall getting fucked.

864
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,700
Okay, Trent Spiner would?

865
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,580
I'm just saying.

866
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,620
I would teach him

867
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,820
because it would be really ironic

868
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,140
because he gets absolutely perforated

869
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,420
by aliens in ID4.

870
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,020
So yeah, right.

871
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,260
People like they already know how he how he does.

872
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,100
How they how to get him.

873
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,060
He likes it.

874
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,700
How Brent likes it.

875
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,900
He likes it and serving.

876
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,140
Yeah.

877
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,140
Of course, they're not going to bother

878
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,820
if he's not already outside and naked

879
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,780
and praying to them.

880
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,380
And lubed.

881
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,100
Cooperate with the aliens at all times.

882
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,340
They get angry if you don't take their advice

883
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,460
or do what they tell you.

884
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,140
They may look spindly,

885
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:17,140
but they can easily control you.

886
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,020
Can they?

887
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,740
This person's got a pretty robust knowledge

888
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,420
of what these aliens are into.

889
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,060
Listen, these aliens.

890
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,420
They can easily control me.

891
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,220
Why are they worried about

892
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,660
if my clothes are off yet or not?

893
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,900
They want to see me strip?

894
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,980
Yeah, it's actually incredibly unsexy for them

895
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,100
because they don't wear clothes.

896
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:34,900
They don't understand.

897
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,780
Oh, they don't wear armor.

898
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:38,660
They see armor.

899
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,620
They see they're like,

900
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,940
why doesn't this guy have natural chitin

901
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,220
emerging from the skin?

902
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,220
They get angry and they lose their boners.

903
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,580
And then you don't want to be up there

904
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,940
when they lose their boners.

905
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,140
That boner is the only thing

906
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,740
keeping you alive in space.

907
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:54,820
Also, it's in their hand,

908
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,780
which makes E.T. seem way different now.

909
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,620
Talk with the aliens telepathically.

910
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,980
Don't say words in your mind.

911
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,900
Use symbols to communicate your ideas.

912
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,740
Yeah, thanks.

913
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,660
Now they will easy to control my thoughts.

914
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,140
Yeah, my symbol is going to be a stop sign

915
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,740
because I'm being fucked by an alien

916
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,980
and I want it to stop, please.

917
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,100
Please stop.

918
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,620
I don't even bother telling them what to do.

919
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,820
So yeah, what does it matter?

920
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,820
Like, I think that your path's pretty well set

921
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,100
once you ask them to come down.

922
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,780
Hey, P.S.

923
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,980
Did these rules change

924
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,700
if you accidentally beamed down the angry aliens?

925
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,540
Like, should you submiss as hard

926
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,500
as they're telling you to?

927
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,100
Oh, so you're saying

928
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,620
if we beamed down ID4 aliens,

929
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,020
then we have an ID4-esque revolt against them.

930
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,340
If we beamed down sexians.

931
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:41,540
What I'm saying is this guide should probably branch

932
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,260
a little bit.

933
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,740
There should be some limited branching

934
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,540
between if it's an angry alien or a cool alien.

935
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,260
I like the idea that every other species,

936
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,060
every other alien race in the galaxy,

937
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,380
except human beings, can hear thoughts.

938
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,140
Like, so they're up there just waiting for someone on Earth

939
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,660
to call them down naked

940
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,820
and then come down and just fuck the shit up.

941
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,540
I'm ready.

942
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,940
I just watched Earth Girls Are Easy.

943
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,900
Let's get it wet.

944
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,620
Let's get it wet.

945
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,260
I just want to point out that both movies

946
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,860
we've referenced in this conversation

947
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,380
have both starred Jeff Goldblum.

948
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,420
Jeff Goldblum knows about fucking and fighting aliens.

949
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,740
Right in their ship, if you like.

950
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,780
I can't do this anymore.

951
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,700
Right in their ship, if you like.

952
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,980
I don't think you have a choice.

953
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:27,220
If they put you on there, you're-

954
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,740
You may not have a choice, it says.

955
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,420
You may not have a choice.

956
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:30,900
No shit.

957
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,580
You can't do anything they don't tell you to do.

958
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,500
Hey, aliens, you just fucked me,

959
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,860
and it was really bad.

960
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:36,820
Um, can you-

961
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,420
My house is just that way.

962
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,060
If- No.

963
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,020
Oh, we're going-

964
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,900
We're going to-

965
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,620
Oh, you're gonna have-

966
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,660
Fuck me on Uranus.

967
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,380
That's very funny.

968
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,820
That's really-

969
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:46,900
That's a really good goof and a hot spoof.

970
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,260
It's a pretty good spoof, aliens.

971
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,060
Can I go home?

972
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,060
Are you gonna kill me?

973
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,380
This is nothing like Flight of the Navigator.

974
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,580
This hurts-

975
00:44:58,580 --> 00:44:59,860
This hurts everywhere.

976
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,020
I'm picturing a picture of me dead.

977
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:04,660
I'm picturing the symbol of me dying.

978
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,420
Can you do that, please?

979
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,500
Establish an ongoing relationship with them by telling them-

980
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,460
No, we can't.

981
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,900
By telling them you want to participate in their breeding program.

982
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,180
No!

983
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,380
It sounds like you already participated.

984
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,180
It's like you're in it to win it already.

985
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,420
You are down with the rogue.

986
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,700
You are ready.

987
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,900
You are on board, as much on board as you could be.

988
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,140
You're naked and lying in your lawn and thinking about sexy cool aliens.

989
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,980
Like, you are in it.

990
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,140
How many symbols do these bitches need?

991
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,580
Like, you're naked.

992
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,540
Do they want you to gape it for them?

993
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:43,780
Yeah.

994
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,900
Do you want you to reach right there with both hands and just gape it?

995
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:47,380
My symbol-

996
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,020
Step 18, reach back, spread butt cheeks.

997
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,540
The aliens love it.

998
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,660
The aliens love that shit.

999
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,900
Here's how you get an alien turned on.

1000
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,940
In your mind, sing hello by Lionel Richie.

1001
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,180
Instant alien boner.

1002
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,860
And then gape it.

1003
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,780
Um, that's all for the steps.

1004
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,740
There are some tips and warnings, including don't try to look an alien in the eye.

1005
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,020
It's almost impossible.

1006
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,260
Almost.

1007
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:15,380
I guess, I guess because the position that you're in, like, it'd be hard to control your body.

1008
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,740
Don't tell anyone about your talks with aliens.

1009
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:20,180
They'll probably think you're crazy.

1010
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,220
No shit.

1011
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,700
Don't even post on the internet about your talks with aliens.

1012
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,460
You may find yourself being followed by men in black or being posed by black helicopters.

1013
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,660
Maybe.

1014
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,340
Or the aliens will get on Facebook and be like,

1015
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,580
oh man, Robbie told about our fuck sesh.

1016
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,620
I thought that was private.

1017
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,580
I'm changing our relationship status to angry.

1018
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:39,620
I'm changing it from currently probing him in his butthole.

1019
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,340
I'm changing it from Earth girls are easy to ID4.

1020
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,260
Sorry.

1021
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,540
Sorry, Earth.

1022
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,900
Here comes the fire wipe.

1023
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,700
And thank you.

1024
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,820
And thank you to Dylan.

1025
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,860
We hope it was worth it.

1026
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,380
We hope you really love the probing.

1027
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,820
Um, I can't-

1028
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,820
This is, this is semi-related.

1029
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,300
When the robots finally rise up and overthrow humanity,

1030
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,700
will Anthony Daniels be given a pass for his portrayal of C-3PO in Star Wars

1031
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,980
or will said performance be seen as robot blackface?

1032
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,860
That's from Jessica.

1033
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,340
I don't know what the advice here is,

1034
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,940
but I'm going to, I'm going to, um,

1035
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,140
I'm going to pretend that she's deciding whether or not to go visit Anthony Daniels

1036
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,340
or maybe go see him perform.

1037
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,380
We can't do that.

1038
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,140
We can't remix these questions.

1039
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,900
Remix.

1040
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,140
Substep. Kyle, from that first question,

1041
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,940
he was asking about his awesome life and how to make it more awesome.

1042
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:32,900
Yeah.

1043
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,460
He doesn't work at Target.

1044
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,540
He works at Home Depot.

1045
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,500
I just did that.

1046
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:44,660
I don't think the aliens will have any love for C-3PO, the character.

1047
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:47,380
I think, I mean, he works for humans.

1048
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,900
I think they're going to see him as something of a, of an Uncle Tron, if you will.

1049
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,580
Oh, Justin.

1050
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,140
No?

1051
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,020
You don't think so?

1052
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,340
Maybe.

1053
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,820
It was worth a shot, I guess.

1054
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,380
I'll give you a guffaw, but that's it.

1055
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,620
That's all you're getting for this situation.

1056
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,140
I will give you half a chuckle.

1057
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,420
I will give you a chuckle.

1058
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,620
Listen, I can't, I can't laugh at this question

1059
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,780
because we just saw a robot run the fucking train

1060
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:14,420
on the best that humanity has to offer to Jeopardy and now,

1061
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,740
this isn't the future anymore, guys.

1062
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,340
This is, this is yesterday.

1063
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
This is like two weeks ago, whatever that Jeopardy happened.

1064
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,700
We're living in the yesterday of time.

1065
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,500
We are living in the yesterday where robots just brain fucked Ken Jennings,

1066
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,100
like got deep down in him.

1067
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,980
Like he was, he was like, as if,

1068
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,460
as if Ken Jennings were gaping like Dylan on his lawn.

1069
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,580
They just got in there.

1070
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,620
He took him to a whole nother dimension of shame.

1071
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,860
He beat Ken Jennings so hard at Jeopardy,

1072
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,540
Ken Jennings is now impotent.

1073
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,340
That's true.

1074
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,780
He can't reproduce.

1075
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,420
Right after he finished, right after he finished with Ken Jennings' brain,

1076
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,860
he shot off an EMP.

1077
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,980
Both players are EMP.

1078
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,500
I can't even remember the other guy's name

1079
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,740
because his existence has been wiped from history.

1080
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,300
He did that because he's a fucking computer.

1081
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:04,820
I, I think that this, it's not a joke.

1082
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,620
I, if, if there's, if there's a God in heaven above,

1083
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,500
Anthony Daniels will be dead by the time the robot revelations.

1084
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,180
Oh, they will desecrate Anthony Daniels.

1085
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,420
They'll probably dig him up,

1086
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,700
reanimating with cyborg parts and then crucify him.

1087
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,500
It will be brutal.

1088
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:22,820
All right.

1089
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,380
Well, listen, I want to hear Griffin's last question,

1090
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,180
but first just real quick housekeeping things.

1091
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,540
mbnbam.com is our website.

1092
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,380
There you can find out how to ask us questions,

1093
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,380
but spoiler, you just mbnbam at maximum fun.org.

1094
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,420
Thank you again for, for supporting the show.

1095
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,180
If you donated, look for your gifts.

1096
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,500
I think in the next six weeks or so,

1097
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,180
just keep an eye out on the mail.

1098
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,140
You know, we got a lot to send out, but keep an eye on.

1099
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,060
Definitely know if you got like a tote bag or something,

1100
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:53,860
let us know when it comes in,

1101
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,300
send us a fancy picture of yourself wearing it

1102
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,500
and carrying items in it.

1103
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,940
If you want to tweet about the show,

1104
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,860
make sure you use the mbnbam hashtag.

1105
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:08,260
We'll see like quotes and stuff like that.

1106
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,460
People are always really, really nice

1107
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,900
about spreading the word that way.

1108
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,220
We got a question this week from Stephanie,

1109
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,660
who said she loves the show,

1110
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,260
but the boyfriend showed it to me

1111
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,740
and always keeps his comedy sources a secret,

1112
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,020
but she wants to tell people about it.

1113
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,980
He won't let her.

1114
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,860
So I say, go to Twitter, go to in person,

1115
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,940
burn a CD and just hand it to someone.

1116
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,100
Say, here, here, this is for you.

1117
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:32,900
I got this for you.

1118
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,300
Go to Facebook, just get around him.

1119
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,820
You guys spread the word, it's the most important thing.

1120
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:38,980
I want to drop some, I want to drop some shout outs

1121
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,860
to all the people I met in Austin.

1122
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,380
We did a quick impromptu South by Southwest meetup,

1123
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,620
me and Jordan Morris from Jordan and Jesse Go did,

1124
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,380
and it was a good time.

1125
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,020
It was a fun time.

1126
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,820
The world's best people is what they call Austin.

1127
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,700
Austin, we got the world's best people, they said,

1128
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,060
and it's true, I know it.

1129
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,820
I know it as a fact.

1130
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,780
You know it deep down in your heart?

1131
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,140
I know it deep down in my heart.

1132
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,500
World's best pizza, I meant to say people,

1133
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,100
but also our pizza's pretty good too.

1134
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,900
Thanks to everybody spreading the word on Twitter.

1135
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,940
Thanks to Dorian Burn, Ghost211, tons of people out there.

1136
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,060

Also Matthew Modine.

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:25,860
Lots of people.

1139
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,820
Andy Volhop, everybody, everybody on Twitter

1140
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,780
talking about the show.

1141
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,420
Pussy Lake.

1142
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:36,500
Pussy Lake, all of our followers are out there

1143
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,060
spreading the word.

1144
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,540
So listen guys, thank you again.

1145
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,060
Again, have we talked about everything?

1146
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,340
Go listen to Stop Podcasting Yourself,

1147
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,860
Jordan Just To Go, Sound Young America.

1148
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,500
Just John Hodgman.

1149
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,260
A whole kit and caboodle.

1150
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:52,740
And thank you, as always, you're the best.

1151
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,300
This very final question was sent in by Christina Curtis.

1152
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:58,020
Thank you, Christina.

1153
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,540
It's by Yahoo Answers user Marissa Ventura, who asks,

1154
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:08,340
Help, my boyfriend keeps shouting Illuminati during sex.

1155
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,420
I'm Justin McElroy.

1156
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1157
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,740
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1158
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,340
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

1159
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,140
Kiss your dad.

1160
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:33,140
Square on the lips.
