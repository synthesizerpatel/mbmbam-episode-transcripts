1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,880
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:49,120
Welcome to the Solstice! I knew it! That's what I was gonna do!

6
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,680
It's my brother, my brother, and we special summer solstice episode.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,520
As we dance amongst the fairy rings. The sky hangs high with the brightness of a

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
luna as the sun beams down on us from its highest position.

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,040
Lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt, lightning bolt.

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,800
Let's all start fucking. My, there's only three of us here.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,320
It's hugely creepy. I'm the oldest traveler, Justin McElroy.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm the middle-est and naked-est to Travis McElroy. I'm free!

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
I emerged from the mist one. I emerged from the mist two.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,960
I emerged from the mist three. Hi, my name is Griffin McElroy.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm a level 14 troll berserker. And I, sorry, I hate to.

16
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,080
One of you guys buffed me while I was emerging from the mist,

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,760
which is LARP rules like 101. You gotta wait for me to be summoned

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,720
before we can begin our encounter. I actually have an enchanted mirror of

19
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Conchlin Crong and it helps me to see you from the mist.

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,720
Have you had those new, those Fritos Conchlin Crong?

21
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,080
They're so good. They're buffalo blasted.

22
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,960
I did just watch Monster Camp again, so I am like coming hot and fresh

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,800
off the like, that glow that you get after you watch Monster Camp.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,080
People watch Monster Camp. I think you have to like rent it on Amazon Instant

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,600
Video or something like that. It's an important movie and it's one of

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,840
those movies that you watch it and you're like,

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,840
this is a crazy world I know nothing about and I never will. Look at these,

28
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,720
look at all these people. And then also you feel like,

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,880
could I maybe like uh, could I maybe dip in?

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,640
That is the great dark secret of Monster Camp is that you

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,840
watch it. You were the monster the whole time. You were the monster the whole time.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,480
You will watch this movie with your significant other

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,560
and your your wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend will be watching it and

34
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,400
laughing and you'll be laughing. Inside you there's another you that's not

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,760
laughing. Not laughing at all. There's another you that says maybe I

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,840
could dip in. It's weeping with a fantastic longing.

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,840
I want our listeners to know that I felt like that

38
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,280
goof was general enough that I can't imagine we were making fun of any

39
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,240
specific group. No, I think we were mostly making fun of ourselves.

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,680
Yeah, I felt that way too. Because of our distinct lack of knowledge of what the

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,760
Solstice is, what it does. Don't you take this as an opportunity to

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,520
educate it either, dear listeners. I'm onto your game. You can educate me.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,120
I like learning stuff. I'm not afraid to learn and expand and grow as a person.

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
I'm done with that. I feel like I have to with a with a child so close I feel

45
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,400
like I have to cauterize myself as a human. I have to like

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
you can't grow anymore. I don't want to grow anymore because that would be

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
confusing for them. So I basically just have to cap it off

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
here. Well and then it's all like bigotry and

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,600
ignorance and just waiting.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,280
I guess. Well and then you start to pass on your memories to the child

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
as like what it's like to sled and what the color red looks like.

52
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,440
Right. And and how cinnabons taste. And where the baby hole in the wall is where

53
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,920
you put the bad babies. Mm-hmm. That's dark book. Is it dark book?

54
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Dark book. I'm glad they want a new berry then. Yeah did it win a new berry?

55
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
I believe it won a new berry. Can we get to the comedy already? I'm dying

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,720
inside and outside. I have noticed that the way I shake

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,560
hands with people may be a little off. I have a firm grip

58
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,600
but I tend to counter the other person's pumps

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,760
with trying not to pump at all. Instead I flex my shoulder and arm

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,800
so while the person is trying to move their arm up and down my arm stays

61
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,920
completely still. Yeah pump that shit. Just try and pump that shit idiot. Pump it.

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,360
I imagine the other person encounters some unexpected resistance to an

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
otherwise routine bump or two. Brothers how am I supposed to be doing

64
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
this? You know how you're supposed to be doing

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,440
this? That's from wrestling in Winchester.

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,520
Now listen my brother my brother me listeners. Before you start laughing too

67
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
hard I've shaken a lot of your hands. You're

68
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,240
a wonderful people. Kind. Oh I love your spirit. So many of

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
you came up to the LA show. We met so many

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,760
so many beautiful hearts. Sometimes you're bad at handshakes. I've shaken a lot of

71
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,560
your hands. Some of you could pick up a tip or two.

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
That's all I'm saying. I always just assume that it's like

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,960
and not because I've done this before as well like if you're standing on a line

74
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,920
for something or you're waiting and you know that handshake's coming

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,440
like if somebody just encountered you at random was like hey and you shook their

76
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,600
hand you would nail it you know 100 percent

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,200
but then when you have time to think about it yeah I'm about to shake this

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,640
hand it's up and down right no wait hold on be proactive about it

79
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,640
wait if you're if you're waiting in line to like after one of our live shows you

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,320
want to shake our hand and like that's super cool um go ahead

81
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,760
and like get your hand ready do do a little bit of pre-pro on that

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,880
hand to make it perfect for us maybe breathe into it a little bit to

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,680
get it to the ideal temperature for me that's 96.5 a little bit cooler

84
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
than normal um I like a definitely not warmer

85
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,320
definitely not wet definitely dry that hair right off

86
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,640
I'm not sure which um which handshake I find more upsetting like

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,080
on the one hand you got the one that feels like their arm

88
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,600
was like somebody filled up a jello mold that's shaped like an arm

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
and then just kind of attached it to a person as if I wouldn't notice

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
I don't like that handshake but I think what I find even more upsetting

91
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,080
is like the super firm like they gotta like dog

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
like don't try oh I like that one don't try that fucking pickup artist bullshit

93
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
with me I just shake my hand I can win that one

94
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,640
so I like that yeah Travis is Travis has like extra knuckles

95
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,160
inside of his hand his hand is like a I don't know it's

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
bristling with knuckles on the inside the one I the the handshake I

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,920
dislike the most is that one where you go over the handshake and their hand

98
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,160
closes like a second too soon like some kind of awful claw game

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
oh yeah just they grab like your fingers instead of like your palm

100
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,640
yeah and then they get embarrassed and try and back out and it's like don't

101
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,400
back out just like fix it just fix it just back out now

102
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,520
this is what I'm gonna remember you by finger grabber handshake

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,200
is like making love there's no standard for it you have to

104
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,480
and you can get the presence from energy yeah

105
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,560
you have to see where they're going with it you can get crabs from it

106
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,960
you get all kinds of stuff this person is playing a dangerous fucking game

107
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,760
because if you ever meet your counterpart in this world

108
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,320
and you guys go in to shake hands and then both of you just grab hands

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,960
and then stand perfectly still you are holding hands at that point

110
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
that is cease to be a handshake you are holding hands if that's your boss

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,800
that's a whole ordeal we got to call HR into the room HR please witness this

112
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,680
this is just a shitty handshake we're not holding hands in the office

113
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,800
on office hours okay but here's is I can I get this a little you don't pump

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,800
you're not a pumper no but I I there's something to me that's

115
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,520
always seemed so calculated and forced about the like

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,240
handshake pump pump pump done there's something about like just a grab

117
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
and kind of a like a almost like just a flex is all the pump you get where it's

118
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,440
just like grab and like you're just kind of flexing

119
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,600
your arm and then you break off and that you go

120
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,720
you go into the you don't go up and down you go like in

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
and you hit yeah you're walking like Voltron it's kind of just like a yeah

122
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,080
put her that like a putter there yeah yeah yeah yeah

123
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,280
which I kind of dig that way more because it's much more of just like an

124
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,320
acknowledgement of like now our hands are together and now

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,800
our hands are apart and there was no kind of extraneous motion in there I

126
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
kind of dig that maybe but that said if the other person

127
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,600
starts to pump you don't just like stare me and go

128
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,600
don't leave them standing alone on pump island

129
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,800
you've got to fucking send them a raft uh I want to ask one other quick favor

130
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,720
since I know that this only applies to like people who do meet and greets after

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
their live podcasts so this won't be widely useful uh but it

132
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm using our show as like a megaphone for

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,000
my own wants and desires when you're at a thing

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
and someone says hi I'm Justin McElroy and and you say yes I know

135
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,000
that's incorrect

136
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
wrong you wanged it you wanged it because I

137
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
I know you know we're playing a game here you and I

138
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
we're going to meet each other it's an introduction I want to know you as a

139
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,360
human you may not believe that but I do I want

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,080
to know each and every one of you I wish I had the time after a live show to

141
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,880
have a nice 20 to 22 minute chat with each of you

142
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,840

143
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,200

145
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
and I cannot stress enough we love all of you please don't ever stop shaking

146
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,600
your hand and talking to us and being yeah we don't get because we need you

147
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,960
very much we need you can I say one thing that uh our our

148
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,960
listeners did fucking nail what uh and are consistently very good

149
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,680
about I was at the uh LA live show

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
and after you do like a live podcast or whatever

151
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,120
or a panel maybe or and you know or even like a wedding thing that you know

152
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,600
that you're gonna like shake a lot of hands afterwards

153
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,920
uh uh so I was in that mode right like I know I'm about to go shake everybody's

154
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
hand I had to pee super bad the show had just

155
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,800
ended there were and I was like I gotta hit the

156
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,160
bathroom I walk into the bathroom there's four people who I know were just

157
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,560
in the podcast watching my podcast show I peed I washed my hands I left not a

158
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,040
word was uttered to me nice like I was not there and I was like in my head

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,520

and Barney diversion and Barney is my idol

185
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
I was just wondering I'm in high secondary school

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,600
but I am known for being the suit guy but I feel like I lose this in school

187

other words become legend wait for it fuck you let's do this

189
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,880
question all right derp Barney is a fictional character fictional

190
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,880
character I want to be Robinson Caruso did I say Caruso that's not his name

191
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,200
he's a he's a caricature of a person uh in real life no one would like that

192
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
no one would no one even likes him on the fucking show

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,080
it's he's a punchline that's that's the thing is he's a goob

194
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,320
he's not he's not a real person you already fucked up if you're in high

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
school and you're the suit guy the suit guy is not a thing you want

196
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
to be in high now that said if you're in high school and you wear a suit good for

197
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,120
you I don't think anyone should ever be

198
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,440
identified as the blank guy no not good for you Travis you said a

199
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,400
bad thing don't wear no I don't want to judge listen if somebody

200
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,720
wants to wear a suit if someone wants to wear

201
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,240
a spider-man costume if somebody just wants to like roll out the school

202
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,320
incorrect no no I'm done with the idea that people in

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,960
high school should be making choices about their

204
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,480
identity and everybody should just passively be okay with it listen

205
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
you're still in your formative years okay I there's still a chance for me to

206
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,440
help you you wear a suit to weddings and funerals

207
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,880
stop it stop doing this you can wear a nice

208
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,040
a nice pair of slacks um and a a polo or a button down

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,560
if you want to elevate your fucking like jinko style

210
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,400
I get it I get it go for it but there's what if I want to wear

211
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,920
tearaway pants and a button-up dress shirt you mean like you

212
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,680
you mean like you did every goddamn day just

213
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,840
just as an example can I can I let me ask you a question real quick because

214
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,920
you did that was not a joke you wore

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,200
tearaway pants basically basically around the clock

216
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,960
were you getting so much trim that you I did not first of all needed to have

217
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,200
that first of all maybe once a week and it is

218
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,080
because I was in fucking show choir on pussy day

219
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,360
you mean they were comfy dance pants gotta be at the ready

220
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,080
Minutemen Minutemen assemble I mean my balls get out of here I like I like that

221
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,560
Travis's answer about uh uh meeting them for show choir was

222
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,160
actually an implicit answer to Griffin's question about how much

223
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,840
trim because that zero no no I don't know

224
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,880
I was in show because my girlfriend was in show choir

225
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,400
and you put on that sequin vest and you saying we built this city

226
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,400
and just the city was the year before me Griffin my year was things

227
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,680
got damp um we did more of like a Billy Joel

228
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,600
uh kind of style like oh it just got 10 times better in the erotic

229
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,040
actually I'm gonna I'm gonna hope against hope

230
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
that you were doing that because it was in that the the few years that uh

231
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,000
Billy Joel was married to one of uh Huntington's native daughters

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
and you were hoping that maybe he would come by see

233
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,800
Justin I live my life every second hoping Billy Joel comes by

234
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,280
so here's here's just his body not like him driving into your office window god

235
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,200
no here's a fun side story okay Billy Joel

236
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,560
marries have to have told this story before no I don't well

237
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,520
no I don't think so okay so Billy Joel married

238
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,640
Katie Lee who is somebody that um I knew a little bit we did some shows together

239
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,480
uh back in back in the day in the in the outdoor theater

240
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,360
so he married Katie Lee who then goes on to she hosts the first

241
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,600
season of Top Chef and she's done some other cookie shows

242
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,200
whatever that was after this so Billy Joel marries Katie Lee

243
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,360
and the the interesting thing about this is that it starts this like

244
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
weird it's starting it starts this weird sort of like

245
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,000
pseudo paranoia in Huntington that at any given moment Billy Joel could show up

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
to something and it's more of like an expectant thing

247
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,800
like a like a child whose parent has abandoned them

248
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
that every time they're at like the science fair or something they have that

249
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
like back of their head fantasy that maybe

250
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,120
they heard about it and their erstwhile father will show up

251
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,960
it was sort of like that with Billy Joel for a while anytime like a large house

252
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,480
sold in Huntington the room room mill would fly and it was

253
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,880
purchased by uh Dr. William Joel honorary uh and

254
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
and and it was his that was his home that there was gonna live there was a

255
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
bar on a home here that bar on 4th street that used to be

256
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,120
club echo that it peaked at club echo but it would like rotate every maybe

257
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,600
year and a half to become a different bar in the height of that fever it became

258
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,840
cno piano bar and i think it fucking became that

259
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,160
like expecting that maybe the jolster would cruise on through

260
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,840
a piano bar hey why i just happen to know a piano man

261
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,120
uh-huh billy just keep driving billy just well just once

262
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,400
no we're going to chickadees stop it could it hurt we're going to

263
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,440
we're going to stumblers to still stumbling we can't stop and see you know

264
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,120
piano bar we left your tab open before we went to see a movie at the camelot and

265
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,240
we said we'd be back and now we have to go back a lot of really great

266
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,880
lot of really great references another question yeah uh years ago my two best

267
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
friends who were dating had a wickedly ugly breakup which

268
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
resulted in me having to choose sides i sided with my homeboy and broke contact

269
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,880
completely with the other it's been six years and emotions have

270
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,360
subsided so i decided to bury the proverbial hatchet and just make peace

271
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,320
now she's inviting me to hang out as if nothing happened

272
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,600
when i don't even really know this person anymore

273
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,280
should i just accept that i open this pandora's box and jump back into things

274
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,560
or should i go with my gut and tread carefully that's from critically

275
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,800
confused in cranberry oh i feel

276
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,160
i feel some real advice coming on this it's been a while

277
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,320
uh-oh i know it's just like this is a thing that everybody i think has

278
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,320
to deal with it's like a combined thing of having to choose sides when your

279
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,480
friends break up is already pretty awful and it's unfair and it's

280
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,840
something you shouldn't have to do but we all have to do it at some point

281
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:39,600
um it is that combined with the like latent awkwardness of i haven't seen

282
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,480
this person in years do we like

283
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,160
making like the catch-up call to somebody that like you used to be really

284
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,880
good friends with and then you haven't talked to

285
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,280
uh is always like in your brain before you do it like the most going to be the

286
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,080
most fucking uncomfortable thing ever because you have to ask them like

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,960
what are you what are you well let me counter that though because i think that

288
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,800
it's my i think the ideal way to do it is you

289
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,680
kind of fake it till you make it kind of thing

290
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,880
no well hear me out where you jump in like

291
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,040
you know you just spoke the day before and then things kind of shake out where

292
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,000
it's like okay great i'm noticing that this is

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
different and this is different they like this now

294
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,240
instead of like let's sit down and have a 30 minute intensive conversation about

295
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,280
what's different in our lives no i think that's what you gotta do and

296
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,520
i think that's worth it because you can't just be like

297
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,400
you sit down hey hey it's good to see you you too should have done this a

298
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,000
while ago yeah sure so how's work like now i've been in grad

299
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,440
school for three years you fucked that one up next how's jimmy

300
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,640
jimmy's jimmy's astronaut now jimmy's in space i i don't see jimmy anymore he's

301
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
with the space men now he's a space jesus now how's your dog

302
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,800
dog died next keep it up do you wanna i i hear the

303
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,920
good are you saying that that's the ideal like that's what you have to do

304
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,560
no i'm saying that's what you get when you fake it when you until you make it

305
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,000
that's your strategy i sit down and i say let's just like

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,320
fucking hash it out you play mario kart 8 and like you don't talk about shit you

307
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,120
don't know the answer and then they leave and it's like oh fuck i forgot to

308
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,960
ask anything about you because i don't know

309
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
anything about you i guess our whole relationship we have to be playing

310
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
mario kart 8 whenever you come over now shit that's kind of weird to me

311
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,240
in this question uh i don't you said it's been six years and emotions

312
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,680
subsided so you decided to bury the proverbial hatchet make peace

313
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,080
what where does your homeboy figure into this what is his

314
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,920
like did you ask his blessing before burying this this hat i don't think you

315
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,640
need to six years is a long fucking time six

316
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
years is a really long time how bad were these emotions at

317
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,720
six years yeah i mean it could not be it couldn't be that it could just be like

318
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,240
you stopped hanging out with this person and when you do that like they left your

319
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,680
mind's eye and you didn't like think to do this i'm

320
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,400
saying it's always worth it to like to try and

321
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
reconnect with a person like it's always so great because then you have like

322
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,280
one of your old friends is back it's always like the best thing

323
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,320
ever it's just like broaching that subject is always really rough i think

324
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,560
you have to be like really open about it like

325
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,920
hey we lost touch and that sucked let's just like

326
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,000
just run through it let's this hangout is going to be us like fucking

327
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,280
getting through the past six years and then the next time we hang out it can be

328
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,200
just like what did you do this you will honestly you will be surprised how

329
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,880
quickly you can wrap up the important things in six years it's easy and like

330
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,840
they're doing it they want to do it too i'm with you guys on this they don't

331
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,840
know what you've been up to like they're in the same boat like because

332
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
in any in any relationship communication is key right like that's the thing

333
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,080
so i changed my mind how because here's the thing if you really are going to

334
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,880
re-establish a a true friendship with this person you

335
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,960
were best friends before this all shook out

336
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,640
and now you're looking to like rebuild that i think it's perfectly justified

337
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
would be like hey i feel like you know we really grew apart in

338
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,840
that six years and we lost contact so what's up but you know let's

339
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,600
let's catch up i would find it so flattering i would find it so flattering

340
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
that like you want to put in the effort to like

341
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,360
the like this relationship meant something to us at some point like it

342
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,600
really means a lot to me that you want to like work to to get us back

343
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,720
to where we were like i don't know man i think it's i think

344
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,760
it's super it's super nice and it's something like i'm

345
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,240
i'm dishing it out but like it's something i struggle with i've been going

346
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,320
to a lot of weddings this year and like reconnecting with like my literally my

347
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,040
oldest dearest friends that i'm just like such a

348
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,120
shithead about you know calling once a month or so

349
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,440
um i i think the more that you do it i think i feel like that's a big part of

350
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,080
becoming an adult is like realizing that everybody that you

351
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,440
were friends with in school coming up have also become

352
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,360
adults and it's so fucking cool to like talk to

353
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,280
them and see like how you guys have how you guys

354
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,200
have developed things broke bad but most of the time

355
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
they're not gonna get weird the nature problem with these

356
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,760
conversations this is why it's such a like this is why a lot of times in my

357
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,560
life i will avoid these conversations because

358
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,760
i'm so afraid of saying to the person like

359
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,320
so how is this person that i sort of kind of remember from your family

360
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,400
and they're dead and like that's i can't even process that

361
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,800
like this is not a goof like i i'm i worry enough about that that

362
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,880
that i will actually avoid conversations like this because i i i am so paranoid

363
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,800
about i i think it's honestly just like looking

364
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,560
stupid because i don't think people would be like upset

365
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,600
angry at you like i i'm just worried about looking

366
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
dumb in front of a person and saying like the stupidest thing

367
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
but geez isn't that like a litmus test where if the person's like

368
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
uh they're dead and you're like okay so's this friendship

369
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,400
like where that person's gonna judge you for not knowing this thing because you

370
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
haven't spoken anxiety isn't really rooted in

371
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,360
like social anxiety especially isn't really rooted in

372
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
the realities of the situation because almost with all of these like the worst

373
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,120
like people are usually very sort of like generous and kind about

374
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,840
conversation that's the thing you have to like

375
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,880
concretely remind yourself of but but you know

376
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,560
it's not really rooted in the realities of how they're going to react it's like

377
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,840
yeah it's just that's just the paranoia start start general

378
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,600
like i i start with like so what do you like what are you doing now like where

379
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,840
do you live that's a good one like where do you live

380
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,800
and what do you do there is a good way to like start out and then

381
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,720
like you get your feet wet from there don't start with who in your family

382
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,200
died this year like that and don't and try to say general i think don't ask

383
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
like are you still really into deep blue

384
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,320
something because i seem to remember you being very into that band

385
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,120
sure and what if their answer is yes i'm a groupie for them

386
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,040
hi they let me in the band i'm in the band i hand job to all all of them

387
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,400
yes could you just throw out like how's your family and then

388
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
let them fill in the blanks as they feel comfortable with that's like as

389
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,640
opposed to like well as opposed to like how's your dad

390
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,360
doing how's your brother who had all those

391
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,560
risky tendencies keep it keep it real keep it real real general i think and

392
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,120
and a lot of people in your life that's gonna like

393
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,240
whatever they tell you is probably going to be a pretty good indication of who

394
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,800
they are and then you can move on from there but it's it's

395
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,080
it's hard and it gets harder the longer you go without

396
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,680
talking but man like i never get off a phone call

397
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,640
with one of my friends that i haven't talked to in a few months without feeling

398
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,800
like fucking awesome about it yeah um

399
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,760
you're right griff i need to just get over and just do that more just because

400
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,720
it really feels kind of like finding a time capsule we were like oh yeah

401
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
there's all this awesome stuff i forgot about

402
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,040
yeah and you think i i think this is one of the problems with like

403
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,840
i've really turned a corner on twitter and facebook i kind of think they're the

404
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,400
fucking worst now um and i think it's because like you

405
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,920
follow your friends on there and you see pictures of like the food that they

406
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,520
eat in the vacations that they take and you think like

407
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,800
man i really know what this guy's up to now

408
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,040
but you fucking don't like you gotta call them and you need to like actually have

409
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,960
a human conversation with them and then you will and then you'll know

410
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,680
you trick it social media is like a way of tricking yourself into thinking you're

411
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,440
staying in really good touch with their friends

412
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,640
but really you're just like a creepy voyeur of their the

413
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,320
meals that they eat well i but i will say this i think the one thing that

414
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,880
facebook really does well for me is even if it's not

415
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,000
deep it at least keeps in my mind's eye like hey you haven't talked to jordan in

416
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
a while and it's like oh yeah you know what you're

417
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,320
right i haven't i don't know it's like you can if you see

418
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,000
someone coming up that you know they haven't talked in a

419
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,160
long time you can sort of hide in their periphery

420
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,280
as you check their facebook and there is also that

421
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,480
get get a few sort of ground things grounders

422
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,160
i call them yeah a few easy ones you can ask about because yeah then you always

423
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,880
have the hey i saw on facebook that you just got a new puppy

424
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,400
how's that going and then you've got weird things

425
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,000
i don't know now i say that i would say no don't say that out loud no that

426
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,560
seems like hey i know we haven't talked in six years but i

427
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,760
looked at oh i still watch but isn't that completely socially

428
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,720
accepted at this point that people look at your facebook all like

429
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,320
hey the reason i follow you on facebook is so i know this shit it's not like

430
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,880
but it's not like you're nsa hacking them like no

431
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,400
i prismed you and it looks like you're really happy with that new man

432
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,080
i guess it might be naive of me to say this but i would like to think that if

433
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,160
you were close with this person they they might be feeling the same

434
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,520
thing and saying like hey i don't want this to be awkward but

435
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,760
it's been so long since we talked let's just like get down to it i i mean

436
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,640
i would like to think that would be the best way to approach it i know

437
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,280
that's completely different from how i started

438
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,720
yeah we changed we changed minds together just yeah but it's like you know

439
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,400
what just like be real and if they were really your friend and

440
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,960
if that's really a connection you want to rebuild

441
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
then rebuild it and sometimes that takes work and sometimes that work

442
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,800
is this is scary it's going on too long i love you

443
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,880
i got it it's taking forever it's just that i miss you get it i feel like we

444
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,040
never talk we get it we just never talk and i miss you

445
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,360
get it we get it we get it whatever you have to we get it

446
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,000
okay i get your whole thing i get it you're just wrong

447
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,680
we we just did like 30 minutes on that question we were wrong the whole time

448
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,240
you didn't say anything i just got i got bored enough that all i

449
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,640
just did i just think you feel like you're wrong

450
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
i feel like no right answer should take that long to explain

451
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,600
i feel like the easier the the simpler answer is usually the right one isn't

452
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,080
that what ockham's razor is yeah i think ockham's razor is from harrys.com

453
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,720

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,880
they're not bad they're pretty good can we talk about the companies that did

457
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:12,240
give us money to talk about the product

458
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,760
problem with doing ads for major companies

459
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,520
is that you get all this money and you don't have anywhere to put it

460
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,000
it is such an issue i deal with it every day i deal with it every day we insist

476
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,560
just burning a hole in my pocket you can actually deposit hodors from

477
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,520
your phone now here's the way that works you take a picture of it

478
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,040
and then you and then they scan it and they say okay that one counts and then

479
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,640
you burn it yeah you burn that in your account he's

480
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,400
gonna be scared of the of the fire and the technology the

481
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,600
whole process is not going to be great for the hodor but you've got to

482
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,240
digitize them you got to uh it's just like tron uh it's

484
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,480
for when you forget to pay your roommates for that cheetos bag

485
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,480

486
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,040

487
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,200
bag of cheetos they're not selling collectible cheeto

488
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,040

when you have to pay your roommate for that cheetos bag what is there

493
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,280

solution on earth oh they've solved banking they

495
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,160
fixed banking but it sounds like their whole situation

496
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,160
maybe their home life is not so great i mean it also says

497
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,320
pay your bills fast before your hot pocket is done microwaving

498
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,520

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,360
for you dear listeners that will shock you and there has never been

636
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,800
an advertiser that has pulled their advertising from

637
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,800
our show nope uh and i think we keep pushing it just to

638
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,640
like we keep walking the line because i think we kind of deep down want that

639
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,360
eventually like we want that to happen we're trying

640
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,640
to be controversial like we really are i don't think they

641
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,080
listen that's what that or it's some kind of

642
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,200
like weird shaming thing where they're like we do deserve

643
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,920
advertising as uh masochism apparently sure hey ross

644
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,440
hey carrie hey it's me your co-host oh yeah we have a show don't we have a

645
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,400
show oh no ross and carrie it's about

646
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,560
undercover investigations of fringe groups

647
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,800
yeah like the toni olamo ministries cult yep that's led by a pedophile

648
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,400
he's in jail he's in jail also we became mormons we became raelians

649
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,520
which is a ufo group that's right we joined the ordo templi

650
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,360
orientis yes the 911 truthers we got cupped we got

651
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,560
acupunctured we got rakey we've pretty much anything that you've

652
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,000
heard of and been like that doesn't sound quite right we've done

653
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,840
that so you don't have to do it so if you want to hear about this and

654
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,040
you should then go to maximum fun dot org

655
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,720
uh this yahoo was sent in by tanner thank you tanner it's by yahoo answers

656
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,800
user naomi who asks i got baptized then smoked

657
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,880
weed a day later and this happened i got baptized on

658
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,040
wednesday then smoked some weed well reggie

659
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,560
is that like a brand of nickname is that like a strain

660
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,600
hold on i'll hook it up you guys go on i'm on that reginald

661
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:32,720
on thursday on that val johnson i'm on that reginald val johnson

662
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,720
on thursday i've smoked okay fuck this question no punctuation i got

663
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,560
baptized on wednesday then i smoked that sweet dank reginald val johnson on

664
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,800
thursday i've smoked before so it wasn't new to

665
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,600
me and then it says in d

666
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,520
which is like maybe a typo maybe they meant to say in bd like no big deal

667
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,640
so at first i was feeling good just chilling

668
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,120
then like 40 minutes later i got in the car and was going to drive home but

669
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:10,880
everything went right then black and then another in d

670
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,000
i couldn't see i drove over a curve curb and got really dizzy and threw up

671
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
after that i was a little high and felt pretty much sober

672
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,120
but that had never happened to me before i've smoked

673
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,960
way more than that before and not long ago from that day

674
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,040
so i don't know what happened any clues

675
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,200
just to clarify reggie is like regular like street grade

676
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,520
weed

677
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,880
that's uh that sucks because reginald val johnson

678
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,040
is far from a regular street grade actor no he is definitely top quality he is

679
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,360
that is dank kush prime kush is this person's theory that had

680
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,640
they not been baptized this wouldn't have happened but because they were

681
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,520
baptized jesus looked down and said like oh

682
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,960
smoking weed a can't do that you got smoked them you

683
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,840
gotten sanctified waters and that will blend

684
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,680
with that good good reginald cannabis inside your body

685
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,400
that dank dank kush and it's going to create a chemical reaction in your body

686
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
that is going to be a fucking like visceral experience

687
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,800
oh so it's like it's a cross like bong water and holy water together

688
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,560
gonna fuck you up not like jesus was like no more weed for you

689
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,640
no i mean there's a purely scientific reason for it sanctified water

690
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,520
plus val johnson tight tight smoke in your lungs i feel like enough

691
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,600
time passes between the introduction of the fact that this person got

692
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,640
baptized and the end of the question that it almost takes on sort of a a

693
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,600
checkoff's gun uh uh veneer so that you don't you

694
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,640
aren't actively thinking about it and maybe that's the twist

695
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,400
it's like you're it gives you long enough to sort of forget about it and

696
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,400
then so when it pops back up you're like oh that makes perfect sense so maybe

697
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
this question i sort of literally did not remember

698
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,640
the baptism part and when people circle back around on it oh

699
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,000
actually now that you mentioned that baptism i've forgotten i call that i

700
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,520
call that trope burke's law because that was every episode of burke's

701
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,880
law well they fucking show you they give you

702
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,800
all the clues that you need to solve the mystery

703
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,840
it's right there at the beginning especially if you're 75

704
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,440
if you're 75 years old you're gonna figure it out it is slylock fox level

705
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,440
difficulty um we can agree that this person had

706
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,360
an embolism right or i don't think that that is what happened

707
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,200
i think that i am a huge advocate for not a huge

708
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,760
advocate i don't actually for smoking weed and driving

709
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,880
i support no i support no i no no i support the legalization of marijuana

710
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,040
pretty broadly these are helpful reminders i think

711
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,160
i think is a is a helpful reminder that not just the smart people get to

712
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,800
purchase legal weed there are going to be some people that

713
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,640
get baptized and then get super reggie high the next day and then

714
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,560
think you know what i'm going to motor on over

715
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,320
to a destination of my choice in a car a heavy one too a real heavy the heaviest

716
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,160
car i can find i'm just gonna get get to driving in the

717
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,920
heaviest car i can find i'm a little high but i'm mostly over puke

718
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,920
should i take the smart car nah i'll go with the homer

719
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,440
is it possible that the original val johnson was was laced with a little

720
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,760
urkel

721
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,040
i'm on that urk i'm on that jaleel i mean just like a

722
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,400
five percent urk mix you know what i mean just enough you're like yeah i feel

723
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,640
fine but then you introduce like a bunch of

724
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,880
moving objects in your rear view mirror and suddenly blackout puke puke puke

725
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,960
you said you were selling the reggie this is this is fucking richie

726
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,960
this is bullshit i paid top dollar richie was a character on that show

727
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,080
little yeah he was the little kid he was the littlest richie

728
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:12,240
um guys is it cool to like when he got baptized did he not be like

729
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:19,040
as part of this ritual i promise to you jesus that i'm not gonna

730
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,440
do as much weed smoking i'm gonna give you like a 24 hour

731
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,600
window of just like blissing out on these holy waters i don't think jesus

732
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:35,040
gives two shits either way i guess not but this guy obviously

733
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,400
thinks that there's a connection there because he has smoked this reggie on

734
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,840
the reg on the reg so like reggie on the reg this has never

735
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,240
happened to him before and he seems like the kind of person

736
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,000
that smokes a lot of weed he seemed like an informed scientist

737
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,200
he's taken notes and a complex journey which is what makes me think that this

738
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,920
reaction transcends science i don't know guys i think there

739
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,440
might be a little uh i think i think you might have gotten

740
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,760
touched by angel this week on divine intervention

741
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,800
maybe i've watched that show by the way makes you think

742
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,080
have you listened to the bim bam yeah that podcast makes me think

743
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,760
and that's why i like it i wonder if this person got to the end of writing

744
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,840
this question and thought what am i doing

745
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:27,520
what what am i doing here i i don't think there's even a question

746
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,840
what am i doing i think we're just a weird story i'm telling

747
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,400
i feel like i'm telling a weird story i don't know what the response would be

748
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,040
or who could respond to and i have to get ready for work as vice president of

749
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,720
the united states of america

750
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,720
i got another question for you guys i'm getting married next may

751
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,680
while planning the celebration has been a breeze my fiancé

752
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:55,600
and i have hit on one point of conflict whether to have a wedding cake

753
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,720
or go non-traditional to have a wedding pie

754
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,520
if i can get you brothers on my side maybe my big day will have that extra

755
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,920
berry filling to put it over the top that's from fearfully frosted in

756
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,400
philadelphia now you can't see this at home

757
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,200
but uh the f from fearfully frosted has been translated

758
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,480
to replace the ph in philadelphia oh that's fine

759
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,360
can i tell you something choose i love the way that you say the word fiancé you

760
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,400
sound like john malkovich's character in rounders

761
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,440
when you say like trying to say fancy yeah

762
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:35,360
fancy um um chick chick chick let's all

763
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,640
simultaneously do our teddy kgb impressions

764
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:46,160
chick you give some money money that was my favorite i we're a cake

765
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:52,000
family damn it um this this used to be like the big

766
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,360
point for i feel like we had again have to have talked about this on the show

767
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,600
like uh we used to have like brutal fights

768
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,880
about whether cake or pie was better um

769
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,040
i feel like i feel like wedding traditions in our generation have been

770
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,120
all but phased out yeah at this point don't you think i

771
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,840
think that the idea of doing something because it's traditional

772
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,200
is the wrong reason to do anything if you're saying

773
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,720
i want pie and my fiancé wants cake that's a much different discussion then

774
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,720
we both want to have pie but he's worried about breaking i actually feel

775
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,280
like the commerce the conversation about whether or

776
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,760
not to have cake or pie at x event is more important than the

777
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,840
conversation as to whether or not it's important at a wedding just the

778
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,320
general question is the is the thing you need to be worried

779
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,800
about whether cake or pie is more delicious

780
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,920
right and we can't get into this we could let me throw this out

781
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,280
both yeah what have a groom's a groom's pie

782
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,360
yeah you know at our wedding we did uh like cheesecake bites

783
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:00,160
because we love cheesecake and that was the way we went with it and then

784
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,280
and it was kind of that well but not what i would have guessed well here's the

785
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,360
point of the story is that we were worried about it going in

786
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,680
like oh is this weird because we're not going to

787
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,200
have like you know the traditional like three-tiered cake or whatever

788
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,560
and then it was one of the things that people talked about most of like

789
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:20,320
i love that that was so cute and so you guys and blah blah blah it's functional

790
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,200
too and i have to worry about like fucking like waiting

791
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,720
my turn to get like a person who didn't want to be there to like

792
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,960
cut me off a big old chunk is the chunk too big i can't eat all this but i have

793
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,080
to also feel guilty is it too small and i have to go wait and fucking

794
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,480
line again and yeah we just set out like cake

795
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,280
plates on each table with cheesecake on them it was

bit fish out of water was that before or after i made you drive

816

00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,800
i had to get them i had to get them from the underwear spot

819
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,760
where he kept all of the things and i had to get it

820
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,440
and i touched them to yeah they acknowledged that they i had to

821
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,720
i had to okay here's the order i learned about them

822
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,640
i said that's terrible then i learned that i would have to retrieve touch

823
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:39,920
no feel believe hold grasp acknowledge become

824
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,280
embrace absorb and now you guys are doing that at home

825
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,960
they were silky as fuck no they were silky and they were black

826
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,160
and they were kind of black just a little bit sheer just a little

827
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,160
bit sheer so i just just like i'm a little bit dead now i acknowledged that

828
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,120
they existed i had to touch them my balls went into thought about

829
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,840
Travis thought about Travis's balls how they would feel

830
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:03,360
inside of them had to acknowledge the moment where Travis

831
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:08,480
decided to get special wedding underwear then go to a store possibly with his

832
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,960
bride to be had to think had to learn a lot about

833
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,640
traps more of an impulse buy it was a lot more of an impulse buy where i

834
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,760
looked and i said you know that's gonna feel real good i had to learn a lot

835
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,920
about Teresa that i didn't know and the things that she prefers

836
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,520

pop up video behind the music i bought the wedding underpants

841
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:46,640
not for a sexy bent but because i knew the silky smooth material

842
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,160
would prevent any chafing day of which i didn't want to deal with as i'm walking

down the aisle i need to call on you Travis uh

impulse buy the the decision to send your brother

to go get your special wedding and it was malicious

847
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,160
it was a combination of because i knew that if i didn't

i would think about it all day because that's the way my brain works like oh
