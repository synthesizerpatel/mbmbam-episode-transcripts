1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:50,640
Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Candlelight Eve Eve episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me,

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,320
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I am your sweet baby Jesus in a manger, even though that's not really Candlelight's canon

9
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,600
McElroy. It's more like sweet baby Stephen in an oversized down comforter.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
There probably was a baby named Stephen born on Candlelight's at some point in history.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Speaking of what- And they probably put him in a barn.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
What day does Candlelight's fall on this year?

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
You have to consult the calendar handed out by your local butcher.

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
You have your butcher's calendar, don't you? Just check your butcher's calendar.

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,680
Why would he have his hands on that?

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,840
Because he also makes calendars to raise money for his butcher business.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
Butcher business doesn't rake it in like it used to.

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,680
This feels like a very local occurrence, though.

19
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
Do people all go to my butcher to find out what day it is,

20
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,160
or are they just relying on me to break this news out?

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, he has a website. I mean, goddamn it, Griffin, it's 2013.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,600
Nice, that's a good point. The Candlelight's is an agnostic pan-religious pansexual

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,760
celebration of all things personal pan-sized. Hydroponic.

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,200
It's automatic. It is much like Greased Lightning in that it is a real pussy wagon,

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,080
and it is a holiday for men and women, boys and girls.

26
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,480
You know, we are coming up on it. It is fast approaching. Open up the advent calendar.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,880
Pop this window open. How many days left?

28
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,600
What's back there?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,880
It's Griffin's pinky toe.

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,680
It's my pinky toe.

31
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,480
You know how Thanksgiving and Hanukkah were at the same time this year?

32
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,960
It's like the first time that it's happened in like 5,000 years.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Candlelight's can't do that shit because Candlelight's will like fucking eat the other

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,920
holiday and gain its nutrients and power. It's like a parasitic vine, you know,

35
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,000
where it wraps around and then the thing inside dies and then it looks like the whole tree is

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,960
like flowering. But don't touch it.

37
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,080
It'll spit poison at you. It'll spit poison at you. What a fun holiday.

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,200
I figure Christmas as a holiday has maybe five to six more months before it's just

39
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,560
completely overtaken by Candlelight's. Once our branding train starts going,

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,360
and then it'll hit Christmas. Imagine Christmas as a man and then it'll hit him and then,

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,360
you know, how his trains hit men.

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,360
It's basically Christmas and dreidels and latkes and Kwanzaa songs.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,800
Yeah. So we took the best parts of each holiday, right? Like Kwanzaa songs clearly beat the ever

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,920
loving shit out of Christmas songs, out of Hanukkah songs. But Hanukkah has the best breads.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
Mm hmm.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,640
But Christmas, you know, we got the trees, you know, those are smelling pretty good.

47
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
So we got sights, we got smells, we got sounds, we got flavors, we got touches.

48
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,880
Candlelight's.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,640
Candlelight's. Catch the wave.

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,080
And in case anyone was wondering, the Candlelight's, the color scheme is more of,

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
sort of like the red and green, because that's too, you know, that's been done.

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,800
We do like a purple and brown, kind of like peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

53
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,920
Kind of like a PBJ.

54
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,320
Our Candlelight's special episode will be going up on the 23rd, I guess,

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,840
and that will be a cuss-free, calling it cussing makes me laugh, cuss-free episode of our show.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,000
No wordy nerds at all.

57
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Appropriate for the whole family, except conceptually.

58
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,960
Conceptually, it'll still be challenging material.

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,800
The ideas will be adult. You know what it'll be? It'll be like a,

60
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
it'll be like a particularly raunchy episode of Married with Children.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,500
Yeah.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,040
It'll be, there'll be a lot of Christina Applegate in this particular episode.

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,540
Yeah.

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,840
And I'm doing a lot of suggested things. Maybe there's a car wash.

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
You won't see any areola, you won't see any areolas or nothing,

66
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,640
but you'll like know that they're there.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,640
She gets acid in her eyes and has to take a chemical shower and lab class.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,320
You'll be, you'll be areola adjacent if you spend the candlelight's with us.

69
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
You'll know you're there. You'll know they're there.

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,080
You will know they're there.

71
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,520
There will be no doubt about it.

72
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
This is an advice show, so let's do it.

73
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,640
Hey brothers, I've been dating a woman for about six months and things are going well.

74
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,920
Problem, her birthday is a week before Christmas,

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,560
so in the past it's been lumped in with the holiday.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,960
Any ideas for how to make her birthday special and have it stand out from the holidays?

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Right now I'm planning on taking her out to dinner, but not sure what else to do.

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,080
And that's thanks timing troubles in Texas.

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Can you, can you not just have a birthday party?

80
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,280
It's too close though, right?

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,960
Like is your worry that it will accidentally become a Christmas party?

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,320
Ha shit, they showed up in sweaters with presents.

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
No, but like eggnog everywhere.

84
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,840
Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year.

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,880
It beats the shit out of any birthday you could ever possibly have, right?

86
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,720
So when you have them that close together,

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,960
I think that there's, there's just sort of a natural comparison that goes on there.

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,240
And people say, well, it was nice, but, um, you know,

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,880
my entire family wasn't there and there wasn't eggnog.

90
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,680
Uh, the other benefit to candlelight's is that you never have this problem.

91
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,560
Candlelight's is so long that about one third to two thirds of the population

92
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
has a birthday in or near candlelight's.

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
It is hard to get away from it.

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,400
We cover like four astrological signs.

95
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
With most holidays, there's a debate as to when you can start decorating.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,080
For the holiday with candlelight's, the question is when you can stop decorating.

97
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,200
You just can't.

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,800
And usually it's just when the support structures in your house begin to bend

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,880
and moan under the weight of the trimmings and the deckings.

100
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe you could decorate her like a birthday tree.

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
Maybe string some birthday garland.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
This is kind of a weird sentence.

103
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,880
What?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,800
You're just sort of conflating like a lot of ideas that don't.

105
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,000
No, like you light some, you light the birthday candles and the birthday wreaths.

106
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,480
Um, you sing some birthday carols.

107
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,600
You light the wreaths?

108
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,360
You light the candles and the wreaths.

109
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
It's a fucking exciting birthday.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
Well, you gotta, you gotta flameproof the wreath.

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,440
Is this your first birthday wreath?

112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Um, you ever birthday wreath before?

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
God, if somebody's, if this is somebody's first episode of the podcast and you're like,

114
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
who are these fucking clowns that don't understand holidays?

115
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,880
It's like we're three aliens that just came to this planet.

116
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm like, take me to your Halloween turkey.

117
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,160
I'm, I'm willing to bet, question asker, that if this person has spent their entire life

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,240
with their birthday, getting lumped in at the Christmas, you doing any amount to make

119
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,880
them feel special will go such a long way.

120
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,960
Just like completely, you taking them out to a nice dinner and making it all about them

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
and not, because I bet the lumping is like mostly in like the present department.

122
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,640
It's a birthday and Christmas.

123
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,720
Good luck escaping it though.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Like you can't get away from Christmas because it's everywhere.

125
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,800
You can't pretend that it's not Christmas.

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
I don't think to avoid lumping it, you have to pretend like Christmas doesn't exist.

127
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,880
You just make it about the person, you know, because I would bet that's the problem is

128
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,720
that it's hard to throw a party because everyone's throwing Christmas parties.

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,160
It's hard to, you know, they probably got one gift for Christmas and birthday that probably

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,720
the family came in and said, let's celebrate on the 23rd because the whole family will

131
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,280
be in town.

132
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,720
The problem is that it is about, the problem is it's already about a person stretching

133
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,760
back to like already Christmas has exploded beyond its seams all the way back to like

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,880
the middle of November.

135
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,600
So the only person that's about it is Juicy Crust.

136
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,480
Well, Juicy Crust has got to be pissed because no one celebrates his birthday.

137
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,680
They just celebrate Christmas.

138
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,520
You know, you could, we picked an arbitrary date for Jesus's birthday and that's bad

139
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:44,640
luck for you, but what you could do is change your birthday, maybe step off my lord and

140
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
savior, let him have his time.

141
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
He was there first.

142
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,120
He did get here first and he did have to sleep in a manger.

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,840
It kind of sucks.

144
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,280
I feel really bad for anybody in this situation.

145
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,760
I've always secretly felt bad for you two because like my birthday's in April, so you

146
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
get like a nice gap there.

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,680
It's like a little stop gap of like, man, it sure has been a few months since I got some presents.

148
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,280
And then I get them.

149
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,040
For you guys, it's like, blah, blah, blah, blah.

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,000
I mean, my birthday's about two months away from Christmas.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,360
Yeah, but the year, if you look at it, if you look at the year as a whole, like it's

152
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
kind of, it's kind of top heavy for you two.

153
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
And you don't have a lot to like space you out.

154
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Me, like I'm wandering through the desert and then I reach April, I'm like, oh, present

155
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:25,840
oasis.

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
What about Easter, dawg?

157
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,480
You're just getting birthday baskets.

158
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,400
Um, we don't really do that anymore.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Kind of 30.

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,120
Kind of like 30.

161
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,400
We're all pretty much 30.

162
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
So you guys don't get Easter baskets?

163
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,400
I get Easter baskets.

164
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,960
Do you really?

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,200
What did you do to stay in good with that big bunny?

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,760
Um, I married someone who still does Easter.

167
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,840
So should I get back in it?

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,160
Like you guys, I mean, all three of us are like super into holidays.

169
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,240
I have like done fell off the Easter.

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,960
You need to get back into Easter because here's the jam of Easter.

171
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
Completely off topic.

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
But Easter is just a just an excuse.

173
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,520
It's like it's like Halloween for adults for lazy people.

174
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,240
It's like trick or treat for lazy people because you don't have to go door to door.

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,400
Someone just hands you a basket full of candy.

176
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,440
Yeah, it says go to town.

177
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
I'll take any excuse to eat a whole ham.

178
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,600
I know I'm I'm I say next Easter we we appropriate that one too.

179
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, no.

180
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,640
Here's the fucking problem though.

181
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
I just talked to all this shit about how it sucks to have your birthday around Christmas.

182
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,240
But my birthday is basically Easter.

183
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,960
So if I start doing Easter, then I'm going to start feeling the redundancy.

184
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,480
I'm gonna have to move my shit to like what?

185
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:32,980
August?

186
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,280
Move your shit to August.

187
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
I that's what I would say.

188
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,000
You run into flag day in August?

189
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Oh, we tear that shit up on flag day, though, in Austin.

190
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Yeah, is that pop off?

191
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,720
It pops.

192
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,280
Right pop.

193
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
What's a month that has nothing in it?

194
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,280
I mean, April occasionally you get out of but April Fools is still in April.

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
This is pretty fun.

196
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
I mean, I know maybe veterans memorials.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,880
One of those is in there.

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,000
You know what?

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,960
Nothing's in August.

200
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,160
I really don't think August has much going on, except it has it has like a labor or a

201
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,800
president's or a veterans or memorials.

202
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,160
Those four are all pretty.

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,160
I think they swap places actually secretly every year.

204
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,880
Yeah, it's hard to people have to tell me I don't keep a very good you.

205
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,680
Is there a June?

206
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,400
What's in June?

207
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Arbor Day.

208
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,520
Flag Day.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,640
How about a Yahoo?

210
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
Because this bit is getting a little long in the tooth.

211
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
This Yahoo was sent in by Elizabeth Scott.

212
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Thank you, Elizabeth.

213
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Celine Lola Pasman, who asks,

214
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,840
Is it normal to hang out with your lunch lady?

215
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:49,680
Okay, so I want to go to Warped Tour with my lunch lady.

216
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,180
Whoa.

217
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,260
But we're both still debating either or not.

218
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,380
It's illegal.

219
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,340
So is it additional additional details?

220
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,020
She won't go to jail, will she?

221
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,740
Because she listens to some really cool bands and stuff.

222
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,700
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

223
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,780
This is asked by someone named Selena, so I'm going to assume a girl.

224
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,940
Celine Lola Pasman.

225
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,300
Okay, young girl.

226
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,620
Let's put her in.

227
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,420
Let's not jump to let's not jump to conclusion.

228
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Middle school or high school?

229
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
Definitely high school.

230
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,940
Benefit of the doubt, high school.

231
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,060
Okay, so let's say 16, 17 year old.

232
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,280
Okay.

233
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,420
Discovering your own body.

234
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,460
Discovered her sexuality.

235
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,260
Go on.

236
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,380
Not in the context of this question.

237
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,980
Just like, that's where she is.

238
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,020
That's where she's at.

239
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,900
That's just where she's at.

240
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,500
But her lunch lady, super cool.

242
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,460
Fucking super cool.

243
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,700
Let's skew young on the lunch lady and say like 28, 29.

244
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,660
Graduated from college with like a biochemistry degree,

245
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,260
but then never really did anything with it.

246
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,900
Never really.

247
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,100
She's a lunch lady.

248
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,600
Yeah.

249
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,180
But she's still super cool.

250
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,100
She's really into molecular gastronomy,

251
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,060
but she doesn't really get a lot of time to like practice it at work.

252
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,940
So she just wants to go to fucking warp tour.

253
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,980
She does cool stuff too.

254
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,380
Like she'll chop up the super donuts and like

255
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,180
refry them with an injection of like cayenne pepper or something.

256
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,780
Oh, that sounds delicious.

257
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,180
So we're assuming that Celine is a super cool like 16, 17 year old.

258
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,420
Really mature for her age, old soul.

259
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,620
Yeah, definitely.

260
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,100
There's something going on behind the eyes.

261
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,060
That she's not your regular every day, 16, 17 year old.

262
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,980
I'm going to say it's okay.

263
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,580
I'm going to say I'd watch that movie.

264
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,780
I think it would be a good movie.

265
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,580
It's an unconventional relationship, but it's one that I can certainly celebrate.

266
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:40,900
I do think though, you got to at some point in this film we've created in this fiction,

267
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,940
I think, and I think our question asker here is going to run into the same thing.

268
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,260
I think society is going to judge.

269
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,060
They're not going to understand like we understand this very special relationship

270
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,060
that we've constructed from whole cloth.

271
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,420
They're not going to see Celine and Lunchy the way that we see them.

272
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,980
Can we give her like, we've given her a fucking life.

273
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,140
We just breathed life into this woman.

274
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,140
Like the fucking hit film AI.

275
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,900
Like we just created this person.

276
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Can we give her a God damn name?

277
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,380
How about this?

278
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,060
I feel like Lunch-a-rella.

279
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,020
Okay, Lunch-o.

280
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,900
How about just Lunch-o?

281
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,140
If we're going to fucking be dicks about it, let's just do Lunch-o.

282
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,420
How about Lunch-o McGee?

283
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,540
All right, great.

284
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,740
Man, really put our backs in that one.

285
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,980
This story would be a lot of a hit film, a little film called The Man Without a Face.

286
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,220
Okay.

287
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,740
People didn't see what was going on between Mel Gibson and that kid.

288
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,020
Let's play a game.

289
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,340
That's because Mel Gibson didn't have a face, if I remember correctly.

290
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,500
Didn't watch that one super close.

291
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,180
No, I think he was just a skull, a talking skull, and the kid hung out with him.

292
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,860
You shouldn't hang out with that talking skull man because I think he's a baby.

293
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,380
What was the problem with him?

294
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,420
So like his face had melted off while he was like helping Hitler or something.

295
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,900
It was actually the first adaptation of Ghost Rider and they got it really wrong.

296
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,580
They messed it up pretty bad.

297
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,660
And the second adaptation of Monkeybone.

298
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:02,660
Guys.

299
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,900
Monkeybone face, leave that kid alone.

300
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,980
Why can't Skeletor hang out with kids?

301
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,140
Okay, here's some of the headliners at Warped Tour 2014.

302
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,380
Okay.

303
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,100
There's a Stray from the Path.

304
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,820
Don't know who that is.

305
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,860
Hardcore band.

306
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,820
Tear Out the Heart.

307
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,460
Don't know who that is.

308
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,020
Metalcore.

309
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,020
Plague Vendor.

310
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,260
Nope.

311
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,500
Teenage Bottle Rocket.

312
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,140
Mixed Tapes.

313
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,620
Made up.

314
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,860
Skate Shoes.

315
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,820
That's made up.

316
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,260
That one is actually made up.

317
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,580
Okay.

318
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,620
There's the Proto Men, I actually have heard of.

319
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,980
Okay, Proto Men, I know.

320
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,860
Have heard of them.

321
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,180
So one, I guess that'll be a pretty good show.

322
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,300
What do you think Plague Vendors,

323
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,820
what do you think a Plague Vendor show is like?

324
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,020
It's like dudes in those like 17th century bird masks

325
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,380
just vomiting into the crowd.

326
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,860
Plus, here's the weird thing, it's funded by Andy Williams.

327
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,580
So around this time of year, a lot of Christmas tunes.

328
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,220
Interesting.

329
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,420
It's what the audience demands.

330
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,500
And they do it by a big pool of stagnant water.

331
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,540
Everybody get your shots.

332
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,420
No, but seriously, we're offering shots at the foot of the stage.

333
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,220
Herd immunity is down in 2013.

334
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,100
2013.

335
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,180
But no, seriously, it's filthy.

336
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,260
It's fucking really super gross.

337
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,420
Clean your butts or else you'll get prostatitis

338
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,940
like Griffin did at Bonnaroo 2006.

339
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,900
Is Griffin here?

340
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,540
Raise your hand, little buddy.

341
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,260
Is Griffin here?

342
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,060
Raise your hand.

343
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,660
Why don't you stay seated, buddy?

344
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,420
Guys, I just read.

345
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,540
This one goes out to Griffin.

346
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,660
It hurts to sit, it hurts to sit, it hurts to stand.

347
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,780
And get somewhere in between and stay that way.

348
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,140
Squad for your life, Plague Vendor's only hit.

349
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,460
This is absolutely, by the way, one of those situations,

350
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,660
I've kind of recognized them now,

351
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,420
where as soon as the show goes live,

352
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,460
someone will tweet at both us and Plague Vendor

353
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,180
and say these fucking guys, these guys.

354
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,940
They think you care about Griffin's butthole.

355
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,900
Prove you do not.

356
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,700
They might be awesome.

357
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,860
If they have any cure, it's chronic.

358
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,820
One of the guys who answers on this said that

359
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,620
you can't cross state lines with someone.

360
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,100
If they're over 18 and you're under 17,

361
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,620
if you cross state lines with them,

362
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,060
then you break the law.

363
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,660
Is that fucking true?

364
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,460
That can't be true.

365
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,100
That can't be true.

366
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,500
Maybe without parental permission.

367
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:16,740
Yeah.

368
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,460
But without permission, I feel like it wouldn't be okay

369
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,220
for me to take a kid without permission

370
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,900
so long as I stayed within Ohio.

371
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,180
Yeah, yeah.

372
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:28,260
He has to cross state lines, we can't do anything.

373
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,620
Ohio's a big state though.

374
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,020
Texas, we have a lot of flexibility there

375
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,780
because I didn't take them with Northern Panhandle.

376
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,300
They will never see their parents again,

377
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,980
but I'm taking them to Warped Tour

378
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,060
so it's totally fine, totally platonic.

379
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,380
It's a super cool Celine-Luncho relationship.

380
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,060
It's more of a mentorship.

381
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,780
I'd watch that movie Tuesdays with Luncho

382
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,300
if it was about Celine wants to go to Warped Tour

383
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,740
but her parents are like, no, you're eight.

384
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,420
And Luncho was like, no, get in my Toyota Corolla.

385
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:56,980
We're going.

386
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,540
And then it was like a road trip to Warped Tour

387
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,260
but they couldn't cross state lines

388
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,020
so they weren't able to make it to Warped Tour.

389
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,100
So they had to stage their own Warped Tour

390
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
at the local amphitheater.

391
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,740
It's like a benefit show.

392
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,180
It's just a big banner up there.

393
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,660
It says like, let's get warped.

394
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,980
The R is backwards, it's adorable.

395
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,220
Hey, I got another question for you guys.

396
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:25,940
Okay.

397
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,860
I've been in a relationship for six years

398
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,100
but we have never spent a Christmas together.

399
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,540
We started dating in high school

400
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,060
and I've always gone to our respective families

401
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,180
homes for the holiday.

402
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,340
We've continued to do so now that we've graduated.

403
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,940
This has been fine but we really like to start

404
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,780
spending this major holiday together

405
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,540
and are struggling on the how.

406
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,780
We live in Washington, her parents live in California,

407
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,220
a minor in Oregon so splitting time

408
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,980
or the holiday isn't an option.

409
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,420
We aren't ready to have Christmas on our own

410
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,580
so at some point one of us will be the child

411
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,340
that didn't come home for Christmas that year.

412
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,180
To add complications, her dad's birthday happens

413
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,620
to fall on Christmas.

414
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,940
Now that all of you are married,

415
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,220
presumably splitting some holiday time between in-laws,

416
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,700
how have you and your significant, et cetera, et cetera,

417
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,660
candle nights as from stumped in Spokane?

418
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,380
I mean, it's not an issue

419
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,740
because we're all spending Christmas together.

420
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,740
All spending like Christmas day together.

421
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,540
The real answer, you have to get really stupid,

422
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,380
creative and sacrifice, sacrifice.

423
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,540
We don't have to do that

424
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,060
because our family trust is bond and blood and love

425
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,540
and trust and blood, you know what I mean?

426
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,620
We're spending Christmas together in our hearts.

427
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,340
Yeah, in our body because our hearts are in our bodies

428
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,620
and our bodies are all gonna be together

429
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,780
Christmas morning tearing open those packages.

430
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,660
Even though our bodies will be far apart, Griffin,

431
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,140
our souls will still call to each other.

432
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,860
Well, December 25th I just told us

433
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,740
we'll have to call each other

434
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,500
because our voices came from across the room.

435
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,780
Yeah, I'll see your face.

436
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,780
Sometimes more orange rolls.

437
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,300
Good morning, here's your Christmas kiss.

438
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,860
Sometimes people love each other.

439
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,420
I love you.

440
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,380
You have to spend a little time apart.

441
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,740
I can't wait to tell you I love you

442
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,260
face-to-face on Christmas morning.

443
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,660
Good news, you guys.

444
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,540
Can't wait.

445
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,820
I've hired a Travis impersonator

446
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,220
to be there on Christmas with you.

447
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,060
So there'll be two Travis's, that'll be fun.

448
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,900
No, no, no.

449
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,740
It's gonna be the best Christmas ever.

450
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,100
My only wish was that we get all together,

451
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,020
married finally in defiance of logic and God's will

452
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,900
to just be, this goof is running a little long too.

453
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,780
Travis is not gonna be with us on Christmas morning.

454
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,820
This is how you explain it.

455
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,020
No, well, okay, Griffin.

456
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,580
That's what he says.

457
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,860
But I've been watching a lot of ABC.

458
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,700
Oh, what's that present behind?

459
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,620
What's that present behind the desk?

460
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,060
A lot of ABC family in the run-up to Candle Nights.

461
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,260
And if I've learned anything from that series of films.

462
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,660
You watched a movie with Joey Lawrence in it, didn't you?

463
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,260
No, no, I watched an actual,

464
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,020
this is an actual plot of a real movie

465
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,220
called Holiday in Handcuffs

466
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,860
that I only saw about 20 minutes of, but I got it.

467
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,340
Melissa Joan Hart was a disgruntled waitress

468
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,660
who was tired of not having a boyfriend for the holidays.

469
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,140
So she kidnaps Mario Lopez.

470
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,020
Fuck.

471
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,020
Yeah, and takes her to her family home.

472
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,380
Mary Kay Place is her mom.

473
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,940
I didn't recognize the dad,

474
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,700
but he is her prisoner for the holidays.

475
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,660
Does she know him?

476
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,700
Or is this like a fucking like random crime of passion?

477
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,980
It's a random crime.

478
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,100
She kidnaps him.

479
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,700
She has crazy hair.

480
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,060
And it's a very sort of Kathy Bates and Misery vibe.

481
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,580
At the end of the movie though,

482
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,700
Does they fall in love?

483
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,020
Does Mil Lopez go,

484
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,540
oh, I see now that you're a good person and I love you.

485
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,220
Well, no, he doesn't see if she's a good person.

486
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,980
She straightens her whack haircut

487
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,140
and she's all that into him.

488
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:55,220
He says, I really do love you

489
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,340
and I'm glad that you kidnapped me.

490
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,300
It's a Christmas miracle.

491
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,900
She says, okay, I'm gonna take these handcuffs off

492
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,540
so he can kiss.

493
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,340
And he says, great.

494
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,780
And she takes the handcuffs off

495
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,860
and then he picks up the phone that's sitting next to her

496
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,940
and hits her over the head with it and runs away.

497
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,740
It says, not today.

498
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,580
I'd watch that movie.

499
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,740
I think the biggest fiction about that movie

500
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,500
is that you actually legally cannot kidnap Mario Lopez.

501
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
He's just happy to have something to do.

502
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,380
What?

503
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,900
Is there work there?

504
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,700
Or kids?

505
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,340
Are there gonna be kids?

506
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,980
That's just cause he approaches everything as a gig.

507
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,220
Everything.

508
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,020
They got blankets?

509
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:29,860
I'm in.

510
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,980
My payment is a plate of biscuits and a warm blanket.

511
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,020
Thank you very much.

512
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,700
And then it actually says that in all of his contracts.

513
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,580
If you leave more biscuits and a warm blanket

514
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,500
out at night on Christmas Eve,

515
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,340
Mario Lopez will literally be dead.

516
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,380
You'll walk into the living room

517
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,500
and he's watching a VHS tape of the Greg Louganis movie

518
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,620
that he was in.

519
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,100
Oh, come on.

520
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,060
Why don't you sit down with me?

521
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,860
There's room for two.

522
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,660
It's in French and it's not subtitled.

523
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,900
We're gonna shoot some intros and outros real quick.

524
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,340
I just get this gig nailed.

525
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
I brought my own gaffer.

526
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,820
Is that cool?

527
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,020
Well, you have fun on this show, but-

528
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,940
Travis won't be with us.

529
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,460
Travis definitely won't be.

530
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,060
Okay, if you're looking for an excuse,

531
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,580
there's two options here.

532
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,220
If you're looking for an excuse to not have to travel

533
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,460
and just want to spend some quality time

534
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,660
with your significant other-

535
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,540
That's not an option.

536
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,660
That's not what he's asking for.

537
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,460
That's the wisdom of Solomon.

538
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,580
No Christmas!

539
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,740
No, there's an easy answer.

540
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,100
You have a kid.

541
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,180
The kid's gonna get you out of at least two years of travel.

542
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,060
They're not ready to spend Christmas in that fashion.

543
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,740
No, they want to spend it with their families.

544
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,580
It's just, how do they pick now?

545
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,700
Well, what we're doing is alternating years

546
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,700
as to whose place-

547
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,420
So we're spending the 21st, 22nd, 23rd with the McElroys

548
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,220
and then the 24th, 25th, 26th with the Wellmans.

549
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,700
It would be nice if Griffin could have synced that up, but-

550
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,420
Yeah, that would have been pretty nice.

551
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,060
But then next year it'll flip

552
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,940
and we'll be at our house for Christmas.

553
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,620
Yeah, and Rachel and I do something kind of-

554
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,140
This is not something that Justin has to deal with

555
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,500
because all of those family units

556
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,180
are in fairly immediate proximity,

557
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,140
but Rachel and I just do Thanksgiving with her folks

558
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,460
and Christmas with mine,

559
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,300
and usually her folks come in a few days before Christmas

560
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,420
and we'll hang out with them for a bit.

561
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,900
Yeah, my situation has its own set of challenges.

562
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,460
I've spent an hour of every Christmas-

563
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,700
The murderous ghost that lives in the Smurls house.

564
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,420
I spent an hour of every Christmas commuting,

565
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,460
a Christmas day commuting for the past eight years, I think.

566
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,220
That's been like Christmas for me.

567
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,860
And it's hard.

568
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,340
That's its own sort of thing

569
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,580
because you are in town and you are so close.

570
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,060
You always feel like you're disappointing people

571
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,020
no matter where you're at.

572
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,580
And then when you're driving on 52

573
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,940
between Huntington and Ironton,

574
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,460
you're disappointed the most important person

575
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,500
is just yourself constantly every 30 seconds

576
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,900
when you drive past someone who isn't Arby's.

577
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,380
The problem is when it's Christmas day,

578
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,340
there's never a good time to leave on Christmas day.

579
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,540
There's never a point where everyone's like,

580
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,380
I wish that guy would just get out of here.

581
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,820
Has this been magical enough?

582
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,900
Is the magic over, would you guys say?

583
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,220
Our rule generally is you wait for the first person

584
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,340
to fall asleep and then you have a pretty solid out.

585
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,580
Why don't you just do it at your place?

586
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,020
Just do like a super fucking-

587
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:29,700
You guys would throw the sickest Christmas rager.

588
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,020
You would tear the fucking city apart.

589
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,060
You start at 6 a.m., you pop some eggs,

590
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,780
you just don't stop until the Christmas tree burns down.

591
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,740
That's what I'm saying.

592
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,900
You have the power to cancel your own captivity

593
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,540
in Christmas hell that you find yourself in.

594
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
I know, but then it's like even sadder

595
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,900
when you're like by yourself

596
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,740
or just sitting there alone.

597
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,260
No, you invite other people over, I guess.

598
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,740
Justin, I make you this Christmas promise right now forever.

599
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,460
You ready?

600
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,020
Yeah.

601
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,620
I will never pay for a hotel when I'm in Huntington.

602
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,340
I will always, always, always stay at your house.

603
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,620
This is a guarantee from me to you, brother to brother,

604
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,420
I will never, ever not impose.

605
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,300
That's touching, Griffin.

606
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,140
You never have to worry about being alone

607
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,020
when I'm in town just chilling on your couch

608
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,140
eating the snacks that you've bought for me at Kroger's.

609
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,900
Do you still like flip sides that-

610
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,460
I'll eat the fuck out some flip sides.

611
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,340
I've been working on a new technique where I eat one side.

612
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,700
I'll eat like the pretzel side

613
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,460
and then I'll get to that cracker side in a bit.

614
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,580
Great, great, great, great, great, great, great.

615
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,260
I will need two boxes of those.

616
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,700
This is on my, this is on my waiver.

617
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,500
Need it.

618
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,860
Travis, are you staying with us at all

619
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,060
or are you staying just in Ironton?

620
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,020
Are we gonna discuss all of our travel plans, though?

621
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,140
Yeah, why not?

622
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,820
We're gonna do a night in Ironton,

623
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,100
a night in Huntington.

624
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,700
Bed situations get a little bit cramped.

625
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,860
I hope that we don't-

626
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,060
We've got our dog with us, too,

627
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,980
but she'll probably stay at Dad and Carol's.

628
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,900
If we stay together in Ironton,

629
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,460
Rachel and I totally call the Austin Powers room

630
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,740
that has the Austin Powers poster.

631
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,020
Aw, you dick.

632
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,220
Yeah, that one's mine.

633
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:06,980
I need that.

634
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,140
Let's get some money.

635
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:22,260
You gotta have your family around, right?

636
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,820
And you're not gonna have any idea what to do with them.

637
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,780
Who knows?

638
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,700
Who has any idea what to do with these people?

639
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,740
They're in your home and you have no options.

640
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,020
Well, we have an option for you.

641
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,540
It's called Hulu Plus.

642
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,820
You know Hulu.com.

643
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,180
Everybody knows Hulu.com.

644
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,380
But Hulu Plus lets you watch thousands

645
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,060
of television programs and movies.

646
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,140
You wanna do something with your family?

647
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,940
How about you binge on Jimmy Kimmel Live

648
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,540
or Sharp, maybe something more timely,

649
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,580
actually, now that I think about it.

650
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,580
Brand of Shark Tank or Scandal.

651
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,220
And you can even get old stuff.

652
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,740
Get some Doctor Who community.

653
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:55,700
Get it.

654
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,620
Get into it with your family.

655
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,940
There's also original-

656
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,820
There's originals.

657
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,340
Unique shows that Hulu does,

658
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,540
like The Wrong Man's.

659
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,380
There's also a docu-series.

660
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,140
Behind the Mask is the docu-series.

661
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,980
And it takes you inside the world of sports mascots.

662
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,780
Travis, you are dick deep in that show, right?

663
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,500
Mm-hmm.

664
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,140
Can't stop.

665
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,860
Won't stop.

666
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,300
Ad-free movies, stuff for kids.

667
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,060
It's really good for the holidays.

668
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,740
But here's the secret right now.

669
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,820
We can get you through the holidays.

670
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,260
Well, we can get you through Christmas

671
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,660
with a two-week free trial to Hulu Plus.

672
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,740
Normally it costs $7.99 a month.

673
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,620
Let's be honest, it's $8.

674
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,900
But you can get a two-week free trial

675
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,380
using going to huluplus.com slash my brother right now.

676
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,340
Get that free trial, get those TV shows,

677
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,100
and get your family distracted

678
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,500
so you can get out of the house and catch a smoke.

679
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,100
Wait, what?

680
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,740
For once.

681
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,980
I have a call to action.

682
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,140
I have a demand, actually.

683
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,820
I'll just call it a demand.

684
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,980
Check out Watch Out for Fireballs.

685
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,060
Show, it's on iTunes, or you can also catch it on Duck Feed TV.

686
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,180
And while you're at it, you can check out the other shows

687
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,620
on Duck Feed TV.

688
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,340
It's a podcast network.

689
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,020
It's Duck Feed dot TV.

690
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,660
Dot TV.

691
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,220
It's a network, not unlike our own.

692
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,940
Watch Out for Fireballs is a retro games podcast.

693
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,860
It's hosted by Gary Butterfield,

694
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,900
the Secret Service agent from the West Wing,

695
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,740
and Cole Ross.

696
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,260
Friend of the show, Cole Ross.

697
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,180
Thanks, Cole Ross, for being a bud.

698
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,460
Every episode is an in-depth exploration of an older game

699
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,020
where they talk about why it succeeds or fails,

700
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:39,540
and there's jokes and there's sketches and goofs and spoofs.

701
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,540
And they have a really big back catalog,

702
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,220
so I'm sure there's something in there

703
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,100
that is about a game that you love.

704
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,740
So check it out.

705
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,660
It's great because you can hop in, hop out

706
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,260
with just the episode interest you.

707
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,180
It's an old nostalgic game for you.

708
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:52,820
Check it out.

709
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,860
Check out Duck Feed, too.

710
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,500
They have a show all about the hit game Dark Souls,

711
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,940
which is really good, and Justin never beat it

712
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,500
because he's got a little boy's penis.

713
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,340
He's got a little, like a baby,

714
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,820
like a little, like a little, little boy's penis.

715
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,500
I got a message for Henry, and it's from Aiden.

716
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,660
And I, Aiden.

717
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,460
Oh, you don't know.

718
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,180
Why are you fucking pretending like you know?

719
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,300
Beyond Two Souls ruined me on Aiden

720
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,380
because that game pronounces it Aiden,

721
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,980
and that's wrong, objectively.

722
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,180
We all know that's wrong.

723
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,180
Super French sensibilities.

724
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,340
Anyway, happy birthday, Sweet Pea.

725
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,460
You're the total package.

726
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,300
Cute butt and a cute heart, XOXO.

727
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,020
I'm willing to bet that Aiden has not seen Henry's heart.

728
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,020
And let me also throw this out.

729
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,420
I've been watching a lot of toddlers and heroes.

730
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,940
That is not the complete package.

731
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,900
What else does Aiden need?

732
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,020
What?

733
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,540
What else does Aiden need?

734
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,620
You got to have poise.

735
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,580
You got to have the talent.

736
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,100
Got to see in their eyes because they

737
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,460
can't be straining in their eyes.

738
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,180
Yeah, right.

739
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:56,580
Right?

740
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,780
Listen, you can get up there.

741
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,820
You can walk with confidence.

742
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,460
But if your talent game is shit, get off the stage.

743
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,540
Henry, when's the last time you updated your flippers?

744
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,380
Because if you have some out of date flippers,

745
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,380
you'll have like little weird teeth.

746
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,340
Well, then here's the thing.

747
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,980
You could have one of those homemade costumes, splurge,

748
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,780
spend the money.

749
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,580
It's worth it.

750
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:12,820
It's totally worth it.

751
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,540
You'll see the difference.

752
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,420
You tell the difference.

753
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,900
For God's sake, bring your own hair and makeup person.

754
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,660
Don't trust the pageant organizers

755
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,260
because you know they're getting kickbacks.

756
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,060
And don't just have your mother do it.

757
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,860
Hire someone.

758
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,140
Hire a trainer.

759
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,460
Get them in there every week.

760
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,980
Speaking of splurging, Extreme Restraints

761
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,820
is an adult superstore that you can

762
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,820
go to to find all kinds of things that will make you splurge,

763
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,820
both financially and-

764
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,660
I actually just moved from a medium gauge

765
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,860
to a heavy gauge splurger.

766
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,060
Now, see, I was saying like-

767
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,940
Oh, I got stretched out enough?

768
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,100
Yeah, well, oh, no, no.

769
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,860
When you talk about it like some sort of tool

770
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,860
that you use to widen an orifice,

771
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,540
you're ranging into like Sucian territory.

772
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,980
I would not, could not with a splurge.

773
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,900
But I'm working on it.

774
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,660
But I'm trying, Dan.

775
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,220
It takes time.

776
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,500
It's a fibrous-

777
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,940
It's a fibrous tissue.

778
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,620
It doesn't like to be stretched.

779
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:14,180
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore.

780
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,060
You get toys, sexual in nature, books, DVDs.

781
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,900
They've had over a half million customers

782
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,380
and you can be half made in one.

783
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,020
You can get Curious Games of Benjamin Button.

784
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,820
You don't have that.

785
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,180
All kinds of DVDs on there.

786
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,860
Golden Girls complete box set.

787
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,180
That might be somebody's fetish.

788
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,740
I don't know.

789
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,540
What's great is they cut in sex scenes

790
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,780
into all the episodes, which is really nice.

791
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,280
Worth it.

792
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,220
Totally worth it.

793
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,300
You can get a bargain deal at ExtremeRestraints.com.

794
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,780
You can get some, like, what is it?

795
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,900
20% off, I think?

796
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,060
Something crazy like that.

797
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,620
You gotta use the coupon code Sexabunga.

798
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,940
I can't believe how long that one's fucking rolled.

799
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,740
I know.

800
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,380
Sexabunga is still legit.

801
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,220
You can use it at ExtremeRestraints.com.

802
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,060
Save yourself, I guess, 20%.

803
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,020
It's a good amount.

804
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,980
It's a healthy portion.

805
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,540
It's a healthy portion.

806
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,700
20% of you use it this week.

807
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,020
It's 10% every week after this.

808
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,380
So there you go.

809
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,700
There it is.

810
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,740
ExtremeRestraints.com.

811
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,700
Place your orders now.

812
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,980
Maybe you'll get in time for Christmas.

813
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,620
I don't know what their shipping speed is.

814
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,860
They don't indicate whether or not it'll arrive by Christmas.

815
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,340
It'll come by Christmas, and so will you.

816
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,460
But it's a pleasant, friendly vulgarity

817
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:55,460
from two guys who went to a reasonably prestigious

818
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,260
UC college.

819
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,420
Why don't you try this show out now?

820
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,100
Grab one with one of your favorite comedians,

821
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,340
like Rob Corddry or Rob Delaney or whatever.

822
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,740
Or somebody awesome that maybe you haven't heard of yet.

823
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,420
Yeah, go to MaximumFun.org or your favorite podcasting app

824
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:18,900
and download an episode of Jordan Jesse Go! now.

825
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,940
I have so many.

826
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,740
Thanks, everybody, who sent in in the Yahoos.

827
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,180
This one, though, was sent in by Christopher Baker.

828
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:26,820
Thanks, Chris.

829
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,380
It's by Yahoo Answers User X, who asks,

830
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,460
what happened to fashion?

831
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,500
Firstly, if you get offended or butt-hurt by this question,

832
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,220
don't answer.

833
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,020
But my question is an honest one.

834
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,860
What the hell happened to fashion?

835
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,100
I mean, every time I turn on the TV or go out,

836
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,700
people are dressed up awful.

837
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,980
Men are wearing skinny jeans, ugly colored chinos,

838
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,620
tacky V-necks, have the worst hairstyles,

839
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,140
wearing awful-looking flannel shirts,

840
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:55,060
and stupid-looking snapbacks.

841
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,580
And to make this worse, it seems to be considered as cool and hip.

842
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,020
What the F dash dash dash?

843
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,420
I consider myself to be old-school, I mean, honestly.

844
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,580
Look back at 2003 to 2004.

845
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,420
Fashion was so cool and normal-looking.

846
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,260
No one wore any of the above-listed clothes.

847
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,100
Everyone wore normal-looking jeans, loose cargo pants,

848
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,380
long sleeves, normal-looking baseball caps, et cetera.

849
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,300
What the hell happened?

850
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,460
Every time I go to a store online to find clothes,

851
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,140
I can never find anything that I want.

852
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,100
Every jeans or trousers in stores are skinny jeans.

853
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,900
Just like me.

854
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,820
Every jeans or trousers in stores are skinny jeans, chinos.

855
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,620
Or they have-

856
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,220
Where's the JNCO jeans?

857
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,860
Or they have the, and then there's a hateful word here,

858
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,500
that if I had seen when I was vetting this question,

859
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,460
I wouldn't have read it anywhere,

860
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
because I do not appreciate that.

861
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
But they said a pejorative term

862
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,620
about the tapered-leg looking effect.

863
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,180
I mean, every men's trouser is now fricking tapered.

864
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,540
I can never find a trouser with the standard leg cut even more.

865
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,260
Even loose, regular jeans are all tapered.

866
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:59,140
Or when looking for a hat, everything is a snapback.

867
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,980
I hate these goofy-looking hats.

868
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,060
I'm desperately looking for a normal hat,

869
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,620
like these ones worn by Linkin Park in this video.

870
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,220
And then there's a video of a Linkin Park concert.

871
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,740
Two of the men are wearing hats.

872
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,260
Regular hats, you would say?

873
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,660
They're definitely not snapbacks.

874
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,460
Now, it seems that people love to dress up in a bizarre manner,

875
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,500
and even bands like Linkin Park enjoy the hipster trend.

876
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,780
So what the hell happened?

877
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,340
Anyone out there share the same feelings as me?

878
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,180
Fuck.

879
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,260
Even fucking Linkin Park has succumbed

880
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,180
to the siren sound of a snapback hat.

881
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,460
You bastion of fashions.

882
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,540
Where?

883
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,420
Those paragons, those fashionistas.

884
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,460
Those men among men.

885
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,500
Where is this guy shopping?

886
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,900
The shining city on the Linkin Park hill.

887
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,340
Hi, I'm Jesse Thorne.

888
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,100
This week on Put This On,

889
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,740
a whole episode dedicated to Linkin Park.

890
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,820
Thanks for listening.

891
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,980
Thanks for listening.

892
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,860
Where are you going?

893
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,780
Hey, come back.

894
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,660
Oh my Jesus.

895
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,700
Guys, I am fucking one step closer to the edge

896
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,740
and I'm about to break.

897
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,820
What happened to fashion?

898
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,580
Real quick question.

899
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:12,180
You remember the golden days in 2003-2004?

900
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,860
Is 2003-2004 quote old school?

901
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,580
That's when fashion made sense to him for a little while.

902
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,860
How, okay, okay, fun quiz.

903
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,260
Answer at the same time on three.

904
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:24,580
Okay.

905
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,700
How old is this dude?

906
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,340
One, two, three.

907
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,260
21.

908
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,140
Okay, a lot of broad spectrum there.

909
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,940
Broad spectrum.

910
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,740
I don't understand where this guy is shopping

911
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,580
or living or existing

912
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,420
where he can't find literally everything in the world.

913
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,060
What's great?

914
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,220
Everything in the world is on sale.

915
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,420
Just go to like,

916
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,540
I bet there's a store called No Snapbacks and Regular Pants.

917
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,100
Notate.com.

918
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,380
Go to fucking TJ Maxx.

919
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,140
Become a Maxinista.

920
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:59,300
Get those, get those non-tabred jeans.

921
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,620
So I get my non-tabred jeans, friendo.

922
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,300
You're welcome.

923
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,700
There's a little TJ Maxx tip from Trav to you.

924
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:10,260
Do you guys know that in the UK it's called TK Maxx?

925
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,700
As if we wouldn't notice.

926
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,580
Is it really?

927
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,620
Yeah, it's bizarre.

928
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,340
I saw a commercial.

929
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,020
It was like, it was really one of those,

930
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,620
am I dreaming?

931
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,060
Am I like in that half reality between wake and asleep?

932
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,260
Let me ask you this question,

933
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,700
or rather observation.

934
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,780
I think my favorite thing about this question

935
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,500
is the use of the word desperately in looking for hats

936
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,260
because I can just picture this guy busting into like a Hollister.

937
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,860
Be like, where are the hats?

938
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,940
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, Scott.

939
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,660
You don't understand.

940
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,580
He's just, he's just knocking shelving over.

941
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,660
Snapbacks, snapbacks, snapbacks.

942
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:48,100
Lincoln Park, how could you?

943
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,820
I thought that everybody shop for hats

944
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
in the same way that I shop for hats,

945
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,260
which is that you find the one hat

946
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,580
and maybe in the universe that fits your weird head.

947
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,620
The top of my head is like octagonal, basically.

948
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,100
I've been wearing the same West Virginia Pumpkin Festival hat

949
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,380
for the past like seven years

950
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,500
because it fits my melon.

951
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,380
Because it fits it.

952
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,020
I didn't know that people had a choice in that matter.

953
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,940
Um, there is a lot of agreement in the answers section of this question.

954
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:19,380
A lot of people are totally on board with this, with this dude.

955
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,740
One person calls him out for his homophobia, which yeah, fuck this guy.

956
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,140
He doesn't deserve anybody's help in the first place

957
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,260
because of his hate speech.

958
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,380
But, um, but he has made some excellent points

959
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,540
about how terrible fashion is nowadays.

960
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,780
What happened to those loose fitting cargoes?

961
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,060
Those loose fitting cargoes that looked so good on everyone

962
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,980
on the last season of Dawson's Creek.

963
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,220
Listen, not only up here, but some people

964
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,900
up here put some pockets down here.

965
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,420
How convenient.

966
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,580
The closest I ever got to matching fashion

967
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,980
is that one time I had a Hawaiian shirt.

968
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,340
I still have it actually.

969
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,300
And my wife informed me that it had once been worn by Pacey on Dawson's Creek.

970
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,420
And that was the closest I got to really being fashionable.

971
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:05,300
It was five years after the series ended, of course, but still.

972
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:10,500
Um, I have to read this answer from somebody

973
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,460
who has agreed with this person's assertion

974
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,660
in, I would say, an unorthodox manner.

975
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,980
He, I'm assuming, he or she responded.

976
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,580
It's called cultural collapse.

977
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,740
All cultures eventually collapse all in the same general manner

978
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,020
and for the same general reasons.

979
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,060
Symptoms of impending collapse include basic service jobs

980
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,420
taken over by immigrants, increasing welfare roles,

981
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,860
national defense given to mercenaries because citizens refuse to serve,

982
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:45,300
debunking of national heroes in admiration of slobs instead,

983
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,620
rejection of the dominant religion, morals, and all standards of excellence.

984
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,940
First noticed in arts and then in all activities.

985
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,100
The trigger for the final collapse is always random

986
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,900
and always something that a healthy society could have handled.

987
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:01,780
And he links to a website called comingdarkage.blogspot.com.

988
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,700
So I think that this person,

989
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,940
in agreeing with the fact that ginkgo jeans were pretty comfortable

990
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,500
and, man, wouldn't it be great if ginkgo jeans were still around,

991
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,540
may have lost his fucking gourd at some point.

992
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,660
What I'd love to see is the Yahoo Answers question asker

993
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:19,140
getting to that answer and be like, yeah, so many people are-

994
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,620
Yeah.

995
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,340
Whoa.

996
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,460
Whoa. Hey, buddy.

997
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,700
I was just saying I wanted a snapback hat.

998
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,100
I hit a nerve here.

999
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,980
I think America's doing pretty okay.

1000
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,820
Travis, you watched the movie Collapse.

1001
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,820
Is this a plot line when he's like, the old dude from that movie is like,

1002
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,980
oh, I know exactly what I'm talking about.

1003
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,100
Look, here's a graph and the graph says ginkgo jeans on it.

1004
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,620
And then it's just a line going down.

1005
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,020
So thanks, Obama, I guess.

1006
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:50,180
I enjoy the idea that the supposition that the collapse of society

1007
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:53,220
was not heralded by the existence of Linkin Park,

1008
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,540
which I probably could have gotten on board with,

1009
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,100
but with Linkin Park switching to snapbacks and hipster wear.

1010
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,620
That is the sign that we have-

1011
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,420
Well, that's what signaled the fall of Rome,

1012
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,900
is they went to wear the skinny fit togas as everybody knew.

1013
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,540
Is there any fucking band from that era that has kept it OG?

1014
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,820
And by OG, I mean, 2003-2004?

1015
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,540
I mean, Harry Connick Jr. has kept it pretty close to the vest.

1016
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,980
He's kept it pretty cool.

1017
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,940
I think Blink-182 still is-

1018
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,900
No, fuck those fools.

1019
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,540
Those fools went fucking corpo sellout bullshit.

1020
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,940
Is that why they're not invited back to Warped Tour anymore?

1021
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
I remember when those fucks used to show up at Warped Tour

1022
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,460
and they had those thermal shirts

1023
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,700
and they cut holes in them for their thumbs to come through.

1024
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,060
That was a cool fucking look.

1025
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,780
I still do that look, but out of necessity,

1026
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,620
because I just have a lot of holes in my shirt.

1027
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,060
And you get cold palms.

1028
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,380
By the way-

1029
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,340
I get the cold palms.

1030
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,340
Because I'm sure everyone was wondering,

1031
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,380
the last post on thecomingdarkage.blogspot.com

1032
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,580
was posted in 2004, so apparently they gave up.

1033
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,020
They gave it up.

1034
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,340
Fuck.

1035
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,740
Maybe they traded in their jinkos and they're like,

1036
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,660
no, it's time, this is a young man's game.

1037
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,420
Let me just throw this out real quick too.

1038
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,020
Abraham Lincoln Park.

1039
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,420
Go on.

1040
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,140
You just said a thing, it didn't really-

1041
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,700
I know, but it popped in my head like five minutes ago

1042
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,180
and I knew it wasn't gonna come up organically.

1043
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,540
Yeah, well there's a pretty good reason.

1044
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,700
That's like, you just wrote a sketch day,

1045
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,860
a series of sketches on Saturday Night Live.

1046
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,460
You don't take more than that sometimes.

1047
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,500
Can I read another Yahoo?

1048
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:23,540
Please.

1049
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,540
It's sent in by Steven.

1050
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,500
Emrick thanks Steven.

1051
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,860
It's by a Yahoo answers user.

1052
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,260
What?

1053
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
And then an emoticon that I don't know how to pronounce.

1054
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:34,740
And what asks, what do you like the most about Yahoo Answers?

1055
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,620
For me, for me, it helps me to spend my time.

1056
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,420
That was what?

1057
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,380
Answering not me.

1058
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,020
It helps me to spend my time?

1059
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,580
Mm-hmm.

1060
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,180
Oh, he's in prison.

1061
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,700
It's possible.

1062
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,460
What is in solitary confinement

1063
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,220
but somehow has gotten his hands on a tablet?

1064
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,420
Yahoo Answers is better about leaping to assumptions.

1065
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:54,980
Yeah.

1066
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,020
Okay.

1067
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,300
It helps him spend his time because he's trapped in a box.

1068
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,980
That the government put him in for crime.

1069
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,180
That's the government.

1070
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,500
He put him in a crime box for a thing he did.

1071
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,860
You can leave anytime you want, but there are bars.

1072
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,660
They're locked.

1073
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:11,380
And they're locked.

1074
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,220
They will meet with you periodically to see if you're cool to go.

1075
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,260
Are you cool to go?

1076
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:16,820
Not yet.

1077
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,700
Guys, someone answered the best thing about Yahoo is having contacts

1078
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,820
and making friends here.

1079
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,180
There's some nice people here.

1080
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,860
There's some trolls too.

1081
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,900
There's some trolls too.

1082
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,420
What kind of lasting relationship begins with,

1083
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,140
help, my cat's on fire and it's in my butt and I'm drunk.

1084
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,220
And I'm 12.

1085
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,660
To be fair, that's the time of Teresa.

1086
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,620
I'm also 12.

1087
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,340
Guys, I like, if you make that joke,

1088
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,180
but if someone helped you out of that old dickament,

1089
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,980
then I think you would owe them a debt of gratitude

1090
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,940
and you would appreciate them.

1091
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:55,140
If someone helped you out of that

1092
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,660
and they were able to keep it a secret,

1093
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,100
you'd owe them a life debt.

1094
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,140
You'd have to follow them around.

1095
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:02,660
Why don't they, it's like a mob thing

1096
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,700
where instead of like asking for advice,

1097
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,820
you ask for a favor,

1098
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,860
but someday Yahoo Answers will contact you

1099
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,340
and they'll need you to do them a favor

1100
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,380
and you can't say no.

1101
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,980
Sort of like pay it backward.

1102
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,100
Yeah, pay it backward.

1103
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,500
You know, I would be on this,

1104
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,620
on board with like goofing about all these people

1105
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,380
probably haven't made any long lasting friendships

1106
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,180
through Yahoo Answers,

1107
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:28,340
but I watched this Second Life documentary

1108
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,500
where like married people like swinging with each other

1109
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,900
and like going to conventions in Las Vegas

1110
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,740
for like people that they run Second Life businesses with online

1111
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,300
and like anything's fucking possible.

1112
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,260
There probably is a Yahoo Answers baby out there.

1113
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,540
I mean, it's not sad, it's fucking beautiful.

1114
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,060
Who are we to cast dispersions?

1115
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,660
I just hope it's one of the good ones.

1116
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,860
People have given us so much

1117
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,060
and we've given them nothing.

1118
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,740
We've given them literally nothing.

1119
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,980
I'm gonna fucking start a Yahoo Answers account.

1120
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,180
That's my New Year's resolution.

1121
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,860
I'm starting a Yahoo Answers account.

1122
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,140
I'm gonna get active in that community.

1123
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,460
I'm gonna fucking do a thousand hours community service.

1124
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:06,580
I'm gonna get my hands dirty.

1125
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,380
You know, the catch 22 of the nature of our business

1126
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,100
is that if we were to honest to God,

1127
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,860
answer and fix all of these,

1128
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,180
if we were to be the Yahoo Answers superheroes

1129
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:21,140
that didn't make fun,

1130
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,180
but instead answered earnestly and honestly,

1131
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,860
we put ourselves out of a job.

1132
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,540
Cause you think we could be the change

1133
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:28,500
that we want to see in the world

1134
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,020
or in this case that we don't actually want to see.

1135
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,140
We rippled through and instead of these,

1136
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,540
we were like, yeah, put a pizza crust in your butt.

1137
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,220
If we went through and said, oh, okay, you want to wait,

1138
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:36,740
that's how you do it, you do it like this.

1139
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,700
Or we would probably tell them not to do that, Travis.

1140
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,460
We wouldn't give them detailed instructions

1141
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,260
on the best way to put pizza in your butt.

1142
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,020
No, no, no, I'm saying that that's an,

1143
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:45,540
give them alternate ways to give back their pizza crust.

1144
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,820
How would you even know the best way

1145
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,580
to put pizza in your butt, Travis?

1146
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:51,300
Cause you can't go, that's another catch.

1147
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,260
Or if you remember, the question wasn't how best to do it.

1148
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,340
It was other ways to get back at their parent

1149
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,020
without putting pizza crust in their butt.

1150
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,900
What I'm saying though,

1151
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,140
is we have built another catch 22 in there.

1152
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,220
Is that where do you look

1153
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,500
for how to best put pizza in your butt, but Yahoo Answers.

1154
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,620
It's a fucking time paradox.

1155
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,940
You can't get that information from Yahoo Answers

1156
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,100
to give it to someone on Yahoo Answers.

1157
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,860
This is the thing about Yahoo Answers

1158
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,980
that you don't realize until you really get deep into it

1159
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,620
and think about it.

1160
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,540
And this is what those people over at midnight

1161
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,100
will never understand about Yahoo Answers,

1162
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:32,980
is that it is only an appropriate place for questions.

1163
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,900
They're either questions that are so weird

1164
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,100
Google can't answer them,

1165
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,100
or people that are so dumb they can't Google.

1166
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:43,620
So that's the balance the Yahoo Answers strikes.

1167
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,540
It's right there in the middle

1168
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,700
between the bizarre and the stupid.

1169
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,500
It has to be a one in a million problem for there not to be,

1170
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,780
because think about this for a second.

1171
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,100
If you Google any of these questions,

1172
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,460
which I assume you would do

1173
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,460
before you put yourself out there to strangers.

1174
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,780
If you Google any of these questions

1175
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,740
and someone has already asked it on Yahoo Answers,

1176
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,580
then the answer you seek will be there.

1177
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:11,300
So QED, you cannot be the first person in the world

1178
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,500
to have this problem for it to appear on Yahoo Answers.

1179
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,900
That's how unique the situation has to be.

1180
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:19,620
This seems like a great money-making opportunity, doesn't it?

1181
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,420
Like if I do that and the top answer is Yahoo Answers,

1182
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,420
then I will know that this is knowledge.

1183
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,740
This is information that literally doesn't exist in the world.

1184
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
I can breathe more knowledge into the world,

1185
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,260
like Albert fucking Einstein.

1186
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,660
And also I can go to godaddy.com

1187
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,060
and I can get the domain pizzabutts.org.

1188
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:35,700
Uh-huh.

1189
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,260
Or I mean, let's make it more descriptive,

1190
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:39,220
bestpizzabuts.org.

1191
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,660
Bestpizzabuts.org.

1192
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,020
Don't go to pizzabutts.org.

1193
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,260
Their answers are unsatisfactory.

1194
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,380
They're gonna try the rest.

1195
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,780
Now try the best way to put pizza crust in your mouth.

1196
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,420
Our patented technique, you can tell it's patented

1197
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,540
because butts is with a Z.

1198
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,580
With the spread and bend.

1199
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,540
It's funny because I feel about Yahoo Answers

1200
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,340
the same way you feel about that one friend you've got

1201
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,260
where it's like, you're okay to make fun of him,

1202
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,620
but as soon as anyone else does it-

1203
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,900
I'll fucking bite your fingers off

1204
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,260
so you can't internet anymore.

1205
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,260
It's like, listen, I appreciate Yahoo Answers

1206
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:16,340
on a non-ironic deep level that you will never understand.

1207
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,100
So thanks so much for listening

1208
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,180
to our Yahoo Answers tribute episode

1209
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:21,540
of My Brother, My Brother Me.

1210
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,180
My Brother, My Brother Me goes back.

1211
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,380
It's a great service.

1212
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,820
If Marissa Mayer puts her fucking fingers on it,

1213
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,700
is that the Yahoo lady?

1214
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,380
I don't know.

1215
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,780
I know that I'm serious about Chris Hardwick and Midnight.

1216
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,340
They're chomping on flavor and I'm fine with it

1217
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,540
because it's great flavor

1218
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,980
and I think there's enough flavor for everybody.

1219
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,500
There is plenty of flavor.

1220
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,260
Get a, so thank you for listening to our program.

1221
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,660
Thank you to people who have been tweeting about it

1222
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:51,300
like Church's Wife, Mbittle, Usman, Alex, Two Alexes,

1223
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:55,380
Gaston Tercero, Tercero, yeah, I'm gonna go with Tercero,

1224
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,660
Jan Villarosa at Garden, BradyBinitBugs, Emma Elaine,

1225
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,780
13 Scarecrows, Sam Houston, Patrick B. Foss,

1226
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,380
Josh, Kevin Locke, so many others.

1227
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,540
We sure appreciate it.

1228
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,980
If you wanna share a link to the show to get people started,

1229
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,100
a great option is bit.ly forward slash mbnbam2013.

1230
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,540
That's our new sampler for this year.

1231
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,700
Guys, how about an apology?

1232
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,940
Yeah, quick apology.

1233
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:29,060
Very special apology to our friend and old listener Maureen

1234
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,460
who went through the trouble of giving us money

1235
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:37,220
for a MoneyZone spot that we did a pretty bad job with

1236
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,660
with all things considered.

1237
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,620
We really blew it.

1238
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,740
We really blew it.

1239
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,060
It was a happy birthday wish to Michelle,

1240
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,940
which I guess redo, happy birthday, Michelle.

1241
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:51,700
The offending, I think, portion was that she called her love

1242
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,020
burrito and I said that was gross.

1243
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,380
And I made fun of kale, which I feel awful about.

1244
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:56,900
And you made fun of kale.

1245
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,900
And I think that I wasn't saying that human love

1246
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,740
between two people is gross because I just got married.

1247
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,020
I'm obviously on that team.

1248
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:09,700
I thought when you said-

1249
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,420
I was saying, ooh, cause I was picturing a giant burrito-

1250
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,540
That you have sex with.

1251
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,300
Family double dare style.

1252
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,260
Oh, oh, oh.

1253
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,860
I was thinking of a burrito that you have sex with

1254
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,900
and immediately the logistics of that entered my mind.

1255
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,300
And within a split second, I thought after a month,

1256
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:24,820
that burrito has got to go.

1257
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,860
But I could understand how it could come off

1258
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,220
as a condemnation.

1259
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,380
So we done fucked that bit up.

1260
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:33,860
So apologies to Maureen.

1261
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,300
Happy birthday to Michelle.

1262
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,740
We'll try to get it together.

1263
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:37,380
I will not-

1264
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,420
Michelle, we love you both.

1265
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:39,540
Thank you for supporting the show.

1266
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,900
We're sorry that we made you sad.

1267
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,180
I will not do songs though, because I'm not a whore.

1268
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,660
I'm not a musical whore like Linkin Park.

1269
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,780
If you want to take a shot-

1270
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,580
If you want to throw your hat in the ring,

1271
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,740
if you want to spin the wheel.

1272
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,100
Go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron

1273
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,700
and get something special for somebody

1274
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,180
or maybe mess things up.

1275
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,700
Maybe we'll just do it really bad.

1276
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,420
But then you'll get-

1277
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,740
What's rarer than a Money Zone spot?

1278
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,700
An apology.

1279
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,980
You can't pay for that.

1280
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,820
I don't know that we've apologized before,

1281
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,340
except maybe to jugglers and furries.

1282
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:12,900
No, we didn't even apologize to jugglers.

1283
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,940
We stuck by those guns.

1284
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,180
Griffin, do you want to thank John Roderick

1285
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,060
and the Long Winters for you-

1286
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:17,700
John Jondrick?

1287
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,420
I want to thank John Jondrick and the Jondricks.

1288
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,100
I'm Ron Jondrick.

1289
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,740
This is my band, Dong Winters.

1290
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:28,420
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1291
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,620
for the use of our theme song,

1292
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,820
It's a Departure, off the album,

1293
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,780
Putting the Days to Bed.

1294
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,700
You know what, Beyoncé just secretly released an album.

1295
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,540
If you guys could do that shit,

1296
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,460
if you guys could do that shit,

1297
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,540
it would be a legit Candlelight's Miracle.

1298
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,140
You could release it on our show.

1299
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:42,340
People would tune in,

1300
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,060
they'd hear the disclaimer at the beginning,

1301
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:45,540
and what's that?

1302
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,620
Just an hour of Long Winters.

1303
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,380
Hey, this disclaimer sure is going a while.

1304
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,340
And then there's another song,

1305
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,180
and another, and another, and another.

1306
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,180
We're not saying that it's probably not the broadest way

1307
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,780
to distribute your music.

1308
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,460
But it does get us out of a week of work.

1309
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,260
That's what I'm saying.

1310
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,700
It does get us out of a week of work.

1311
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,740
That is true.

1312
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,540
We do love that.

1313
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,580
Oh, and make sure that you check out Hulu Plus

1314
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,660
if you haven't, I assume that you already have,

1315
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,860
because everybody has.

1316
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:12,580
But if you haven't, you can get it on your Xbox,

1317
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,460
your iPad, your Samsung tablet, whatever,

1318
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,020
and check out all of their awesome shows

1319
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:20,100
and their original shows.

1320
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,700
You get an extended free trial

1321
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,500
by going to huluplus.com slash my brother.

1322
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,220
All one word.

1323
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,700
Check out Almost Human.

1324
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,580
I've been jamming on it.

1325
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,060
It's really good.

1326
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,020
Is it good?

1327
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,820
It is.

1328
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,460
I was wondering about it.

1329
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,340
I turned it on on a whim, and it's really good.

1330
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,980
Is it?

1331
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,740
So do a pros, cons, comparison

1332
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,980
with Almost Human and Little Wonders go.

1333
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,700
That's hard.

1334
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:45,380
I can do it with Not Quite Human.

1335
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,500
Nope, that's not what I wanted.

1336
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,340
It's not what I wanted, is it?

1337
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,380
One of the Little Wonders, didn't I?

1338
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,980
It's not nearly as erotic.

1339
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:51,380
Okay.

1340
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,020
Oh, God.

1341
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,220
This final Yahoo answer is sent in by Sam Grub.

1342
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:00,180
Thank you, Sam.

1343
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,620
I guess before we go, please send in

1344
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,500
Candle Knight's questions.

1345
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,380
Oh, yeah.

1346
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:03,780
You didn't ask.

1347
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,820
And make sure you listen to it with a loved one

1348
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,140
who maybe has never listened to the show before.

1349
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,820
That's your Candle Knight's present to us.

1350
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,620
It'll be clean.

1351
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,780
Please warn them that it's not usually.

1352
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,580
All right.

1353
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,620
This one is sent in by Sam Grub.

1354
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,180
Thanks, Sam.

1355
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,580
It's by Yahoo answer user Mandy, who asks,

1356
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,380
what are dogs made out of?

1357
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,740
I'm Justin McElroy.

1358
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,700
I'm Travis McElroy.

1359
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:26,900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1360
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,940
They're my brother, my brother and me.

1361
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,900
Kiss your dad.

1362
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:29,940
Square on the lips.

1363
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,220
Maximumfun.org.

1364
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,260
Comedy and culture.

1365
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,380
Artist owned.

1366
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,420
Listener supported.

1367
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:53,940
This is Biz.

1368
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:54,820
This is Teresa.

1369
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,060
We host a show called One Bad Mother.

1370
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,220
We're a comedy podcast about parenting.

1371
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,620
Not a parenting podcast.

1372
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,940
And for some reason, we seem to be most popular

1373
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,260
among single dudes with no kids.

1374
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:07,220
Weird.

1375
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,900
The only advice you'll get from us

1376
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,940
is when we tell you to stop feeling like a s***

1377
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,980
for being a mom.

1378
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,700
Or a dad.

1379
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,020
Or, you know, a single person with no children.
