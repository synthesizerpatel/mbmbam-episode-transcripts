1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,940
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,300
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,580
cool they are for listening.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,580
What's up, you cool baby?

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:31,000
Howdy!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Welcome to my brother my brother mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I'm your sweet baby brother 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin McElroy

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey, can we can we vape in here or what?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I

14
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,980
Heard ten people say no, that's enough. That's a quorum

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,320
so

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,040
This is our

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
fourth show in three days

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,960
which

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,000
the road the road

20
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,800
For real artists that would not seem like a lot of work. No, we've done four. We've done four hours of work

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:01,400
In three days like that. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. I did saw bones though. So I'm actually a four and a half

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,600
Now for lesser artists that would mean finally about to get home gonna just phone this one in

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,040
But for us it means

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,040
I

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,180
Okay, one day I hope to be as confident as that person was

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,280
To shout get drunk in a very big crowded dark. I was gonna say get weird

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Which I hope you've all learned the folly of yelling shit cuz you never know what I'm gonna say next

28
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,280
So don't try to get incorrect where I'm gonna go cuz you better get it, right now had you gotten it, right?

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,280
You would have won

30
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
$1,000

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,280
American American dollars. I'm in our content in an effort to get weird. I have done my Judd Nelson cosplay

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Sure

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Oh my god, you did just put that on for this show. There's like a new look. Yeah

34
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Cuz I love you. So, uh

35
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,280
We're so happy to be here back in the Wilbur for like ages since we've been back in the world

36
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,280
I know for our fourth performance at the Wilbur in beautiful, Boston, Massachusetts

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Um as we were driving in today, uh, well we from the airport, um, I saw

38
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Something happen here in Boston that made me the happiest I've ever been and it was that at the Boston Tea Party

39
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
boat exhibit thing museum

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Sometimes they call them history museums

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
There was a

42
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Box that people are encouraged to throw off the boat and then reel back in on a rope

43
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Which I do not think they made them do

44
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Very funny Gregory now pull it back up

45
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
You've made your point to the British

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,280
But I do what I do want some tea. I am thirsty. Do you think that's a good idea?

47
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,280
After the tea party where they're like, hell yeah, we did it and then right after like man. I would like some tea though

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,280
Oh, man, the river smells like nap time, man

49
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,280
All our tea in why did we save some tea you think that what one guy was like listen

50
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
I'm into all of this. So

51
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Definitely definitely into it. My mom sent me this camomile tea

52
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,280
In this box here that I've got here. So all this great do it all

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Definitely story of tonight totally into it got a sore throat. Yeah, if I could just get a bag

54
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Save me a little bit of the camera scene. So we're gonna be leaving it all

55
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Out on the court tonight and we're very excited about that

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,280
I think what we've talked about it is we're gonna go for a little bit and then we're just gonna do a fuck ton of audience questions

57
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
Cuz I usually go so super good

58
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,280
It's so we're gonna we're gonna hear them all out tonight. And so should we yeah, I should say

59
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
We're gonna get weak

60
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Please remain calm only one of us can be weird at a time

61
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,280
And it's our turn

62
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,280
We've earned this bad show. You're about to see no, it's gonna be good. We're gonna tonight we fix it all we're gonna fix everything

63
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
So hold on. There's a lot wrong. There's a lot wrong

64
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
We can't get with tonight. We will fix 90% of everything. Yes. I love that. That's good

65
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,280
We can stick with that. But first we're gonna get into some questions that were sent into us

66
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,280
From our audience. What we do is we take your questions and turn them out could be like into wisdom

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
And we're experts

68
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
so

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,280
My mom's co-worker recently came to me and she was like, oh my god, you know what?

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,280
And we're experts so my mom's co-worker recently came to her asking advice about a situation

71
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,280
She thinks someone has physically snuck into her house Pink Panther style and passworded her Wi-Fi so she can't use it

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
The perfect crime

73
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,280
She doesn't believe that there's a password that comes with the unit and instead wants to install

74
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,280
Security cameras and get a whole new laptop to catch this apparent

75
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
security camera

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,280
How would the security cameras connect to the laptop is question number one, right?

77
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
Just plug in a VHS recorder. Yeah

78
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:50,280
How do we convince her that there is no ninja but instead just look at the user manual and that's from Aaron

79
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I mean what you just said sounds like a pretty good start. Yeah, I I wish I wish

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,280
Listen, I like myself a lot. Okay

81
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Kicking off with that full stop

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,280
I can't imagine being in a scenario where I was like, yeah

83
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,280
I'm having trouble with the the password is somebody said it and somebody said the very reasonable

84
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,280
Oh, it comes pre-programmed and I said no

85
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Must be a burglar situation. Must be a ninja

86
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280
My Ben Oceans 14. Yeah

87
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Fucking Clooney got in here perfect crime got in here without a trace

88
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Put a Wi-Fi password without a trace except for the sticker that he left at the bottom of the router that tells you what the fucking

89
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Default password is. That's what he wants you to think

90
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,280
That's what he wants you to think if he falls in love with Catherine Zeta Jones because of this password sticker

91
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,280
You should okay you should are you here?

92
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
No, okay, cool

93
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
They must have been so distraught about this that they couldn't make it

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,280
You should not if you're listening to this later. You should not stop this from happening

95
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,280
Yes, because the end result is going to be that this person is going to set up cameras on a laptop and

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Then the password will be there again and they will spend the rest of their lives reviewing that film

97
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Right. Yeah trying to spot trying to spot a frame old st. Nick sneaks in

98
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Um, is this wait? No. Okay. Nobody wanted to jog it back and talk about it right there. You see it, right?

99
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,280
That's your cat. No, it looks like my cat. No, that's my password

100
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,280
I've spent seven years reviewing the film

101
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,280
It couldn't be anything other than the cat

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Now I want to say don't do this because why are people so eager to remove these wonderful angels from my life?

103
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Yes, although my boss says busting nut and but in the wrong way

104
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:52,280
Should I correct them and it's like always know because I'm a person alive in the world and I want to know that they exist

105
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I'd like a little magic please. Yeah save some for the rest of us. How about a Yahoo answer? Yes

106
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,280
This one was sent in by Caitlin. Thank you, Caitlin. It's from Yahoo answers user anonymous

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm telling you like 90% of Yahoo answers users are like I love getting bad advice from stuff

108
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,280
But I don't want my name attached to it

109
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
We will call them Ron

110
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Ronald asks can a dolphin tell if you're hungover?

111
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Ronald asks can a dolphin tell if you're hungover?

112
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Okay, wait before before we answer that question I

113
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Have another question, which is how could you tell if the dolphin could tell yeah?

114
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,280
That's why they're asking Yahoo answers and this was easy to discern they would have yeah, no, that's fair

115
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:53,280
But like if like that dolphin is kind of side-eyeing me. Yeah, I think he knows

116
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Okay, you laugh and I heard thank you for that. It is a comedy show but like also

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Maybe

118
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
They are the smartest creature

119
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Yeah, it's not only that they have a sort of energy about them or just like if any animal could tell I was hungover

120
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:19,280
It would be a doll. How cool is your life? By the way, where you have a dolphin meeting opportunity and you do not step

121
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
completely correct to it

122
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,520
like if I

123
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,360
Then I'm gonna be the dolphin. I'm gonna be my best me. Yeah, I'm gonna spend five days just practicing my petting motion

124
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,920
Yes, I'm gonna have an updated of resume with me. Yeah

125
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,560
I okay. So here's what I'm thinking. You're right in the dolphin. Slow down. Slow down. Oh, wait. Oh, oh

126
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,920
Wait, how one more time show me how you're right in the dolphin

127
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,620
Which sounds like a euphemism, but it in BNB am ride the dog the dolphin

128
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,080
So you get on the dolphin if you think about it, your mouth is gonna be directly over

129
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm drawing an imaginary column of breath air from my mouth to the bowl

130
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,120
Oh, so the air is gonna be going from your mouth to the blowhole

131
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,720
You know, what are you what's wrong? Nothing? You're fine, right?

132
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,760
Okay, so you're the air is going from your mouth through the blowhole. Does it?

133
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,040
Okay, are there any scientists here who can tell me if they breathe air in through the blowhole?

134
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,560
It's not called a suck hole some I know a few you just yelled and I also wanted to say I know you're not fucking

135
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,200
Scientists, I don't think I don't think Lisa Frank would do quite so many stickers of this animal if they had an appendage called

136
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
a suck hole I

137
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,240
Don't think Sega would have made echo the dolphin if it had a suck hole on it

138
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,040
You're gonna come up against there's kind of a barrier there the rocks are down you're gonna have to use your suck hole powers

139
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,060
Suck in the blow pit fish with your suck hole. Just shoot it at the evil

140
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,700
Yeah, there were like fucking scary aliens in that game. You remember it you think oh, it's just peaceful swim

141
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
No one remembers echo the dolphin

142
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
But could they because

143
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:23,140
Would they a lot of times dolphins do seem to be judgy? Yeah. Oh, yeah, and I wonder what I mean other than the fact that

144
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,340
they've got

145
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,620
Basically way chiller lives than us. I don't know what they're lording over

146
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,260
I think if the dolphin could tell they wouldn't be cool about it, right? No way

147
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,660
They get up in your ear and like

148
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,780
God I I

149
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
Meet at a dolphin once

150
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,740
And I was not hungover

151
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,540
But I had extremely bad diarrhea

152
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,180
Diarrhea, so it was a Tuesday and

153
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,700
The dolphin didn't say anything so

154
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,420
We're good

155
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:05,060
We're good folks now. Okay, you didn't have diarrhea on the dolphin, right?

156
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,620
If I did, I don't think I'd be talking about it in front of my 1000 new friends Justin

157
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,340
No, I don't think I'd tell my I diarrhea on a dolphin story to my

158
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,780
Room full of 1,000 strangers Justin. I don't think I would do that there

159
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:23,900
But I am trying to establish the premise that all you've proven is that dolphins cannot sense that

160
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:27,280
prior to and directly after

161
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,700
You will the your dolphin experience you'll be having very liquid and frequent bowel movements

162
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:38,480
Why the fuck are we using dogs to sniff shit out? We just be walking dolphins through airports. Yeah

163
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,300
Yes, we should Travis be walking dolphins through airports

164
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,300
You're right

165
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,980
We'd build them a suit

166
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
Idiot

167
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,780
Fuck me, I guess I'm the asshole our household vacuum while still functional in a technical sense

168
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,100
Isn't quite a great suck hole on it that vacuum

169
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,700
Isn't quite what it used to be since my housemates sucked up an entire crew length sock with it

170
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,500
Which he left for me to discover and extract after weeks of shrugging non-committally

171
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,500
Every time I wondered aloud why the suction was so bad

172
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,140
I continued to do my best with what we had feeling that I wasn't in a financial position to purchase a new vacuum

173
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,900
But my mother recently took pity on me and my dust-bound purgatory and purchased one for me on the condition

174
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,520
That my sock vacuuming housemate never be allowed to use it

175
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,180
what are some lies I can tell my housemate about the

176
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,060
Powerful highly efficient vacuum sounds coming from my room every Sunday

177
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,380
How do I keep him from discovering the new appliance and taking another

178
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,660
vacuum

179
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,860
It's like back who's that from

180
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,740
The sheet is disappeared. Let's move. All right, kill the bow. Are you here?

181
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,220
Is the problem with having an early show on a late show

182
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,340
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we've caught so

183
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:13,220
Why first of all, nobody vacuums there anything once a week that is the most buckwild thing how much dust are you

184
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,860
generating pink pin

185
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,220
I

186
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,780
Don't think your roommate will be too upset about the fact that they don't have to vacuum anymore

187
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah

188
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,500
I don't think you need a fabrication for like I'm just gonna vacuum the house from now on the entire apartment is me. I

189
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:36,360
Wish I could have been inside your roommate's head the first time you use the vacuum

190
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:44,080
post-sock experiment and you said huh? What do you think's wrong with this and they went

191
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,300
I wish I could be inside your roommate's head when they were vacuuming and they saw a big full-length sock on the ground and they

192
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
were like

193
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,520
I don't want to fucking pick it. Oh, whatever

194
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:07,140
Yeah, because it was not yeah, I think you you very generously say it was mistaken in here

195
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,800
It was not your your roommate looked at the sock and looked at where the hamper was

196
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,000
Actually, fuck this get a quick cost-benefit analysis of winding down to get the sock

197
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,740
Yeah, they always show you in the commercials though

198
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,860
How many socks they can pick up and suck you going they shouldn't put that in the commercials because it's like look sock after sock

199
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:32,660
It just sucks these bad boys up and eat some for lunch. I know we don't I'm gonna get a little weird and advocate a

200
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,400
Direct approach. I'm pretty sure if you look at your roommate and say yeah

201
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,980
My mom bought me this after you broke my last one and she doesn't want me to let you use it

202
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:47,180
That's a pretty good explanation because you're a fiend. You can continue to use the awful vacuum. Yeah

203
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,420
like I

204
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,820
Would say that you should not be direct if it weren't for the fact

205
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Your roommate did leave it for you to find it. Yeah, they not only intentionally sucked it up

206
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:04,260
They left it as a little mystery for you to uncover. They have lost vacuum privilege. That's right. They don't deserve it

207
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,900
I would be down. I love to lose vacuum privilege. Yeah, right

208
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,500
This is sort of like how I used to fake an allergy to Windex at blockbuster like you if you do yes

209
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,220
if if you do a bad enough job at something eventually people just I

210
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,800
swore for two years at blockbuster that no one had trained me how to vacuum and the only time you vacuum at blockbuster is

211
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,660
1215 in the morning because you closed at midnight and that's the last thing that happens

212
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:34,220
So nobody's gonna be like 1215 time to train this pudgy liar how to vacuum

213
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,140
They'll just go ahead and vacuum for you. So I went two years without ever learning

214
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Anyway

215
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,540
Selfie hey, that's a little distracting but go back. Let's do it. Okay. Here. Hi

216
00:17:52,740 --> 00:18:00,820
Okay, how about a yahoo? Yeah, this one's in him by level 9,000. Yeah, I

217
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,860
Can do better than that

218
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,940
Level 9,000. Yeah, Drew Drew at Drew Davenport. Thank you. Drew. Did you?

219
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,620
say

220
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:17,820
You say Drew thief. No, I said Drew Davenport and it's from yahoo answers user young spongy

221
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:37,820
Who asks what's in your dream stable?

222
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,360
For our equine science class my friend and I have to decide what

223
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,800
Good point Travis

224
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,160
My friend and I have to design our very own dream stable. We've chosen to be a boarding facility

225
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,200
Apparently we have unlimited money. So we get to spend obscene and offensive amounts of money

226
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,480
Here's all the stuff. We have a for a somewhat class obscene and offensive

227
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
It's just ten wieners, I

228
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,840
Don't know anything

229
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,720
We have all the stuff for a somewhat classy little boarding facility indoor outdoor arenas designated riding pastures trails a bunch of other boring stuff

230
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
We've included the prices of manure spread. Nope still boring

231
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,360
Is there anything I'm missing or anything fancy and so frivolous that my friend and I just must include my mom suggested

232
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,480
chandeliers in the indoor and barns

233
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Yeah, you just read the last line I

234
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,360
I thought that'd be pretty fun. My friend and I are gonna show Obama how to really spend billions

235
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,920
I

236
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,800
Look at him sitting there so smug thinking he knows how to spend billions. We'll show him. I

237
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,880
Hope he does get this documentation somehow. He's like, well, these ain't me good

238
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,080
Got me no one no offense intended. Well tough shit

239
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,000
Thanks, you're welcome, um, what's in your dreams stable dreams

240
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:20,360
Chandelier feels like a cheat because you should at least put something in that I can imagine the horses could give a shit about

241
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,840
Yeah

242
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,800
They I don't even know. I'm not a horse genius, but I don't think they could look up at him

243
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:33,200
If they're directly above I'm not sure a horse could get up there to sneak a peek is what I would say

244
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Not an angle, of course. I need a chart. But if you imagine a horse, okay, okay. No, never mind. I'm done

245
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,560
So maybe some fancy sconces instead

246
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,720
Level yeah, or maybe just more oats

247
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:56,440
Oats cuz it's a horse you're thinking of a very horse based user experience. I'm more thinking about me

248
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,520
You're right. Let me do this. Apparently we have unlimited money. Okay, how about unlimited horses?

249
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,440
If I walk into this fucking tesseract

250
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,800
This four-dimensional hyper stable

251
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
And

252
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,000
There's just infinite horses, but the horses are just infinitely long like in

253
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
fucking interstellar

254
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,160
Whoa, and I reached through the horse and I'm sending messages to my daughter

255
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,300
Suddenly interstellar makes so much. I get it fucking Christopher Nolan sitting at home like finally

256
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,900
Oh my dream stable. Thank you

257
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
infinite horses, but

258
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,140
What if they were in?

259
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,780
what if it was a

260
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,460
What if it was like a horse vending machine where you could just go and press a bunch of buttons and a horse?

261
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,060
Come out

262
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,580
You know what? Here's the thing. We're talking about

263
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,300
Obscene amounts of the idea of a horse vending machine. You got over it so fucking quick

264
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Well, okay. Can I tell you why?

265
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,200
Here's what bothered me most about the image you created. Okay

266
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Are they in little

267
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Plastic clear. It's not a gosh upon

268
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,020
Okay, so it's more you see him behind the metal spirals. You see a big my horse is stuck

269
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,780
I got two horses

270
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,820
Well shit, I can't take care of two horses

271
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,780
I'll just leave it in the tray than the next one. The good news is they both died

272
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,060
Cuz this is a dumb idea if you think about it

273
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:50,480
It'll be a very big machine and the fall would probably kill all the horse. It is an it is an interactive horse mass grave

274
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,060
Alright hold on hold on hold on I got a whole lot of pre-dead horses here

275
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:04,100
And you can kill anyone what dispensing solution 65 cents and their soul is yours. I

276
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,780
Think we should make a movie theater for the horses and I hear what you're saying horses don't like movies and

277
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,620
I get it I do but have you ever taken a horse to the movies? I bet you haven't

278
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:23,580
I'm one a theater with seats that are comfortable for horses because none of them are I probably wouldn't

279
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,340
Like movie theaters if they were built for people with half as many appendages as I have

280
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,660
which is the what horses have to go through all the time because they have four legs and

281
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,420
Also, I just think we should make a movie theater for horses. Well Justin I like that

282
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,140
Can I in closing can I alley you as a good book report? Can I?

283
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,700
What it you have unlimited resources, yes

284
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:53,020
Movie theater for horses also movie studio that makes movies for horses for horses. Thank you Travis

285
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,780
Okay, but directed by Christopher Nolan see this they would be like see biscuit secretary

286
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,180
I can think of like a billion. No, no, no, no, no no no no those are about horses

287
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:08,980
Yes, they're cool horse narrative for horses. Just like a carrot that swings for two hours

288
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,300
But also by horses, so we're gonna need to think about cameras a little bit yeah

289
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,380
Just really go back to the drawing

290
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,420
software

291
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,660
Before horses, we will need a big director's chair. Oh and how big are those Jodhpur is gonna be?

292
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:33,060
Yeah, you just need to change the mouse so who can fit in it and they can take it from there

293
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:39,060
The problem with horse movies is this uh-huh that it would be like the Christian movies

294
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,620
They make sometimes where they trick you into it by putting a big-name Hollywood star in there like Jeff Fahey

295
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:49,700
And then you think oh shit new Jeff Fahey movie. I'm stoked and then you get the end. It's like one man's

296
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,060
Inspirational journey, you're like wait a minute

297
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,500
Got me Jeff of dream stable is for real a new

298
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,300
For horses by horses if we have unlimited money

299
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,080
Could we just have a room in the dream stable that has infinite money inside of it?

300
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:11,300
Shit, I hacked your whole question. I have infinite money now. I

301
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,200
Wish Scrooge McDuck's been was like that. So when he dove in who just keep going

302
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Are you

303
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:26,320
Entrapped like a grain silo. Yeah, exactly. Here I go. Be like, oh shit. I thought I wanted an infinite money

304
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,040
But I guess I don't

305
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,040
And then it's like Twilight Zone

306
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Can I just say Scrooge McDuck

307
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,000
Ricky richest duck on earth, right? Yeah for sure. I can't think of a richer duck

308
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,560
He has a lot of empty space in his money bin it was very

309
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
Asterational

310
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,560
Right, even though he's got the most money a duck could have he's still got about five six of that. Yeah

311
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,040
Dive into it. He wants to be able to walk comfortably onto the surface of his mind

312
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,320
Right. So at some point as he was designing the money been surely someone went that's big enough, right?

313
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,360
Don't you think that's big enough? No, no, cuz he knows the more money he makes the less it hurts when he hits the money

314
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,080
So he's like punishing himself. It's like why doesn't he just have dollar bills? Why does he have so many fucking coins?

315
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,760
He's rich. Maybe that's it. It's all pennies. So it seems like a lot of money. It's like yeah, you're super rich

316
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,040
He has like three hundred and ten dollars

317
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:37,160
I should just dive in and land on a credit card. Is there a rich jag who has died

318
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,440
IRL because they wanted this experience and they jump and they're like, oh fuck. It's hard metal. It's a bit

319
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,840
That was the secret you need the bill to penetrate the surface of the coins

320
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,560
I just started a new job and while there's generally been good. I'm having a problem with my boss

321
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,480
I work for a streaming company that broadcast corporate meetings live to the web

322
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,700
So there's no room for failure during an event. That's too bad because every online meeting fucking sucks

323
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:16,920
Like clockwork before every event starts my boss approaches me takes off his headset looks me right in the eye and whispers

324
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Don't fuck this up

325
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, he pauses and then says even more quietly don't

326
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:36,140
This makes me feel incredibly nervous and even though I'm fairly sure he's just joking around and I have never messed up

327
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
He says it with a completely straight face

328
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,440
Brothers, how do I get him to stop doing this? And that's from live stream lament. Listen, I don't

329
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,880
He's

330
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:53,040
He's a person who's in a position authority above you and if you mess up it would be embarrassing and then he says this every

331
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,280
time

332
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,040
Why do you think he's joking? Yeah, he says he has given you no social cues to indicate

333
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,800
This is a 100% success rate tactic

334
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,480
It sounds like if you're crushing it if you're running the world's only successful online business meeting

335
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,320
Yeah, that's the other thing. It's like this tactic while it may seem a little heavy on the pressure

336
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,240
It does seem to be working on you very well. Is it bad boss behavior to look at your employee and say

337
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,660
I don't think you're supposed to I haven't been in an office since I worked at GameStop

338
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,800
If you consider that an office, but I don't think you're supposed to wait, hold on I don't

339
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Nor do any of us, I think. In any sort of non-home business situation

340
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
I don't think you're supposed to cuss. I

341
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Don't think you're supposed to cuss. If my boss ever did a cuss toward me

342
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
Isn't Justin your boss?

343
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,620
I'm not and I haven't been for 18 months, but thank you for being my brother I guess. No, I mean as as older brother

344
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,860
Oh, okay, like yeah within our hierarchy, I guess

345
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,360
Oh as the CEO. I've never seen an org chart of our family

346
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,080
I've never seen a chart of our family. I have never seen a chart of our family

347
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
I've never seen an org chart of our family

348
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
And I've never seen an org chart of our family

349
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,760
Oh as the CEO. I've never seen an org chart of our family, but I guess. I think we all roll up to dad

350
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
I guess. Yeah

351
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,640
Gervin do you know the yahoo should we get in the audience? I just got really uncomfortable with the idea that dad was our boss in any

352
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,480
Sort of in any sort of capacity. I

353
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,840
Say we go to audience. I think we go to audience. I want to warn I

354
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,080
I want to warn everybody. This is our fourth show of this tour in three days, which again is just astronomical amount of work in

355
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,080
Two of the three shows we did before this one

356
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:56,080
I had to leave the stage to use the bathroom because I drank a lot of liquids and it's feeling like there's gonna be one

357
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,920
Of those shows so that's gonna happen again at some point just to warn you there's Paul. Hi Paul

358
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:09,040
I'm putting my iPad away. Let's do it. Fuck it. I'm closing the computer. I'm

359
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,200
new

360
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,640
I'm just gonna keep don't stand up. I promise that's that's that ain't gonna do it

361
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,360
Let's start on the right side and then we'll just sort of just go all over

362
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,760
I see somebody that looks like with blonde hair sitting at the very end of the aisle

363
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,560
Yeah pointing to your own top of your head. No, you're pointing the one with the blonde hair blonde hair pointing the top of your head

364
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,960
You're standing up. Yes, you're standing up right now and you're going here. We go Mike's over here

365
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
I'm sorry that we started so far away

366
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:43,880
And we're scooting. We're scooting just scooting and scooting still scooting ever scooting and we're scooting and we are home

367
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,440
Hi, what up? Hey, you can yeah, feel free everybody if you're at the mic just go ahead and angle it to yeah

368
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,360
Shoot it right at you

369
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,920
Everyone not to yell things at her. It's very it could be very strong. Hi. What's your name?

370
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,560
My name is Jen. Hi Jen Jim or Jen Jen Jen. Okay

371
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Jen yeah, we got it. Yeah

372
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,280
Just three letters, but we're gonna get there eventually

373
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,840
What's your question? I have a theory and I have a really I would just love to hear your thoughts on this theory

374
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,760
Okay, thank you for coming to our dissertation. Go on. I

375
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,520
Know that some of you are college educated. Yeah, I've been to college. Okay

376
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:29,320
Here he goes. You can't do callbacks to the last episode. We did at this theater two hours ago

377
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
There we go. Nice

378
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:40,240
So I have a theory that every raccoon is the ghost of a confederate Civil War. Oh

379
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,800
Wait, hold on Jen do you

380
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:53,740
Do you really do you really know it's serious. I believe this just because raccoons are a scoundrels

381
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,360
Jen listen, you've come to the number one source for scientific discussion on the internet

382
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,160
If that's the evidence you're bringing to your theory

383
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You're gonna have to do better than that

384
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,360
They bet you better have seen him eating some Johnny cakes or something. I don't know

385
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,480
I mean, we are y'all are all tied up in the second part of the theory. I'm still I

386
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,040
Don't even think I heard the second part of the theory because the first part of theory is I think every raccoon is a ghost

387
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,400
But do you have evidence to support a ghost a ghost

388
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,560
a ghost probably cannot take my trash, but if it could it would

389
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:50,280
Every trash is another raccoons treasure. Yeah, but it's not a ghost! It doesn't mean it's a ghost!

390
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:55,400
That doesn't mean the raccoons a ghost! You said a raccoon thing not a ghost thing.

391
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I agree raccoons love trash

392
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:06,040
That is not up for debate. We're all agree that point is settled. I do not think that was part of the thesis statement

393
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:11,560
Is there a line in a history book that's like and Confederate soldiers love trash eating trash

394
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
those motherfuckers

395
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,200
Okay, so I want to hear more from you actually more than anything. I want my entire life

396
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,120
So please elaborate for the next 30 seconds. Go ahead

397
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,720
souls ghosts

398
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,160
Souls also live in raccoons. Okay, so it's a fluke situation where they reincarnated into

399
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:37,480
Okay, so that's not the reason I understand what you're saying. I wicked don't but it's I

400
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,880
Want to I want to I want you to workshop the theory a little bit more

401
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Yeah, I think it has I think it's got legs

402
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,200
But the four of them four of them four furry little yeah ringed legs

403
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
But what I need you to work on is

404
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:01,520
Raccoons or ghosts start there solve that one and then you can connect me to the other dots. So thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you

405
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,680
I'm sorry. Somebody brought a sign like this is WrestleMania. We have to do yeah

406
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:21,280
Don't everybody bring signs though from now on we want everyone to be able to continue to see and our stadium

407
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,840
We don't have stadium seating usually. Hi. Hi. Hello. What's your name? What was it? I talked during it. Yeah, shut up

408
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,760
Okay, Stefan. Hey Stefan weird vibe

409
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,000
Just to reiterate everyone we're gonna get weird

410
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,560
Please we need you to be our anchor point Stefan

411
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,280
Bring it down a little okay right here. Okay, what's up?

412
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,240
Well, I was gonna ask about horse vending machines, but I think we covered that. Oh, okay. How serendipitous. Yeah

413
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
so

414
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,440
My friend and I have a podcast where we talk about fan theories and hypothetical questions about raccoons and ghosts

415
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
It's not

416
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,520
It's called overthinking out loud and you can find it wherever

417
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,000
What is it what is your what is your question I wanted to know how to get free promotion for your podcast this isn't it

418
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,480
I

419
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,840
Sorry, go ahead

420
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:27,040
If you guys had any fan theories that you would like to give a discuss about a subject about anything

421
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,120
Oh, it's about anything. It's about anything Jesus for instance. So this one time I was doing a live show. Okay?

422
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,440
Then this person got up and asked a question and my theory is

423
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,240
They wanted to promote their podcast

424
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:57,880
Don't be ridiculous the fun is not promoting his podcast. He's secretly recording us to include on a future episode

425
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,680
I

426
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,300
Literally, I'm blanking. I have nothing for you. We just told you about Scrooge McDuck and his $310. It's true. Yeah

427
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,240
Can you it's a credit card. Could you just edit that in? I?

428
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,840
Think the characters in Mary Poppins specifically Mary Poppins and Burt are actually a

429
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Sort of infinitely

430
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
living alien beings

431
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:31,960
That have wandered the earth as immortals and possessed powers beyond our own

432
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,780
That they if you think about it

433
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,520
It makes a lot of sense and I'm not gonna I'm not gonna lay it out for your smart people

434
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,520
You can walk yourself to it

435
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,800
But I've watched that movie too many times, but that's what I think maybe just enough times maybe just enough times

436
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Thank you so far. Thank you so

437
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:57,240
I trust the two of you to pick somebody good. Oh, no, this would be great

438
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,560
You can't we're gonna pick somebody they're gonna ask their question

439
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,720
Griffin has peed in every show we've done. This is ridiculous

440
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:13,900
All right, hurry and ask your question before Griffin gets back and then he'll have to answer the question without any context, okay

441
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,840
Ask quickly go go go. This should be a good one. My name is Charlotte. Hi, Charlotte

442
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,600
And I also sent this in but I sent him yesterday

443
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Matt we all love the good your goof because your dad's grand lips. Yeah, but for me, it's a constant fear

444
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,400
because

445
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,040
Hold on one second. Charlotte. I need to put on my

446
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,160
emergency live podcast panic vest

447
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,360
In case we ramp into a fucking ravine like it feels

448
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,480
Paralysed Lee close to doing right now. Hold on one second

449
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,720
All right

450
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,080
Go ahead Charlotte. My life is in your fucking hands

451
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,400
Go ahead. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna do it

452
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,520
Go ahead. I'm trusting you. I'm not cutting you off Charlotte. I guess I should probably preface this. No kidding

453
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
Also Charlotte

454
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,680
You preface the things before this

455
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:21,560
You post facing a post facing it. Okay. It's a cost to hear my mother

456
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,040
and she flat out i'm a 25 year old married woman, and she

457
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Every time she sees me

458
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,600
She kisses me square on the lips. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're back on track. All right

459
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,140
Is your question how do I celebrate my parents loving me so much

460
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,180
There's that but also it really skews me out

461
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,780
So I really don't well, it's just right here. Yeah. No, I know where her mouth is

462
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,260
It seriously skews me out so I'm wondering how do I ask her to just not stop

463
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,260
kissing my mouth I

464
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,000
Know we say that sometimes and we're talking like we're big confident not incredibly anxious people

465
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,160
But this is one of those situations where you can be like, I'd rather the mouth kisses stop

466
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,300
Yeah, gang does the thought cross your mind every time she kisses you right directly on your human mouth?

467
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:19,300
Does the thought cross your head? I'm gonna talk to her about that someday

468
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,380
Oh, yeah, this sucks

469
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,980
Let me hit you with this idea cuz I get

470
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:32,940
Conversations is bad conversations in general is bad. So what if you?

471
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,540
Wean her off of this with like a little side juke a little left side dash a little wave dash left

472
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
You're doing it like oh

473
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,940
One of those that was presented in Joby 5.1 surround sound for our friends at home

474
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,260
You've tried that and it did not work. Oh, no

475
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,820
Oh my god, I would like to Charlotte someone was running up the aisle behind you for a hot second

476
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,820
I thought it was your mom coming against it. I

477
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:02,220
Was so excited. I was like so excited. I was flipping out

478
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:07,300
They were completely in shadow. I just saw a silhouette but I was like, oh shit

479
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,940
Here it goes

480
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:19,260
But okay, so I've only been a parent for ten months now, I've been a parent for three years

481
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,460
I'm gonna I also have a child

482
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:30,540
I'm gonna make a bet. I don't think your mom likes doing it either

483
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:35,780
Your mom is afraid that if she stops you'll think you she loves you less

484
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:42,820
She's afraid that if she doesn't do it, you'll be upset. You'll be upset. She thinks you're into it. I know

485
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,820
Every time she gives it she's like god damn. This is weird. It's so weird

486
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,860
You could she just couldn't find an off-ramp, you know, like you get to a birthday and you're like, well this today's the day

487
00:40:54,860 --> 00:41:03,420
I'm gonna stop fucking Hagrid kicks in your door like you're 26. You don't have to kiss your mom anymore, Harry

488
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:13,700
Talk to your mother talk to your mother. No one should kiss you on the mouth of that you really wanting them to that's a pretty

489
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:20,740
Good general rule for life. It seems like this episode we did it. This is it. She's listening. Hi. Thanks for

493
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,820

494
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,340
Thanks for listening to our live show. We we did not want to put up three live shows in a row

495
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,660
We really want to try to space these out. But Travis is moving and then my baby was sick

496
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,660
and then I got the sickness and

497
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,960
There's just been a series of unfortunate events. And so we had to put up another live show

498
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,700
Which I'm I'm genuinely sorry about and hopefully we're gonna get things back on track soon

499
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,580

529
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,020
McElroy, but it's sold out in like zero seconds. Sorry about that

530
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:39,160
We but we are sure the brothers will be fine with this TGIF style crossover

Thank you for being our DM and our sweet baby brother. We love you. We love you, too

532
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:48,180
Sorry, you couldn't get on adventure zone. It's you know, it's a hot button commodity

533
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:52,620
Well, we only do half as many of those as we do these so boom. Bam. You're good to go

534
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,940
That's probably not true either

535
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,180
But if you do want to get a message on the show just go to maximumfund.org slash Jumbotron

536

Thanks to John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song into departure off the album putting the days to bed

540
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,020
Thank you to

541
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,300
justice and Dizzy Rascal

542
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:24,680
for the remix from the video game DJ hero that we used as the intro to this episode because

543
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,780
Justin like really wanted to get pumped up

544
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:32,460
That was really why we did it and oh, there's a big sight gag coming up that we explained a little bit later on

545
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,340
But I didn't want you to be lost where somebody asked a question

546
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,020
Just as Justin is coming back on stage then he pivots on his heels and walks right back off stage

547
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,140
And it was very funny

548
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,500
And I didn't want you to be confused when there's like two minutes of uninterrupted laughter. That is what happens

549
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,860
Um, I think that's it. I'm gonna go now. So thanks for listening and

550
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:55,320
Go to maximumfund.org check out all the shows there. They're great and we'll be back next week. Bye

551
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,500
There is a new series of Star Trek coming out and

552
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:07,180
Maximum fun org has submitted to our blackmail and agreed to host a new show on the network

553
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,060
We're calling it the greatest discovery. We've got

554
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:18,080
Photographs we have recordings. We have web browser history on everyone at maximum fun

555
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,380
Those are the things that have allowed us to have a second Star Trek show on maximum fun

556
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,020
There's no way they're happy about this

557
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:32,420
But we will be recapping every episode of Star Trek discovery all 15 of them as they come out over

558
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:40,360
The fall and winter and we hope you'll join us by going to maximum fun org and looking for the greatest discovery

559
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,140
We're looking for it wherever you download podcasts

560
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,080
How about okay somebody with pink hair is pointing to somebody in front of them in the center

561
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:54,820
Yes, you're standing up and waving with both hands. Yes. Yeah, and you put any signs. Yeah, right. No, this is good

562
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,980
You have to be very specific because like literally every time the person's like well

563
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:05,260
I am wearing a fuchsia jacket, and I'm wearing a jamiroquai top hat, but it may be somebody else with a fuchsia

564
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,740
Hi, what's your name? Danny? Hi Danny

565
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,660
so I need your guys's own advice advice on how to

566
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:16,740
Convince my cousin that the patriarchy is real. Okay

567
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:26,300
Hey, here's the thing he he believes in the gender binary, okay, but he doesn't believe in gravity

568
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,740
You

569
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,060
Know you probably don't write country songs, but you've got the start of a great one right there

570
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:02,140
Danny sorry for the

571
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,180
Just ran on stage and then ran back off

572
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,260
Burrowed into the ground like a mole

573
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:17,300
Oh Danny may I offer a suggestion a slight tweak on the wording of your question, okay?

574
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,580
Yeah, hi brothers. I need advice on how to stop talking to my cousin

575
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,940
That's valid. Thank you

576
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:27,620
because at a certain point

577
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:35,220
Convincing them is not the issue. Yeah is yeah is if you want proof like can you just tell them to like?

578
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:40,940
Look at the replies to any woman's tweet on Twitter literally ever

579
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:49,420
You need proof that the patriarchy says let me show you movies but gravity seems

580
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,160
We could probably start the work, I mean that was like fuck yeah, let's defy gravity

581
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,600
Yeah, how does he not believe in gravity he's a flat-earther too and

582
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:11,200
You know what if you had put that sentence earlier it would have been surprising now, it's like oh, yeah, yeah

583
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,640
How do you how do you believe in flat earth, but not gravity are we glued to the ground?

584
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,760
Don't you have a finite number of minutes on this earth do not waste them on bad people anymore. This is my permission. Thank you

585
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,040
Let them go. I know that's harsh. Yeah, that's harsh, but listen

586
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,880
Family is given both given but also earned and this person's lost their privileges to you

587
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,080
This is important. This person is not ignorant. They are willfully choosing. Yeah

588
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:51,840
Yeah, do not believe in these two totally there things anybody who will look at you and go it is easier to convince them that

589
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,840
The earth is flat

590
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,280
But it's hard to convince them

591
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,840
That gravity exists. Yeah, not because someone hasn't tried. Yeah

592
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,840
Yeah, you're you're you're doing this person. Congratulations. So that's a big

593
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:14,400
Mile all the time you free room for one more new person. That's great. Anybody in the market for a cousin today

594
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,600
Let's see some hands who wants a cousin. Hey, I see a lot of cut a lot of potential cousins for you to choose from

595
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,980
We're here on another episode of cousin swap

596
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:34,060
The extreme cousin makeover, how was that? That was good. It felt brutal to me

597
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:43,420
We just proved your family tree he thanks for coming he deserves it honestly. All right, thank you so much. Thank you

598
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:52,600
Justin you're back back from the room. You want to pick somebody? Okay. There's somebody who's kind of dancing in the middle

599
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,840
It's yeah, come on down

600
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,280
You got to stop doing that every time hi, what's your name? Hi brothers. My name is Chelsea. Hi, Chelsea. I'm sure

601
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,240
Thank you island time. I love it. So I'm a third grade teacher

602
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:16,600
Thank you, thank you and one of my students the other day was like wow when you smile it's very creepy

603
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Oh

604
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,120
Just quick note it amazes me that that kid said that and yet there are adults in this room like how do I have a

605
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,120
direct conversation with someone

606
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,040
Fucking putting it on blast every single day kids. Oh kids will say the shittiest things

607
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:41,280
Well, that's why I love them. They're amazing. So my question is how do I convince him? I'm not creepy. Oh

608
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,840
Oh good. Yeah, that's a conversation any adult can have it. No, no, I'm not creepy

609
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,100
Yeah, you got to put a ton of effort into it. That's for sure

610
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,020
Yeah, the harder you try to not be creepy the more effective it will be. That's what my experience

611
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,720
Have you tried?

612
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,880
Have you tried wait

613
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:10,600
I think it's hunting. Hold on. There's some okay. It's been a long weekend. So something something fidget spinners, okay?

614
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,720
But but you can't the problem is you can't walk up to them like free I don't know what sounds

615
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,220
That is where miss Frizzle got her name, you know in the remake by the way, what's up, here's how fidget spinners work episode 1

616
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:35,300
You got to like let the kid like you're they like walk in from recess and you're fidget spinning like oh, oops, sorry

617
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,660
Yeah, it's important to not try

618
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,140
They've got to catch you fidgets

619
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,300
Hey, how cool is your school in vaping?

620
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,940
So I need to get a vape. That's what you're saying. You don't already have a vape. What are you doing? It's 2017

621
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:56,660
Or as the plane that the three holy shit. This is the funniest shit ever the plane. We're on today said

622
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:01,140
There's no smoking on this plane. That includes e-cigarettes and personal vaporizers

623
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:06,740
Excuse are you are you a flight attendant or a cop?

624
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
No marijuana cigarettes

625
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,100
To be fair personal vaporizer does sound like a space-age weapon. Yeah, sure

626
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:23,780
Yeah, you should not have on the airplane to be fair. So yeah fidget spin, but make it look like an accident

627
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:29,620
So yeah fidget spin, but make it look like an accident and don't smile while you're doing it. No. Yeah dead dead face

628
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,940
Yeah, so fidgets been very seriously. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you're not

629
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,140
Everybody should be taking their spinning extremely serious like

630
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,700
It's not a toy

631
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,900
Does that help absolutely, thank you. Thank you. I

632
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,380
Would like to propose an experiment, all right, all right, let's whatever it was an experiment everybody

633
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:57,780
There's a gentleman. Yeah. Yes, you're sitting in the spotlight very excited so you can do your question, but

634
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,260
You have a minute. Well, no

635
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,700
This is a bad experiment. You have as much time as you want. Hi, what's your name? Hi. I'm Bailey Olmsted. Hi

636
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:14,080
Hi, um, so Bailey, okay, like the alcohol got um, so I go to school here. I go to Emerson College

637
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,220
Shit all right college fans

638
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,780
and

639
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,900
But I'm I'm from New York. I

640
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:26,540
Like

641
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,820
We're in Boston, I don't I didn't know this people in Boston don't like New York. Yeah, so that's

642
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,500
Is it hi? Wait, is it hi? I'm I am a child. Please don't boo me

643
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,060
Okay, so yeah, don't boo Bailey, but is it because of baseball cuz if so, come on gang

644
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:49,460
This is a better place. We're at a comedy advice podcast show. We don't care about baseball here

645
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,780
So this is and we like we like the reds

646
00:54:55,300 --> 00:55:00,820
My question like how do I how do I be a little bit proud of the fact that I'm from New York in a town that

647
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:08,140
I love in Boston and and how do I make the two coexist that according to the audience are contradictory now Bailey

648
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:15,380
Did you start to get a little disheartened about the chances you need a good answer to this when we just literally just discovered

649
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:17,380
This is an issue 30 seconds ago

650
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,700
No, I I was a little worried when you're like, what do you mean?

651
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,860
Bailey I think

652
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,380
That that is the definition of pride

653
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,740
Because I think that if you are proud when everyone is okay with it

654
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:38,180
That's easy, but to be proud while people are giving you a hard time is true pride. Oh

655
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,960
That's beautiful I am I'm about to start crying in front of like 2,000 people, you know the thing Bailey

656
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,560
And then this is everybody. I I love it when people are from places where like there's places like

657
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,880
Morgantown and honey, so much, Virginia. You don't get along because they play each other in me. I shit you not friends of cold bowl

658
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,880
And

659
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:06,960
There's always and when you get people from Morgantown in the Huntington, there's always this like Huntington sucks thing

660
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,340
Why can't you just be like, yes, I am from Morgantown and also here is nice, too

661
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,340
They're both in West Virginia and they've both been ravaged by the destruction of the Kool-Aid

662
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,720
Here in the Northeast you have a lot more that unites you and separates you

663
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:27,240
So I think you should be proud of where you're from. It's got some pretty good things going for it

664
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,920
Not as many as Boston because I'm physically a

665
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,600
Long cold walk back to the hotel. I can't help you much there

666
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:46,280
Can you take a thing that's good about New York and a thing that's good about Boston and combine them and as I'm saying this

667
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,000
the only thing I'm thinking about no is

668
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,360
Is pizza chowder?

669
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,480
So all your friends were still like fucking up in arms about

670
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,760
Inter-relevant baseball season where these two were in close contention here and just say like oh that's too bad

671
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,040
You're still up in arms about that and you reach into a hearty spoonful of

672
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,760
cream and pepperoni

673
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:22,360
It would be something else pizza chowder is a fill-in metaphor for

674
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,560
Squashing this completely ridiculous East Coast East Coast

675
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,920
Thank you so much

676
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,080
All right

677
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:43,920
Let's do we've done the center law. Let's do back left somewhere. Somebody's waving a hat. I think on the on the far end

678
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,880
Yeah, you've got your hat in the air and now you're standing up. No, they had the hat in the air

679
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,880
Yeah, you're putting yourself with two hands. No

680
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,960
Both of you point at yourself at the same time

681
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,040
We're gonna be just stumble come down. Yeah, where's it go down to you? Yeah, we'll do that simultaneously. Yes. Okay. This will be fun

682
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,480
All right, we'll do you first and then we'll do you next. Hi, what's your name? Tim?

683
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
Canons kiss

684
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:18,520
Thank you very much Tim did we help him? Okay. No, hold on. No, I'm no no Tim got what he needed. Come on down

685
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,600
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this Reverend you look that up

686
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,280
Kiss I like your red socks Josie a red socks. Yeah

687
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,440
Hey Tim

688
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,080
I'm looking at some I'm looking at a tape

689
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,960
It's looking at a website. You may am I'm on a I'm gathering data points for you, too

690
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,640
Top result are nuns allowed to kiss that is yahoo answers Timothy

691
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,840
Don't be proud of that

692
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:02,420
All right, Pastor Michael Kelly says not passionately on the lips, but certainly they can give a kiss on the cheek or a hug

693
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,420
I

694
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,260
I've sullied myself for you Tim. Hello new person. I'm gonna wait

695
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:13,120
Hold on before you person who had long hair on the balcony standing up

696
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,100
I've never done a balcony one before so start wait making your way down. Yeah, sure. We're gonna give it a shot

697
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,300
Okay

698
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:22,800
What's your name? My name is James James. Hello James. Hi

699
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:29,300
So I am studying somebody stoked about James. Yes, so he yes, so he's got James fever

700
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,740
um, so I'm studying for a PhD in physics and

701
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:34,860
and

702
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,140
That is not typically the reaction I get

703
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,500
Hey hit you with a question. Yeah. Yeah is gravity real

704
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,480
It's a theory but it's pretty well-defined so

705
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,680
All right, not for sure, okay

706
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,840
That's way more hedging than I expected

707
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,720
I thought we'd get one three letter. It's 100% for sure you guys

708
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,960
Yeah

709
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,080
So what's what's up?

710
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:18,560
So I was wondering how to introduce the fact that I study physics without having people grown or say that they hated their high school class

711
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:23,280
I might I suggest I'm getting my PhD in motion

712
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,520
Oh

713
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,080
Just step back a little bit. Just step back one little bit. We're gonna do both of you

714
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:35,100
Just okay right there right there right there. Why do they have to step James is not a bear. No

715
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:38,080
Careful careful. No, they were

716
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:44,920
Really want to focus on James cuz James studies physics. He's not gonna have a lot of opportunities for this level of attention

717
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:52,120
So I just want to make sure he gets this moment James next time somebody drops something or does something that

718
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,080
physics is in

719
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,180
To be fair that could be anytime somebody moves or

720
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,160
You could just be like, you know

721
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,640
the reason that happened was physics and then give them like a little just a little taste of

722
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:17,200
of something interesting like a bomb all that, you know, and then

723
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:23,960
They'll be like hooked. You know, I'm gonna be like I wish you knew more about this and you'll be like good news

724
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,360
This is he's better PR cuz I was thinking that there I can't think of a schoolhouse rock song about physics

725
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,960
She's like anytime anything happens

726
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:41,440
When heat or energy is transfer between two things is that physics which one is it?

727
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,980
See, I don't know cuz it wasn't a fucking schoolhouse rock song about it

728
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,320
Can you say you're getting a PhD in psychics

729
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,880
Which is what I think the word physics is half the time that I see it written on a page

730
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:58,480
It's super effective at the gym. It's good against fighting. That is James

731
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,440
James you're pandering to me specifically, but I appreciate it

732
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:08,760
Just say you're getting a PhD in Pokemon. Yeah deep into it. Yeah, I was at a second alone. Oh

733
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,920
Everybody stop listen for a second. What's physics?

734
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,940
like I know basically what it is, but like

735
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:20,360
95 fucking percent of you that just laughed you're only kind of sure what it is

736
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,520
super quick

737
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,080
Yeah, so if you want to look at the study of

738
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:34,800
You're gonna have to come more correct than that, let's try one more again James what's physics?

739
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:39,120
Make a schoolhouse rock sexy for now. I'm just saying but like what's physics?

740
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:43,760
So our whole universe was formed in a hot dance place and nearly

741
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,400
Thank you, thank you James

742
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:57,240
Fucking don't really on the left you first in person on the right. Hello

743
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:07,000
Okay, so this is also another locational question, okay, I go to college here but I'm from South Dakota

744
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,020
Okay, a lot of is there a South Dakota Boston beef that I don't know about

745
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,520
Okay, we're good here

746
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,000
And the thing is is that nobody's met someone from South Dakota. You're the first for me. Definitely. Oh, really?

747
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I've never heard that before

748
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:29,680
All across this great nation of ours except to South Dakota, is that the just between you and me

749
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,680
Sucks so bad

750
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,520
Is that the first question you get anytime anybody says I'm from South Dakota. Is it the Mount Rushmore one?

751
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,520
No, they say are there people?

752
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,880
Taking from somebody

753
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,960
So

754
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,080
I think this is a perfect grift opportunity

755
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:59,720
To convince them of something that exists in South Dakota. I have already convinced people that there are jackalopes, but like

756
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,680
What's another thing? I should tell people that happens in South

757
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:15,600
Do we have an episode like a hundred years ago about a great fog wall that separated the Dakotas where there's some sort of

758
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,600
You know nobody here in this audience of a thousand people remembers it. So it must have not been a great bit

759
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,880
What's a fictional thing to tell people yeah, it's where Dave Coulee is from

760
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,720
You're not gonna fucking challenge you know, we might know he's Canadian and if so you just stare at him until they leave

761
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:45,920
What if when you say you're from South Dakota and they're like, oh there are people there you say oh you're thinking of West Dakota

762
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,200
The state nobody mentions the star no one can remember

763
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,960
What can I ask you a question to help kind of frame this what

764
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:02,720
Is a lot other than Mount Rushmore totally maybe this is a good opportunity for instead of you running a grift

765
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,600
You could educate our audience and the people who listen at home about right

766
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,160
Talk shit about West Virginia. I'm like home of soupy sales

767
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:16,440
Yeah, if you have any comments on like the infrastructure of South Dakota

768
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,800
Oh some people are fascinated when I complain about the coal industry taking over West Virginia. Yeah, that's why our education is so bad

769
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:27,320
Did you like did you like the voice of Chucky? That's Huntington West Virginia's own Brad Dourif

770
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,660
So Michael Cerveris you say all right, this is about it's South Dakota's time to shine

771
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,080
You're right girl, but West Virginia's had enough

772
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,840
There is the Mitchell Corn Palace

773
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,720
Is there wait, hold on. No, I don't want to hear what Travis has to say

774
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,640
I want to hear what you have to say about the Mitchell Corn Palace. We're on the edge of our seats

775
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,320
every

776
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,440
year

777
01:05:53,440 --> 01:06:00,080
Maze is gathered throughout the Dakotas. I guess there's not two of them. I don't think you need to pluralize

778
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,960
Because they make murals

779
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,200
Out of corn around the corn palace, which is actually just the jim

780
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:15,560
Edible? Travis has a great question. No, it's dried. I could still make that work for me

781
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:20,800
You want to say much Griffin loves corn corn art

782
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:28,120
Yeah, corn art. All right. That's I'm one step closer in my journey to knowing things about South Dakota

783
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:32,080
And I did not think corn art was gonna be the first step in this long journey

784
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:36,200
Mitchell Public Schools mascot is the colonels. I

785
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:43,760
I could respect that for sure, but not like a military colonel there like it's

786
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:53,160
Can I ask you so there's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace, yes, what's on the inside it's a municipal gym

787
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:02,120
Wait, Justin Schoke was very good. But your answer was also very good. So let's take turns Travis one more game again

788
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:07,320
There's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace. Well, what's on the inside the cob?

789
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,680
All right now Travis

790
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,240
When I'm editing this I'm gonna pick whichever one was better

791
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:22,640
So there's corn on the outside of Mitchell's Corn Palace, but what's on the inside it's a municipal gym that's better

792
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,520
I say lots of dumb shit

793
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:33,800
Um, just start talking mad shit about Nebraska. You don't have to don't build up, South Dakota

794
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,320
tear down

795
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,720
Tear down North Dakota

796
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:45,440
You all got a team up gotta unify to Super Dakota

797
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
the ultimate Dakota Oh

798
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,320
Dakota fanning watch the throne

799
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:59,360
Two states have combined and they finally take down Dakota fanning

800
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,080
Does that help

801
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,280
Now you in the aisle

802
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:16,820
Wait, what are you doing? Oh, no, we're right now. We're taking a selfie. I'm 35 years old. I don't understand and also 30 also

803
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,820
I'm 36

804
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:23,300
Oh, there's a lie. You don't understand. Hi. What's your name? Hey, I'm Chloe

805
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:29,860
So I work as an art conservator which it's like an art doctor

806
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:35,180
Like if it's old and broke and in a museum, my job is to make it not that okay, not in a museum you steal it

807
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,900
You craft you cracked my art puzzle

808
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:47,360
So like wait, can you I this is this is the fucking like episode where I just want to know everything about the question

809
01:08:50,820 --> 01:08:56,100
Restoration is I do I specialize in papers like old books and miss paper. What are you fucking?

810
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:58,420
What do you do? It like it's moldy and shit. I don't know

811
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,140
You need to know you should know it's your fight

812
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:09,500
Oh of expertise is not on us. Okay. Listen, I mean like it gets it gets ripped

813
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:15,100
If it gets wet you get those nasty say that I have eight. No, we hate tape don't take anything anyone ever

814
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:21,540
I have okay. Wait a minute for you. No, I just can I start I what's the like weirdest thing that you used to fix books?

815
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,100
Oh

816
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,620
Well, one of the weirdest things paintings conservators use is saliva

817
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:34,060
We're done go on okay go on with your question. I'm so sorry. I asked about your trade. No, no

818
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,340
No, I need to know they look like spit on it

819
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,300
No, they get a cotton swab sort of like for your ears

820
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,540
But longer and bigger and you put in your mouth and use it to clean a painting

821
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,600
Some it's not just cuz they forgot to bring anything else with them

822
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:51,620
Or is it because they are fucking like narcissist pervs like now I'm part of the Mona Lisa

823
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:59,220
They fucking take their friends and you see them like you see that one starry starry night, it's my spit on it

824
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,860
That's definitely the reason

825
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:10,140
Hey for a second go about two minutes ago. You talk some bad shit about tape. Is that a thing for you guys?

826
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:15,340
Is that like y'all really really angry at me? I cannot tell you how many paper conservators

827
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,220
I know that have mad beef about today. So let me let I love this fucking world of ours

828
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,940
I know it's a very good world. So let's be clear tape

829
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:31,220
Mean that's about the long and short of it, you know

830
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:37,820
Can I ask you a bunch of questions about the realness of the movie national treasure and some okay? Okay

831
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,260
Okay, like like for real though last summer

832
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,420
I did intern in the labs of the National Archives where that shit was shot

833
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:51,160
And there's a part where like Nick cage like burps onto the Declaration of Independence and a treasure map appears. Is that

834
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,880
How often do you find treasure maps? How often do you like burp on do it?

835
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:01,820
Like a piece of paper that's a treasure map as a map. I would say like once a week. So like I knew it

836
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,780
I know y'all want to get to your questions. I want to know everything about

837
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,460
Fucking fascinating everybody. Okay. Okay. What's your question? Sorry?

838
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,060
So I fix old art and shit. We got that

839
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:17,180
Yeah, but there's this one tool that we use when we want to make a nice sharp crease

840
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:21,100
Not an old stuff for like making boxes or whatever. It is called a bone folder, right?

841
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,940
Wait, oh wait, it gets better. So how that's the best word

842
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,620
So it's made sometimes out of animal bones. Sometimes

843
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,660
But

844
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:41,020
Fucking the heebie-jeebies up here. It's September. I'm not supposed to get these Halloween spooks already. Go on. Yeah, they are all haunted

845
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:44,100
It's terrible. Okay, but haunted by a deer is like no

846
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:48,940
We don't use my paper. Please. No, please please letter

847
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:56,920
So common parlance in the paper conservation world is when someone tells you to use your bone folder to fold something

848
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,920
They'll tell you to bone down hard

849
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:08,340
Yeah

850
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:15,380
With gratitude to the last episode of my brother my brother and me because I've recently realized my life's calling

851
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,900
Teach me your ways

852
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:25,880
It just goes to show what I've always said, which is paper conservators know how to fucking party

853
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,300
So I don't make it your

854
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:37,020
God to the fucking question yet. If your question is how cool is my life the answer is very well

855
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,340
Yes, it is and I do not want people to stop doing this

856
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:44,180
I love it. My problem is when this happens at work and someone says oh you're gonna really have to bone on hard on that

857
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,180
one I

858
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:49,540
Know what Justin's doing right now. Yeah, I do that

859
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:54,140
And then I think it doesn't like they've just been seeing it for so long that it doesn't connect that it's like very dirty

860
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,740
And funny and great. So I think they think I'm like, I'm not gonna do that. That's a shitty idea

861
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:05,380
How do I not make my co-workers think I'm shitting all over their ideas when I laugh at this funny shit that they say how long?

862
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:10,460
Quick brother pull how long in your life? Would you have to casually use the phrase?

863
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,620
100,000 years. I

864
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:22,180
Don't know how long an eon is but many of them right cuz I'm pretty sure I could be a hundred and two and saying

865
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:29,500
I've been born with a bone folder in my hand fucking

866
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:35,360
170 years old is going town to town folding bones fucking

867
01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:43,920
There's this is this is the this is the Kobayashi Maru it's gonna be funny forever

868
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:50,560
Forever it's not gonna not there's no words that we could say up here that will not make bone down, huh?

869
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,400
Especially when someone says to you you're gonna have to bone down hard

870
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,420
I guess the only thing is you just need to start responding. Don't I know it?

871
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,200
Thank you, thanks, yeah, I think that I'll really solve my problem

872
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:17,080
I don't think we solved it, but just thank you for this gift you yeah

873
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
All of us here tonight. I

874
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,160
Sense you up there. I knew I knew

875
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,620
Let's do like one more maybe yeah

876
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:34,040
Let's see, let's see we need to pick one quick. There's a I think the last like three apparently

877
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:41,320
How about okay? You're pointing to somebody there. You've got your hand. Yeah stand on up, and you're walking towards us here

878
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:43,320
We go yeah all the way over there

879
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,400
We're doing it. We're doing it. We're doing hey by the way good

880
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:54,720
Luck following that one because holy shit. Do you work in an industry with like a really funny named tool?

881
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm sorry just real quick something just occurred to me

882
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:05,680
There has to be someone who makes bone folder. Yeah, okay? We can't we got to be done with bone folders

883
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,160
We have to hi. What's your name? Hi? I'm Cory. Hi Cory

884
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:14,640
All right, so my old roommate when he would take a shower, okay instead of using a towel. He's a folder

885
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:21,000
Can you work so I can you just like I want to hear you, and I want to work with you

886
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,540
I'm gonna play in this space with you Cory, but you're gonna have that bone down hard

887
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:32,400
You're gonna have to work like bone folder or something to just like keep this I'm riding a wave right now

888
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,720
If it right now you're my co-pilot, and I have used a bone folder. Have you really I have

889
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:56,800
This is a good planet this but maybe you're the only two people who've used a bone fold up wait on

890
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,840
Show of hand listen I can't stress enough

891
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:08,440
I need sincere serious answers don't raise your hand if it's a lie raise your hand if you have ever used a bone folder

892
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:12,240
That's a shit ton of hands

893
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:18,680
Did you bring one

894
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,420
Okay, sorry, okay, sorry sorry Cory

895
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:27,160
I'm whatever you have to say is gonna be really important, and we're so paying attention to it

896
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:33,320
I'm definitely not thinking about how quickly we could go backstage an Amazon fucking one-day delivery some bone folders

897
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:38,600
We're definitely not gonna be thinking about whether or not we can get bone folders delivered to our hotel tonight before we have to fly home

898
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:44,880
And we're there seamless for bone folder definitely no definitely not thinking about if you can bring a bone folder on an airplane

899
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,340
What's what's your roommate used to shower tell that sounds tell me more after he would shower

900
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,300
Instead of using a towel he would use toilet paper

901
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:06,140
One time he even went all the way into the kitchen and then used paper towels and like I know he has a towel

902
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:13,260
I've seen it, but he's never used it so my question is is he an alien trying to steal my organs or like

903
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:16,020
like

904
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:19,580
That's really very wasteful

905
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:28,140
Extremely wasteful the towels right there, but then you have to wash the towel you don't gotta wash no toilet paper

906
01:17:28,220 --> 01:17:34,180
He just left the toilet paper out like damp. How many rolls so is your roommate right?

907
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:36,940
Yeah, old roommate he used one and a half rolls a day

908
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,740
Never never once bought any

909
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:44,600
Send us a question before cuz we definitely need to address TP sort of like

910
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,600
ridesharing

911
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:53,680
What's interesting we get a lot of questions where the question revolves around like this person does something weird and

912
01:17:54,760 --> 01:18:00,360
So very rarely does anyone entertain the idea of are they doing it on purpose to fuck with me?

913
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:08,160
And my guess is one time first time your roommate forgot to bring their towel in the bathroom

914
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,880
And just right off a toilet paper, and it freaked you out so bad

915
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:18,140
That they just can't do hey hold up. Hey hold up. How you know they did this okay?

916
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,200
Paper he would leave it hanging like on the shower shut up. No

917
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,800
With the paper towels he didn't know that I was home, and I was sitting in the front room

918
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,800
And I see him walk into the kitchen and just like

919
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:40,880
Oh, was it at least like Downey like fucking triple ply

920
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,340
Shit did your roommate ever display any like germ a phobic

921
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:51,120
I don't think I thought you were gonna say serial killer tendencies

922
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:55,000
Cuz the answer is based on what I know of them. Yes

923
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:05,040
Yes, you know in England. They don't really use paper towels, and they probably think it's pretty weird that we do so maybe

924
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,840
Because he came to America, and he was like these things fucking rule

925
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:18,840
Hey, let's just for everything. Let's maybe get too real here for a second. Why did why did y'all stop living together?

926
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,440
Because if it's not for this

927
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:27,240
Did what worse like um well he also left food out, and then we got a bunch of mice

928
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:32,620
That's bad. I like the way you said that though because it makes it sound like you went and bought a bunch of mice

929
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:35,680
He left food out period

930
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,000
And we got a bunch of my face. That's bad, but I've heard that one before

931
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,060
This other things new to me and exciting

932
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:51,940
Um so what's the question yeah, so is he an alien? Yes? Yes? Yes, yes, yes, yes

933
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:57,780

01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,820

938
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:31,380

939
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:37,780
Love yours um thanks got a nice. I'm glad we built this report

940
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,460
Mm-hmm

941
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,460
Tell us some other stuff you like about us

942
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:45,660
Please don't it said when she bought her shirt. I made it 80 cents

943
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:53,620
Maybe she made your shirt. Did you make this shirt? Thank you so much good design?

944
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,700
So I got it

945
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,740
I'm a female security guard at a truck gate. I am basically the only

946
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:08,520
Female there, and I have to deal with a lot of truckers, and so what's a truck gate like a weighing facility like it?

947
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,040
It's where like can you get a little sorry can you local something?

948
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:15,320
It's um where vendors will bring the food for supermarkets

949
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,400
And a lot of these truckers don't talk to women normally

950
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,920
but I'll check them in and out and like I write down their purchase order numbers and

951
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,160
They all think that I'm super like

952
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:31,240
Enchanted by them because they don't see a lot of women

953
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:39,540
Wait hold on they exist on earth though, right? What's up? They don't cease to exist when they leave your truck gate, right?

954
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,540
They see women other places

955
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,280
They don't act like they do

956
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,600
So they see you and they go

957
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:55,800
Oh like sometimes like if it's raining them like oh, man. It's your shirt in rain like oh, but

958
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,880
Either way some of them are really gross some

959
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:07,400
So no, it's it's very upsetting um you know it sounds like it

960
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,560
I'm saying it with this tone because if I said it with the tone

961
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,640
I feel that would be a down into the podcast. I'm saying it up here

962
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:19,600
I lied about having a husband once I went on my husband like that and the guy like leaned over went

963
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,600
Oh, I don't even care

964
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:30,520
That is not my question my question Jesus Christ a real God who has saved me from that being a real question

965
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:35,660
They all tend to call me things like sweetheart hon, babe

966
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,800
And it's yeah, it's real gross um

967
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:45,280
um, but I recently started responding with like no problem sport no problem champ and

968
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:53,680
Wait hold on is your question. How awesome am I doing? Yeah, the answer is very awesome

969
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,340
Can we hey can we come to you for advice? Yeah?

970
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:06,960
My question is what else can I use because I feel like I need it happens so often

971
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:10,000
I feel like I need more than just champ and sport okay, okay?

972
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:14,920
You have to understand that we would never have thought of something as good as the thing you've already thought out

973
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,320
You could keep going like slugger kiddo tiger

974
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,080
Dill weed

975
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080

976
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,000
Boner bone you put no boner wouldn't work

977
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,700
I feel like that would cause bone folders

978
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,420
What don't worry can I can I try no problem dad

979
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:45,960
Just see just fucking see where it go wait wait that might maybe pop off pop off

980
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,960
I

981
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,400
Don't want to go down that avenue so bad

982
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:58,600
What if can I ask you a question you run the secure security guard at the gate?

983
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:03,020
Can you just if they're like yeah, thanks a lot, sweetie. You're just like oh click

984
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:11,480
I'm outside. I'm outside with them. Do you have a gun no Jesus Travis?

985
01:24:12,240 --> 01:24:17,960
Don't be ridiculous. Do you have a taser? I don't I have a big flashlight. That's very hit him. Yeah

986
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,320
No, you don't have to hit all of them

987
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,480
But if you hit one word gets around Chuckers love to talk

988
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:28,960
You know I called her sweet. She's not very sweet. She's not very sweet. I was wrong. I caught her pumpkin

989
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,080
She is no pumpkin. I have she's a human being with big flashlight. I

990
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:38,820
Thought she was a baby angel. It turned out. She's actually a human being with a very large flashlight

991
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,480
Never gonna believe this

992
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,640
Do you remember do you remember that sugar dumpling I thought she was a sugar

993
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,360
It turns out she's a person and she's very strong

994
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,160
She has a flashlight she knows how to use it yeah, she's yeah, please get the word out to other truckers

995
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:03,600
And you know what listen this is how wild other truckers, but if this

996
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:08,720
If this sugar baby angel could turn out to be an actual living human being

997
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:16,720
Well, we can't really run the risk that others could be too. What if they all have flashlights?

998
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:23,720
What if all women have flashlights? What do we do there? What do we do there? We can't run that risk

999
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:30,400
May we just play it say cool. Yes, let's say for me cool. That's the big horn

1000
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:36,000
They have so anyway. I guess our answer is flashlight one of them, and I'm sorry for any repercussions
