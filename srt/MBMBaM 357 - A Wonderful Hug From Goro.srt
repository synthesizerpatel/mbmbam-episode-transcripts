1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,480
Tell everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,480
And I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,160
Listen, boys, here's the thing. I don't want to do My Brother, My Brother anymore.

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,720
I want to just talk about Twin Peaks, and I have a pretty big, listen,

10
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,840
but I have a bold theory that I would like to pitch to you guys.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,760
Welcome to our Twin Peaks theory cast, Twin... Three Peaks, no?

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,040
Garman Bosia Boys.

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,480
The Red Room Boys.

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,200
The Red Room Boys.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,080
Red Room Boys.

16
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,880
The Fun Lodge.

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,240
Gum Boys.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,560
Gum you like.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,120
Peepums.

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,280
Gum, the gum.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,160
The Bookhouse Boys.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,840
The Bookhouse Boys, done, cut, sold it.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,520
Got it, Bookhouse Boys.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,920
So, here's the thing. I've been watching Twin Peaks, The Return,

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
and I realized it might have a connection.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,000
Did you guys know that there was a similarly named show that came out in the 90s?

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,280
Okay.

28
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
And I think the two might be connected.

29
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,200
All right, so the theory is that Twin Peaks, The Return has a connection to another tele...

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Was the other television show David Lynch run as well?

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,880
Because I know he likes to sort of weave his universes together.

32
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
I haven't checked IMDb.

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,200
I know Kyle McLaughlin is in both.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Whoa, okay.

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,600
Yeah, right?

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
It's not Porlandi, is it?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
Because if that's the connection,

38
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,360
then you've just named two things that Kyle McLaughlin's been in.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,520
No, it's Showgirls.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,120
No, wait, sorry.

41
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
No, that's something different.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,640
But that is connected because those both take place in Nevada.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
2017 Twin Peaks takes place in Nevada.

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,640
I'm talking about there's a 1990 show called Twin Peaks.

45
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,360
What the fuck?

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,400
I know.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,120
How did Showtime even get away with making this damn thing then?

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Well, the 90s were the Wild West.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,600
Nobody even has records of that shit anymore.

50
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,080
But I found it buried deep on Netflix.

51
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,600
And I was like, wait, what is this show?

52
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,040
Yeah.

53
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,920
Now, I think I remember this show that you're talking about from the 90s

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,760
because it was on ABC, the America's broadcasting channel.

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,840
And it came on right after TGIF.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
It was like, thank God it's Friday.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,440
And then at like 10, 30 PM, it's like, where's your God now?

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,400
Because the show is, if I remember, kind of spooky and kind of fun and a little sexy.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,880
And so, what's the connection?

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,680
Is it just the name or is there other stuff too?

61
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,200
Griffin, listen, the list of connections is downright fucking spooky, right?

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,760
Okay.

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,640
So, I've been watching this 90s one.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,880
There's a woman with a log, right?

65
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,320
In the new one, woman with a log, there's references to coffee in the 90s one.

67
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

68
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,400
Hello?

69
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
They talk about coffee in the 2017 one.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,200
That's about it.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
That's as far as the list goes, actually.

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
That and Kyle McLaughlin.

74
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,040
And break.

75
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,960
Okay, so pretty fun bit.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:00,000
One of the things that I think would make it funnier is if you literally did not just

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
list all the connective tissue between old Twin Peaks and new Twin Peaks.

78
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,680
If the two Twin Peaks were in any way similar other than the ways you just listed, then

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
it probably would have landed a little better.

80
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
But it is, in fact, basically a completely different show.

81
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,600
I'd like to, let's talk, can I try a different sort of Twin Peaks we're on?

82
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,080
Sure.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:16,400
Oh, sure.

84
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,360
And we're back in.

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Do you guys ever think that David Lynch just wants to fuck a big cup of coffee?

86
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,280
Just watch any shows and stick with me.

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,360
There's a lot of stuff that I think David Lynch is really horny for that I think we

88
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
would consider avant-garde.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,120
Sure.

90
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920
That's a really flattering way of thinking about it.

91
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,920
It's just like sometimes you watch things and you get a really close up picture of like

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,200
some pie that like a woman wearing some 1950s clothes puts down on a counter.

93
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,040
And it's like David Lynch wants to fuck all this, this old aesthetic.

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,200
I think he's probably, I don't want to, he's a very talented man, but I think he's probably

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,560
made love to a big like redwood tree at some point.

96
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,240
So we are going to have two episodes in a row where we talk about fucking pies, right?

97
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
So this is our second one.

98
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,560
Okay, okay.

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,800
Sequentially.

100
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Well, I'm not saying, I'm not saying, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

101
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm not saying he has fucked a pie.

102
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
I'm saying he wants to very, very badly.

103
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
No, you're not saying he's fucked a pie.

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,680
No, you're not saying he's fucked a redwood.

105
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,200
He did fuck a tree.

106
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,440
Yes.

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,440
That's that one's true.

108
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
Why would the pie gentleman not take the pie to his room?

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,360
This has bothered me for a long time.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
Oh, from the pie gentleman movies?

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
He knows he shares the space with Eugene Levy, his father.

112
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,280
Yeah.

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,600
Why would he do the thing in his kitchen?

114
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
He knows he shares that.

115
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,080
Why would he do that there, Justin, that he is hoping to get caught?

116
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,640
Interesting.

117
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,320
An underlying guilt that he wants to be punished for this action, which he knows is wrong.

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,440
That's just it.

119
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,160
When Shermanator tells him about this pie thing, he says the guilt is what makes it so sexy,

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,040
Jason Biggs.

121
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,400
So, and it does.

122
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,120
It does.

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
It does.

124
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
I just asked David.

125
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,720
Like, it feels great to-

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Is it bad that I would rather talk about Twin Peaks for an hour than do jokes?

127
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
Is that a normal impulse to have?

128
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,480
Only in that it would be poisonous to our show.

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
To our show, yeah.

130
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
Yeah, because Twin Peaks isn't at all hot right now, Griffin.

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
People aren't just looking for that sweet Twin Peaks content.

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
I mean, I watched Twin Peaks The Return, and there's part of me where when I see Kyle

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,240
McLaughlin barfing up a gallon of creamed corn, I think like, I'm probably one of 50

134
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,760
people that enjoy this, right?

135
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,800
There can't possibly be more than 50.

136
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
I am enjoying this, but I have to be in the migraine.

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,520
There can't be any more than, oh, 50.

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,560
I have to be a member of an elite group who enjoy watching Kyle McLaughlin vomit up a

139
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
hysterical amount of creamed corn, right?

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm the only one.

141
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
Spoilers, by the way, spoilers for Twin Peaks The Return.

142
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,520
Kyle McLaughlin just expunges a ludicrous amount.

143
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,120
Tub's full, but Max and Irma's ice cream bathtub full of Garmin Bosia.

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,320
This week, sponsored by Max and Irma's.

145
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,080
Get that bowl of Garmin Bosia here at Max and Irma's and everything.

146
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,040
Should we do advice?

147
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,000
Griffin, can I say, I would love that.

148
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,000
I'd rather talk about Twin Peaks.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm gonna work Twin Peaks into a couple of my answers.

150
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,240
See if you can spot when I do.

151
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,480
This will be a fun game.

152
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,800
Last night, I had a dream.

153
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Well, this is an easy one.

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,160
The owls.

155
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,680
Last night, I had a dream that I filled up my tank and while giving me change, the attendant

156
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,240
called my eye and slips an extra 50 in my change.

157
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,840
He leaned in and whispered, this is a test, before telling me to have a good day.

158
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,440
What does this mean?

159
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Okay, y'all, we have expanded beyond the scope of advice.

160
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,480
This is secretly our Twin Peaks episode.

161
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,960
This is the caliber of episodes if we're getting into dream interpretation.

162
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,000
Can we just pretend?

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Let's remove a few words from this question.

164
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,320
Let's remove I had and A and dream.

165
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,120
So just last night, I filled up my tank and while giving me change, the attendant caught

166
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,440
my eye.

167
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,480
That would make this a much more palatable sort of request.

168
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,360
Yeah, let's just try that.

169
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
But also, a much more fireable offense for this gas station attendant.

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,160
Well, it's a test, Trav.

171
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
So he's not necessarily experience or not.

172
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah, not necessarily given them a 50 bucks.

173
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,600
One time, Daryl, your kill is $350 short again.

174
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Well, they must be tested.

175
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,760
This is like what Morpheus did when he woke up.

176
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,160
We woke Neo up from the Matrix dream.

177
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,280
And he said, this is a test.

178
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
He said, this is a test.

179
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
There's a good way and a bad way to do it.

180
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,280
Are you a robot?

181
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,560
Matrix movie one.

182
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,360
Have you guys ever thought about how different that movie would be if Neo had taken the other

183
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,680
pill?

184
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,600
Wow.

185
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:58,720
Right?

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,840
Where's that fan film?

187
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,320
It would just be him waking up the next morning, going to Subway, eating a Subway.

188
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
It would basically just be The Office starring Neo.

189
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Oh shit, Justin, you just opened my whole fucking thing.

190
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
Holy shit, yeah.

191
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,600
When Jim looks at the camera, it's like, I should have taken the other pill.

192
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,960
Get me out of here.

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,920
Get me out of here.

194
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,320
This Dwight robot is a real pill.

195
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,680
It doesn't mean anything.

196
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,520
You just ate like some weird food during the day.

197
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,360
That's what dreams are.

198
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
And that's what I believe.

199
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,120
A lot of people say it's like a collection of your experiences that all get garbled up

200
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,640
in there and then they get barfed back up like so much Garbongoda by Kyle McLaughlin.

201
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,400
But I think it's just you ate like a weird, you ate too many cinnamon rolls during the day.

202
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,880
It's an undigested bit of beef, a lot of mustard, a cup of cheese.

203
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,960
It's some chili you ate that got up in your brain somehow and then it was like,

204
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,320
all right, let's do $50 gas station test.

205
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
Here we go, hit it, roll it, roll that beautiful bean footage.

206
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,920
You know, guys, I've been thinking a lot about Tibet and-

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Okay, okay, here we go.

208
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Oh, okay, here it is.

209
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,520
What?

210
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,040
And that's about as far as my joke went though, so.

211
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,920
God, this coffee I'm drinking is so sexy.

212
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,040
These pretzels are making me thirsty.

213
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,280
You know, we went back to my place, bada bing, bada boom, you know, from Twin Peaks.

214
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,600
You know the part in Twin Peaks where the woman, the fiance dies because she licked too many envelopes?

215
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,960
Could I be any more possessed?

216
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,520
Yeah, I know, that's my favorite part of the show.

217
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,920
Smelly Cat, remember the Smelly Cat song from Twin Peaks?

218
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
That if they could just decipher, they'd figure out who killed Laura Palmer

219
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,360
and also why the cat was so smelly.

220
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,640
Yeah, good.

221
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
I love playing arcade games, but as a childless 30-year-old man,

222
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,760
I feel weird going to the local putt-putt slash arcade by myself.

223
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,120
We live in a small town in Georgia, so the closest grown-up arcade,

224
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,240
a la Dave and Buster's, is almost 90 minutes away.

225
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,400
How can I satiate my desire to play childish games without actually having a child?

226
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,640
That's from too old for this shit in Leesburg.

227
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Leesburg's pretty country, they got a great mall.

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh, you know.

229
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
Used to work out there.

230
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,680
Wait, what?

231
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,000
Yeah, for a couple summers, Leesburg, Virginia.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
I was working at that children's theater.

233
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,000
This is Georgia.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
This is Georgia, buddy.

235
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Yeah, it's a pretty country up there.

236
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,840
Okay.

237
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,920
My name is Lee, and I'm claiming this one too.

238
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,800
Lee, you can't, not again.

239
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
You already got one, Lee.

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
You already got one.

241
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,200
Well, I like this one also.

242
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,680
If you had to buy, you know my hangout with buying them has always been,

243
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,840
if it breaks, that just became a very expensive place to put dust under.

244
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,360
Like, that's a very expensive-

245
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,240
That's a good point, J-Man.

246
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
I was trying to come up with something.

247
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
There's literally at that point-

248
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,720
There's nothing you like in it.

249
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,800
Like, I was gonna make a joke like paperweight.

250
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Absolutely not.

251
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,920
No.

252
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,240
No, I don't think I will lift that up to put paper underneath it.

253
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,800
It's a lot like-

254
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,440
It's nothing.

255
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,880
It reminds me of the episode of Twin Peaks where they bought the Frogger machine.

256
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,120
Yes.

257
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,360
Yes, and the problem too with the arcade machine and it breaking down is,

258
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,160
I don't think they're making new ones.

259
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,520
I don't think anyone's made an arcade machine since 1998.

260
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
So like, you're wrong.

261
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,120
So like-

262
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Okay, I don't need those tweets.

263
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,480
Just real quick, I'm gonna pop in there.

264
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,560
I'm speaking hyperbolically.

265
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:44,800
Okay.

266
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
They're not as popular as they used to be.

267
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,640
So there's probably not as many new ones being made.

268
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,080
What arcade machine would you get?

269
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,400
This is the problem, isn't it?

270
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:01,280
Because like, anything you get, fucking somebody comes into your den or whatever and is like,

271
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,640
whoa, you must really like Smash TV.

272
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Like, yeah, I guess I do.

273
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,320
Is it your favorite game is all you do play Smash TV?

274
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
Because all your other games are little CDs and they go in your box and you play them.

275
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,520
And this is the only one you have that's the size of a coffin.

276
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,080
So you must really like Smash TV for it to occupy this much square footage in your house.

277
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,800
Yeah, I guess it's a pretty good game.

278
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,920
I used to be, I used to like it.

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah.

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,800
Oh, you better like it.

281
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Man, you must play a lot of Smash TV.

282
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
Not so much anymore.

283
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,400
It is Smash-

284
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,080
It's a hundred years old and I did pay like $2,000 for this and it's the size of a coffin

285
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,920
and it's in my den and it's taking up a lot of square footage, but it is still Smash TV

286
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,000
and I've beaten it quite a few times.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,080
And like, I just finished Prey on PS4 as a great little RPG shooter.

288
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,840
I don't want it to be the size of a coffin in my office forever.

289
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,840
And it's just going to be there for a while until one of its pieces breaks

290
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,480
and then I never touch it again.

291
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,840
Boy, you like Prey a lot, huh?

292
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,680
To have this big box of it.

293
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,120
What I might do is, what you could do is do one of the, like a cocktail.

294
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,520
Now that I can get-

295
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:13,760
Yeah.

296
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,080
Because then that, when it breaks-

297
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,560
It's a table.

298
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,440
Now you got a table.

299
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,760
Yeah.

300
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
You got a table where it's a very heavy table.

301
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,320
You could do like one of those emulator things where like within the cabinet is a computer

302
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,080
that has like a thousand games, but-

303
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,440
Well, I mean, you pay for it.

304
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,560
But it's not, I don't think that has in the street cred.

305
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,000
There are three arcade games that I would own in a heartbeat.

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,960
Here we go.

307
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,840
Joust, Burger Time, and Tapper.

308
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,920
I fucking love Tapper so much.

309
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,680
Oh, yes.

310
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,160
Tapper.

311
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,520
That's my third.

312
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
DDR would at least, I would get some good exercise out of it.

313
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,960
And the Deal or No Deal machine, it would just be nice to have like Howie Mandel's voice

314
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,080
booming from my garage every like minute and a half.

315
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,160
You know what I mean?

316
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,400
Like I'm just in the living room watching Twin Peaks and just like having a really great

317
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,280
time with my kids.

318
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,360
And then Howie's in attract mode.

319
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,600
And he's in attract mode like, come on, Donna, open these fucking briefcases.

320
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Like, whoa.

321
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
I don't know why.

322
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
You just lost a million dollars, fuckface.

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay, Howie.

324
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,440
Whoa.

325
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
If you did buy like a machine like that, you do really have two options, right?

326
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Like your choice is to have this like stupid malfunction, like pointless box of glass and

327
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,080
steel, or you can have Howie Mandel shouting at you 24 hours a day.

328
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,040
That's really not a good option for your Deal or No Deal machine.

329
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,920
What if you just got like a licensed and like connected to the system video gambling machine

330
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,400
just like right in your house that was like fully like you could put money in it.

331
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,360
You could win money.

332
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,360
So I'm like really, really porny.

333
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,800
It would be good too because someone would be like, well, Justin, your gambling's out

334
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,280
of control.

335
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,080
You've got to stop.

336
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,600
And he's like, I don't think that's a wise investment.

337
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,920
I don't think I got my money back out of it.

338
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,160
Justin, you got to stop playing so much video poker.

339
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:12,960
The house always wins.

340
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,720
Like motherfucker, I am the house.

341
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,800
It's in my house.

342
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,280
I win.

343
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,280
I can't get rid of, I can't quit gambling because this investment is either going to

344
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:28,880
pay for itself or not like very much, but it might, you never know.

345
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,040
I'm having a lot of bad beats today.

346
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm having a bad day at poker, but the cards are so sexy, so horny and sexy.

347
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
It's just fun.

348
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,680
It's kind of fun and flirty to play it because you know, you shouldn't be here.

349
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,840
I want to read this Yahoo cause it's a good transition.

350
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
It's from a level 9,000.

351
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,360
Yeah.

352
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,920
Drew, Drew, Drew.

353
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,320
Java port.

354
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,560
Thank you.

355
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,720
True.

356
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,920
It's from your answers user.

357
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,160
Sorry.

358
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
Something's gone wrong.

359
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,000
We'll say Dougie asks, what do you think it would feel like to get crushed or killed

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,680
by Goro from Mortal Kombat?

361
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,400
Probably not good.

362
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,200
Like not good.

363
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,520
Well, maybe it's like a hug.

364
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,400
A hug that's like one degree too much.

365
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,840
Yeah, it's like two hugs.

366
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,160
So Goro does have that happening.

367
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
Goro is a big, a big man from Mortal Kombat.

368
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,440
He's got four arms, I think, or does he have six?

369
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,840
Not six.

370
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,880
Six is too many.

371
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,360
I feel like at first it might be-

372
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,800
I think he's got the four arms and the two legs, which are kind of like arms, but with

373
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,840
feet at the end.

374
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,480
You're right.

375
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,880
Okay.

376
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,760
So six sort of stick out, stick out body parts, whatever those are called.

377
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,920
I feel like at first it might be, it might be kind of nice.

378
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,160
Okay.

379
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,640
You know what I mean?

380
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,120
Like until you died from it, at first you might be like, man, four arm hug.

381
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,440
Yeah.

382
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,640
Nobody gets these.

383
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,160
But you are getting it, you know?

384
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
So it's good, good, good, good, good, very bad.

385
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,240
Ruh-roh.

386
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,720
Yeah.

387
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
That's about, that's the trajectory of it.

388
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,360
Good, good, good, good, good, good, nothing.

389
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
So I guess what I'm saying is like, as a way to go, not bad.

390
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,480
Right?

391
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,960
Because it would be like, oh, this is so nice.

392
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,320
I'm getting tired.

393
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,640
Done.

394
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Like that's it.

395
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,320
The scorpion is just like, oh no, he got me with his big grappling hook thing.

396
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,120
Oh, it's in me.

397
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,400
He's pulling me towards me.

398
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,280
He took off his mask.

399
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
There's just a dang skull under there.

400
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,640
This is all very scary.

401
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,920
Oh, he burned me up.

402
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,880
Every part of that, from the grappling hook to the skull to the burning, was scary.

403
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
Goro's just like, hey, do get over here.

404
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,280
Get on in here.

405
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,600
Get on in here.

406
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,040
That was actually his catchphrase.

407
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,320
Get on in here.

408
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,200
Get up into this.

409
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
Get up into this.

410
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,520
And pop.

411
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,760
The scorpion is irritating because you would definitely have a good 15 seconds where

412
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,680
the thing is in your chest.

413
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
You're like, oh man.

414
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,280
Oh man.

415
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,080
Why would you?

416
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Sub-zero freeze you and you're like, oh, I'm frozen.

417
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,240
If he punched me now, I'll break all over.

418
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
And oh, I'm watching him because I'm froze.

419
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,080
I can't, I can't not watch him and I got to face right and he's walking over.

420
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,880
He's going to punch me.

421
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,160
I just thought he would break.

422
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,960
He broke me.

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,520
I'm done.

424
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,520
It is doubly irritating because he said get over here and he didn't even give me a chance.

425
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
Like you said it.

426
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,680
Give me a chance, especially the second time that you've done it.

427
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,920
I clearly know the stakes, right?

428
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm going to get over there.

429
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
If you just ask, you don't need the hook again.

430
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
I don't understand this carrot and stick approach.

431
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,040
Just like, just ask me to come over there and I will for sure.

432
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,840
It's just, there's no, there's no other fighter.

433
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
Kung Lao, you see the razor brimmed hat before you even start fighting.

434
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
You're like, he's going to cut me very bad with that.

435
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,440
And now I'm just anticipating it.

436
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
Can we not do this, please?

437
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,200
You know, here's the, okay, I would like to take a second to talk about who I think is

438
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,200
the most insulting character in the Immortal Kombat universe.

439
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,800
And that's Johnny Cage because here's the thing, you look around, you got a scorpion.

440
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,280
He shoots out a thing or you talk about your sub-zero, he can freeze you.

441
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,000
Gora, he's got fucking forearms.

442
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,360
Johnny Cage is just a human.

443
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
And when he kills you, he gives you a signed headshot of himself.

444
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,040
That's so insulting to the person he's just killed.

445
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,280
What?

446
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,560
He's a, he's a prick.

447
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah, it's like, hey, I killed you and you can shoot out ice and chains and have forearms.

448
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,040
And I killed you with my simple human strength.

449
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Yeah.

450
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,560
You know, and also the other thing is if you kill Johnny Cage, like as you're killing him,

451
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,680
he's like, well, I'm a human.

452
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,240
Good job.

453
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,160
Yeah, yeah, I'm a real, I'm a real person, Justin.

454
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,360
Does it feel good?

455
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,440
This is your first, this is your first taste of, it's your first taste of it.

456
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,840
Great.

457
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
I think that Johnny Cage should never be able to win a fight in Mortal Kombat.

458
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,960
And here's why.

459
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
He's fighting up against a seven foot dude with like four arms.

460
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,320
I don't think he wins that fight.

461
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,680
Obviously he did in the Mortal Kombat movie because he used a little bit of trickery.

462
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
But like he's fighting against a guy who could do ice magic.

463
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
I don't, I wouldn't win that fight.

464
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,560
I don't see why Johnny Cage gets to.

465
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
What do you think it'd be like to be kissed by Goro from Mortal Kombat on the mouth?

466
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,600
So Griffin, you got a yahoo or Justin, you want to read another question?

467
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,480
Not tender.

468
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,960
I think he has his good-

469
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,400
Wait, how the fuck do you know?

470
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,200
Do you think just because he's a big strong person with four arms who can crush

471
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,280
you that he can't also tenderly kiss a person?

472
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,840
I think Goro would be an excellent kisser and let's move on.

473
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
And with that said, I go to the same coffee-

474
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,480
I think Goro fucks like a leaf, like falling off of the most beautiful tree.

475
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,240
So is there a nude Goro online that I can-

476
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,440
I mean, probably.

477
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,000
Can you generate a nude Goro?

478
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,520
Hey everybody, this is your pal Griffin.

479
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,320
Just want to let you know.

480
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,240
No, those eight characters I just typed into the Google search bar,

481
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,000
I think I may have found the worst eight characters you could type into Google.

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,360
Oh, I gotta get a quick one.

483
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,680
Oh no, he did it.

484
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,760
I will say there's a lot of just sort of regular old pornography here in the mix too,

485
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
as if Google was like, I'm not going to give you that,

486
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
but I can tell what you're trying to get to.

487
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,600
You probably meant to just type nude, right?

488
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
The Goro is a typo.

489
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,680
I go to the same coffee place every single morning.

490
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,480
Sorry?

491
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,760
Uh, damn good coffees.

492
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,880
Damn good coffee, got it.

493
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,440
Yeah, got it.

494
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,520
The same guy, Daniel, always makes my same vanilla iced coffee every day.

495
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,640
Everything was normal and fine, but for the last two weeks,

496
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,920
he's been pestering me about getting something else and saying things like,

497
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,320
don't you want to try the new brownie espresso flavor?

498
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,920
Or we've got something new for you, a fruity drink,

499
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,280
and gets visibly disappointed slash annoyed whenever I politely decline

500
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,760
and just ask for my same vanilla iced coffee.

501
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,040
It's been making me feel pretty uncomfortable slash pressured.

502
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,000
Is there any way I can ask him to please quit pressuring me

503
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,440
and just make boring drink?

504
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,640
Or do I have to find another Dunkin to dunk in?

505
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,560
That's from the girl with the Dunkin tattoo.

506
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,760
Okay, listen, I don't know how to break this to you, but he may be,

507
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,720
shh, take a seat, he may be doing that to everyone

508
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,280
because he works at a business.

509
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,080
So I'm not sure, but he may just have to ask you about the new drink

510
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
that they've got and see if you want one.

511
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,720
Because you know how it happens at every store like that?

512
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,080
Maybe what's going on here.

513
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,160
Now, I can understand your confusion because he's obviously very, very bad at his job.

514
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,120
If he's throwing up fucking solid gold Shark Tank pitches like,

515
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,800
we got something new in stock, fruity drink.

516
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,840
What does that even mean?

517
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,440
You know.

518
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,760
I have to imagine this question asker has not actually been paying that close attention

519
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
to the pitches.

520
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,320
Maybe Daniel didn't throw up this rock.

521
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,400
Maybe they just heard, you know, mango,

522
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
strawberry, and then that's all they heard.

523
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,360
Now, I guess this is a fruity drink.

524
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't know.

525
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,160
He's just a, he's just a chittering automaton that makes my vanilla iced coffee for me.

526
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,200
Unless, unless I'm going to deliver this in a tone of voice.

527
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,280
And it's possible, just possible that this is how Daniel said it.

528
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,680
Don't, don't you want to try the new brownie espresso flavor?

529
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Oh, I see.

530
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
This is, this is implied, please.

531
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,920
This, this, you mean Travis, this is him.

532
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,320
The man, the myth, the legend, Daniel Duncan.

533
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
I worked so hard to make this.

534
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,720
It's a drink of fruity flavors instead of vanilla.

535
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,800
I thought you would, Samantha, I thought you'd really like this.

536
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,360
It's got mango time in it.

537
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
You don't want, I made it for you, I made it for you.

538
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,920
My dad, Carl Donuts, said that nobody would like this and I didn't believe him.

539
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,560
He said, people just want the coffee.

540
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,840
But yeah, I didn't believe him.

541
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,320
He sounds like that and I didn't believe him.

542
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,520
And I guess I should have listened.

543
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,920
I guess nobody does want a fruity drink.

544
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,120
We've got all this mango back here.

545
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,160
It's starting to stink.

546
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,560
Go buy a fruity drink next time and throw it to the floor as hard as you possibly can.

547
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,040
So it splashes all over the store and yourself.

548
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,960
And then while you're still sort of dripping with the kiwi stuff, just say like, now,

549
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,800
what did we learn, Daniel Duncan?

550
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll have the regular.

551
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,680
Call him that to his face, Daniel Duncan.

552
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,960
Call him that to his face.

553
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,920
Say, Daniel Duncan.

554
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,000
And he'll say, you know, I, you don't have to be a member of the Duncan family to work here.

555
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
I'll say, I know how this, I know how this whole cabal works.

556
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,560
Or you'll call him Daniel Duncan, he'll fly off on a giant spoon

557
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,920
and you'll solve the mystery.

558
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,520
He's like the Baba Yaga.

559
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,440
If you say his true name, he has to leave and go to torment another village.

560
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
Yeah, I'd love to try the fruity drink.

561
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000
Can you just say your name backwards?

562
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,640
If you could just say that out loud, I'd be happy.

563
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,280
Here's what you do.

564
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,400
You get the fruity drink, you upturn it on his head and say,

565
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,480
either you just want a major sporting event or I want you to fucking listen to me next time.

566
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,400
And I guarantee you will never have this issue again.

567
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,040
You just won the Super Bowl.

568
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I don't pay you to think, Daniel.

569
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,520
You just won the Super Bowl of not giving me the drink I want.

570
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,920
Well done, coach.

571
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,720
Gonna definitely take him that big brass ring for this year.

572
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Uh, I, if we're gonna buy our own vanilla iced coffees, I don't know.

573
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,440
I got nothing.

574
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,040
It's time to go to Muddy's own.

575
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:27,040
What do you think it's like to be crushed and killed by Daniel from Ducks?

576
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,800
Father's Day is just around the corner and dads can be impossible to shop for.

577
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,520
Difficult to find something that feels special he'll actually use.

578
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,440
Always waiting in the last minute, etc.

579
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,000
You know, this is a common copy point that we get.

580
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,560
Hey, everybody's impossible to shop for.

581
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,120
Nobody, it's impossible to buy gifts for anybody.

582
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,800
Uh, except for babies.

583
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,640
It's really easy to get stuff for babies.

584
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,000
If it crinkles, if it shakes, you're good.

585
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,560
You can buy things that are too grown up for babies and just say like,

586
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,640
it's too big for him now, but just wait for it.

587
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
And then you never have to fucking find out if they liked it or not.

588
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,920
It's delayed, delayed reaction.

589
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,480
It's perfect.

590
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
Since I became a dad, actually, it's weird.

591
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,800
I've turned into just a really unsatisfiable picky piece of shit.

592
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,240
So I get it.

593
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,720
Yeah.

594
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,120
Well, here's a great solution for that, Griffin.

595
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,600
Harry's, it's all about a great shave at a fair price.

596
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,960
You get five German crafted blades, flex hinge, lubricating strip, 100% quality guarantee.

597
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,520
There's a full refund if you're not happy and they just cost $2 a blade or less,

598
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,600
which is half the price, being generous, of the leading five razor brand.

599
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,760
And the shave sets from Harry's, they start off at just $15.

600
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,720
And you get $5 off when you go to harrys.com slash my brother.

601
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,080
You'll get a razor handle, moisturizing shave gel, and three of Harry's-

602
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,680
That gum you like is going-

603
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,920
Yeah, I was going to say, is this a Twin Peaks reference?

604
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,240
Your-

605
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,840
That, and it's got a flex hinge, so sometimes the blades bend back.

606
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,480
And interesting fact, that $15 set is named Harry Truman after the sheriff from Twin Peaks.

607
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,640
Harry's limited edition Father's Day Shave Set comes with a storm gray razor handle,

608
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,600
chrome razor stick, because that's all dads could love anymore.

609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
Dads don't want color, guys.

610
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
This is what dads could handle.

611
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,560
If it's not the color of a battleship, dads aren't interested.

612
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Three relation blades and a travel cover.

613
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,920
And it comes in a sleek, giftable box with the option to add custom engraving

614
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,280
and a personalized card for free.

615
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,800
Don't try to get your own box.

616
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:34,960
No, no, no.

617
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,920
Don't try to get your own box.

618
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,960
It may not be giftable.

619
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,120
Your dad may throw it back at your face, and that's dangerous.

620
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,760
It's full of razor.

621
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,720
Full of razor blades.

622
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,680
You might actually find that you're unable to keep it, that you try to retain it,

623
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,200
but it continues to escape and present itself to someone you love.

624
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,520
Unlike that dumb box that you have, you give it to your dad or uncle or whatever,

625
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,720
and then the next day it's sitting on your couch like the mask,

626
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,560
because you can't gift it, dummy.

627
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,480
So that address again, harrys.com slash my brother.

628
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,360
That's harrys.com slash my brother.

629
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,280
We did a good job of that commercial.

630
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,640
Five dollars off a shave set.

631
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,120
Hell yeah.

632
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,080
Go, go, go down.

633
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,640
I need to look at this one, because there's a lot of red text on this one.

634
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,760
There are not a lot of things.

635
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,320
Well, that's because this one's a serious business.

636
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,520
That's what I'm going to say about Betterment.

637
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,280
It's a serious business.

638
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:26,480
And they have lots of things that we just can't say because of laws.

639
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,920
But it's the largest independent online financial advisor.

640
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,760
That ain't no law against that.

641
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,720
And they help improve customers' long-term returns

642
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,160
and lower taxes for retirement planning, building wealth, and other financial goals.

643
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,000
That was all a legal sentence.

644
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,520
A legal sentence, I just said.

645
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,560
So we're good so far.

646
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,480
You know how you listen to our show hoping to get some financial advice?

647
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,680
Oh, God, no.

648
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:48,880
Don't do that.

649
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,080
Betterment.com slash n-b-n-b-a-m.

650
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,360
It says, I have to tell you that investing involves risk.

651
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,320
So that's done.

652
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
That's out of the way.

653
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
And this one also, their tagline, Betterment.

654
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,960
Rethink what your money can do.

655
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,840
I don't know how many of our listeners want to get investing.

656
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,640
So I think the best thing we can do is offer us really bad investing advice.

657
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,040
And then they'll be like, well, this is obviously not right.

658
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,000
Let's go to Betterment.

659
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,840
So for instance, if I said, y'all, it's time to double down on cans.

660
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,720
You want to get as much money in cans as you possibly can.

661
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,160
See?

662
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,320
And we can do something fun with that, too.

663
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,120
Cans are popping off.

664
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,960
It's everybody's favorite way to store things.

665
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,160
Investing involves risk, guys.

666
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
Oh, it's risky shit.

667
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,720
It's risky.

668
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,280
You need professionals like those at Betterment.com.

669
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,600
Man, I hope this is all legal to say.

670
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,800
So find out how you can get up to six months managed for free by going to Betterment.com

671
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,800
slash M-B-M-B-A-M.

672
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,960
Betterment.

673
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,240
Rethink what your money can do.

674
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,840
I'm rethinking because I put my fucking shirt into cans, y'all.

675
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,080
My baby's retirement fund that I was saving up for him.

676
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,800
Is it a shirt?

677
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,720
I put it in cans.

678
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,440
It was a shirt.

679
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,560
I was going to sell my shirt so my baby can go to good college.

680
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,880
Is it a good shirt?

681
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
Love that O'Henry story.

682
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,280
This shirt cost $250,000.

683
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,280
Here's a message for Peter Owen.

684
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,400
It's a Jumbotron message.

685
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,080
If you want to get a Jumbotron on the show, too bad we sold out.

686
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,920
Here's a message, and it's for Peter Owen, and it's from Nicole Rupp, who says,

687
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,320
my dearest love, happy first anniversary from your favorite brothers and your favorite wife.

688
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,560
Aren't you glad I made you listen to that first time?

689
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,400
Aren't you glad I made you listen that first time?

690
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,920
I hope this message makes up for some of the times I left the lid off or something.

691
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,800
I love you, Cole.

692
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,080
Wait, Cole?

693
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,360
Cole?

694
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,160
Wait, wait.

695
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,920
This is, oh, Nicole.

696
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,800
OK, OK, OK, OK.

697
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,520
It's short for, yeah.

698
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,440
Oh.

699
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,400
And let me tell you something.

700
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,880
Let me tell you guys something.

701
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,000
Everybody listening.

702
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,720
Cans?

703
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,840
No lid to leave off.

704
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,400
There, it's a one time deal.

705
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,160
Please buy these fucking cans.

706
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,360
My house is full of cans.

707
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,720
My house is full completely with cans.

708
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,800
Happy anniversary, Nicole and Peter.

709
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,080
My caniversary.

710
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,600
All right.

711
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,640
That's good, Travis.

712
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,840
I'm just trying to do some branding for you.

713
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,560
Can I bring you on as a marketing media manager or whatever?

714
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,480
Because I got to move these cans, Travis.

715
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,160
I'm sitting on 10 cans right now.

716
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,520
There's a slogan for you, Griffin.

717
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,800
Nobody hates these cans.

718
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,960
That could help, too.

719
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,520
From Twin Peaks?

720
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,680
I want to tell you guys about the Nisei Garage.

721
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
It's a monthly music show.

722
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,520
Well, it may be Nisei, it may be nice garage.

723
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,960
A monthly music showcase hosted out of Ripe Art Gallery in Huntington, New York.

724
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,440
You get three acts per show with different bands every time.

725
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,000
Now, you want to hear some new music?

726
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,120
Go to NiseiGarageMusic.com and you get an archive of every show

727
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,320
spanning over two years and 50 plus acts.

728
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,960
And if you're local to Long Island, you can check out Nisei Garage on Facebook

729
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,240
for show info and updates.

730
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,840
They got new recordings and videos to those pages once a week.

731
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,520
So there's bound to be something for everybody.

732
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,040
Don't be fooled.

733
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,200
Don't go to ShittyGarage.com.

734
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,800
That's completely different.

735
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay, let me see this garage.

736
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,240
Whoa, yeah.

737
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,480
They shouldn't call this a garage.

738
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,120
When I hear garage, I think of like my old paint cans

739
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,040
and my classic cars that I have.

740
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,000
My sort of Jay Leno-esque collection of classic cars.

741
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,120
Covered in paint cans.

742
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
Covered in paint cans.

743
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,400
This looks like a nice garage.

744
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,360
One where you can keep like a big freezer full of jerky or something.

745
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
And or like musicians.

746
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,520
All right.

747
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,880
Freezer full of musicians.

748
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,360
What's Ben Affleck and or Drake up to?

749
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,320
What show should I be watching right now?

750
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,920
Should the rock run for president?

751
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,880
How about Oprah?

752
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,680
What's a great French film about lady cannibals?

753
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,240
Who's stronger, Luke Cage or Iron Fist?

754
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,200

759
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm not going to judge.

760
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,600
This was sent in by Brulee, who says...

761
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,240
Thank you, Brulee.

762
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ella, who says,

763
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,160
who are the real emos?

764
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,040
Who do you think are the real emos in our society today?

765
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,280
We have many people dressing like them,

766
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,200
but who are the real ones?

767
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,520
I think it's hard to tell because there are people who try to look cool,

768
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,720
and so they dress like an emo.

769
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,000
Then there are real people who suffer and are truly emotional.

770
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,640
Who agrees slash disagrees with...

771
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,600
How do you agree or disagree with who are the real emos?

772
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,720
Who are the real emos?

773
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,560
Because you see somebody and they have that

774
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,680
wild hair that I see on kids at the mall.

775
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,440
And it's like, are you all?

776
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,400
But you can't say it, but it's like, are you all?

777
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,840
But really, you think about it,

778
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,880
and maybe the real emos is like Tom Bergeron.

779
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,800
See, okay, Griffin, here's the question.

780
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,680
Is it a subversion thing where it's like you look at someone and you're like,

781
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,760
they look emo, but they're not real,

782
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,160
and that person doesn't look emo and they really are?

783
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,440
Or is it that within the population of the emo-looking population,

784
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,880
there are actual emos in there?

785
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,920
It's so much deeper than your just wild mall hair

786
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,920
or your just sort of the clothes that they all have.

787
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,040
For me, it is the music, but you can never ever tell.

788
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,480
Jill Biden loves Panic at the Disco, and you wouldn't know that,

789
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,760
but she's real emo.

790
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,720
Do you guys remember Balloon Boy?

791
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,680
Yes.

792
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,720
Do you remember Balloon Boy?

793
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,760
He went up in the balloon or he didn't and his parents were trying to get on TV.

794
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,040
He was real emo.

795
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,960
He was one.

796
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,520
That's one.

797
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,120
So that's at least one.

798
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,400
Yeah.

799
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,120
Chris Carrabba, the lead singer for Dashboard Confessional?

800
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,640
Not, not really.

801
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,360
Weird.

802
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,720
Just cashing in on it.

803
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,040
The Heaney family, you know they're emo

804
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,400
because Richard Heaney made an invention called Bear Scratch

805
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,160
that is a long log that you nail to a corner of your home

806
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,680
and then you rub your back on it.

807
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,440
It's a long stick that you adhere to your wall

808
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,600
and then you scratch your back with it.

809
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,480
It's called the Bear Scratch.

810
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,360
If you had to pick one, who would you say is more emo?

811
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,680
Joe Montana or Joe Montagna?

812
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah, probably.

813
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,040
Well, Joe Montana used to throw footballs for money

814
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,960
and they don't let him anymore.

815
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,440
That's it.

816
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,800
He's probably not happy.

817
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,000
He's probably not feeling great.

818
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,520
He's probably got like weird swollen shoulders with like football bone spurs

819
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,480
and that would make that I think he I think he definitely

820
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,440
listens to Taking Back Sunday.

821
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,360
I thought he had swollen shoulders from not being able to throw footballs.

822
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,880
I have to get the throws out.

823
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
I'm saying they're building up in there.

824
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,640
He owns a lot of Sunny Day real estate albums, all of them.

825
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,280
On the flip side, though, Joe Montagna constantly has to remind people

826
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
that he's not Chaz Palmentieri.

827
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,920
So that may be something that he's kind of sad about.

828
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,040
And Joe Montana.

829
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,600
No, no, you've misunderstood.

830
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,320
Man, God.

831
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
Hey, Joe, as long as we got you here, can we chuck the pigskin around?

832
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,880
I mean, I guess.

833
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,480
Yeah, right.

834
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:34,880
I guess.

835
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
You know I'm not Joe Montana.

836
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,320
Oh, no, I know.

837
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,360
I've just always wanted to play football with you, Joe Montagna.

838
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,680
OK.

839
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
Did you guys ever play on Genesis?

840
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,960
Joe Montagna's football went away.

841
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,360
It was good because the quarterback was Joe Montagna, the actor,

842
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,920
and he would he did not throw the football well or accurately.

843
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,440
So it was really a running game.

844
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,080
Very focused on the running game and Joe Montagna's football.

845
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,800
Have you guys ever wondered if maybe they were switched at birth

846
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,440
and Joe Montagna was supposed to be a football star

847
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,600
and Joe Montana was supposed to be an actor?

848
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,960
If your name is Joe Montana, there's no reality in which

849
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,640
you're not a football quarterback.

850
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
Like you have to be with that name.

851
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,960
Well, but Justin, if Joe Montagna had gone to the right family,

852
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
he would have been Joe Montana.

853
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,200
The last name doesn't travel with the baby wherever it goes.

854
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,720
That's the outliers, people.

855
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,120
That's that's what Malcolm Gladwell was talking about.

856
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,720
Yeah, the whole chapter about Montagna versus Montana

857
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,360
and how a last name affects a child's football performance

858
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,720
is one of the more esoteric.

859
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,360
But I think enjoyable chapters of the outliers.

860
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,440
You cannot go to an all time low concert

861
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,600
without seeing John Madden there.

862
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,760
He's he's truly I think that's about as deep as it gets.

863
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
He as long as we're talking about football gentlemen, deep,

864
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,880
yeah, deep, deep roots in the emo community.

865
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,720
I'm just saying you never you don't look at somebody

866
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,240
with their wild hair and say you're an emo

867
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,640
because you don't know that John Madden is deeply,

868
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,000
deeply into the scene.

869
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,760
That's actually really hard for him, too,

870
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,440
because he refuses to fly.

871
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,160
So he's got to get on that big bus every time

872
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,480
and just follow all time low around.

873
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,440
He'll just travel with them.

874
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,360
He'll like be in the bus with them and just be like,

875
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,120
great set last night.

876
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,620
Boom.

877
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,920
He makes his buzz pull over at the same rest stops they do.

878
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,680
Like literally every time they use the bathroom,

879
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,680
they hear echoing in the men's room.

880
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,320
I can't believe I'm taking a dump with all time low.

881
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, it's my dream.

882
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,680
This is my dream.

883
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,360
Yeah, we did it yesterday, John.

884
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,080
Now get back in.

885
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,520
We need to practice the new songs.

886
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,200
Justin's doing a Paramore song.

887
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,160
This is my favorite track.

888
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,320
I want a much.

889
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,880
Squad.

890
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,360
Squad.

891
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,280
I want too much.

892
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,840
Squad.

893
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,340
Squad.

894
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,720
Good news.

895
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,800
I just found out this week that Carl's Jr. and Hardee's

896
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,680
have a site for press releases.

897
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,600
And I'm pretty excited about that.

898
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,720
Because they up to some shit always.

899
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,440
They're into the business.

900
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,600
This may, I've read a lot of these.

901
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,360
This may be the most buck wild opening.

902
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,040
It's a real up and down.

903
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
So hold on for the ride of your life.

904
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,840
After welcoming back fictional founder, Carl Hardee Sr.

905
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,200
Wait, what?

906
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
Tire screech.

907
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,400
What?

908
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
And purging their past live on the internet last weekend.

909
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,240
So I guess.

910
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,120
They're on some McElroy level of metafiction right now

911
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,720
that I am kind of deeply into.

912
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,880
So here's the wild thing about this.

913
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,120
This is an advertising campaign where they had an old man

914
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,800
pretend to be Carl Hardee Sr.

915
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,720
And the reason the place has been garbage for so long

916
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,080
is that his son, Carl Hardee Jr.

917
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,360
was running the place and that's why they've been garbage for so long.

918
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,440
That's the advertising campaign that they were trying for.

919
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
So now Carl Hardee Sr.

920
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,400
That's one way to do it.

921
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,240
When Domino's did this, Domino's were like,

922
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,120
yeah, our pizza's trash.

923
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:19,920
We're gonna fix it.

924
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,560
And then they fix it.

925
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,240
It was like, it's okay.

926
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,120
It's better now.

927
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,320
Their thing is like, it's my dumb ass millennial son.

928
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,840
He's the reason burgers stink.

929
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,040
So now we're back.

930
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,320
And sorry about all the commercials with all the objectified women.

931
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,280
That was my son.

932
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,480
My son's just so wildly just horny all the time.

933
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,960
Just profoundly, so emo.

934
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,880
Sorry about my emo, horny son.

935
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,840
He's horny for burgers the way that David Lynch is horny

936
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:48,000
for coffee and pies in the 1950s.

937
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,560
And they made sure to clarify fictional founder

938
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,880
because that's fun for your campaign.

939
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,440
Okay, the chains today announced their next

940
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,920
and most epic food innovation.

941
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,920
The baby back rib burger.

942
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,440
God, with bones and everything, bones and all.

943
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,160
It's the first ever QSR.

944
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:10,880
Quick, who's got it?

945
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,440
QSR?

946
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,320
I can't think of a Q word.

947
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,200
Quick service restaurant burger to feature real boneless baby back ribs.

948
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:25,040
If only there was another word for a quick service restaurant.

949
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,360
Not one that doesn't have all the baggage.

950
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,600
They fired fast food junior

951
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,440
and brought back the original founder,

952
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
quick service restaurant senior.

953
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,360
They are reclaiming.

954
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,920
Okay, it serves as the ultimate expression

955
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,320
of the brand's recently reclaimed identity

956
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,200
as pioneers of the great American burger.

957
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,000
Christ.

958
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,500
Wow.

959
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,900
It's a fucking burger that you put more non burger meat atop.

960
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,100
It is, this is not the signing of the civil rights act.

961
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,700
Hardys, Carl.

962
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,780
Griffin has sort of guessed the twist here

963
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,580
and they lay it out and say it features real boneless baby back ribs

964
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:11,060
that are charbroiled and dipped in sweet and smoky cattleman's

965
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,660
original BBQ sauce.

966
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,580
The ribs are then stacked on one of the chain's

967
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,660
famous charbroiled beef patties.

968
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,420
And it's like, you can't just say that.

969
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,180
You're doing something terrible.

970
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,180
You're doing a sin.

971
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,420
You can't just say the sin with a straight face

972
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,260
and not expect us to know you're sinning.

973
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,220
Can I say something?

974
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,700
I don't want to shop here anymore.

975
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I always take my family here every Sunday

976
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,500
and go have a great time with their very tall burgers.

977
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,540
But like, if you're not going to stand up for your fucking son

978
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,740
when he makes a mistake,

979
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:45,620
that's an element of this we haven't really discussed.

980
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,700
It's just like, my dumb shithead son fucked up our company,

981
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,980
so fuck him, he's out.

982
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,740
Anyway, here's a rib burger.

983
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,460
All better.

984
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,820
Sorry it was so bad.

985
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,620
My son sucks.

986
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,660
So Carl, we're looking over your resume

987
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,740
and we're so happy you want to join us at Twitter.

988
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,740
What sort of job experience have you had?

989
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,740
I ruined Hardys.

990
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,780
Yeah, my dad let me go and he hates me now

991
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,180
because I made too many sex commercials.

992
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,620
Wow, he didn't stand up for you?

993
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,100
No, not even for like a fucking second.

994
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,780
Those sex commercials were pretty bogus.

995
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,740
Yeah, I know.

996
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,860
But he's nerve-fucked.

997
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,060
Anyway, my dad fired me.

998
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:20,740
I got a new commercial for you.

999
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,020
No second chances, he said.

1000
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,180
Here's the new commercial, okay?

1001
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:27,620
Kate Upton-

1002
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,900
Stop, Carl, stop.

1003
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,940
No, listen, it's good.

1004
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,500
Kate Upton loads up Twitter on her phone

1005
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,980
and then she is in a bikini notch

1006
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,340
and she unhinges her jaw and swallows her phone whole.

1007
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,220
You just really see her just jam the whole phone in there

1008
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,980
while Twitter's there and it's like,

1009
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:47,940
what do you have to say today on Twitter?

1010
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,660
She should be on there and she'll get a mean tweet

1011
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,380
from somebody and then a big water balloon

1012
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,780
full of hot nacho cheese falls on her.

1013
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,220
What the fuck, man?

1014
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,420
When do I start?

1015
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,380
When do I start?

1016
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,180
Today, because we're Twitter and we're fucking bad too.

1017
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,260
Justin, I would like to make a Munch Squad called shot.

1018
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,620
Okay.

1019
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,180
But by the end of 2017,

1020
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,900
someone will come out with a sandwich

1021
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,500
that is a hamburger with a fried chicken patty on it

1022
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:24,260
or vice versa.

1023
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,380
Okay, I would love that.

1024
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,100
And the fact that this doesn't already exist

1025
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,860
is baffling to me.

1026
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,020
Yeah, so I haven't even gotten to the quotes yet.

1027
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,020
Brad Haley, chief marketing officer for Carl Jr. and Hardee's.

1028
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,740
What does he have to say?

1029
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:39,460
Yeah.

1030
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:42,180
Recently, we set out to reclaim our rightful status

1031
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,820
as pioneers of the great American burger.

1032
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,580
Is this the second time that that sentence appears

1033
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,100
in this one press release?

1034
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,860
It's in quotes, so it's their thing.

1035
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,700
So we had to show the world that we're back

1036
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,660
with a burger that truly earned a place on that mantle.

1037
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,020
And really spin the face of McDonald's.

1038
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,180
Yes, and God, because we put two animals together.

1039
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,220
That really horrified both man and God.

1040
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,980
That everyone is terrified.

1041
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,620
Yeah, the tagline of this burger is, and it's kosher,

1042
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,740
and they don't know what the word means,

1043
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,860
that we've pioneered many iconic burgers over the years,

1044
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:17,860
but no other chain has ever before

1045
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,540
put real bowless baby back ribs on a charbroiled burger

1046
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,940
and with some crispy onion strings,

1047
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,940
pickles, and barbecue sauce on it.

1048
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,580
That sentence kind of got away from you, huh?

1049
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,820
Also, just because nobody's done it before

1050
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,020
doesn't mean it's a good thing.

1051
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,020
Nobody's ever served their burgers

1052
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,100
in a functioning $2,100 electric Japanese toilet.

1053
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:42,500
Well, no, but we're pioneers of a true American experience.

1054
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,300
Enjoy it.

1055
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,380
You can have the toilet taken home with you, please.

1056
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,780
As you can imagine, it's not easy

1057
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,540
to get real boneless baby back ribs,

1058
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,220
but our friends at Shark Tank help us out

1059
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,700
by investing in a startup company that did just that.

1060
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,420
Wait, what?

1061
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,140
Yes, we're putting back another layer.

1062
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,780
What is this Shark Tank and Vision?

1063
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,220
We did the bone ripper.

1064
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,860
You put the cows right in it, ribs just pop right out.

1065
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,660
No bones or anything.

1066
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:06,580
We've made what we call soft cows.

1067
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:09,700
No, it's Bubba Q's boneless ribs.

1068
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,940
Bubba Q is boneless ribs.

1069
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,260
He was on Shark Tank in 2013 and Damon John invested.

1070
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,260
So here is his quote.

1071
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,540
When I first started Bubba Q's,

1072
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,580
I never thought I'd become the official rib supplier

1073
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,380
for two of America's most well-known fast food chains.

1074
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,100
And then they shocked him with a cattle prod

1075
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:31,140
because he said fast food.

1076
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,620
He said, I mean, quick service restaurant.

1077
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,740
Back in the day, I was just happy to be bringing great ribs

1078
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,500
to the people of Avon, Ohio.

1079
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,100
And it goes on like that.

1080
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:42,660
Here's my invention.

1081
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,540
I was raising my wobble cows and then-

1082
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,460
I'm looking for $100,000 for 30% in wobble cows.

1083
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,620
Here's the premise.

1084
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:54,740
When I saw these cows with an easily removed exoskeleton

1085
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:57,620
of bones leaving just nothing but delicious meat afterwards,

1086
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,540
I said, I must have it.

1087
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,620
They've also credited the actors in here

1088
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:05,540
playing Carl Hardy Senior and Carl Hardy Junior.

1089
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,660
It's Kyle McLaughlin and Kyle McLaughlin.

1090
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,940
Yeah, he plays both of them.

1091
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:12,980
I hate my shitty kid.

1092
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,860
I'm sorry you ruined my fast food company, but he's out.

1093
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:16,740
Your son?

1094
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,540
Yeah, he's done.

1095
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:18,500
Your child?

1096
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,500
Where did you go?

1097
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,940
You know they're gonna come back at us in like six months

1098
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,740
and be like, the prodigal son returns and kills his father

1099
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,820
and is like, sorry about the rib burger.

1100
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,940
We fucked up again.

1101
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,060
But anyway, I learned a lot during my time

1102
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,860
living in the monastery and we're back at it.

1103
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:44,420
This time, it's just one big fried ham bone.

1104
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:45,860
And then he's gonna come back and be like,

1105
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:46,820
oh, I had a kid.

1106
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,780
It's gonna be like, sorry about the fried ham bone.

1107
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,660
I killed my dad.

1108
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,500
I'm 10, but I'm in charge now.

1109
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,540
Let's try this.

1110
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,580
I'm the boy king.

1111
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,740
I'm Harold Cardys.

1112
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,340
I'm the lost brother.

1113
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,020
And from now on, plain bread.

1114
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,460
Plain bread.

1115
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,220
I'm from the bizarro dimension.

1116
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,580
I fell through a time slip.

1117
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,180
Now I run the joint.

1118
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,340
In a hundred years.

1119
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,580
Uncooked potatoes and plain bread.

1120
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:15,380
In a hundred years, the commercial for Hardee's

1121
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:18,340
is just gonna be a slow zoom starting from far away

1122
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,700
and it's Carl Jr. Jr. Jr. sitting on a throne

1123
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,260
with his family members' heads on a spike.

1124
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,940
And it closes in on his face and he just says,

1125
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,700
a new era has begun.

1126
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,420
When you play the game of burgers,

1127
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,700
you get diarrhea.

1128
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,180
Pretty much, there's not a win or lose state.

1129
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,340
It's pretty much just the diarrhea every time.

1130
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,420
He holds up a steaming bowl of burger soup

1131
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,500
and is immediately killed by his son.

1132
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,420
A baby.

1133
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,660
It seems enclosed on that son's mouth

1134
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,220
and he just whispers, chocolate dipped burgers.

1135
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:56,100
How long did Carl, okay.

1136
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,220
Carl Hardee Sr.

1137
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,580
I have a bone to pick with you.

1138
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,780
When you saw the first commercial of Jenny McCarthy

1139
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,300
hiding mustard in her bra or what the fuck ever,

1140
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,540
how were you like, well, let's see where this goes.

1141
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,940
He's new.

1142
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,700
He's still getting his sea legs.

1143
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:12,980
Let's see how it goes.

1144
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,060
How many did it take, Carl?

1145
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,500
I mean, Justin, what happened was

1146
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,260
he was actually out in the wilderness.

1147
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,940
He was living in a cab and he wasn't seeing it

1148
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:25,620
and John Hammond landed his helicopter nearby

1149
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,700
and he's like, I need you to come back, Carl.

1150
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,060
He's like, no, I'm out of the game.

1151
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,980
We got one last mission for you.

1152
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,340
I can't, I told you, I'm out.

1153
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,700
Your son's making super Randy Hardee commercials.

1154
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:35,940
What?

1155
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,540
Not with my brand.

1156
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,620
Wait, let's see.

1157
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:40,580
My boy?

1158
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,300
My boys.

1159
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:43,940
Well, let's see these bad things.

1160
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,060
Wow, they are.

1161
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,420
These are bad things.

1162
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,220
I gotta get back.

1163
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,740
I gotta get back.

1164
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:49,460
Do you think that we could get-

1165
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,340
Andy put potato chips and a hot dog on a burger?

1166
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,380
No, fuck this.

1167
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,580
Ribs on a burger.

1168
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,700
Wait, what?

1169
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,820
Nevermind, don't worry about it.

1170
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,700
Just get me back there.

1171
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,580
Do you think we could get Charles Esten

1172
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:04,900
from TV's Nashville, the actor who portrays Carl Hardee Senior

1173
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,980
to come on the show as a guest spurt in character

1174
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,020
as Carl Hardee Senior?

1175
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:10,980
You think that's possible?

1176
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,740
Hey guys, by the way, can you just name him one thing now?

1177
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,460
Like, you're pretty much, like, we all know,

1178
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,620
and the jig's obviously up because all your cups and stuff

1179
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:24,900
have both the names on it.

1180
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,220
Can you just call them all Hardees, please?

1181
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,940
And not Carl's Junior, by the way, please?

1182
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,500
Hey, Rally's Checkers, you're on fucking Blast 2.

1183
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,940
And as long as we're making a request,

1184
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,860
can we bring back the California Raisins?

1185
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,700
Hey, as long as we're saying stuff,

1186
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,060
California Raisins, it's time for your time in the sun to come back.

1187
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,100
There was a time when Hardees had, like,

1188
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,420
raisin cinnamon rolls that were really good,

1189
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,420
and they were represented by California Raisins.

1190
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:54,420
Hey, and while we're at it, Arby's,

1191
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,140
my favorite sandwich ever was when you put roast beef

1192
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,260
on a croissant.

1193
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,460
Can you do that again?

1194
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,420
And hey, as long as we're at it, I miss tastations, man.

1195
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,020
These little guys, you suck on them for a long time

1196
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:09,860
and they taste like butterscotch or chocolate

1197
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,820
or whatever the fuck.

1198
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,620
So what's up, Hershey's?

1199
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,900
As long as we're at it,

1200
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,420
McDonald's bratwurst weren't anything to fuck with.

1201
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,740
How about it?

1202
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:23,300
These are good, tasty Polish sausages

1203
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:24,580
that you served at McDonald's.

1204
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,780
Don't know where the hell they came from,

1205
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,900
Johnsonville or something.

1206
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,540
Bring them back.

1207
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:31,540
Hey, Applebeast, remember when you used to just bring

1208
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,460
a plate of a bowl of bread to the table

1209
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,620
and I was used to wondering, man, I love this bread,

1210
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,060
and you could just buy it at the store?

1211
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,420
Can you just put it back in your restaurant?

1212
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,180
Because I always forget to buy it at the store.

1213
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:42,100
But I would totally get it if it was Applebeast again.

1214
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,060
So you know what else?

1215
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,820
As long as we're at it, what happened to the mole on ABC?

1216
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,420
Celebrity mole, where did it go?

1217
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,060
How about it, ABC?

1218
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,580
Come on, what's going on?

1219
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:04,820
Anything else?

1220
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,460
This has been our show, my brother, my brother, and me.

1221
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:12,580
We hope you've enjoyed yourself on our program.

1222
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:14,660
If there's other things you want to bring back,

1223
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,820
go ahead and just tweet at Travis about it.

1224
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,820
And he'll read all those.

1225
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,580
Travis didn't really play in that space as much.

1226
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,540
I think Travis is just like, I like everything how it is today.

1227
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:26,980
And I look in the past and I'm like,

1228
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,860
it was way better because we had two stations.

1229
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,980
This is his punishment.

1230
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,980
Thank you for listening.

1231
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,980
Thank you for supporting our show.

1232
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,260
We have a big announcement.

1233
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:37,460
It's huge.

1234
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,900
It's so exciting and huge.

1235
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,300
We've got a new podcast.

1236
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,300
If you follow this feed, you've heard one episode of it.

1237
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,940
It is the McElroy brothers will be in Trolls 2.

1238
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,100
It is now on iTunes.

1239
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,580
There are two episodes, the one you already heard

1240
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,140
and then another new one featuring our agent Joel Begleiter.

1241
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,660
This is happening.

1242
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,620
We are doing this.

1243
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,700
This is a story, is a nonfiction serialized prestige podcast

1244
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,660
about how we got into Trolls 2, which will happen.

1245
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,740
And it will serve as a historical document

1246
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:09,380
of how that all came together.

1247
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,140
There are two exciting episodes now.

1248
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,420
Please go rate and review and subscribe to that.

1249
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,020
We'd love to get it up on the charts

1250
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:18,340
so people find out about it, especially Dreamworks.

1251
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:19,220
If we can go to them and say,

1252
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,220
hey, we have the number one comedy podcast

1253
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,460
and it's about this, they'll say, well, you're in, I guess.

1254
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,500
So please be able, you can have a part in this.

1255
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,180
So what is what I'm saying?

1256
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,460
You can be part of what helped us get into Trolls 2

1257
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:36,580
by rating and reviewing and subscribing to that podcast

1258
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,580
and helping it to climb the heat chart.

1259
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,100
So please do that immediately.

1260
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,300
Actually, two more announcements too.

1261
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,700
One, in case you missed it,

1262
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:50,020
we put up a audio commentary for episode one

1263
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,180
of the My Brother, My Brother, and Me TV show,

1264
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:56,020
which has been available on CISO.com since February,

1265
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,780
but it's also now available on iTunes in the UK, Canada,

1266
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,620
Australia, and probably some other places.

1267
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:09,700
So we've put up the episode one commentary in this feed

1268
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,060
in the My Brother, My Brother, and Me feed.

1269
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,740
And we've also recorded an episode two commentary

1270
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,780
that should be out later.

1271
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,260
I'm trying to figure out where to put that.

1272
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,140
But definitely one and two are already in existence.

1273
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,980
So you can check those out.

1274
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:26,180
Also, wanted to let everyone know.

1275
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,860
So in, I have been working,

1276
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:31,460
we have been working with the guys from Welcome to Night Vale

1277
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,260
and Hank Green and John Green

1278
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,300
to create a podcast convention in Seattle in December,

1279
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,900
December 9th and 10th.

1280
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,300
And we are currently in the middle

1281
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,940
of our crowdfunding campaign to help us finance that

1282
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,940
so we can put together just a really kick-ass thing.

1283
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,780
There will be a My Brother, My Brother, and Me

1284
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,100
performance there, Alice in Dead performance there,

1285
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,460
lots of performances there.

1286
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,140
Tons of cool people are gonna be there.

1287
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,700
It's already shaping up to be a pretty amazing event.

1288
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:04,580
And you can help us fund it and go ahead

1289
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,340
and get your ticket to it, whether in person

1290
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,300
or we also have the ability to view it remotely.

1291
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,780
Even if you're not able to make it out to Seattle,

1292
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:19,220
you can go to podcon.com, P-O-D-C-O-N.com to check it out.

1293
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,300
And there's a bunch of other rewards and tiers

1294
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,900
to help us fund the project at, but go check that out.

1295
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,420
P-O-D-C-O-N.com.

1296
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,260
I want to thank John Rodgick from The Long Winters

1297
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,540
for you to start this song.

1298
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,620
It's a departure off of the album,

1299
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,140
Putting the Days to Bed.

1300
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,460
It's a really good album that you should definitely

1301
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,100
go buy and or rent.

1302
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,780
Do people are people renting out?

1303
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:41,300
I don't know, but go listen to it

1304
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,060
because it's really very good.

1305
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,020
I also want to say thank you to David Lynch and Mark Frost

1306
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,300
for writing this episode.

1307
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,100
I think it turned out really, really well.

1308
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,460
So thank you.

1309
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,460
It got a little weird there in the middle.

1310
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,140
And went on like it, we weren't talking very quickly.

1311
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,660
And it was a very long winded episode.

1312
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,180
Hey, that's just how we do it.

1313
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,940
It builds tension and fear.

1314
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,500
So Mark Frost used to follow me on Twitter.

1315
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,540
What happened?

1316
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,340
What did you do?

1317
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,220
I don't know.

1318
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:08,660
I don't know why he started following me,

1319
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,940
but he doesn't anymore.

1320
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:10,980
Oh, used to though.

1321
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:11,540
Well, shoot.

1322
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,100
Well, maybe we'll bring him back in the fold

1323
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,500
with all of this cool Twin Peaks talk.

1324
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,820
Yeah, this really cool episode that we did

1325
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:20,020
about Twin Peaks mostly.

1326
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,700
So that's going to do it for us.

1327
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,140
Griffin, do you have one last Yahoo?

1328
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,620
Yeah, this final Yahoo was sent in by like nine people.

1329
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,660
Thank you, nine people.

1330
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,380
It's from Yahoo Answers user Ali asks,

1331
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,260
how to get silly putty out of bedsheets?

1332
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,580
I have made a terrible mistake.

1333
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,260
My name is Justin McElroy.

1334
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,540
I'm Travis McElroy.

1335
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1336
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,940
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1337
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,820
Kiss your dad's square.

1338
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,580
I'm not gonna kiss your dad's square.

1339
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,100
This has been my brother and me.

1340
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,700
Kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1341
00:57:51,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Hey, good girls, do you want to say, hey, I want to?

1342
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,620
