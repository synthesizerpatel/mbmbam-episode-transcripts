00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Hello, friends. This is Griffin. You're about to listen to my brother, my brother, and me's

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,880
heretofore untitled holiday special. As we promised, it is relatively free of cursing

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,280
if you want to listen to it with your family, except for, oh, I don't know, the first minute

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:30,160
or so features a song that is full of quite a bit of cursing. So just a heads up, if you're

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,920
watching this with Mama and Papa and Lil Bro and Big Bro and Sissy and Unky Dan around

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,440
the fireplace and you don't want to hear any curse words, you may want to skip forward

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:57,000
by about a minute, starting right now.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:15,320
Fuck you if you don't like goodwill to men. Fuck you if you don't like presents in the

9
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:35,000
giving. Fuck you if you don't like yams from a can, and fuck you if you don't like honey

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,480
from a can. Fuck you if you don't like Christmas. Fuck you if you don't like Christmas. Fuck

11
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,080
you if you don't like Christmas.

12
00:01:52,080 --> 00:02:01,160
Ho ho ho. That's it? That's what you're bringing? That's your super original? That's my Christmas

13
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:10,240
heat is to say ho ho ho at the beginning. As true today as it was in Santa Claus's day.

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,200
My original thought had been to say ho ho holidays. That's the worst, Justin. Oh my

15
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,200
god. Pretty good, right? Were you struck in the head with something? Let me try again.

16
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,600
I'll just start over. Let's just fire off like nine or ten different. Born unto us this

17
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,640
day is a child named Wisdom. Born unto the star of knowledge and enlightenment, while

18
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,920
a three wise men named Justin, Travis, and Griffin. Okay, now that's a vein that we

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,780
can tap into. Yeah, definitely. Make the three wise men more of a focal point. The three

20
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,000
wise men were the true sinner of the first Christmas. Every 25th of December we get together

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,480
and celebrate three wise men appearing unto Jesus. So there's there's gold, there's

22
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,040
frankincense and there's myrrh. Which one of us like which which which gift would each

23
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,960
of us have brought? Because I think I would have brought the frankincense. Yeah, I think

24
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,160
I would have done myrrh because I'm on a budget. But see, gold seems a little too gaudy for

25
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Justin. Me? Yeah, no, I would. No, I was back then. Could it be could it be frankincense,

26
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,680
myrrh and Pokemon cards? Justin and I would probably both bring myrrh because we didn't

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,880
talk about it beforehand. Yeah, I would bring gold because I would be super into my Joey

28
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,760
but a Foucault face. Yeah, I just have chains and stuff. That was me back then. That was

29
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,000
a long time. It was literally approximately 2000 years ago. Not approximately, Griffin.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,880
We know exactly how long ago it was. 2009 years and 360 days is how long ago. So this

31
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,880
is my brother, my brother and me teach me how to holoduggy. This is an advice show for

32
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,920
the modern era. There has to be a better name for it than that. I don't think there is.

33
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,960
The only other one I could come up with was teach me how to snuggie. But I feel like that's

34
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,600
right in that same vein. Griffin, you're talking to a man whose best intro was ho ho holidays.

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,480
I'm not going to be able to come up with a better name. I don't know. I appreciate the

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,400
candor of your terrible, your terrible holiday reference. So what about. It was called the

37
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:22,040
episode Christmas time. What about this time? A holiday snowdown. A holiday snowdown. Sure.

38
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,480
This is, like I said, the advice show for the modern era where three actual brothers.

39
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,480
My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy and I'm Griffin McElroy. And we're trying

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,000
our darndest and you'll know, you know, it's true because I said darndest to do a holiday

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,540
show, a family holiday show appropriate for all ages. And so this is going to shake out

42
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,280
one of two ways. If you're listening with family members, either you are going to share

43
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,240
a really nice 50 or so minutes or you're going to share a nice twenty five minutes followed

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,160
by twenty five minutes of awkward silence. Now, we kind of we kind of screwed that up

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,640
with our intro song. But really, I feel like it was so delightful and light hearted that

46
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:18,000
that profanity, you know, it wasn't it wasn't vulgar. No. Using the FCC's, you know, regulations

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,360
for. OK. Yeah, I had forgotten about that. So sorry already, I guess. That's our buddy

48
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,680
Drew Toothpaste. His name is not Drew Toothpaste. His name is Drew. He makes ToothpasteforDinner.com

49
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,920
a delightful web comic. You should go buy his merch and you should follow him on Twitter.

50
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,560
He's at Drew Toothpaste. And maybe just say, like, hey, thanks. Thanks for the license.

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,280
Thanks for letting the brothers use your tune. I'm a big fan fan for life. I'm your biggest

52
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,640
fan now. Yeah. Just turn swim fan on him. Yeah, that's good. Go full swim fan. Follow

53
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,200
him around. Leave leave dead sparrows in front of his car. Yeah. See, I'm a big fan of your

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,460
show and he'll be like, what show? And then disappear like a ninja. Hey, so let's get

55
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:10,520
into the questions. Let's dip in. What's the best way to introduce your significant other

56
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,480
to your drunken family at the family holiday dinner or party? Happy holidays from Mary

57
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:24,800
in Manhattan. And that's M-E-R-R-Y. Love it. Love it. This seems ideal to me. This seems

58
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,280
like it cuts down on a lot of the pressure that you undergo when when introducing a significant

59
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,640
other to a group of people. It's like pressure free because every first off, they're only

60
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,920
sort of going to remember it. Yeah. There's like a built in reset button. Yeah. That's

61
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,400
a double edged sword, though, because your significant other next time they see your

62
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,840
family members, if your family members are like, oh, hey, I could hurt her feelings or

63
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,600
his. There's no greater gift than the next social engagement you're at. You know, you're

64
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,480
going to have a leg up because the person will remember you. That is true. Puts them

65
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,880
on the defensive. That's a priceless form of social currency. Sometimes when I introduce

66
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,680
myself to people, I say, oh, hi, I'm Grisha. And then then I got all the power. I hold

67
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,960
all the cards in that situation. And that's what that's what the holidays are all about,

68
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:26,080
holding all the cards. Yeah. Especially if you're playing Skippo. Skippo. Holiday Skippo.

69
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,320
You got a whole family together. The cable's out. You got there's wassle, a big pot of

70
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,920
wassle and you and you don't know what to do. Well, why not? Why not Skippo? That's

71
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,720
a freebie. Skippo for the holidays. That's a free one. That's a new slogan. That one's

72
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:52,480
for you, Skippo company. Thanks for the money, suckers. I think that you, you know, you say,

73
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,080
hey, this is Deborah. Let her into your heart like you let Jesus into your heart two thousand

74
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,240
nine years and three hundred sixty days ago. Yeah, I would say unless your family is like

75
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,400
belligerently drunk, it's not any different than introducing them to them at any other

76
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,360
time. Now, if your family is belligerently drunk, might I suggest not? No, screw that

77
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,520
noise. Might I suggest drinking contests with your new like proof, prove her or himself

78
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,560
to them? Oh, I like that. Or maybe you just show up to the party with like a whole cart

79
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,920
and a three buck chuck. Like, hey, guys, you're south right now. I'm going to take you to

80
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:40,080
a full on blackout town. Let's go to blackout town for the holidays. I love it. And yeah,

81
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:48,000
this is a good time to introduce new loves in your life because it is because strangers

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,800
are almost like to be expected. Yeah, it's the only time where I think it wouldn't be

83
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,240
weird. Yeah, but there's I mean, especially extended family because you don't know them

84
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,080
that well. Maybe that's why. I mean, the ceremony of the holidays, there's so much ceremony

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,160
and everybody's ceremonies are different. That's kind of what we're talking about today

86
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,880
is people's, you know, what they do for Christmas, what's their normal, their normal style. And

87
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,840
when you introduce new elements into that, I don't know, I think it can be weird for

88
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:21,440
them. But but it sounds like this person's tradition is drinking heavily, which I think

89
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,800
most people can get down with. The most important thing for you to do is to explain to your

90
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,760
significant other what they should be prepared for. Because really, like, I think the concern

91
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,000
here is not your family accepting them. So much as it is your family is drunk at a family

92
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,480
holiday party. And you're bringing your significant other there. And they are getting introduced

93
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,040
for the first time. So just make sure that they are prepped and ready to go for you know,

94
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,200
your drunk uncle, your drunkle hanging out on the table. Yeah, you don't miss a trick

95
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,080
do you? Nope. You just can't help yourself. I love it. Let's move on. What are some some

96
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,480
cheap gifts for Hanukkah I can get for my friends without seeming cheap? I am in college

97
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,520
and super poor. Any advice? Kara. Kara, sweetie. You done missed it. What about Bible? You

98
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:21,360
done fell off. Travis, are you suggesting that she convert to Christianity and that

99
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,160
be her Christmas present or her Hanukkah present? No, I'm suggesting she convert other people.

100
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,000
She be a force. She be a force to win souls to Jesus. Is that what you're saying to me?

101
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, of course not. That's bigoted. Happy holidays. I'm changing your religion. Man,

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,800
every Hanukkah is winding down. You're like, boy, this has been fun, but wouldn't it be

103
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,560
great to celebrate again? That's when you need to make the switch. Keep it going. Folks,

104
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,360
if you're gonna switch from Judaism to Christianity, you have to do it. You've got to do it like

105
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,300
December 19th? Yeah, like right around there. And then surprise. I think you should, whatever

106
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,680
you get, you should go to your friends and say, I'm sorry I got you terrible Hanukkah

107
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,320
gifts. I asked three Baptists what I should get you. And they said I should convert. Did

108
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,880
not come through. It did not play like how I thought it would. I used to think that nobody

109
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,240
could do this successfully. I used to think if you do not have money around Christmas

110
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,920
or Hanukkah, you're just effed. There's nothing you can do there. But lately, I don't know.

111
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,640
I've seen some people actually make some really nice things for other people. Scarf. Knit a

112
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:44,240
scarf. Yeah, scarf, a nice scarf, a nice shawl. Never underestimate making dinner for your

113
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,960
friends. You know what I mean? It's a big group present. It'll cost you like 20 bucks

114
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:55,600
to cover everyone. And if they're poor too, they'll probably appreciate the food more

115
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,800
than they would appreciate a lighter or something. I don't know. What do you get people on Hanukkah?

116
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,000
No, that's good. That's good because I think college is an appropriate age where you don't

117
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,800
have to worry so much about killing it with actual tangible gifts. Actual shows of affection

118
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,720
are just as appreciated. You know that old saying, it's a thought that counts? Yeah.

119
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,320
I like to extrapolate that to its logical conclusion and give people gifts that they

120
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,200
won't let me give them to it. Try this. When Christmas time rolls around, tell them you

121
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,360
got them two months of maid service and then they'll be like, wow, that sounds really nice.

122
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,200
And then on the first day, show up in like an apron with a duster and just look really

123
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,480
sad and start cleaning their floor. There's no way they're going to let you do it. Now,

124
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,880
let's dissect that. What thought went into that other than like diabolical? Like the

125
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,800
thought was, the thought was I'm going to get you two months of maid service and I'll

126
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,320
do it myself. And the best gifts are the ones you make. Right? That's a thought. So turning

127
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,480
yourself. So it's implying that your house is really dirty. Yeah. Turning yourself into

128
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,680
an indentured service servant is. Yeah. The thought I had is that you might like their

129
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,160
house to be cleaner. That's creepy. I don't like that. It's not like a do anything. It's

130
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,000
not like those dirty maids that you hear about. Yeah. Not a dirty maid service. It's like

131
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,280
a regular maid service. Still, still. Oh, another great gift. Dirty maid service. Yeah.

132
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,400
If that's available in your area. It's major metropolitan right now, but I think it's really,

133
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,920
I read in a Reader's Digest. It's really spread. Reader's Digest. Really? That's right. That's

134
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,800
where I read about it. Someone took an advert. Oh, another great cheap gift. Reader's Digest.

135
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,960
They're like three, three bucks a pop. They're at every doctor's office. Just get them from

136
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:48,640
a doctor's office. It's free. Hey, it looks like you can't handle a real magazine. Here's

137
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,640
this little guy. The thought was I was going to read a bunch of magazines and, and cut

138
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,020
out the best parts and tape them together for you, but instead I let these people do

139
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,000
it for you and I stole this from a doctor's office. My crazy aunt has made a list of things

140
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,900
she wants from her relatives for Christmas. She even made my grandmom, her mom, buy a

141
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,400
pot she wants and told her to get the money for it from me for Christmas. That's a lot

142
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,360
of stuff. What do I do? What? That's a lot. I don't, I'm not even sure I understand the,

143
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,480
the inset this for me today. Her crazy aunt has a Christmas list, right? Like a list of

144
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,080
things she wants for Christmas. She made her grandmother by which the question askers mom

145
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,080
buy a pot until he gets the money. Okay. So the person asking the question gave her mom

146
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,320
money to buy a pot for her aunt for Christmas. Not an ordeal. I don't see the ordeal here.

147
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,760
I think the issue here is the specificity of the list and like to the point where it

148
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:56,480
is less a, a list of suggestions and more like the aunt said, that's the pot I want.

149
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,720
Buy it now and then just get the money from her later. I think it goes deeper than that.

150
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,520
I think she's saying, I want the question asker. Let's just, can we just call her like

151
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,320
Deborah, Deborah, Deborah. I want Deborah to get me a pot Christmas, Deborah. That seems

152
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,760
almost like that, like fetishist. Like, yeah. My Christmas will be ruined unless Christmas

153
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,180
Deborah gets me that pot. Just go ahead and get it now before it's sold out. Get it now.

154
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,280
Get it now. Get it today. She has to buy it at 946. Now I have had holidays ruined because

155
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,640
people didn't bring me the pot they promised that I can sympathize with. But like if she

156
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,240
gets the pot from, from Deborah's Papa, like, yeah. Is she going to freak out at that point?

157
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,680
Like if my dad gave me pot, I would freak out. Yeah, absolutely. Well, this leads I

158
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,040
think to a good discussion about lists. Um, lists such a holiday conundrum. Yeah. On the

159
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,160
one hand, it's kind of, it's kind of like a kidnapper. You're making really specific

160
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,280
demands and like you put things on there specifically so certain people will get them for you. But

161
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:09,800
then there's without a list, it's a complete crap shoot. Oh, it's a, yeah, it's rough accent

162
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:20,200
on the crap. Yeah. I have so many things now. The sliver of things that I want of like material

163
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,920
possessions that I would value is so small. Yeah. Like I'm going to, I'm a, I'm a white

164
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,520
American in my, in my early thirties. Like I have a, well late twenties technically.

165
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:39,680
It's like very late twenties. I have the latest twilight years, twilight years in my twenties.

166
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:48,120
And uh, I have most of the things that I would need. Yeah. Including twilight. Yeah. Um,

167
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,880
here's the thing though. Papa McElroy and I agreed that Christmas time is a test. It's

168
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,320
a time to like prove how much you love someone by how well you know them, by what gifts you

169
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,600
can get them. Yeah, that's it. It's not, it's not how much you get them. It's it, you're

170
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,680
absolutely right. It's how well do you know me? Yeah. Like if you guys get me cookware,

171
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,360
it's like actually I could actually use some cookware. That's a bad thought. So yeah, yeah,

172
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,000
it's a moving target. That's the problem. Um, I think I, this is, this is one area that

173
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,800
I excel at. I don't, I don't want to toot my own horn, but I think I'm, I'm pretty good

174
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,440
at identifying what a person wants and needs and filling that desire with my, with my,

175
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,200
with my dollars. I'm pretty good with knowing what girls want and girls need, but, but as

176
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,400
far as just regular people, whatever, whatever makes them happy, sets them free. Absolutely.

177
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,280
I can't believe I knew the second verse, the second line. Yeah. That's my Christmas gift

178
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,200
to you is that knowledge, that realization. Um, remember that on Christmas day because

179
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,480
you're not going to get as much as everybody else. Uh, I think this is a classic question,

180
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,240
but what do I get my boyfriend's parents for Christmas? We've been together for almost two

181
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,240
years now and I've actually spent more time at his parents' house in the last two years

182
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,960
than at my own. I'm in grad school and he lives much closer. I want to get them something

183
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,120
that says, thank you for letting me sleep in your son's bed without judging me too much,

184
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,600
but not high. I'd like to be your new daughter. Thanks. Confused at Christmas time. Fine line.

185
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,640
Got to walk that line. Got to walk it. Um, have you considered a card? Uh, like just

186
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,280
a nice card. Maybe you can make it yourself that says, thank you for letting me sleep

187
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,840
in your son's bed without judging me too much. Hmm. Hmm. A little literal for my taste. Yeah.

188
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,560
I mean it's Christmas time. Cut out the middleman. Sure. That's in a mentality. If you've been

189
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,920
with this dude for two years, why are you afraid of a gift that says, hi, I would like

190
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,400
to be your new daughter. Don't you want to be? Yeah. Let's not bring it down. Let's not

191
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,960
bring a Christmas show down by talking about how this person has commitment issues. But

192
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,280
what I'm saying is what I'm saying is you sleep at their house. You spent more time

193
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,360
at their house than at your own. Maybe it's time to accept the fact that you probably

194
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,720
don't need to worry about what you get them for Christmas. Well, you should actually reverse

195
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,440
of that have to worry more and more each year. It expounds. Expounds. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah,

196
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,640
yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh man, I miss the boat. Can I, can I, I think a lot of times people,

197
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,360
um, you think too much about who you are relative to the gift you're getting and I don't think

198
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,880
that matters to people so much. I think if you think about them as, as people, just as

199
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,240
the person and, and what that person might like, um, then, then I don't think you send

200
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,600
me, like the only time I think you send messages with a gift is if it's like a ring or a key

201
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,400
or something like, I don't think people read into it that much. Maybe that's just me. No,

202
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,600
you're completely right. Frame photos. Stay away from frame photos. Yeah, it does the

203
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:54,520
same thing. Here's the thing. If you are having trouble, uh, identifying your, you know, potential,

204
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,080
what is that parents in law? Yeah, your parents in law, like your potential parents in law,

205
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,160
what they, what kind of people they are, what they might want. Maybe that's a sign that,

206
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,920
you know, maybe you should spend some more time with them and get to know them a little

207
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:09,640
bit better. That's a great present. That's a great present. Or, I mean, it sets you up

208
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,000
for ease of use for future, you know, gift buying things like you, you, ideally you would

209
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,760
know them as well as you know your own parents and you would know what to get them. What

210
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,000
I would suggest is everybody has like that main thing that people think about when it

211
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,420
comes to getting gifts for them. Like, oh, he really likes dogs. So I'll get him something

212
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,080
dog themed. You want to go for the second level that less people know, but they still

213
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:40,200
really enjoy and then get them something non-specific theme to that. So it's like, I know you well

214
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,480
enough that I know you like this thing, but you know, it's, I don't want to be your new

215
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,720
daughter. That can really bite you in the ass though. If it's like, I know you like

216
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,960
books. So here's a, you know, here's a Barnes and Noble gift card who don't, I don't think

217
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,840
it's for, for parents, potential parents-in-law. I don't know. That seems, you know, you can

218
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,300
go more specific than that. I brought Barnes and Noble. Yeah. I brought you to Barnes and

219
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,320
Noble to pick out whatever you want. Get in the car. It's Christmas. I, I, um, I, I'd

220
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,600
like to let you guys in on a little, a little Justin McElroy jam, a little secret from me

221
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,720
to you. If you're spending a lot of time at their house, get them, get them something

222
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,640
that they can keep at their house. It's going to make your life a little better. A couple

223
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,000
of years back, I got my in-laws the surround sound system. They like it. I love it. Cause

224
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm there all the time watching movies, uh, uh, getting, getting a real sensory experience

225
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,440
that I got them. Nothing says happy holidays like something that's going to make you happy

226
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,960
too. If you want more specific for the dad, get the new Mark Twain autobiography and for

227
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,800
the mom get a Snuggie. It's a gift everybody wants, but nobody will buy themselves. Yeah.

228
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,560
I was going to say a roller skates, roller skates, roller skating lessons. Okay. Good.

229
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,200
Couples activity, couples activity. I like it. Strengthen their marriage and embarrass

230
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,080
them, embarrass them on the street. Cause let's be honest, they weren't in roller skates.

231
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,200
Matching sweatsuits, matching tracksuits. I love it. That's a slam dunk. Hey guys. Oh,

232
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,840
you know what? Griffin, do you have any, um, give me Yahoo. I do have a Yahoo. I only have

233
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,000
a couple that are holiday themes. So I'm going to save those for maybe a little bit later

234
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,280
in the show. Um, let's do this one instead. This one was sent in by Bridget. Thank you,

235
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,800
Bridget. Okay. It's by Yahoo answers user. Jesse, who asks, why do I feel like I am a

236
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:43,400
car for some reason? I have an obsession where I know I am a car. Mostly a Mercedes Benz

237
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,000
or BMW. Like I will be running and stop all of the sudden while doing my tire brake sound

238
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,840
effect and act like I am slamming on my brakes on the interstate. I also like to make the

239
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,680
BMW face while taking off really fast and doing the sound waves. Wait, what? Is it normal

240
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,720
that I feel like I am truly born a car like a BMW or a Mercedes? Is it normal? No. Hello.

241
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,960
It's not normal. It's opposite of normal. Here's a good, here's a good like normal acid

242
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,360
test. If anyone ever has ever said anything like what you're saying, it's normal, but

243
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:26,760
that, that is not your case. Like you're the only person. Why is a BMW face? You don't

244
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,560
know? No. I'm making it right now. Let's see if you can tell like a difference in my, my

245
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,920
vocality. Okay. Yeah, guys, I'm just raking about BMW face now. All it does, it kind of,

246
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,640
it shits my mouth. It sounds classier I think. Yeah. Should I make it for the rest of the

247
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,680
show? More streamlined. Okay. I have a question for you. What would be less creepy? This,

248
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:54,200
this person who says, I know I am a car or someone who wrote in saying, I like to pretend

249
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,880
that I'm a car. Like I would always prefer they have the commitment to being a car that

250
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,040
like, like this person does. I know I am a car. I mean, what, what could possibly lead

251
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,160
to this is obviously some sort of deep, deep delusion that he's been cultivating for years.

252
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:15,080
What could possibly, what was the seed? What was the inception that really got in his noggin

253
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,320
and planted this, this idea in his head? Is it what he watched turbo team and he saw a

254
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,480
turbo team, something hot and change into a car. That's me obscure 1980s cartoon stuff.

255
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,080
Okay. Then you already know. Okay. It sounds like you cracked this case or he's turbo team.

256
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,640
Eat some hot and he turned into a car. That sounds like something hot, like spicy. Yes.

257
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,840
Or he get or he get hot. Like he just got high. He turned into a car turbo team. That's

258
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,320
the crappiest superpower. Yeah. That's not awkward. What happens if you're on like a

259
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,700
first date, but you're at like a, an Indian restaurant and you eat some, you know, uh,

260
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,680
some chicken tandoori with a little in it. And like you, you, what about when you get

261
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,640
into like later on the evening, you get into that heavy petting and all of a sudden she's

262
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:10,720
got a handful of Chrome. More importantly, she's crushed to death underneath your car

263
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,120
that you are. The sauna is another weird one cause you're just there with a bunch of naked

264
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,880
guys and all of a sudden there's a car in a towel and they crushed all of them cause

265
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:27,640
it's not a big sauna. Um, so I have to know more about this question that I, are there

266
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,920
answers like there are too. Let's this one is by a Yahoo answers user. Come on people

267
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,420
who says it's completely normal. What's not normal is how you think you're a Mercedes

268
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:45,000
Benz or a BMW. Just face it. You're a Chevy like the rest of us. Uh, Yahoo answers user,

269
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,880
uh, nightwish responded. I'd rather eat worms than drive a Chevy. Be a man, drive a Ford.

270
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:58,080
And this is what it devolves into. Meanwhile Yahoo answers user Mitch Chase says you sir

271
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,960
are a complete lunatic. There. Thank you. We got back around to it. That's a, my brother,

272
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,240
my brother and me listener. Yeah. Yeah. Going through Yahoo answers and found this question

273
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,040
and answered, Hey, you're crazy balls. Oh man. Is there a more perfect symbol for the

274
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,800
internet? The one human being says, I am a car and another one says, I like different

275
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,120
cards. Like what? What are you? I didn't you hear the first thing, the thing that just

276
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,400
happened. If you guys were cars, uh, or you know what? So let's open it up. Any form of

277
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:38,000
motorized, uh, uh, locomotion, what would you, what do you think you'd go with? If I

278
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,120
was a farmer, do buggy Travis, really? Yeah. I don't get that. You don't seem like you're

279
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,160
a big fan of the dunes. No, I just want to be a dude buggy. They're awesome. Okay. Is

280
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,000
this like a, what will be? Yeah. It's like a, it's like a psychological like association

281
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,200
test. Like what, what are you? What, what attribute derailed train? Ooh, that's, that's

282
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:07,480
pretty poetic. Travis. Thank you. Justin. Yeah. Anything? Me? Uh, I'd be a, uh, a hearse

283
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:14,680
that used to be a hearse, but then somebody turned it into a pizza wagon. I like it. Or

284
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:21,960
maybe a segue, maybe a segue. No, that's good. Where do you want to order? Where do you want

285
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,080
to order from? We can do Domino's. We can do pizza hut. Yeah. That would be really upsetting

286
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,920
because you get so excited for your pizza to show up. Like, you know how, like when

287
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,280
you see the pizza wagon roll up, I guess the most exciting moment of your life. Why do

288
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,440
you always order from pizza funeral? That's my least favorite place. The pizza graveyard

289
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,760
is my least, and you always want to order from there. Although their corpse crust is

290
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:50,680
just really out of this world. I would of course be a G six or like a G six. Yeah. Um,

291
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,600
I think I'm G six like the way that I like to fly so high. Hey guys, my sister-in-law

292
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,400
is pregnant. Not only does she want to put one of her sonogram pictures on her Christmas

293
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:06,520
card this year, she wants to Photoshop a little Santa hat on her unborn child. Yes. Yes. Yes

294
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,440
is she does. How do we politely explain to her that this is the worst idea ever? You

295
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,400
don't do that. You don't do a thing. In fact, I would suggest like a series of these doing

296
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,440
different things, like a little cowboy hat. Maybe he's playing a little flute, a little

297
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,320
pan flute in there. Yeah. I like that. Ask her to make it, um, good for a bunch of different

298
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,280
religions and like Photoshop a little Yamaka on him and put happy Hanukkah. Cause that

299
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,080
would be adorable. I mean, it depends on how far along he is, right? Like if he's still

300
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,200
like just a little, a little zygote, uh, I do not think that, that, that particular form

301
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,360
of human being is capable of doing many things. Although I don't think you could capture that

302
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,920
in a sonogram that might be a little. And if it is a zygote, um, an inappropriate response

303
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,820
is to go, not too late. And that that's like, don't don't do that. Like, uh, will, will

304
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,960
Santa visit you in the womb to say, well, yeah, it's just a tight fit. There's, there's

305
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,200
some, uh, you don't read that Christmas story very frequently. It's, it's, it's pretty

306
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,300
apocryphal, but yeah, they, they, I mean, he can get down in there. What's the chimney

307
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,560
like? What is he? Does he turn it on? You like, doesn't go the way you expect and like

308
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:29,020
does the nose. Is that your, it's your, it's your butt. It's your, Santa's a little kind

309
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:33,960
of on the, it's a little literal. Santa just, he's not a creative man. That's why it's not

310
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,480
the most popular Christmas story ever. It's not the best story ever told. It's not, it's

311
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,440
the most upsetting story. Listen, you're going to have to be pretending that you, uh, really

312
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,680
can't get enough of this kid for years to come. You might as well start now. You might

313
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:53,200
as well just keep it, keep it to yourself. I watched Die Hard every Christmas Eve and

314
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
have done so over the past decade or so. It's been a longstanding tradition after one year

315
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,080
when it was the only remotely Christmas related movie my had on, not watched by Christmas

316
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,400
Eve. What? Okay. Uh, nothing gets me more pumped for a special day than watching Bruce

317
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,640
Willis kill German thieves. Would you consider Die Hard a Christmas movie? And is this tradition

318
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,360
as awesome as I think it is? Or is it just plain weird? Simply, uh, sincerely McClain

319
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,600
at Merrymas. Yes. Yes. What is awesome. It's awesome. I do this too. And of course Die

320
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,780
Hard is a Christmas movie. It's the best Christmas movie. I mean, it's, it's a, it's a Christmas

321
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,040
movie in the same vein that, uh, Home Alone is a Christmas movie or, uh, uh, Love Actually

322
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,640
is a Christmas movie. Like they aren't, they aren't, uh, you know, mired in Christmas themes,

323
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,460
but they do take place at Christmas and they get me Christmas Eve feeling down deep, down

324
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,300
deep in my gut where your heart used to be. Doesn't Bruce Willis at one point kill a

325
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,200
dude and put a Santa hat on him. Yeah. There it is. There's your link, ho ho ho. I got

326
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,000
a machine gun. Christmas ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho holidays. That's the way she does it.

327
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,680
Ho ho ho holidays. I have a machine gun. Hey, it's, uh, the Christmas traditions are by

328
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:06,780
and large, whatever you attach value to. Um, and if you have like, you know, if that gives

329
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,500
you that traditional feeling, that Christmassy nostalgic feeling to watch Die Hard with your

330
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:18,000
It's it's totally appropriate and not weird at all. Hey, do you guys want to try and guess my favorite line from Die Hard?

331
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,500
Tell me oh my god, the quarterback is toast

332
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,980
That might be my favorite line in any my favorite sentence ever spoken I like I like the old classic

333
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,020
Give me Ki-A buddy

334
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,980
That's what you Christmas that one. We go grab weasel lover mother plucker

335
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,940
People start crushing harder on others my fear theories that the cold weather increases the like factor

336
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,420
Am I crazy for this holiday like theory or do you find it true as well Griffin?

337
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,740
What I

338
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,920
Have some that sentence going on this or do you find this true as well Griffin? No, I guess no he has a point

339
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,700
I'm the only single person. I'm the only batch left on the show, right?

340
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:12,060
So I I got I hope I'm the only one who's still crushing unless you guys crush on your your wife and girlfriend respectively

341
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,220
Yeah, it's very romantic. I'm we're required to yeah. Yeah, it is. Yeah, that's a thing

342
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,540
It is right it is it's because it's because like you're so lonely right? You're so oh man

343
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,380
How lonely is it today? Let me check the barometer

344
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:33,820
Super super lonely and like it's cold outside, which sucks

345
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,340
So you want to be with someone in a cuddle position?

346
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:44,500
And also like it's Christmas and like you don't have any presents like none. You have zero presidents

347
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,660
Yeah. Yeah, that's a totally a thing. It's not it's not a like factor. It's a I don't know. It's a

348
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,340
quiet snowy desperation

349
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,940
Mm-hmm. That is my favorite self Jan Stevens album

350
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:06,180
Oh quiet snowy desperation. The funny thing is is you can put like a time limit on these relationships and they'll go from about

351
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,600
November 20th to February 15th. Yeah, it's groundhog day. That's actually why groundhog day was invented

352
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,220
An idea of how much longer this this is gonna go on

353
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,220
Oh

354
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,620
To spring training soon as spring training starts for that's a baseball

355
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,740
reference

356
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,200
And then I usually I know it's about quitting. It's closing time

357
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
But she absolutely cannot stay here

358
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,720
It's weird though, cuz it's like I've lived this day 20 times and I keep having to break up with you on it

359
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,820
Like I don't know what to do here. I'm pretty sure I need to get out of the relationship

360
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,420
Maybe I should learn to play piano. That is this room?

361
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,180
Hey guys

362
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,620
I'm driving with my best friend who's like my brother from NYC to Ohio for Christmas

363
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,580
Normally other people are there so I just sit in the back and read with my iPod on

364
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,500
Since it will just be he and I I'll have to interact

365
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:12,340
What are some fun things the brothers McElroy do on long car rides road trip in Gmail? Good question

366
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,700
I did this yesterday. Did you but you're yeah with Evan our buddy Evan Minsker friend of the show

367
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,140
Kind I this is gonna sound like a joke, but this is why I I

368
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,900
this year I started listening to podcasts and

369
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,300
You know, it also happened to be the year that I started doing a podcast

370
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:37,920
but like seriously it saved my life because I used to live in in this kind of crummy suburb of

371
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,480
Cincinnati where there wasn't anything to do and it was 30 minute drive to do to get to Cincinnati to do anything and so

372
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,680
I started listening to to podcasts and seriously like there's no better way. It is turned my my

373
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,480
Driving experience, you know into an absolute treat

374
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,620
Good shared activity. Yeah. Yeah, the best thing about podcasts is they take care of the talking for you

375
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,560
So like, you know, you're gonna run out of things to talk about on like a 12-hour drive

376
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,120
Yeah, even if it's with the first hour you pop on your podcast

377
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,720
You're good for like another nine hours, even if it's with your best like Evans my best friend

378
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,160
Like, you know, it's there's still a lot of conversation to do

379
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,200
So so you take the burden off both people and listen to a funny podcast. It's good to have

380
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,920
Sorry go on. No, it's good to have that

381
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,220
In the back like absolutely as a as a backup plan

382
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,040
You should you should have

383
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,040
Some in there to to mix up your repertoire when the conversation slows

384
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,720
I also really like like stand-up comedy CDs. Yes. He's on a sorry is

385
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,080
One of my favorite road trip CDs to listen to sure. I mean that used to be my jam. I think that

386
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,920
Podcasts have replaced that that need for me though

387
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,640
Yeah, most of my things revolve around that like books on tape

388
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,020
Podcasts stand-up comedy. It's all pretty much someone else doing the talking for me

389
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,140
I

390
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,140
some games

391
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,580
There's always spot the car. It's fun

392
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,580
Spot the letter we like to do that one

393
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,060
We used to play a game called ghost which we would do that. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we play

394
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:29,060
Ghost is a game where you take turns. God. This is like the narrative do it. This game is so fun. I

395
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:33,180
Actually, yeah, it's a good holiday game, too. Yeah, you get you take turns

396
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:42,860
Each person gives a letter in sequence you go in in order and each person gives a letter and the idea is to work towards

397
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,580
spelling a word

398
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,780
but the first person to actually spell a word

399
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
or

400
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,340
To use a letter that could not be

401
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,060
used in a in the word

402
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,500
Is is out or penalized? So let's let actually you know what?

403
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,580
Let's do a holiday. All right order of age descending. Okay

404
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,940
s

405
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,940
t oh

406
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,540
See

407
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,700
Yeah

408
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,780
So at this point Travis has the option of saying K and spelling stock

409
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:29,180
yeah, which will we will he will lose or trying to play it off like he knows another word that starts with steer

410
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:35,420
Let's see Travis is also sitting in front of his computer. It's a whole new level the ghost now. I'm gonna say K

411
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,680
What's in this game over? Yeah, necessarily the funniest bit we've ever done, but I feel like not a classic

412
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,020
Ambient being moment. It's not gonna make the tape but the mixtape

413
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:52,060
Dad's gonna love a present cuz I can play that game at any time of day. There are probably nerds shouting at their radios

414
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,060
Right now like he should have said age

415
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,220
stanching

416
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,220
stanching

417
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,460
There are other road games you play you play hide the carrot

418
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,400
There's a will he notice

419
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,360
A great game the Badger's Secret

420
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Victorian part of parlor game

421
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:26,960
One of these is poisoned. Oh, yeah, you start clap every claps and they say the Badger's Secret is that I'm okay

422
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,360
I've gone to two Christmas parties for the past three days where I

423
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,320
suggested that we play that game I couldn't think of the name of it like the game from the Albert Finney version of the

424
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,000
Christmas carol and people looked at me like I was a madman and

425
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,000
Adonami that like not everybody has seen the Albert Finney version of a Christmas carol

426
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,120
To be fair Griffin if you had said let's play the minister's cat

427
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:53,640
They still would have looked at you weird that is right. The minister's cat is a lonely kept the minister's something cat. Hey Griffin

428
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,680
Downstairs, I got that. I got that DVD as soon as we're done with this. Let's just watch that fire it up

429
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
if

430
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,920
It's just fun like that. That's some people haven't screwed what Scrooge track it down

431
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:15,920
My husband's family has a Christmas morning tradition of putting the baby Jesus into the crib in the antivity and the whole family sings

432
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,920
Happy birthday to Jesus. Oh

433
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,000
No, I think this is strange. My husband grew up with this tradition. So he thinks it's normal

434
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,840
Could you guys clear things up and tell us is it weird? Uh, man, this is so

435
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
half and half I

436
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
think

437
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,640
That like I almost feel like we've done this once like but like as a goof because who would do that?

438
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,480
Here's the thing if you were singing to the actual baby Jesus in a crib

439
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,620
My that's the thing my hang up with this isn't that they're singing happy birthday to Jesus

440
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,720
Is that they're singing happy birthday to a tiny little baby Jesus statuette

441
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm against singing to inanimate objects in any form

442
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,000
But aren't we supposed to imagine that he's like floating above them and like approvingly

443
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Clapping his hands along or nodding or whatever

444
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:14,520
Heavens but to say it to a little clay figurine is we yeah, that's that's idolatry dog. That's that's number one. Oh, that is true

445
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,840
I here's what you do Christmas. They start singing you pick up the nativity and smash it on the ground

446
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:27,340
You yell, I tell us and then you know false. God you very very like forcefully try and drag each of them to the oven

447
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Jack and a Bendigo style

448
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,680
Keep it down Shadrach. I'll take you to the oven

449
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,940
This is a George Foreman grill you can

450
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
Do you very slowly?

451
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:45,080
Put half of your hand in here

452
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,460
a

453
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,280
Friend of mine recently told me she's planning on getting gifts for me and a few of her friends for Christmas

454
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,600
I told her getting friends gifts wasn't a thing

455
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:00,240
We usually did and she said she just had some ideas in mind and really gets to shop for guys

456
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,480
And she isn't expecting or wanting something return

457
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,500
Should I run out and get something and tell our friends what she's planning or just let her give gifts as she pleases?

458
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:14,580
Stumped in suburbia. Oh god. This is so tough. Wow. This is something

459
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,020
It's the unspoken contract of gift-giving

460
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,540
You don't have to give someone a gift just because they gave you one but you're gonna feel like a douche if you don't

461
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
This is why you should have

462
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:34,340
You've got this is a warning for everybody. You've got to have some backup gifts

463
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:39,700
Oh, yeah, just some random wrap like like a Snuggie everybody wants one

464
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:45,320
Put like a bottle of wine in the back of your car and oh sure cheese tray something like that

465
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,700
But then you get your gift here. What if like your five your five-year-old nephew gives you a gift?

466
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,980
You can't be like hey son. Here's he gets the Snuggie some yeah, I guess but I mean if all you have is wine

467
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:04,780
Oh, yeah, I was making like it like you get this great juice. I like to have a ten of dance butter cookies. Oh, yeah

468
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:07,140
Say here eat these baby

469
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:15,460
Receive one of those bonus presents and like, you know, you know, of course, you know

470
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,660
To answer your actual question

471
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,320
The impetus is not on you to fix this. Yeah, like

472
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,640
Gifts are nice. It's nice to get gifts and you know, if your friend's gonna do something that might mean people uncomfortable

473
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,640
you

474
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,760
Are are not gonna be able to fix this situation because then think about this combination you have to have

475
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
Hey, you should get Angela a gift like that

476
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,440
It's bossy and nosy and you have the you have advanced nose though. You don't have an excuse

477
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,540
You have to get her again

478
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:53,580
That you like it. That's not an option for you. Um, you know, what else is good scarves. That's a good multi-purpose

479
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,460
I believe it's gift ours

480
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,660
It's cool. No scarves scarves like it like like Garfield does lasagna scarves

481
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,220
Scarves

482
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:11,820
This is a good object lesson not for our listeners stumped in suburbia, but for the type of people that he's talking about

483
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,420
don't get

484
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,100
Random people presents. It's it's really nice and everything like that

485
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,740
But you're gonna sideswipe them and come out of nowhere and and then you're not gonna get anything in exchange

486
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,740
Yeah, and I'm not saying that's the point

487
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,140
But it will make the other person feel uncomfortable because they don't have anything for you

488
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,780
Unless you get them a Snuggie and then they there will be they will feel comfortable for the all of their yes

489
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,280
How about a Yahoo answer tell me this one was sent in by Maddie B. Thank you Maddie B

490
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,420
It's by Yahoo answers user raw

491
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,420
Who asks?

492
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:50,300
Would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list

493
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,300
Well, there's there's additional details

494
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,420
But I feel like we need to address the first question first would your parents explain sex if you put it in your Christmas wish list

495
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,180
It sounds like he's asking

496
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,760
His parents never explained sex. Uh-huh. He's requesting on his Christmas list that

497
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,040
They learn about sex that they do the birds and the bees talks

498
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,680
See, this is another good reason not to have lists

499
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,680
Because you can put some crazy crazy stuff like that in it. Yeah, I

500
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,920
Mean that seems like a pretty important present if they yeah skipped out on that that I don't know about you guys

501
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,920
I received a series of lectures

502
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,600
Yeah, I think it's funny that he has to outsmart his parents about it. Like oh

503
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:44,880
You got me. All right. I guess you gotta have the talk now. You did put it on your list good call

504
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,560
Because is this question asker wanting this information? Like are they in need of this?

505
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,740
Like they know how to ask Yahoo. Let me to ask their parents. Let me bust out the additional details

506
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,000
Okay

507
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm 20 and still awful at it. Oh

508
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,320
Oh, no now that now

509
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,360
We just broke through the crust into the creepy creepy mantle of this question

510
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,720
Wow, so you are wanting sex tips

511
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:21,120
No, you wanna you want you want to go to your mom and dad and say hey mom and dad teach me how to dougie

512
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,160
I mean he is saying something like that

513
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,480
I'm still terrible at it. I need mom and dad

514
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,680
To teach a daddy. Um, daddy my daddy. I love you. Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas, Papa

515
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,680
Do you enjoy your bowling ball?

516
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,000
Good

517
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm trying to rearrange some guts and I could I could use some pro tips daddy

518
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:54,960
Yeah, uh, uh, happy birthday, uh, Jesus

519
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,480
And everything but

520
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:10,160
I'm getting laughed at over here. I'm getting some I'm getting some coital giggles that I could really do without so

521
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,680
If you have like a strategy guide that I could crack the spine of

522
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:25,420
Hey daddy after Rudolph, could you jot me down some charts and maybe some diagrams just jot me out like a Venn diagram of

523
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,020
What to do and where to do it. Yeah, how to do it how you do

524
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,320
Hey, but but listen if your wife's pregnant stay away from the butt cuz that's Santa's town. That's

525
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,680
It's not get out of there. I see

526
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,320
It or tonight you're blocking ho ho's exit and like he needs to he's got

527
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,960
You can't stay in your wife's uterus all night, please

528
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,280
Please let's say that man. Let's sit out

529
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,680
We hope everyone had the foresight who was listening to this their family just skip that clip to head that question off at the past

530
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,720
Yep

531
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,920
Let's just slow it on now. Um, I

532
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,200
I need an idea for a new holiday tradition for me and my husband

533
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,460
This is our first Christmas as a married couple. Also, we're really non-traditional. So go crazy brothers. We're looking

534
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,320
Sorry, so go crazy brothers. We're looking for fun. Thanks in need of holiday cheer gmail. This is awesome

535
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:29,720
I've been doing this so so much up in Chicago because I don't know too many people up in there except for my two roommates

536
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:35,020
Um, and we've had to make our own we've had to make our own, you know

537
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,200
Holiday experiences didn't follow through on a lot of them though, but we had some good ideas

538
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,520
Well, why don't you not don't keep us in we almost we almost went to the zoo, okay

539
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
That's how was your Christmas

540
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Almost went to the zoo

541
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,120
I'm pretty good. We are Christmas Eve tradition or is

542
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,960
on on Christmas Eve

543
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,560
We the three of us and our papa

544
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
Go on a walk

545
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,360
And

546
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,120
We've been doing that for literally two decades every every Christmas Eve will go

547
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,040
We'll take a walk. Charles isn't gonna be in this year. We think we're gonna have to have him on speaker phone

548
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:27,600
Skype him. Yeah, we'll Skype him in but he can't he has to promise he's walking in the cold

549
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,720
It's a that's a pretty dumb tradition because wow, it is cold

550
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,000
It's so cold, but it's not we talked about what happened during the year and year in review type thing

551
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,680
That's that's the nice thing about any holiday tradition or any tradition to begin with it really can be

552
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,200
Anything you just have to say like let's do this every year

553
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:54,320
Your tradition can be to eat hot dogs and watch Rambo every year. And that's your own

554
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:02,240
Me and my roommate watched we were we were going to watch all of the extended Lord of the Rings movies

555
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,240
But we only made it through about one and a half

556
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,480
So maybe your tradition is falling through

557
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:18,040
Yeah, it beat me to it, uh-huh so there's that what about I I'll tell you I

558
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,400
Some of my favorite holiday traditions center on baking I was gonna say baking. Yeah, that's always good

559
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,360
Let me give a quick recipe. Okay, get it third cup of butter 40 big marshmallows

560
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,080
Heat them up on low till they're melted teaspoon of green food coloring

561
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,400
Then six cups of cornflakes mix that all together and then you shape it into a wreath put some

562
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,480
Some people like red hops for berries some people like I use mint M&Ms red mint M&Ms to make the berries

563
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,120
Put it, you know on some wax paper make a wreath shape

564
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,880
You got a holiday like delight there. That is good

565
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,040
I want to see some J pegs of people who actually made that. Oh, yeah, make that Christmas wreath

566
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,960
I made and this isn't just I made this last night. I think it was it's a McElroy family favorite

567
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,480
Yeah, I don't know any other people that do that

568
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,000
and if there are the other day and somebody looked like I was like

569
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,520
Explaining the miracles of birth to them. They were amazed. Mm-hmm. Well, it is flavor birth

570
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,800
Practically. Yeah, that's the birth of delicious. Huey flavor birth. I want to hear. Hey, hold on

571
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,400
Yeah, I can tell you when in the show, but I have another yahoo that that really needs exploring

572
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,580
Okay, is that okay? I know you're going long, but it's Christmas

573
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,840
It is Christmas

574
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:36,020
This is a yahoo answers question that I found by myself, which I haven't done in a long time

575
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,320
We're very proud of you

576
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:46,800
Something a long time. I don't know how people keep doing this because it's really difficult. Thank you so much for sitting in your questions

577
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:53,160
It's by yahoo answers user balls W who asks oh

578
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
man

579
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,800
How can I tell my nine-year-old son? I'm not going to like his Christmas present. I

580
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,360
Found my Christmas present in his room when I was snooping. How can I tell him that? I don't really want a mug

581
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,360
I don't like my brother my brother and me. Why don't you get me this mug?

582
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,480
That's gonna be a really rough conversation balls W because

583
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,240
it

584
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,000
Seems pretty contrary to the spirit of the holidays

585
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Hey

586
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,200
Henry let's

587
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
Have a chat. I

588
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:44,500
Don't want to act surprised on Christmas or delighted, but I know about the mug you goofed

589
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,880
You did a bad job

590
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,240
Heft up do I look like a man who has a lack of things to

591
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,600
Bev out with because I have plenty of I have a wide array of Tervis tumblers

592
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,020
of cups handled cups

593
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm all set on that front. You know Henry. It's gifts like this that made your mother and I get divorced. So good job

594
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:17,040
Henry am I on the naughty list? What have I done to get on your personal naughty list?

595
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,880
What did I do? Where did I go wrong?

596
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,900
You know you should do you should flip it right on its ear and give him presents that he doesn't want

597
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,400
Just give him mugs like hey, here's turbo tax 2009 edition

598
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,220
You're gonna love it

599
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:38,560
Guess you just learned a lesson a thing or two because you really taught him now. No one's happy Merry Christmas

600
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:43,680
I think if you don't like a mug you gotta wait till you open it and smash it against the wall

601
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,640
Because that it would be such a great visual image. Okay, he's not he's he's I'll tell you if you if you if you're that

602
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,200
If you take your nine-year-old son's Christmas gift, it's a mug you take it you look at it

603
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,920
you make a face like you're retching inside like

604
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,200
And then you smash against the wall that kids

605
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,680
I don't know if he's gonna grow up angry or generate but he's gonna grow up special

606
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,000
He's gonna be a special person a light a special be unique world Henry

607
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,960
Why are you acting like a car? Oh, well, you see when I was nine, my dad didn't like my Christmas gift

608
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,520
BMW face

609
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,120
Listen

610
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,420
Bad news balls W. Nobody

611
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,060
Under the age of let's say 15 has ever bought a Christmas present for anybody that they wanted

612
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,220
No, you don't learn how to do that. You don't learn how to divine people's you know

613
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:42,020
Desires until at least age 15, I think and even that's pretty ahead of the curve

614
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:46,600
What kind of budget is your nine-year-old working? Yeah. Yeah, right. I

615
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:52,340
Might I have a sister in law. She's and she's a youngster

616
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,860
She's just now turning 10 and I wish I had a museum of the Christmas presents

617
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,140
They are awesome and and uh

618
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:08,060
You're uh, and if you don't like a little kids present that they got you you're probably a monster. I would like for you to die

619
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,780
Hey, can we curse?

620
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,780
What I really want to curse this guy out cuz he sounds like a real

621
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,900
It's a holiday. It's a holiday earmuffs earmuffs parents earmuffs parents

645
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,640
Listenership and and everything that you've given to us. It really means more than

646
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,280
Then we can say and this has been the best thing that that has happened to me this year is this podcast

647

So I mean that no, I mean that sincerely. Thank you. Thank you everybody

648
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:13,560
That's an awkward finish I mean, I don't have a lot going for me. Okay

649
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,560
I

650
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,160
Would I would actually rather listen to that teach me how to have sex

651
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,920
Then listen to you do this sad sack business again, so why don't you give give me that last guy?

652
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,560

657
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,700
Am I the only one who thinks that the Android store isn't nearly as cool as it sounds it sounds way cooler. Yeah, you're right

658
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:09,500
Um, but we got a song from our boy Jay Fonik. It's that Christmas creep. He turned it into a full full song

664
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:44,700
My veins spell out King is this common any significance?

665
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:59,420

00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,820
Keep your heart three stacks keep your heart. Hey keep your heart three stacks keep your heart man

These girls are smart three stacks these girls are smart play your part

668
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,180
Hi, I know this sounds kind of awkward or crazy

669
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:24,580
But on my left wrist my veins spell out the letters ki and on my right wrist my veins spell out ng

670
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,500
My middle name is in fact King. I've noticed this for the last two years and it will never go away

671
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,700
It seems like I know my family is related to royalty

672
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:37,340
I just want to know if this is common or if I'm just a king without his crown

673
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:41,900
What I do happy birthday Jesus
