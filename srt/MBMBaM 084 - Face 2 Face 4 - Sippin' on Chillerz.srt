1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's familiar, but not too much familiar. It's a new craze.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And the girls, do you want it? Just say, hey, I want it.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did I interrupt the flow, you know?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah, well I was kind of counting on the whole thing playing out, because that's the first physical exertion I've done in a decade or so.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's the most exercise I've gotten. Hi everybody, this is my brother, my brother, I'm in an advice show for the modern era.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm your oldest, most winded brother, Justin McElroy.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm a sweet baby griffin.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Guys, I got presents.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Candle Knight's presents.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I got Candle Knight's presents for everyone who is sitting at this table, and nobody in the audience, I'm sorry.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just this from here, Candle Knight's celebration.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's our swag from Genesis Today.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now what do you got there?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I got you the gift of health.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I got you an acai berry shooter.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, I'm not gonna drink that right now.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I got you super fruit omega-3 gummies.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wow, all for me?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I got you some goji, I don't even know what that one is, never heard of it before.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think that's what makes you do backflips real good.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I was just thinking.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Tell me.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
There's a second back, I was just thinking since we just did another show,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
an hour of goofs, and we never tried to do two hours of goofs in the same day,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that we need all the energy that we can get, and these have lots of B12 in them.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So we got gummy vitamins, this is super fruit.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
We got five-hour energy drinks, which are not from Genesis Today, but I figure they get the job done too.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Also at the Walgreens, where I purchased some of this stuff,

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
they have these at the counter, they're called Tropic Chillers.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They're 17% alcohol by volume.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They come in these delightful little spheres.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They're little alcohols.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
They're little alcohols, and we drink them.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That translates to 17% funnier for you, the people.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's do it.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really don't want to.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How is it?

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's straight gross.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wow.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh my God.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That tastes like radioactive urine.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It tastes like the bad part of vodka night, like towards the end when it comes back to you.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mine actually tastes like someone was floating apple slices in gross vodka, and then someone vomited in it.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I spilled Tropic Chillers with a Z all over my paper, so now I can't read them.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, gross.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we'll combine that with the five-hour energy.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't want to do that.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think the gag was initially that we would jam.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm like, ah, look at us.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
They're disgusting.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not doing that.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's repellent.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will drink a five-hour energy, and I want you guys to have the most pumped up.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can we start a clap?

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Can we start a slow clap for Justin?

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Slow clap, people.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A slow clap.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I know that.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Holy shit.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's gone mad with power.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't encourage him.

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
These are really bad.

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
They're really brutal, right?

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's get right into the advice.

70
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I feel like we've stalled long enough.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
First bit of advice.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't do any of the things from the last three minutes or so.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just don't do that, and you'll be good to go.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
First question comes from The Holiday Hater.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are they here?

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The Holiday Hater.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey, everybody.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Hey, hi.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, come on, guys.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That turned dirty quick.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We've yet to do a live show where the audience turns on each other before they turn on us.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But we will encourage that behavior.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, everybody.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Turn on that guy.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just got straight Hunger Games in here.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The candidate from Panama.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Okay, so he says, I'm a Grinch.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It doesn't matter what holiday it is.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Christmas, Thanksgiving, Halloween, Fourth of July.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He did not include candle nights, but I'm assuming.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Or anything else.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Just can't get excited for them.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Want to get excited and enjoy the holidays, but I just can't seem to.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How can I stop being a Grinch?

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Like things.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Normally we try to cut a little deeper to the bone here on our show.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But I guess like things is a perfectly suitable answer.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like every holiday?

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Like Columbus Day and like Canadian Thanksgiving and stuff?

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What about Independence Day?

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When we beat all the aliens?

103
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can you not eat super fruit gummies during the show?

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sorry.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You sound like my...

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is my chaw-addicted brother, Griffin.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He loves two things.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Bad advice and smokeless tobacco.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, but really.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Independence Day?

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Not a fan of that?

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's just fireworks and hot dogs.

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How can you not get into things exploding and also there are hot dogs there?

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wait a minute.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is every day of your life a holiday?

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you Tim McGraw?

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Live like it was...

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Like I was dying style?

119
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Every day out there skydiving?

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Rocking mountain climbing?

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No?

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, you're here so I can tell that's not true.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hey, I'm sorry.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to say that.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I love the holidays.

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why don't you like them?

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wow.

128
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What do you have against...

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let me say this.

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you have anything against them or is it just like, eh?

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, I don't feel it.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Mostly good.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, welcome to adulthood.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Guess what?

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Nothing's as good as it used to be.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You turn like 16 and people stop giving you candy and sparklers and it's sad from now on.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, and you have to drink chillers and five-hour energy drinks just to feel.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah.

139
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We have a cure for your problem.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's called alcohol.

141
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Get on the bus.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They sold these like next to the paydays and three musketeers at the Walgreens.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can guarantee you carried parents have picked these up as a treat for their young ones.

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Here.

145
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, they like this.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's bright green.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They'll love it.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm not even fucking kidding anymore.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is the grossest thing I've ever drank in my life.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, Frank, I know he's our son and I know how this sounds, but for the first time I

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
was able to really just chill with Dylan.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He just fucking hung out.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Me and Brian got some serious hang time on the bus.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was really good.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We went and hit the jukebox, played all the Toby Keith songs, just flipped the table and

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
left.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What I found in my adult life is all the holidays that I loved as a kid, like Halloween and

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Christmas and stuff, I had to give those up to appreciate holidays like St. Patrick's

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Day and Columbus Day.

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So you're saying sacrifice a few holidays so that the other ones mean more.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, I'm just saying like I've learned to appreciate I don't have to go to work today

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
days and I get to drink all day days.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
How do you not like those days?

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And Flag Day.

166
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What's wrong with you?

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I think you're too broken for our help, but sir, I'm sorry, you will be issued a full

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
refund at the door.

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You will not.

170
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have a Yahoo.

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A Yahoo, you say?

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yahoo Answers.

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
From the Yahoo Answers service.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
From the Yahoo Answers platform that was developed.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't stop drinking it even though you know you have to stop drinking it.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know, but it's like an experiment now.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's like mouth art for your mouth.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This one was sent in by Alethea Eckhart.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you, Alethea.

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nevaeh, who asks, they have it backwards.

181
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey everybody, by the way, cheese it with that.

182
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Unless your name's Nevaeh and you're here, in which case it's lovely.

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who asks, what can I get a horse and dog for Christmas?

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We're having a Christmas party on this Saturday, and we're doing Secret Santa, and I got a

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
horse named Daisy and a dog named Bandit, which Bandit is kind of old and only has 20

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
percent vision, so I can't really get him toys, so what else can I get a dog that only

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
has 20 percent vision?

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Euthanasia.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And what do you buy a horse for Christmas besides treats?

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Horse treats, apples, sugar.

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hey, guess what?

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's the only thing that horses give a shit about, those three things, and not being kicked

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
in the sides.

194
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Those are the four things that a horse is like.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I got you this necklace of roses.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I like oats and not having a man on me.

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Maybe you could get him a smaller horse and a smaller dog.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But you know what, even those horses give a shit about holidays.

199
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Just saying.

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hey.

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Just saying.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Get it together.

203
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They get a little extra trot in their gallop right around Thanksgiving and stuff.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know what horses like anymore.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
In my day, horses...

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They appreciated the simpler things, like Smucker's Raspberry Preserve.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I used to have my finger on the equestrian pulse, and nowadays I just feel so divorced

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
from it.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know what you could do?

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You could get the horse a dog present, and the dog a horse present, and then they swap

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
them, Gifted and Magi, and they become best friends.

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's not how Gifted and Magi work.

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Thanks for the watch chain.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's yours now.

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Gifted the lazy guy.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The Swapperoo.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Newsflash, if you're a horse, you don't fucking know that.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Just take it for granted.

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Somebody tells you to run in a circle, you're like, okay, boss.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I guess, thanks.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I hope I get oats for this.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We've gone, I don't know, five minutes without addressing the fact that someone got a horse

223
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and a dog and a Secret Santa.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What kind of fucking Secret Santa is this?

225
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What kind of Secret Santa is there where you draw a human being saying, oh, whoo!

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thank God!

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Someone that wears shoes and pants and stuff.

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah, I got the short straw, looks like I got the horse.

229
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Good news, you can give the straw to the horse.

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He will enjoy that very much.

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why is your response not, this is a horse.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I think there's been a clerical error.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You have written Bandit.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No, I entered the human Secret Santa.

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm a human and I have a horse.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
This is a horse and dog draw names?

237
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What the fuck is that horse going to get?

238
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All I got is these shoes and like an apple.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you want this eaten apple?

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Steven the human isn't going to like this apple.

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Bad news for Dorothy and accounting, you're not getting anything.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't even buy a gift.

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're going home empty handed.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How did the horse write their name on the slip?

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's a lot of questions.

246
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why are horses even involved in the Secret Santa?

247
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The horse doesn't give two shits about Secret Santa.

248
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Someone's having a laugh at the office, I think.

249
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey, Kristen, we're doing Secret Santa this year.

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The horse office.

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The office where horses are.

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This whole thing is taking place on Hey Dude, the television show.

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Unless this question is written by someone named Steven the weasel.

254
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're saying that this is an Orwellian animal farm kind of thing.

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Right, another animal getting presents for that animal.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
On the internet.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wait, it all fell apart.

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Can you get the dog an iPad too?

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Everybody wants one of those, the hottest gift this year.

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I got you Never Say Never.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Get some Genesis today, super fruit gummies, immunity boosting variety.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
For the horse on the go.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Horses need immunity, that's what I'm saying.

264
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have another question here.

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is Sam Panky here?

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Where is he?

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hi, Sam.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you for coming.

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sam didn't create a clever nickname for himself for reasons that will become evident soon.

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
My name is Sam Panky, and I've been blessed with a pretty wicked last name.

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Throughout my life, however, I've received the exact same nicknames and variants.

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Spanky, Pankasaurus.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to call bullshit on that one, by the way.

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No one's ever called you that.

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Pankinator.

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And my personal favorite, Panky Doodle.

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
These are all great, but I'm looking for something with a little more pizzazz.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And one that might reflect my life as a jazz bassist living and working here in Austin, Texas.

279
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What about pancreatitis?

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Okay.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's a good start.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's pretty good.

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You've got to start somewhere, I guess.

284
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You've never gotten Hanky Panky?

285
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That seems like the most obvious answer.

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Every day.

287
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Every goddamn day, huh?

288
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Stanky Panky.

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's not good.

290
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Has anyone just ever called you Sam by your first name?

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Mr. Sam.

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Excuse me, Sam?

293
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Samuel?

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Excuse me, Samuel Panky?

295
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Is that you?

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Never that?

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What about two in the Pank, one in the Stank?

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, come on.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Jesus.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Whoa, and now I'm the asshole.

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Can you not?

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Like, can you not?

303
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Could you?

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's a hundred people.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I regret nothing.

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You've had as much of your tropical chiller as I have.

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
There's really no excuse.

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm sorry, Mr. McElroy.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm cutting you off.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll tell you when I've had enough tropical chiller.

312
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll tell you when.

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's exactly when I say two in the Pank, one in the Stank.

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That is the specific moment in which I've had enough.

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's my alcohol safe word.

316
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't stress enough how bad these are.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't drink beverages with Z's in the tile anymore, guys.

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How can I have Zima?

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sam, what about doctor base?

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Now stay with me.

321
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You play base, right?

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're a medical doctor.

323
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you good at it?

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What about good base?

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, about average basis.

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Then if you have a really rocking knife, you're like, no, he was above average basis.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's good press.

328
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can't buy that kind of press.

329
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Set the bar nice and middle.

330
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You can jump right over that with just a few bum bum bum bum bum.

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's what a base sounds like.

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Just play the phrase.

333
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I can't see my mouth.

334
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Can we get a nickname started for you that has nothing to do with any of your real names?

335
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like Burger Master or something.

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now, are you good at making hamburgers, Sam?

337
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Do you eat a lot of hamburgers or are you good at making them?

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You talk about burgers a lot.

340
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, there it is.

341
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What's up, Burger Master?

342
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, Burger Sam they used to call him.

343
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Nobody loved him.

344
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The Sam burglar.

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Take that to the bank.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There you go.

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
To the panky banky.

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You monster.

349
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
See you go down to the bottom and while you're down there you find this with two in the pank

350
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
and while you're down there you find an oyster, you crack it open, there's a pearl like that.

351
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's it.

352
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That was beautiful.

353
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That analogy you just weaved.

354
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Get down to the bottom of the oyster and you find a pearl.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's so unpredictable.

356
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's like we're with Flea at his prime.

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's hard to know when he's got...

358
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Flea's a bassist.

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do you want a Yahoo to get us out of this?

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait, I heard somebody...

361
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Did Flea die or something?

362
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I didn't know.

363
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No, he's still cool?

364
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Okay.

365
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Flea's still kicking?

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Flea's still cool?

367
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
All right.

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go ahead, Griffin.

369
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We're cool on Flea.

370
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you, Flea.

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This one was sent in by Nefariosity.

372
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you, Nefariosity.

373
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user D who asks, an old woman keeps trying to get into my garden.

374
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What should I do?

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Does he mean a secret garden?

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think so.

377
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
She is not violent, but she is very persistent.

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She seems healthy and of good spirits.

379
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Additional details.

380
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
She seems of a healthy stock.

381
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Additional details.

382
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This afternoon she tried again, but she was wearing lipstick this time.

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Does this change anything?

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It changes everything.

385
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So wait.

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Wait, what color lipstick?

387
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ren is a game changer.

388
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
She's obviously trying to get all up on your arugula.

389
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is that a thing people grow in garden?

390
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Griffin, describe arugula.

391
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's a purple fruit, like eggplant.

392
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I know I've never eaten it.

393
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is it a flower?

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't.

395
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
So if I understand the situation properly, this man is looking out his garden window.

396
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Cautiously.

397
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Cautiously.

398
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I can't.

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's afraid she'll see her again.

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Is she rooting through his vegetables?

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, trying to get in his garden.

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
She can't figure out the gate.

403
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But don't worry.

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She is very persistent.

405
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
She'll crack that case eventually.

406
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
She'll dig underneath it.

407
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not violent, though.

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
She's not one of those violent garden crafters like you read about.

409
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I gotta say, this afternoon she tried again and she was looking good.

410
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Lip-wise.

411
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Really hot.

412
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Really hot.

413
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
A real foxy grandma.

414
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Everyone knows that old people keep away crows.

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's just a fact of life.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you don't have an old people there, a weasel will come and eat your rutabagas.

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Have you ever seen Rikki Tiki Tavi?

418
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's about that.

419
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Rikki Tivi Tavi and my nani.

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Nani is our grandma's name.

421
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Backstory.

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Ah, the age-old battle of the mongoose and the nani.

423
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
A few Yahoo...

424
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There are 53 answers to this question.

425
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Fuck you!

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Whoa!

427
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Fuck you, internet.

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Because the first one couldn't handle it.

429
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm going to summarize the thesis of about 20 of them who say...

430
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Summarize the thesis, though.

431
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They say, um, let her look.

432
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Just fucking let that old fucking lady into your garden.

433
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What are you doing?

434
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's so important?

435
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hey, you, get out of here.

436
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, that is a good question.

437
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What's your in-game worry?

438
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
She's a carrot thief, maybe.

439
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't know.

440
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
She's just going to start Godzilla-ing it all over your garden.

441
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Grandma, smash!

442
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I hide all my butterscotch candies in there and she's going to take them off.

443
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
She'll find my stash.

444
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I mean, lock your garden, I guess.

445
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Like, what actionable advice can we possibly give this human being?

446
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It sounds like the problem is resolving itself.

447
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She can't get in.

448
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You're cool.

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Unless you're worried about...

450
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No, she's like the Velociraptor.

451
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
She's checking every point of the fence.

452
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Clever old girl.

453
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She's trying to dig under it.

454
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This is great.

455
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah.

456
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It is really good.

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Where's the goat?

458
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Just stick it out.

459
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Wait, wait.

460
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is it a goat?

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Because I get confused that way, too.

462
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This goat in a dress keeps trying to get in my yard.

463
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Because if the goat is wearing lipstick, it has changed.

464
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The rules that you had before are evaporated.

465
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Get the horse and the dog lipstick!

466
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes!

467
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's get these barnyard animals sexy, everybody.

468
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's like a key to any garden.

469
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, shit.

470
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Sam Panky.

471
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Maybe the lipstick-wearing old lady.

472
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's a good nickname.

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Lipstick-wearing old...

474
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Lipstick Gma.

475
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
No?

476
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't like it.

477
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You don't like it?

478
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey, one of my...

479
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, wait a minute.

480
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Hold on.

481
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is Leviticus here?

482
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Boom.

483
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Leviticus.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Front row.

485
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Front row.

486
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is going to get awkward, but let's just stay with us, okay?

487
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's nice.

488
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Is that Argyle?

489
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes.

490
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's lovely.

491
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, God.

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
One of my friends...

493
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We'll talk more after the show.

494
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't listen to these neanderthals.

495
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They will, too.

496
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's not a gag.

497
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One of my friends...

498
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Did you go to my brother's and my brother's show?

499
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, it was good.

500
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
For, like, three minutes, they talked about old ladies and it was funny.

501
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And then for 45 minutes, they talked about Argyle sweaters.

502
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It got weird.

503
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I asked for my $10 back.

504
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They refused.

505
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers.

506
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I feel like I should direct this at him.

507
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He's close enough that I can just stare at him.

508
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I should just have him read it.

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers that she thinks I'm...

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please don't look at him.

511
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I was...

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was actually just looking at you really closely.

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If I'm gonna divorce myself from him enough to goof on him, I need to not...

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Do you want some acai?

515
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

516
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
If you could just superfruit me...

517
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You want one of these?

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm not...

519
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, cool.

520
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You gotta come up here.

521
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't throw.

522
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hey, everybody, Leviticus, everybody.

523
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hey.

524
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He's getting his goji on.

525
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He's becoming too real to me.

526
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't goof on him.

527
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If you keep your mind to me, he's there.

528
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
One of my friends is...

529
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I need to switch seats.

530
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,760
One of my friends is trying to introduce me to a coworker of hers that she thinks I might

531
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,920
be romantically interested in.

532
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,360
I don't know much about her other than that she seems nice and that I think we might share

533
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,720
similar interests.

534
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,340
When asked if I had any deal breakers, I said smoking and it turns out she does smoke.

535
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,800
Should I completely rule her out based on this one condition or should I quit being

536
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,680
stubborn and just accept someone as they are?

537
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,080
I've been single for a long time and I don't want to keep missing out.

538
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,560
That's a really good instinct, everybody.

539
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,000
Minutes, taking away, time to pair off.

540
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
My biological clock is ticking.

541
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah.

542
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Noah's Ark style.

543
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
One by one.

544
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You have to pair off to die.

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Pair off and die, everybody.

546
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,720
Hey, are you sure she really smokes and she didn't just share?

547
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,920
That's a deal breaker.

548
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
Maybe she's trying to get...

549
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,920
She's trying to comment.

550
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Did you see?

551
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
That was her disappear...

552
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
What?

553
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,920
I guess I smoke now.

554
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
I guess I smoke now.

555
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,920
Yum.

556
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I love these.

557
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Smooth.

558
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,520
This is the fresh baked tobacco leaf.

559
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,320
I love how crisp it is in my mouth.

560
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,520
Picked these up from my buddy Joe Camel.

561
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Yummy.

562
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Thank you, Joe Camel.

563
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,120
Flavor country resident me.

564
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,920
You know, there's a middle ground between being stubborn and accepting her for who she

565
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,760
is and that's changing her to the person you want her to be.

566
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,600
You could do like my wife did.

567
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,120
Start dating a non-smoker and then convince them that they're not, in fact, a smoker.

568
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Three years clean, everybody.

569
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Flip it.

570
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
You're saying...

571
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,720
I want to go back to what Travis was saying because it was funnier.

572
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Funnier unless real.

573
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,840
You want to flip it Eliza Doolittle style, My Fair Lady style.

574
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,880
Did you say Eliza Dushku style?

575
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,800
You want to flip it Eliza Dushku.

576
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Is she here?

577
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Eliza?

578
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Eliza...

579
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
She was at the 7.

580
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
She was at the 7.

581
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
She was at the 7.

582
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
You guys totally missed her.

583
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
You guys totally missed her.

584
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
Ask everyone who was at the 7.

585
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
They'll attack.

586
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Striking young auntie.

587
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Who was at the 7 o'clock show?

588
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
See?

589
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
They voted.

590
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
None of them were Eliza Dushku.

591
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
No.

592
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
She had to go.

593
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,120
If you can't...

594
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I don't think you should try a changer.

595
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
I think you gotta change yourself.

596
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
No.

597
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
This is all it takes.

598
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
This is all it takes.

599
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
No.

600
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
A couple of those.

601
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,560
You throw like eight of those and she gets self-conscious.

602
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,200
Did you enjoy the date with Leviticus?

603
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Yeah.

604
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
He's kind of coffee.

605
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
He coughs a lot.

606
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
He has rheumatism.

607
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Yeah.

608
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
I think he's got rheumatism.

609
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
He's got TB.

610
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,200
He's got a touch of the consumption.

611
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
He's a lunger.

612
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
He was a lunger.

613
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,120
I didn't enjoy the time I spent with him.

614
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,840
We tried to watch a movie and he kept coughing.

615
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,840
I'm sorry.

616
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,840
I'm here and I feel so bad.

617
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,840
This is what's important to note.

618
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,080
The fact that she smokes now is not a concrete thing forever.

619
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Right.

620
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
You gotta change it.

621
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,080
It's not like she has blue eyes.

622
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Right.

623
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
This is like, yes, she smokes.

624
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,600
That doesn't mean she's always going to be a smoker.

625
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,680
She's going to want to change your taste in podcasts.

626
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,200
It's going to be a give and take.

627
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,560
She's going to insist you stop calling yourself Leviticus.

628
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Yeah.

629
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Right.

630
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,200
There's going to be a lot of changing on both sides and that's what relationships are, people.

631
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Yeah.

632
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Just caving in to each other.

633
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Right.

634
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Finding out what you need to change about yourself.

635
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,840
Can you talk about negotiation?

636
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,200
Can you get her to cigars?

637
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
Can you flip it and get her to smoke cigars and then you kiss her and it tastes like grandpa

638
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
mouth?

639
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,120
Can you start dipping and then tell her, I'll give up dip if you give up smoking?

640
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
That's great.

641
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
In between vomiting.

642
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Hold on.

643
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
Hold on.

644
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,160
I need a moment.

645
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,120
Can you take up snoozing?

646
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
Can you snoozing?

647
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Or snoozing.

648
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,440
Or you just say everything in rhyme.

649
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,520
Can you talk about the secret a lot?

650
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,320
I don't understand.

651
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
What?

652
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
The secret.

653
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
The book.

654
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
The secret.

655
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Is the secret that you do snooze?

656
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Am I saying that right?

657
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Is it an umlaut over the u?

658
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,640
If you snooze, tell him you're going to reinforce.

659
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
It's a liquid u.

660
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Snooze?

661
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Snooze?

662
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,120
I don't like how it sounds when you say it.

663
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
Griffin.

664
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Griffin, save me.

665
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,520
Here's a Yahoo that has nothing to do with snooze.

666
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
It's by Yahoo Answers.

667
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Sent in by Nefariosity.

668
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Thank you, Nefariosity.

669
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:10,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark who asks, what do angels eat for my book?

670
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:18,640
How to cook for angels.

671
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
I'd read it.

672
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
I would.

673
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,280
I'd read it.

674
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,280
That Shinerbuck is so good after drinking that orange jizz for 30 minutes.

675
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,280
That's because of my asses.

676
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,280
Made here in Austin.

677
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,200
Guys, you got to stop giving in to me.

678
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,040
I am writing a book and the girl in my book is pregnant with an angel and I want her to

679
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,840
have something to crave.

680
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
Help.

681
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,280
Unfortunately, it's a biography.

682
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
You're not writing a book.

683
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
Let's be honest.

684
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
You're justifying to your dad.

685
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
Daddy is an angel.

686
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Trust me, it's an angel, baby.

687
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm trying to win a bet with my stupid friends.

688
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,360
What do angels eat?

689
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Two different people in the Yahoo Answers platform wrote angel food cake.

690
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Good one, guys.

691
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Quality.

692
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Good goof.

693
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Nobody said angel hair pasta.

694
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
Couldn't get another angel-based.

695
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
What about devil's food cake?

696
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Can you believe it?

697
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:23,120
Travis, if you make the jokes that are as bad as the jokes that are in there, then people

698
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
don't have to listen.

699
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,600
No, I said it in a tone of voice like I'm mocking them, but it's all I could come up

700
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
with.

701
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Can I joke snidely for 30 minutes?

702
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,880
Would you guys be cool?

703
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,320
I think, like, anything?

704
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,280
I guess anything they want to.

705
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,640
Obviously, their teeth are made of metal.

706
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,960
Roman Downey's teeth are made of metal.

707
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,480
Fuck you if you don't believe me.

708
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,200
I had a brief fling with her.

709
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,920
What's the other lady on there called?

710
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
Mama Angel.

711
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
Mama Angel.

712
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
I don't know.

713
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
I didn't watch it.

714
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
Angel's.

715
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,400
I'm pretty sure I only eat cloud-based foods.

716
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
So like cloud burgers.

717
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Like cloud burgers, mostly.

718
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Right.

719
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,040
Do they eat like tacos?

720
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Cloud tacos.

721
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,120
They can eat cloud tacos.

722
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,320
They're not exclusively towards cloud burgers.

723
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,080
There's a lot of cloud-based foods in this situation that I am whipping up live on stage.

724
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,200
Griffin's out there on a bold new frontier, and he is writing the rules as we walk.

725
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,760
They'll keep challenging me on this goof.

726
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
What about cupcakes?

727
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
God damn it.

728
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,200
Yeah, they eat those too, but they're made of clouds.

729
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,200
In this situation, I'm creating.

730
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,240
Have you guys ever seen improv before?

731
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,520
This is how it works.

732
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,320
Normally we record for an hour and 15 minutes, and you get a 55-minute show, and these are

733
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,600
the gems you're missing out on.

734
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,040
If you could believe it, you would be robbed of cloud tacos.

735
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:54,160
This is my brother, my brother, me, face-to-face, three, Tokyo Drift, the cutting room floor.

736
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,880
You at home are not hearing this.

737
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,080
So I could say, fuck anybody who doesn't live in Austin or the surrounding area, or New

738
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Orleans.

739
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
Really?

740
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
There he is.

741
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Good stuff.

742
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
You know what?

743
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,080
I'm done.

744
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,120
Do angels have to eat?

745
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,360
Do angels have to... Do angels... Let me bring it down.

746
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,360
Do angels have to eat?

747
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Things are getting too funny.

748
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Slow it down.

749
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,600
Let's have a really intense theological discussion.

750
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,560
What do you guys think about angels?

751
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:30,760
If I get to heaven, when I get to heaven, and I become an angel, because I think I did

752
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,400
a pretty good job down here, pretty sure that's how it works, I don't want to have to have

753
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,800
the onus of eating on me.

754
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,760
Angels only eat because they're hungry, because then, actually, angels only eat to take food

755
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,880
away from poor people.

756
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,480
This is mine.

757
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,720
This isn't made of clouds, I hate it.

758
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,840
I assume you mean non-Christian poor people.

759
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,840
Yes, yes, obviously.

760
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
That's how they punish them.

761
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,840
No such thing.

762
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,080
But it's okay, because they don't listen to our show.

763
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,480
Because they don't have iPods.

764
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,360
What are you talking about?

765
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,040
The horse getting a present made more sense than what you're saying right now.

766
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,360
Our show is the 1%.

767
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
That's all we're saying.

768
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Topical.

769
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Jesus Christ.

770
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,360
Shit.

771
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
Hey.

772
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,520
Hey, I'm talking to this guy who's on my paper.

773
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,900
Hey, I'm a guy who just went on a first date with a girl today.

774
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,400
She seemed really into me.

775
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:31,440
So we'll go out again later this week, and that brings me to my question.

776
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:44,960
What is the Christmas gift giving etiquette for someone you just started dating?

777
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
How much should I spend, and any gift ideas?

778
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
You could give them a coupon that says they don't have to get you anything.

779
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,760
Yeah, that's what everybody really wants, isn't it?

780
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,440
They don't want to have to get you anything.

781
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,880
Oh, a coupon that says, hey, here's a coupon for let's pick this up in three weeks.

782
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,600
You're talking about a temporary breakup slip?

783
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,400
Yeah, just like, we're going to take a break past Christmas, but we're going to kiss each

784
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
other on New Year's, and then it'll be totally cool.

785
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,960
So they're going to be lonely for the holidays?

786
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
No, because they have someone else, but just on layaway.

787
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Such an asshole.

788
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,240
Hey, don't start dating people now.

789
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
What's wrong with you?

790
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,320
Okay, like November 30th should be a cutoff.

791
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,840
Right, earlier than that.

792
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,860
Earlier than that, I'm saying Halloween.

793
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,880
You don't want to do the- You know what, let's just say June.

794
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:36,600
If you haven't found them by June, you get their number and say, I'll call you in February.

795
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
No, no, March.

796
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,600
March, not February.

797
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
After February 15th.

798
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Shit.

799
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,600
I'll call you February 15th.

800
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,360
Remember, remember the Ides of February, because then you can hook up.

801
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,920
But please don't forget my name, girl.

802
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,920
I talked to you once.

803
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,420
Hey, you're a down girl.

804
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
I'm enjoying this.

805
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
I will catch you in March.

806
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,560
Wait, then you have to text them every couple of days and be like, just so you know, only

807
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,360
a couple more weeks till we can talk again.

808
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,720
Got my name on you.

809
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,040
I like that idea, because I like the mental image of somebody being like, oh fuck, it's

810
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
June 25th.

811
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
I better get on it.

812
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,880
I'm going to be lonely for the rest of the year.

813
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,040
Who am I going to spend Independence Day with?

814
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Not that I give a fuck, because I hate all holidays.

815
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Monster.

816
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,000
And then we invent a new holiday on June 30th called Last Call Day.

817
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,960
That would be- Holy shit.

818
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
That would turn the whole game on its ear.

819
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,040
The whole game of love.

820
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
You're welcome, homework.

821
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,520
No, it's not homework.

822
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,120
It's dudes who are like, oh, I got to get down.

823
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,680
It's the 30th.

824
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,960
Everyone's going to be window shopping.

825
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,520
It's the last call day.

826
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,240
Just stand on a mound with some pretty shells and do your mating call.

827
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Don't even do that.

828
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,180
Just walk out on the sidewalk and people are going to run to you like they're picking partners

829
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
for Cotillion.

830
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
Like, come here.

831
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,480
I'm ready.

832
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
I'm ready for you.

833
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,280
I'm the best you'll ever do till February 15th or so, and I'll catch you then.

834
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Just listen.

835
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,280
This is easy stuff.

836
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,040
Just get them something related to the holiday.

837
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Yeah.

838
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Christmas.

839
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
Get them like a- Well, find out.

840
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,600
How about the promise that you don't have to meet your parents?

841
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,320
Well, that's a good start.

842
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,920
Christmas, you get them like a stocking.

843
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,920
That's great.

844
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

845
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,000
No, Christmas, you get them a stocking.

846
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Like one sock.

847
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,640
Yeah, like a sock.

848
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,680
For Hanukkah, you get them a dre- Like a dre-

849
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
A dre- A dreidel.

850
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Like a what?

851
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Dreidel?

852
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
A dreidel?

853
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,680
That's good, Justin.

854
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,680
Wait, hold on.

855
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:27,680
What's a dreidel, Justin?

856
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Dreidel?

857
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,480
It's made out of clay.

858
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,800
It is a- A dreidel, actually, is a purple eggplant-like fruit.

859
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,880
How many people know that?

860
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,400
That hates holidays, and is a fine- Justin, can you get me a Kwanzaa and also

861
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,200
a Ramadan icon?

862
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Yeah.

863
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,720
Kwanzaa, you will want to get them a Kwanzaa cube.

864
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

865
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,560
I just can't solve this Kwanzaa cube.

866
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,160
I got all the red ones matched up.

867
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,760
It's a puzzle-based cube that you give to someone for Kwanzaa.

868
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:11,080
That was left there by the Transformers.

869
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,400
The only way to stop the Decepticons- Sam Witwicky, you must take this Kwanzaa cube

870
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,640
to the head of Mount Inotron.

871
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,680
Take it to the peak, Sam Witwicky.

872
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,920
Hold the Kwanzaa cube above your head.

873
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,720
Ignore that Christmas is way better, in many ways.

874
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,480
Stick by your convictions, Sam Witwicky.

875
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,480
Keep an open mind, Sam Witwicky.

876
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
It's just as good.

877
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,480
This is getting weird for everyone, Sam Witwicky.

878
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,600
Have some awkward conversations with your school friends, Sam Witwicky.

879
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,240
These are our convictions.

880
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
Transformers only celebrate Kwanzaa, Sam Witwicky.

881
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
And Ramadan.

882
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
And Ramadan.

883
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,160
Hey, how about a yahoo?

884
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Yeah, please.

885
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,160
Because I feel like we're like- Hey, sorry, everyone.

886
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,400
We're leaning towards unplayable for fun.

887
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:09,760
We just offended both all humans and autobots.

888
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,600
We're quickly moving towards the fact that Ramadan sounds like a Transformer name, and

889
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,600
then we're going to talk about what kind of Transformer Ramadan is.

890
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,800
It's a smartphone that transforms and it's Ramadan-gle.

891
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,600
And obviously the correct answer is Ramabong.

892
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
That was incorrect.

893
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I'm sorry.

894
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Ramabong?

895
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Anybody?

896
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Is that good?

897
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Pretty good?

898
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
This yahoo answer was- I don't know what religion I'm offending.

899
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,400
I hope it's not one of the ones that- All of them!

900
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
This one's the happy ones, right?

901
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:42,320
The autobots versus the Decepticons versus the Ramagons.

902
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,440
It's a three-way war.

903
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,200
No one knows who's going to come out on top.

904
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,360
I can't believe you finished your chocolate chillers.

905
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,360
As it turns out, it's Sam Witwicky.

906
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Okay.

907
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Go ahead.

908
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

909
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Thank you, Jacob Locker.

910
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Thank you, Jacob.

911
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,360
Somebody wooed for him.

912
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,360
Good work, Jacob Locker.

913
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,280
It's by yahoo answer's user.

914
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
It got cut off.

915
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,920
NYC, trim, eye, and then an ellipses.

916
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
I don't want to know the rest.

917
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
I don't either.

918
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,920
That guy asks, why are these cows yelling?

919
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:15,800
Like he's stabbing them and they won't shut up.

920
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,080
I live out in a field close to some farms.

921
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

922
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,880
How do you have the internet?

923
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,400
Not near a field.

924
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,400
Is up on it.

925
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,520
Close to some farms.

926
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,640
It's a full moon outside and these cows are making these loud screaming sounds.

927
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,040
Do they do this on full moons or is it just them being killed by a predator?

928
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,520
Or the predator.

929
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,240
These tropical chillers are strong.

930
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,840
Have you seen that new movie, Cow vs. Predator?

931
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,760
That's actually how The Catch Predator got its start.

932
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,200
Did anybody listen for the screams of cows?

933
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,360
You know, I would like to think that most people when they heard this question are thinking

934
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,600
like the cows are sitting there going, but I said they're going, the cows are going,

935
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
stop.

936
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,600
Please help.

937
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Help me, I'm a cow.

938
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I'm being stabbed.

939
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Someone forgot to give me a gift for Secret Santa.

940
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,760
My feelings were wicked hurt.

941
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,480
Did anybody here have the kind of rural upbringing that would be required to shed some insight

942
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
on this situation?

943
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,000
Do cows actually scream at the full moon?

944
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,680
Do people, I should fucking hope not, but if you had told me that, I would have stood

945
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,120
up and walked right out that door and never looked back.

946
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,480
And now I have a new crusade to destroy cows.

947
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,080
So wait, so they do scream.

948
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,240
Do they just move super loud?

949
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Jesus.

950
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
That sounds.

951
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

952
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
One more time.

953
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Everybody quiet.

954
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,200
Can you come up to the microphone and recreate that sound for them?

955
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
Get up here right now.

956
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,120
This is for our radio audience at home.

957
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,960
Everybody, this is a howl at the moon.

958
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Say your name first.

959
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,960
Introduce yourself to America.

960
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Kate.

961
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Kate.

962
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,600
And this is the sound of a screaming cow.

963
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,040
We're going to loop this and sound it as one of those tranquil tapes.

964
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,660
This is a full moon hate cow.

965
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,480
This is the sound a cow makes.

966
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:25,000
That was awful, the worst speaking sound ever.

967
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,760
Now, y'all, I always wonder things about like, how do we get milk?

968
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
How did that start?

969
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,240
And I think if you heard a cow making that sound, you're going to try anything.

970
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,240
You know what I want to do?

971
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,840
I'm going to squeeze these pink things and drink what comes out because fuck, I don't,

972
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,200
I have to try something.

973
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,800
I've always been looking for a way to justify hamburgers.

974
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Yeah, right.

975
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,480
It's our only defense.

976
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,480
You make that sound one more fucking time.

977
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
I'm getting the A1.

978
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,080
Well, they're not screaming.

979
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,400
Are they screaming racist slurs, these cows?

980
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,960
Is that how you want to eat them to punish them?

981
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
What?

982
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
Punk cows.

983
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,960
What?

984
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,200
I was imagining the cow screaming racist slurs.

985
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,200
It didn't make any sense.

986
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,360
I just liked the mental image of it.

987
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,080
Next time, just maybe give me, is there a hand signal we can work out to let me know

988
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,320
you're going down a road like that?

989
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Sure.

990
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Can we jump back real quick?

991
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,240
Because I said punk cows and now I want to make a joke about them standing around wearing

992
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240
leather.

993
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Okay.

994
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Let's find it.

995
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
Okay.

996
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Do you know how you know they're punk cows?

997
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
How Travis?

998
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,240
That sounded like a transformer.

999
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Tell us how now.

1000
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
How do they, how do they know?

1001
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
They stand around wearing leather.

1002
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
That's it.

1003
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,240
That's just their skin.

1004
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
Don't.

1005
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Pretty good.

1006
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Pretty good.

1007
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Thank you, everyone.

1008
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Pretty good.

1009
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,320
But are the cows, the question is why are these cows yelling?

1010
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
It's a trick.

1011
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
What are cows?

1012
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Come out here, Steve.

1013
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Steve, we have presents.

1014
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
We can't.

1015
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Be cool, guys.

1016
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Be cool.

1017
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,320
He's coming.

1018
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,320
Steve, what are you doing?

1019
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Be cool.

1020
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Steve, we can't work the VCR.

1021
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,320
Come out here, Steve.

1022
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,320
It's just flashing 12 again.

1023
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Tell them that funny story you were telling me earlier, Steve.

1024
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Shh, shh.

1025
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I don't tell it like you tell it.

1026
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Come out.

1027
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
Steve.

1028
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,320
When he gets out here, we eat him, right, guys?

1029
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
Now, that's my problem.

1030
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,320
I don't think cows do that usually.

1031
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Only on the full moon.

1032
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
Cows that scream, booze.

1033
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,320
On the full moon.

1034
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
There it is.

1035
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Move it along.

1036
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Are you going to eat it?

1037
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Yes, move it along.

1038
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Are you fucking kidding me?

1039
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,320
You fucking dare.

1040
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Fuck.

1041
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,320
We know who the crowd favorite is.

1042
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,320
Yeah, two people managed to applaud.

1043
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,320
Enjoy your night alone.

1044
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
I hate your guts.

1045
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,320
You're out of the family.

1046
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm just kidding.

1047
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
I love you.

1048
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1049
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1050
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,320
They're booing you now.

1051
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Guys, wait, wait, wait.

1052
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Listen, they're still booing.

1053
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Let's take a second.

1054
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,320
They're mooing.

1055
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,320
I just turned Justin into a little girl, everyone.

1056
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,320
You brilliant son of a bitch.

1057
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,320
You got Mad Libs for us so you can bust out?

1058
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Let's just keep this shame train a rolling.

1059
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
Don't actually do it.

1060
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
I can freestyle one.

1061
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
Who's got words?

1062
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
No, stop it.

1063
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
How about another Yahoo?

1064
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
No, wait, OK.

1065
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,320
No, no, if you've got shit, let's do your shit.

1066
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,320
No, please go right ahead.

1067
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
OK, fine.

1068
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
This one's sent by Galiayali.

1069
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Thank you, Gali.

1070
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,320

00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Nope.

1072
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
I don't know what the question says.

1073
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm going to predict that is an inaccurate username.

1074
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
But go right ahead.

1075
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Unless the question is, how do I stop being so totally awesome?

1076
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I'm embarrassing my friends.

1077
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Help me, Yahoo.

1078
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Is it a sin to have sex with a robot for the purposes of procreation?

1079
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
OK, I was right.

1080
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,320
It's not a sin.

1081
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,320
It's just really misguided.

1082
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,320
You know how some couples cannot have children?

1083
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,320
You know, because of an immune reaction by the mother?

1084
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
However, the husband could fertilize the wife's egg,

1085
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,320
and a child could be born if it is placed in a surrogate mother, right?

1086
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,320
Well, what if the surrogate mother is an Android robot,

1087
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,320
a robot that is holding the wife's egg?

1088
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:58,320
Could the husband have sex with the robot in order for the couple to have a child?

1089
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
But what my book presupposes is...

1090
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
What if it...

1091
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
Listen, listen, listen.

1092
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,320
There's a guy who watched the movie Surrogates and got really confused.

1093
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,320
Why do you have to put it...

1094
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,320
Why can't you just like fucking put it in a Petri dish?

1095
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Why does it have to be inside of an Android?

1096
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Or like another human!

1097
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Why do you have to have sex with an Android to do this thing?

1098
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Griffin, you don't have to answer the question.

1099
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
I'm so sorry.

1100
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Is it a sin?

1101
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Obviously, God didn't know about robots.

1102
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
That's true.

1103
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
No one knew about robots.

1104
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,320
John, Mark, Matthew, Luke, Ringo, no one...

1105
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
None of them knew about robots.

1106
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
So it can't be a sin.

1107
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
That's why...

1108
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,320
There are...

1109
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
There's a lot of shit that God don't know about.

1110
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
That's what you're saying.

1111
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Robots, the internet.

1112
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Yeah.

1113
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
God doesn't know...

1114
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,320
You can jerk it to e-porn and the Bible can't say anything about it

1115
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
because the Bible doesn't know about the internet.

1116
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Right.

1117
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
That's why we...

1118
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,320
My brother and my brother and me are writing Bible 2.

1119
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,320
We're writing the cyber Bible.

1120
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Cyber Bible.

1121
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
What's the cyber Bible for the digital age?

1122
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Thou shalt not robo-freak.

1123
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Don't robo-freak.

1124
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
What is robo-freaking?

1125
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Just so I know for sure.

1126
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
So I'm clear?

1127
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,320
How about anything where you talk about having a surrogate baby inside of a robot body?

1128
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
That's a sin?

1129
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
I guess.

1130
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,320
I like to have that discussion and that the word sin enters into it.

1131
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,320
There are so many other things that is before it is a sin.

1132
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Is it weird?

1133
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,320
Is it wrong?

1134
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
Is it imaginary?

1135
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:30,320
Is it not real in any way?

1136
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Don't...

1137
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
Don't...

1138
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Don't fuck this robot.

1139
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
This robot is...

1140
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
I know how it looks wearing lipstick sneaking around in your garden.

1141
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Looks great.

1142
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
It's got mystery.

1143
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
It's got intrigue.

1144
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
Can it even feel things?

1145
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Wait.

1146
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,320
Is it a sin?

1147
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Is it a girl robot?

1148
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Oh.

1149
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
You're saying...

1150
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Wait.

1151
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
Wait a second, Rick Perry.

1152
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Wait a minute.

1153
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,320
You're saying if he fucks a... if this is a lady that fucks a boy robot, then it's bad?

1154
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Is that what you're saying?

1155
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
No.

1156
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
Okay.

1157
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,320
You just want...

1158
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,320
You just don't want a bunch of robo-sexuals running around undermining family values.

1159
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Hey, by the way, first Republican presidential hopeful to adopt that platform?

1160
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
You've got my vote.

1161
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I will...

1162
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,320
I will switch parties if you come out against robo-freaking.

1163
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
It is...

1164
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Did you get one of those robo-calls?

1165
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Yeah, I did.

1166
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
It was weird.

1167
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
It was about robo.

1168
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
It was a robo-sex call.

1169
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:28,320
It was a robo-sex call.

1170
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,320
It was really dirty and there was lots of bleeps and boops.

1171
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Put it in my...

1172
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Everyone knows that if it feels good, it's not a sin.

1173
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Tell that to fuck poor Cyber Dave the robot who keeps getting fucked by a human.

1174
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Like, he doesn't care how it feels.

1175
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
He's a robot.

1176
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,320
He doesn't even get to vote.

1177
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
Which, by the way, that is a sin.

1178
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Yeah, it's criminal.

1179
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,320
It is a sin.

1180
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
They've got emotions.

1181
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
They can decide...

1182
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
Their logic circuits are better than ours.

1183
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Are you saying it's a sin that robots don't get to vote?

1184
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
It is.

1185
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Yeah, exactly.

1186
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
I don't think robots are advanced enough yet to vote.

1187
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,320
Like, I don't...

1188
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
Like, there are robots...

1189
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Whoa!

1190
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,320
It's that kind of mentality, Griffin.

1191
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
There's a kind of...

1192
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
No, no, no, no, no.

1193
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
All right.

1194
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
You're gonna start spewing some anti-robo bullshit.

1195
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
This...

1196
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:17,320
My Roomba doesn't grasp the subtle intricacies of our government system.

1197
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,320
I don't want to think that exclusively...

1198
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
The Robos are coming here and taking our job.

1199
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Yeah.

1200
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
This thing...

1201
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Vacuuming our floors, making our cars.

1202
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,320
If that doesn't preclude many of the flyover states from voting,

1203
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
I don't see why it should preclude robots.

1204
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Well, most of the people who live in flyover states

1205
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:36,320
don't exclusively eat the Cheetos that I drop on the floor.

1206
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Or maybe they do.

1207
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Are you talking about...

1208
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I don't think Roombas will ever vote.

1209
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,320
Is that what you're saying to me?

1210
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,320
That's what you're saying.

1211
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,320
You just turned it back on me, how to kill a mockingbird style.

1212
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,320
There wasn't a lot of turnout for the 2012 election,

1213
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,320
but there was a huge turnout for the anti-dirty floors levy.

1214
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,320
I just called that book How to Kill a Mockingbird.

1215
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
I'm pretty sure it's not an instruction manual.

1216
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Use rocks and guns and stuff.

1217
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Catch them in a net and then hit them with something hard and heavy.

1218
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,320
How to murder a mockingbird.

1219
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Just get them.

1220
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
They're really tiny and fragile.

1221
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
You can step on them.

1222
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
There's lots of ways.

1223
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
It's easy.

1224
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
What do angels eat?

1225
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Mockingbirds.

1226
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Feed them to an angel.

1227
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Cook them.

1228
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
Throw fire at them.

1229
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
This is going to be great.

1230
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
What's his nickname?

1231
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Mockingbird killer.

1232
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
You got Yahoo or a regular question?

1233
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,320
Oh, yeah.

1234
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Where's Hesitant Houston?

1235
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
What?

1236
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Hi.

1237
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Hey.

1238
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Oh, a shadowy figure.

1239
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
Arises for the night.

1240
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,320
Hesitant Houston says,

1241
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I have a potential job opportunity in Salt Lake City,

1242
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,320
which is where my nuclear family lives.

1243
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,320
Whoa.

1244
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,320
However, all of my awesome friends

1245
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,320
and the whole rest of my life is in Houston.

1246
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Should I leave it all behind to join the fam

1247
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
and advance the career,

1248
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,320
or should I stay with the friends I love

1249
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
and hope for the best?

1250
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
It's from Hesitant Houston.

1251
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
Listen.

1252
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I don't care how awesome your friends are.

1253
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
If you have a nuclear family,

1254
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
they're not going to compete with that.

1255
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
I've seen ones you want to move there

1256
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
and focus on your half-life.

1257
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Yeah.

1258
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
We...

1259
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
That's bad.

1260
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,320
I've seen the Incredibles.

1261
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Yeah.

1262
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Do they have, like,

1263
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,320
alien tendrils growing out of their body

1264
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,320
because of the waste?

1265
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,320
I want to know what your situation, like, here is

1266
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,320
that you have to define it as hope for the best.

1267
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,320
You know, I believe you should be with your family.

1268
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,320
Record a podcast with them,

1269
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,320
just hang out with them, whatever.

1270
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
I don't know anybody in Salt Lake City,

1271
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
but I'm pretty sure that's where they film Sister Wives.

1272
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
Is that true?

1273
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
It's around there.

1274
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Can you get to know the Sister Wives people?

1275
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,320
Because if you get in that club,

1276
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
there's, like, 45 people in it

1277
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,320
for you to just know and have in your crew.

1278
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,320
Well, 45 people, 41 of which are kids.

1279
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,320
So if you want to be the guy

1280
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
who has a lot of little kid friends,

1281
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
which has worked out so well

1282
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,320
for many entertainers in the past,

1283
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,320
by all means, befriend the Sister Wives.

1284
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:13,320
Or you can be wife of a five.

1285
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
You can be the fifth wife in that unit,

1286
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,320
and then get all the perks of being

1287
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,320
in the Sister Wife unit.

1288
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,320
No, because he's a dude, and then it gets weird.

1289
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Oh, yeah.

1290
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,320
You can be brother-husband.

1291
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:31,320
This is my brother-husband resident in Houston.

1292
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,320
I love him very much.

1293
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,320
I know nothing about Salt Lake City

1294
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,320
except that that might be where Sister Wives is filmed,

1295
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,320
and that might not even be true.

1296
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Don't they have a sports team?

1297
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah, the Jazz.

1298
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
The Jazzers.

1299
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:48,320
The Jazzercizers.

1300
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Pretty sure it's not the Jazzers.

1301
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,320
I say family beats friends any day of the week.

1302
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
Isn't that right, guys?

1303
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
In a fight.

1304
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,320
In a fight, you can get it together.

1305
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
Yeah.

1306
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Unless your family sucks.

1307
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Yeah.

1308
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Are you moving there from Austin?

1309
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Dude, that's in Houston.

1310
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,320
Whoa.

1311
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
You're right.

1312
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Listen.

1313
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Oh, snap.

1314
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,320
No, no, no.

1315
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
That was a good burn.

1316
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,320
In my defense, I've drank like half of a Tropical Chillers.

1317
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,320
I swear to...

1318
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,320
Now the onus is back on you.

1319
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,320
We should have handed that out.

1320
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
How many Tropical Chillers have you drank?

1321
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Repost.

1322
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Griffin, you got a Yahoo?

1323
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,320
I know someone who's not getting a picture with us later.

1324
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
Ooh.

1325
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
You absolutely...

1326
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
Pretty much everyone,

1327
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
because we'll be passed out in the dressing room.

1328
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
We're gonna black out on Tropical Chillers.

1329
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Did you go to the My Brother, My Brother Me Show?

1330
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Yeah, it's the last one.

1331
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,320
It was really funny.

1332
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,320
For the first 40 minutes,

1333
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,320
and then the Tropical Chillers caught up with him.

1334
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,320
Griffin, help me out.

1335
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
Oh, God.

1336
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
This one is sent in by Alethea Eckhart.

1337
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Thank you, Alethea.

1338
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Julia, who asks,

1339
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,320
does anyone know where to find a gargoyle nativity set?

1340
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm looking to find a nativity set in the form of gargoyles.

1341
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
Any suggestions are helpful.

1342
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
Thanks.

1343
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,320
Um, not any suggestions.

1344
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I bet the ones that we're gonna have

1345
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
are not gonna be particularly useful.

1346
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,320
In my nightmares.

1347
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Did...

1348
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,320
Are there other monsters that are getting their own nativity sets

1349
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
that I didn't know about?

1350
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Does anyone know where to find a werewolf nativity set?

1351
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Yeah.

1352
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,320
With, like, Baby Jesus halfway through Transformers.

1353
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
They didn't follow a star.

1354
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,320
They followed the full moon.

1355
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,320
We brought him frankincense and silver bullets.

1356
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,320
I... why do you need a gargoyle nativity set?

1357
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
You know, we don't take the time to ask the obvious questions

1358
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
and out here, my brother, my brother, me,

1359
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
what are you doing with this?

1360
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,320
So their gargoyle friends don't feel left out.

1361
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Yeah.

1362
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
Yeah, right.

1363
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Oh, wait.

1364
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,320
They're Jewish.

1365
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Well, I guess they...

1366
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,320
What?

1367
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,320
They don't do that.

1368
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
They don't do the nativity thing, do they?

1369
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,320
No, and I don't think they think it starts...

1370
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
It starts off right there.

1371
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Wait, were you thinking of the golem?

1372
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,320
That's what it was.

1373
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Okay, good.

1374
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
I got it mixed around my head.

1375
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
We'll just edit this one out later.

1376
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,320
This is a director's cut goof for everybody here.

1377
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,320
Hey, let's say more things about Kwanzaa that we don't understand.

1378
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,320
I think anybody can appreciate the Kwanzaa cube gag.

1379
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,320
I've been working on that for ages.

1380
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Can we help this person out and find monster themed nativity sets anywhere?

1381
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
This is my problem.

1382
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
To have a gargoyle themed nativity set, at some point,

1383
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,320
some stonemason or carver would have to sit there and go,

1384
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,320
I'm sick of all this human stuff.

1385
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Yeah.

1386
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
I know what the people want.

1387
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,320
I need a Jesus.

1388
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
Gargoyle babies.

1389
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I need a Jesus with wings and a beak.

1390
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
Also, he is made of stone.

1391
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,320
And he perches high upon a watchtower.

1392
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,320
I don't think Jesus wants to be in a watchtower.

1393
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,320
I think we've got to stick with the manger or else it's not really nativity.

1394
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
Keep perches on the edge of a manger.

1395
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Yeah, because there's no room for him to perch.

1396
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,320
And then they're saying, get back in that manger, Jesus.

1397
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,320
Yeah, you're a baby.

1398
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,320
That's dangerous.

1399
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:50,320
Watch out for the gargoyle cow, Jesus.

1400
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,320
There were no perches left on the end, so we had to perch.

1401
00:49:53,320 --> 00:50:03,320
The real lie that this set tells is that you can get gargoyles to sit still for anything.

1402
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,320
Because they, you know, you get a bunch of them in a room together,

1403
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,320
they're going to start arguing, they're going to start having a political fight,

1404
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,320
and it's going to be a real disaster.

1405
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Yeah, humans, you can get them to stand around, even cows and sheep and stuff,

1406
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
but gargoyles, ugh.

1407
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,320
I have been trying to reference the TV show Gargoyles for a while.

1408
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,320
I've been trying to do it in a way that wasn't just saying,

1409
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
Gargoyles, the TV show.

1410
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,320
Hey, if you guys are at the cartoon, they have gargoyles in it.

1411
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,320
I almost said that one of the wise men would have to be voiced by Jonathan Frakes.

1412
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
Jesus.

1413
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,320
But I think that might be, like it's a real deep cut.

1414
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,320
So I'm really going out to the boneyard for this one.

1415
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,320
I would really love to see the look on your face as you look around the audience,

1416
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,320
like, guys, Jonathan Frakes, anyone?

1417
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
How about that Jonathan Frakes groove?

1418
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,320
As the stars at night are big and bright.

1419
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
Deep in the heart of Texas.

1420
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,320
Yeah, it gets you out of anything.

1421
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,320
That's our fucking zip line.

1422
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,320
Bad news, everybody.

1423
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
That's the ripcord.

1424
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,320
So after this, we are working without a net.

1425
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,320
You got anything else, Griffin?

1426
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,320
Do you have anything else to say?

1427
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,320
I do, but it's a question you hate and you don't want me to read.

1428
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,320
Oh, do it.

1429
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Don't read this fucking question.

1430
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,320
Read it as loud as you can.

1431
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:10,320
It was sent by Lynn W.

1432
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,320
Wait, can we just end the show instead of that?

1433
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,320
That's by Yahoo Answers user Koopy Koo, who asked.

1434
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,320
I am against this.

1435
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,320
I'm not here for this part.

1436
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,320
For the next 30 seconds, Justin's going to check out.

1437
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:24,320
How do I tell my girlfriend that a thing down there looks weird?

1438
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Like everyone else does.

1439
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,320
It was the first time I ever saw it on a woman and it looked weird.

1440
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,320
How do I tell her?

1441
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,320
Hold up.

1442
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:39,320
It was the first time you ever saw it on a woman?

1443
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,320
You've seen illustrations and stuff.

1444
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,320
I was looking through the tree line and I saw it.

1445
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,320
It inspired me like sunshine through the boughs.

1446
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,320
Yeah, the first time I heard dubstep, it was weird to me.

1447
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,320
You have to get used to these things.

1448
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
Yeah.

1449
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,320
Hey, have you ever seen Skrillex's vagina?

1450
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
It's like wicked weird looking.

1451
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:05,320
I feel that this is like a whole avenue that Hallmark could go down and just like a series

1452
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,320
of cards on the front that says, hey, baby, I love you so much.

1453
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
And there's like a beautiful sunrise.

1454
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,320
And then you open it and it just says, but your vagina is weird.

1455
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
Your business region is like, what?

1456
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Your downtown area is like, what the fuck?

1457
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,320
You have to broach it with her scientifically.

1458
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,320
You have to say, hey, listen.

1459
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,320
And push your glasses up your nose.

1460
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:29,320
Push your glasses up your nose and say, listen, I need to see some of your friend's vaginas

1461
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,320
because right now I'm-

1462
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,320
I'm going to need you to do a side by side comparison.

1463
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,320
Yeah, I have no basis.

1464
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,320
This is purely scientific.

1465
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,320
You understand.

1466
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,320
Clinical, a clinical study of your friend Darlene's vagina.

1467
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:47,320
I want you to read that, just the first sentence of that answer.

1468
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,320
Rosie says, you're going to destroy her self-esteem if you tell her.

1469
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,320
So find a way to communicate that doesn't involve making her feel gross.

1470
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,320
If her entire self-esteem is based upon the beauty of her vagina, she doesn't have a lot-

1471
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:07,320
I don't have a lot of things going for me, but man, is my vagina great.

1472
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:10,320
I would like to formally apologize for thinking we shouldn't read this question

1473
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,320
because it's gone great so far.

1474
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,320
What a gem.

1475
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,320
One for the record books, I'd say.

1476
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:23,320
I'm pretty sure that nobody with vagina listens to our show.

1477
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
Oops.

1478
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
Oops.

1479
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
Sorry.

1480
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,320
Sorry.

1481
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
We should end this.

1482
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Thank you guys.

1483
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,320
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first I should say thank you to all of you

1484
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:37,320
who have come to our show from Austin, the surrounding area in New Orleans.

1485
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
Thank you guys for coming.

1486
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
You're like the best people in the whole world.

1487
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,320
I love you very much.

1488
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
Thank you so much.

1489
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:45,320
Sorry about that stuff I said about nobody with vaginas listening to the show.

1490
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,320
I feel bad about today.

1491
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,320
There's a lot of people.

1492
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,320
It's just looking around the room.

1493
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
There's a lot of-

1494
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
I can't help but notice.

1495
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,320
There's like 30 to 40 vagina people with-

1496
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,320
And that is what they prefer, right?

1497
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Yeah.

1498
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
That's the PC term.

1499
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,320
That's the PC term.

1500
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,320
Vagina among us.

1501
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,320
There's a lot of vaginids.

1502
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,320
The vaginids among you.

1503
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:12,320
The vaginies.

1504
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,320
I can't say that word anymore for the rest of my life.

1505
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
I burned them all this night.

1506
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Thank you.

1507
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,320
If anybody wants to eat super fruit gummies, we got them up here.

1508
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
We got plenty of extras.

1509
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,320
Don't be shy.

1510
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:26,320
Don't eat more than two of the acais.

1511
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,320
Make sure you come by.

1512
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,320
You will freak out.

1513
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
We'll be over here.

1514
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Come by and say hi and get a picture and get something signed and buy a poster if you want

1515
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,320
for 10 bucks.

1516
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,320
And we're going to be going-

1517
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Where are we going to after we're done here?

1518
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
We're going to go to the Kung Fu Saloon.

1519
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,320
They have ski ball, so-

1520
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
Free ski ball.

1521
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Free ski ball, so-

1522
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
Drink.

1523
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Yeah, drink it in.

1524
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,320
Free ski ball.

1525
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,320
Were you guys just disappointed that the ski ball is free?

1526
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,320
That's how you know it's real low level ski ball.

1527
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
There's going to be kilometers on it.

1528
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,320
I saved my tokens.

1529
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,320
And special thanks to everyone who helped out with the show tonight.

1530
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
To Rachel, Sydney, Bristol.

1531
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Thanks, guys.

1532
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
Justin.

1533
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Tanner.

1534
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Jordan.

1535
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Jordan.

1536
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
And thank you to Blue Theater for having us.

1537
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Yeah, thanks, Blue Theater.

1538
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:12,320
I want to thank the creators of Tropic Chillers with a Z.

1539
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,320
Don't tell them about all the mean things we said about them.

1540
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,320
Your shit tastes so bad.

1541
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,320
They probably don't have a lot going for them.

1542
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,320
Except for their beautiful vaginas.

1543
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,320
Griffin, go ahead with the last question.

1544
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
This final Yahoo is sent in by Nefariosity.

1545
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Thank you, Nefariosity.

1546
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,320
It's by Yahoo Answers user Zoro, who is a top contributor, who asks,

1547
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:36,320
Star Wars fans, can a Jedi use the Jedi mind trick to induce labor?

1548
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
I'm Justin McElroy.

1549
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,320
I'm Travis McElroy.

1550
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1551
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,320
This has been my brother, my brother, me.

1552
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
Kiss your dad.

1553
00:55:41,320 --> 00:56:08,320
I'm Travis McElroy.

1554
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:25,320
I'm Travis McElroy.
