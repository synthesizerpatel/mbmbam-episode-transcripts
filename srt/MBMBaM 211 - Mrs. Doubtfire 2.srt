1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,720
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,880
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,040
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,760
And I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
I'm really, really excited, you guys.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,120
What's going on, Trav?

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
Well, we get a lot of questions, you know, a lot of people asking for help,

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,920
and which is great. I mean, that's what our show is built on.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
It's built adjacent to that.

14
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
It's not adjacent. It's help adjacent.

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,280
This week, we got a really exciting email where a young gentleman is asking for help

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
and it's going to financially benefit us.

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
Oh, I like that. I actually like the second thing better than the first thing.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,280
Yeah, he's a young man in Africa, in Kenya, and he's having a bit of legal trouble.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,160
His father passed away in 2009.

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,280
Oh, that's a shame.

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,200
He had in the bank $10 million and all he needs is our bank account information

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,680
so he can transfer that money in there.

23
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,680
You had me at email.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,600
Just go for it. Send it, send it right away.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:57,440
It's 464-4664-4.

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,680
Okay.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
Six, go.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
I said hit it, Rich.

29
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,520
So, I mean, we might be able to retire from doing the show

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,760
because we get to keep 40% of it.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,800
That's like $4 million.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm refreshing our simple transaction page.

33
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,000
Just waiting for that money to come.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
We're at negative dollars.

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, no.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,320
We're at these transition conversion rates.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,280
You got to spend money.

38
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
You got to spend money, make money, you know?

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,560
That's right. This is an investment.

40
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,880
I don't feel great about this.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:34,240
Well, he just had some trouble with his wicked stepmother and his uncle's legal team.

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,120
So, I'm sure he's just needing some money to help battle them and get their stuff back.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,240
And it's going to be fun.

44
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,520
It's going to be great.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,880
We're going to be rolling.

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,920
Did he provide a return email address that we can sort of correspond

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,040
and just sort of check on like what the hiccup was?

48
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Because I know sometimes like the wires get crossed.

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
That's not just like an idiom.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,720
Sometimes the wires, when you wire money to people, get crossed.

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,680
And then our 10 mil-

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,520
Was it 10 mil that we were getting?

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,240
I imagine just a chunk of it.

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,600
I mean, we get to keep 4 million of it.

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,660
Okay.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
How much were we supposed to-

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,000
You didn't even tell me how much we were supposed to send over.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,040
I just did all of it.

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,880
I just clicked the transfer all button.

60
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,760
I think that sounds right.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I think he just has like as much as you can.

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
Why do they even have that button?

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,640
Yeah, I don't know.

64
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
It says transfer all to Canyon Prince.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,560
As long as we're updating, I want to give you guys a couple of updates on my life.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,600
First is I chased my cat out of the litter box so I could shut her out of the office

67
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
for recording soundproofing.

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,840
Terrific.

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,520
And now I have locked myself in a stinking prison.

70
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,440
Please send help.

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Please.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm dying.

73
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,080
Second, ugh, second alert.

74
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,440
I wanted to give everybody a quick pregnancy update via a message I found yesterday that

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
I thought you all would enjoy.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,240
And I thought we could just stage a reading of this real quick.

77
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,960
I was looking for no baby yet.

78
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Looking for information about how people have-

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,800
There is a baby.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,520
There is a baby.

81
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
It's not visible.

82
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Not a visible baby.

83
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,960
Invisible baby.

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,120
I found this brief forum exchange yesterday while I was cruising.

85
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,880
There are three messages in the exchange, so I figured we could just go me, Travis,

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,280
Griffin.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,760
You ready?

88
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,480
Yeah, it's perfect.

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Nice, he says, I'm a 41-year-old mother of four.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
Every woman pregnancy are very much so different.

91
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
I would advise you all to let Mother Nature take its course.

92
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
All the oils and different regimes may harm the baby.

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,280
The safety of the baby is more important than trying to jumpstart labor on your own.

94
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Congratulations to you, and good luck on your beautiful blessing.

95
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,480
And then Nice, he says again, we are the same age.

96
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,400
Name and kids, congratulations.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,320
And then Ashley says, screw you, I'm 19.

98
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,800
He's ready.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,840
He's just stuck.

100
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,720
I'm going to induce.

101
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm 19.

102
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,000
He's ready.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,280
He's just stuck.

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,240
He's just stuck.

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,920
We need to prime the cannon and blast that baby on after.

106
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,040
I love that Ashley throws in the age, I'm 19.

107
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,840
So I'm a world-wise woman.

108
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
I know that he's just stuck.

109
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
He's just stuck.

110
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,720
I'm 19.

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,880
I'm not some kid, all right?

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm just a child.

113
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Screw you, I'm 19.

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,120
I can tell when a baby's stuck in my gully works.

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,920
All right, so that's where I'm at.

116
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,440
Anyway, those are our problems, but we don't need to stress you out about those.

117
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,880
I, once again, just to check in, have no problems.

118
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,640
No problems still on the Griffin front.

119
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,760
So let's help our listeners.

120
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Hey, brothers, I have a question.

121
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,440
Sometimes my friends and I will go to bars or restaurants.

122
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Like cool people.

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,240
Like cool people, a place to hang out and have fun like you do.

124
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,120
Problem is, oh my God, the smell.

125
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
The problem is one of my friends will often come along and then not order anything.

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I feel like this is rather rude to the establishment.

127
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Am I being weird and should just let it go?

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
If not, what should I do?

129
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,760
That's from Empty Cheers in Davis, CA.

130
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,960
I think that's Cal-a-rado.

131
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
Cal-a-rado.

132
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
I, man, you can...

133
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I worry so much about myself fucking up accidentally without meaning to all of the time

134
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,720
that if I extended that service to everybody in my immediate vicinity,

135
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,840
I don't know why I'm speaking in the hypothetical sense right now

136
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,480
because I do definitely do that and it kills me.

137
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,200
It's killing me.

138
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,640
It's killing me.

139
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,160
Do you know what's especially bad?

140
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,480
If you have a bar that you...

141
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,680
So for example, in Cincinnati, we go to Arnold's all the time.

142
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,640
It's like our theater bar.

143
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
It's where we hang out.

144
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,040
And so if a new person went and did something that I would think of as rude,

145
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,400
it would be so much more embarrassing because it's like, hey, this is our place.

146
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,240
Could you just be cool for two seconds and order some cheesy fries?

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,120
They know us here.

148
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,640
Be cool for five seconds.

149
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,960
Can you just order a hot brown, please?

150
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,000
Just get a hot Dubin, please, for the love of Jesus.

151
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,400
I feel like if you're just taking up a seat though, like a table with friends,

152
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
then that's not really that big of an issue.

153
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,480
I mean, just not ordering something, right?

154
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,440
I mean, the only person who's going to be aware of that is the server

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,760
if they're coming to the table.

156
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,480
And I don't know, that has to be mixed with some relief

157
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,120
that they don't have to do more work, right?

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,760
Well, I guess the question is, is it the same friend more than once?

159
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,560
Oh, okay.

160
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,280
You know, if like Tom always just sits there when you go to-

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
Thrifty Reggie.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,120
Yeah, Thrifty Reggie just sits there at Cheesy Steve's

163
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
and doesn't order the cheesy fries ever.

164
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,520
No, and if you go to Cheesy Steve's, you have to, I mean, it's basically a mandate.

165
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,840
Yeah, it's what they're known for.

166
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
It's the only thing on the menu.

167
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,120
Can I have a water?

168
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,600
No, no, you can't have a water.

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,360
I can blend down some cheesy fries for you.

170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
I guess, do we even have a blend?

171
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,920
No, we don't.

172
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,160
They do a beer, like a French onion soup,

173
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,800
and there's just like bread and cheese floating on top.

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,680
That's it?

175
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,360
We have a deep fat fryer and we got the cheese blaster.

176
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,800
And that's the only two instruments we got back.

177
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
We don't even have glasses.

178
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
We don't have glass in the windows.

179
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
This is a shitty place.

180
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
This is shitty.

181
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,880
I don't know why people keep coming here.

182
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Yeah, man, I wouldn't, there are so many.

183
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,640
I always think of it like there are so many worse things that you could do at a restaurant.

184
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,360
You could like, I was talking to a guy the other day about playing D&D here in Austin,

185
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,040
like where you find a group to do it, like where you find neutral ground to play it with strangers.

186
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,840
He told me he used to play with a group that used to go to a pizza place near our house,

187
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,440
and they would just post up in the pizza place and play through like three hours of a campaign.

188
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,200
And I was like, how were they fucking cool with that?

189
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
Like, cause you, those nerds are going to, you know, chomp down,

190
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,920
but they're not going to chomp down for three straight hours.

191
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,840
Well, here's how you're fucking cool with that.

192
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
If you show up between like two and five, you're fine.

193
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,600
If you order enough to justify being there, you're fine.

194
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
And then if you tip really well, you're fine.

195
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,520
Like, that's the thing.

196
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,760
If you think about being there for three hours, the amount of opportunities they have to come over

197
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,600
and like refill your drinks and like check on you and everything, you have to tip like 30, 35%.

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
But eventually you don't think the cashier is just like,

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm fucking sick of looking at these people.

200
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,400
Juicy, are you okay?

201
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,200
Did you pass out?

202
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,680
Oh shit.

203
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,880
Hey.

204
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
Hey, what happened?

205
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,160
I had to go empty out the litter box.

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,760
Oh my God, you actually did it.

207
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,640
Obama called and he said FEMA was going to have to start issuing housing vouchers to my neighbors.

208
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
If I didn't detain it.

209
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

210
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,360
Of course.

211
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
This Yahoo is sent in by Drew Davenport.

212
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,120
Thank you, Drew.

213
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
He has a lot of honorifics.

214
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,560
You know, some people are starting to get real jealous of Drew Davenport.

215
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Well guys, his game is super on point.

216
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,480
I wish Drew, could Drew do, would Drew be comfortable with going to our Facebook page

217
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
and just sharing some of his secrets?

218
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
I don't think he will.

219
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
I love Drew Davenport.

220
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:29,760
I think he is protecting his secrets the same way that Lex Luthor protects his, protects his-

221
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
The location of Scriptonite.

222
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Let me just, I'll just do that for you and-

223
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,320
That worked.

224
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,880
That worked great.

225
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,360
Hit me.

226
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,720
Drew Davenport, thank you, is asked by Yahoo Answers user Sophie who asks,

227
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,680
is it weird?

228
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,080
I prefer this type of acting.

229
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,800
Huh?

230
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,240
My friends like the whole Hayden Christensen lightsaber fighting, jumping about,

231
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
trying to be cool and intimidating.

232
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Yet I prefer the Marlon Brando Godfather.

233
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,000
I think Brando sat in the big chair is so much cooler and I find it intimidating as well.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,600
I mean, who is the better actor?

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
Hayden Christensen or Marlon Brando?

236
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,720
Ooh, taking a bold stance.

237
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:18,080
Is it, is it, is it weird that I prefer Marlon Brando to Hayden Christensen?

238
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,400
Now I know he's a little indie, little known actor that not a lot of people have heard of,

239
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,440
but I think that that Marlon Brando's got chops.

240
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,200
I guess, but does he have Hayden Christensen chops?

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
Listen, who does?

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm just saying like, it doesn't even, like you gotta scale it different.

243
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,400
You know what I mean?

244
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Like Brando is the best of like the Brandos.

245
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,840
You know what I mean?

246
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,560
Is he going to be able to break into the like Christensen levels?

247
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
No, no, of course not.

248
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
But what he does with what he's got is very impressive.

249
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,960
I guess I look forward to his new stuff.

250
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,680
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,200
He'll never hit that Orlando Bloom echelon, right?

252
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,840
Oh God, no.

253
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
He's, he's clearly not going to Bloom.

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
He's never going to Christensen.

255
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,800
That's it, I mean, I'm, I have an internal debate that I argue about with myself every day

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,000
of Christensen or Bloom.

257
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
Brando doesn't even fucking factor into the equation.

258
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,400
You know who the wild card is?

259
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,240
The wild card is Ewan McGregor because he, I think he can straddle,

260
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,400
but he does the lightsaber fights.

261
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Like, so he's hitting that level and he's a big fish.

262
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,160
And he's big fishing.

263
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,640
You know what I mean?

264
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,360
He's big fishing.

265
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
The problem is what sort of muddies these waters.

266
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,400
That the big fish live in.

267
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:30,720
Go on.

268
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,400
The big fish live in is that Marlon Brando was so good in Star Wars.

269
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,520
Who will ever forget that classic scene of him standing in the rains of Endor

270
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,920
in his white wife beater and his face twisted up in anguish and just shouting Star Wars.

271
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,240
I'll never forget that scene.

272
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
I liked it Star Wars when his giant floating head appeared to Luke and said,

273
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,840
I am your father.

274
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,960
So check, check out this fortress of solitude I made for you.

275
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
I thought, whoa, wait a minute.

276
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,040
Wait, huh?

277
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
There, there are some unexpected crossover here.

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,800
I thought it was weird when for like, just like it jumped from like a lightsaber fight

279
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,320
in the middle of the Death Star.

280
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,200
And then inexplicably he was an old man and he died.

281
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,800
He died in a garden while his, his grandson watched him die.

282
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
And then his grandson grew up to be Boba Fett.

283
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,880
Mm-hmm.

284
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
I love that one scene where he's just flopping around with his big silly head.

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,280
And he's like, Misa could have been a contender.

286
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,760
Uh-huh.

287
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,280
Yeah, that was a good one too.

288
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh man.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
But how does, how does he stack up to Hayden?

290
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
There's a reason he wasn't young Vader.

291
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,640
You know?

292
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,120
Cause like he did, he, whenever Cass, I don't know if you guys know about how big Hollywood

293
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,960
works and Travis, I guess you should learn about this since you're about to be a fucking

294
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,840
cog in that, that horrible machine.

295
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,400
But casting directors, when they cast parts, they're basically ranking who the best actor

296
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,440
is, right?

297
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,240
So if, if Marlon Brando had been better than Hayden Christensen, he would have been young

298
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Vader.

299
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,560
He would have been grown up Anakin.

300
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
He would have been fucking necking with Natalie Portman.

301
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
I have a question though, Griffin.

302
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,800
How do they do, if, if one actor is the best actor, they call them first, right?

303
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,160
In the ranking systems.

304
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,400
How do they decide which part to fill?

305
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,120
How do you make the system so that the best actor doesn't get all the parts?

306
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
You go top down.

307
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,840
Is that what happened?

308
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,560
Well, that's what I'm saying.

309
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,200
Some casting directors get creative about it.

310
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,720
For instance, um, the Nutty Professor.

311
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,040
Yep.

312
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,360
They said, how can we fucking choose?

313
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,000
He would slot into any of these parts perfectly.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,760
We have a lot of people on retainer that we could get, but is our, tell me, I'm going

315
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,480
to meet with our CGI team and see what they can do.

316
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,920
And then the CGI team was like, of course we can multiply him.

317
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,360
Multiplicity, same thing.

318
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,000
Same deal.

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,200
It was not supposed to be Michael Keaton in all of those roles, which is confusing because

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,720
it's supposed to be clones, right?

321
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:04,960
Right.

322
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,200
Um, but the, the CGI tech wasn't good enough back then.

323
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,240
It was originally going to be Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Chris Bale.

324
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,400
I think that's what happened in the social network, right?

325
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,280
It's like they hired two dudes to play the twins and then they said, oh my God,

326
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,320
Armie Hammer is the greatest actor of our generation.

327
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
We're going to clone him.

328
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,080
That's what's great.

329
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,760
It, you know, they didn't do that in the CGI.

330
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,160
The CGI, um, wasn't good enough for, for their standards.

331
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,760
So if you look, if you actually watch the movie, if you pause it and jump forward like

332
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,320
a frame at a time, you can tell it's actually, that's just one shot, right?

333
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
And Armie Hammer is just moving very quickly.

334
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:47,440
Oh, he's just cause a film, a film is displayed in 60 frames per second.

335
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
So he is, uh, 120 times per second moving to the left and right.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,760
And it's just him.

337
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,880
If you, if you look at his, uh, special skills sheet under his, uh, resume on the back of

338
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:04,320
his headshot, it's like juggling some Spanish hyper-frame shifting.

339
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah.

340
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,600
Face, face stepping.

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,120
And he draws, draws a picture of like a lightning bolt next to it on every resume.

342
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,480
Just to, just to heighten it, I guess, or to make it seem more special.

343
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,600
There's a lot of actors that can do that.

344
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,200
Is that why you put the smiley face stickers on there?

345
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,080
No, yeah.

346
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm a super good actor.

347
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
A number one.

348
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,520
And then he puts a scratch and sniff sticker that smells like he does.

349
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I will come to set every day, guarantee.

350
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,320
Guarantee to smell like this.

351
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,120
The Armie Hammer guarantee is that I will smell like this every day.

352
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,720
This is my agent, Armie Hammer.

353
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,320
How about another question?

354
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,680
I feel like we did really good on that one.

355
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Hey brothers.

356
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
So I'll get straight to the point.

357
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,280
I've been dating this guy I was friends with for about three months now.

358
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,320
Nothing official yet.

359
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,320
But anyways, while on a date, he randomly brings up a gift bag with a handmade purse made for me.

360
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,120
It's one of those jean bags you make out of cutting the legs off of some jeans.

361
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,520
It's super sweet.

362
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
I really appreciate the sentiment.

363
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,600
Is it really my style?

364
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,080
No.

365
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,600
So the question is, when would be an appropriate situation to use the bag?

366
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,440
Thanks so much.

367
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,240
Huge fan muddled in Mexico.

368
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,120
I think when you need to transport a disembodied butt, that would be a good place to put that.

369
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,320
I love that when I read this question going through the emails, for some reason,

370
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,120
now it makes sense to me that you cut the legs off all the way like at, you know, the hip.

371
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,400
So it just forms the back.

372
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,680
You dumb bastard.

373
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,200
Cutting it like jorts.

374
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,040
And so like you could put like stuff in one leg or in the other one.

375
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:35,360
Yeah.

376
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,080
Yeah, which leg do I keep my chapstick in?

377
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,880
I bet the punctuation on this is after he gave her the bag,

378
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
he stood up to reveal that he was just wearing jean chaps.

379
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,080
Is it possible you were friends with him?

380
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,760
Is it possible he's fucking with you?

381
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,080
I mean, and he was like, I know this isn't your style.

382
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,600
Like he knew it wasn't your style.

383
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,880
And he was like, oh, this is ironic.

384
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,920
This is funny because she wouldn't normally carry this kind of thing.

385
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm going to give it to her and see how she reacts.

386
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,240
I think she'll laugh about it.

387
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,320
She probably saw like a, he probably saw like a BuzzFeed post of like easy craft gifts that

388
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,720
you can make for a new girlfriend.

389
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,920
And then for some reason, the demented author of that terrible post wrote cut, make a purse,

390
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,880
make a butt purse.

391
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,360
That's what it is.

392
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,000
It's a button.

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,040
I don't want to mince words.

394
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,320
It's a butt purse.

395
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
It's a butt purse in a thing that butts go in.

396
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,480
Typically.

397
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,440
Listen, I, if you're really serious about this fella,

398
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
I think you need to adjust your style because there is no guarantee that you're not going

399
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,680
to keep receiving handmade jean gifts.

400
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,240
Yeah.

401
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,320
A lot of, you know, there are a lot of ladies out there that would just go crazy for some

402
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
handmade jean gifts.

403
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,480
No, no, Justin.

404
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,120
I'm going to disagree with you slightly.

405
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,560
And that I'm going to disagree with you completely.

406
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,800
Okay.

407
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,760
So not like a little bit, like the whole.

408
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
Yeah, like a hundred percent, 180.

409
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,040
Whole enchilada.

410
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,320
One direction, two directions.

411
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,960
Yeah.

412
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,800
And I think that that's this early on in the, they've only been going out three months.

413
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,200
I think that this is kind of a scattershot approach to see what she likes.

414
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
And it's an opportunity to be like, okay, gave her the purse.

415
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,680
She's not using that.

416
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:15,920
Okay.

417
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,440
So I'll scratch that off.

418
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,240
That's a weird.

419
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
Some scented oils.

420
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
That's a weird baseline.

421
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,640
When you're trying to like figure out what your new lover loves, you start with a butt

422
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,040
bag.

423
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,320
No, no.

424
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
It is a huge jump.

425
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,880
You should work backwards.

426
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
It's like if you play, guess who?

427
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,920
And it's like, do they look like they're hiding some sadness?

428
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,120
And that's like your first question.

429
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,760
And guess who?

430
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
Not are they a man or woman?

431
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
Do they have glasses?

432
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
Well, but imagine, okay.

433
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,800
If you say, do they have glasses?

434
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,000
And the answer is yes, which by the way, who the fuck picks someone with glasses for that

435
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
very risk.

436
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,360
But if the answer is yes, you've just narrowed it down.

437
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,840
If you give butt purse and she's like, I love the butt purse.

438
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,640
I love butt purse.

439
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,800
You know everything about that person.

440
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,760
Nailed it in one.

441
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,480
Yeah.

442
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:00,720
Yeah.

443
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,080
It's a good point trap.

444
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a, listen, it's a risky gambit.

445
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,880
I know that, but if it lands, if it lands, you're set.

446
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,200
You are set.

447
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
Butt purses for life.

448
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,000
Is it possible that this person has a, like a blossom fetish?

449
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,040
Hey, why don't you wear this floppy hat tonight?

450
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,680
Just wear this.

451
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,040
I'm going to also wear a weird hat and I'm going to talk very fast.

452
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,160
And we are going to make love.

453
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,400
Whoa.

454
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,880
I don't know, man.

455
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,120
Can you use it for like, maybe like a diaper bag in the far, in the far future?

456
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,040
That might be okay.

457
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,800
Cause that's kind of like putting butts in a bag.

458
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,160
You could use it for like, if you go on a trip and you want to like have stuff in the car.

459
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,880
So like he'll see it, but no one else ever will.

460
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,240
You could use it somewhere where you think there's a high probability of being mugged.

461
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,440
Yeah.

462
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,800
Give me everything in the bag.

463
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,600
No, please.

464
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,680
Let me simplify this for you.

465
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,480
Take my, take my heart, take my legs.

466
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,760
Legs.

467
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
Not my, not my special butt bag for my lover.

468
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,760
It could be a theft deterrent where it's like, give me your purse.

469
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
Wait, no, nevermind.

470
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,280
Bye.

471
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,640
Okay, fine.

472
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,120
All right, fine.

473
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,520
You win.

474
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
I'll just take all the things inside the bag and you can keep, uh, you shh.

475
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,400
I got a lot of stuff in here.

476
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,200
You only got two hands.

477
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
It's going to be a lot more convenient.

478
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
Take the bag, take the butt bag.

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,880
Please take the butt bag.

480
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,080
I guess you could call it a fanny pack.

481
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,200
Oh, good.

482
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,120
Just what this bit needed, Travis.

483
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,720
A fanny pack.

484
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Start again.

485
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,320
I'm lost.

486
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

487
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,120
So like he's saying-

488
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,760
My coworkers are constantly going out to eat for lunch.

489
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,600
I try not to usually do to costs and health reasons, but they aren't, but they are always

490
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
offering to pay or seeming super disappointed when I turn them down.

491
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,520
While I appreciate their generosity, the guilt I'm saddled with after receiving a lot of free

492
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,160
meals isn't exactly pleasant either.

493
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,600
And I often can't afford to pay for a meal in return.

494
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,280
How do I mitigate this situation?

495
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,080
My wallet, conscience, and waistline are all on the line here.

496
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,160
And that's from Treated in Tucky.

497
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,880
That's good.

498
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,600
I like that.

499
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,240
Um, tell them to fucking who, why does somebody care so much about what you're eating all the

500
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,800
time?

501
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,840
You have to go.

502
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
But they feel guilty.

503
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,200
They don't want to have to listen.

504
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,120
They don't want to get free rides from their coworkers.

505
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,000
That's uncomfortable.

506
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,880
I get that.

507
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
But they also don't want to fucking pay for bottomless apps at TGI Fridays.

508
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,120
Every fucking day of their life.

509
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,320
Okay.

510
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,520
But what it sounds like to me is that idea of them like saying, whoop, hey, come on,

511
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,760
is that they see it as a very social, like team building thing.

512
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,560
Right.

513
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,160
And like, they don't want you to feel left out.

514
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,960
They're trying to like make you feel included.

515
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,320
Whereas you're looking at like, nah, I'm happy to hang out.

516
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,400
I just don't want to go out to eat every day, which makes total sense to me.

517
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,240
This sounds to me suspiciously like a free introductory offer.

518
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,520
I feel like you're going to get there, enjoy some like bottomless French onion soup or

519
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,240
something.

520
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
And then at the end they think, boy, it wasn't this fun.

521
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,080
We're, we're happy to pay this time, but I feel like we could really keep these good

522
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,640
times going.

523
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,000
If we could just get you to commit to six meals per month and get on this timeshare

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,960
at TGI, this TGI Friday timeshare with us, then we think that this could really be the

525
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,840
start of something big.

526
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,080
Two weeks out of every year, this appetizer plate could be yours.

527
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
This could be your appetizer plate.

528
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,760
The other 50 weeks, people are going to touch it.

529
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,120
And that's not great.

530
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,760
I'll be honest.

531
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,520
I don't love that part of the arrangement.

532
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,600
Can you brown bag it every day, but make it look special?

533
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,960
Ooh.

534
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,360
Ooh.

535
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,560
Tell them like a sick family member made like, my nanny made me, I can't say nanny, my nana

536
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,960
made me like the sandwich that I feel so guilty.

537
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,840
My adult nanny, my adult babysitter made this for me.

538
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,560
She's very sick.

539
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
Poppins would be really disappointed.

540
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,040
That's going to work for, that's going to work for a week, Traff.

541
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,240
That's not a long-term solution.

542
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Cause after four months, you're like, yeah, nanny, my adult babysitter is still pretty

543
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,640
sick.

544
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,280
So I better, no, then you have to dress up as the babysitter and come into work and be

545
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,840
like, oh, he doesn't want to go out to lunch with you.

546
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,840
Michael, I can't help but notice my special lunch remains uneaten here.

547
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,240
Oh man.

548
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,040
Can you go to the, okay.

549
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,440
Okay.

550
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:25,680
Okay.

551
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:25,920
Okay.

552
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,240
Okay.

553
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,200
Okay.

554
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,080
You go to the bathroom, you dress up as your adult nanny, Mrs.

555
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:40,160
Doubtfire too, and then you carry a brown bag lunch in and put it on your desk and maybe

556
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,680
loudly announce, oh, I was so delighted to make this.

557
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,160
I sure hope Michael enjoys it.

558
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,800
Lunch, lunch time for my little piggy.

559
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,080
Where is that sweet piggy?

560
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,880
I never seem to see him around.

561
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,120
Have you ever noticed how you never see us in the same place at the same time?

562
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,440
Well, I need to go shit.

563
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm going to go shit for five minutes.

564
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,240
I had some bad Mexican food at that restaurant you're always trying to get Michael to go

565
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,400
to.

566
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,520
You might expect me to leave at the front door.

567
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,880
I ate there once in 1987 and haven't stopped shitting since.

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,360
Goodbye.

569
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,560
I'm going to go climb out the bathroom window.

570
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
Have you guys ever noticed how Michael's adult nanny, Mrs.

571
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,720
Doubtfire too, seems to only enter and exit the building via the men's bathroom?

572
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,120
I just went in the men's bathroom and I just saw her clothes lying on the ground.

573
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
I think she shit herself out of her body.

574
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,120
Is this the start of Left Behind?

575
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,720
Has Mrs. Doubtfire too been raptured?

576
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,520
Oh, man.

577
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,400
I think that'll work.

578
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,760
Yep.

579
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,280
I know we were joking, but now I'm like ruminating on and I think that'll actually be great.

580
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,800
I think it makes a lot of sense.

581
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,000
Should we go to the money zone?

582
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:11,280
I want to, yes.

583
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,000
Listen, you tried Hulu on your computer.

584
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,120
Everybody has.

585
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,400
Check out this crazy video.

586
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,040
You won't believe it.

587
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,760
It's on Hulu.

588
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,840
But Hulu Plus is like that, but better.

589
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,320
They've got all the current season episodes of your favorite shows like Modern Family,

590
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,120
The Daily Show, all that good stuff.

591
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,840
And they've got some series every episode like South Park, and it's just exclusively

592
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,320
available through Hulu Plus every episode of South Park, believe it or not.

593
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,160
There's tons of ways you can watch Hulu Plus.

594
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,520
There's Apple TV, Roku, on your smart TV, whatever, however you want to do it.

595
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,880
What's awesome is they have new stuff and they also have tons of like old shows that

596
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
you're not going to find anywhere else.

597
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,120
I'm really excited because they have a show called The Supersizers Go that Teresa and

598
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
I just love and for a long time we couldn't find it anywhere.

599
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,280
Oh, did they add that?

600
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,400
It's on Hulu Plus.

601
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Yeah, it's amazing.

602
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,920
They have episodes of QI with Steven with Steven.

603
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,800
Yeah, they have Penn and Teller's bullshit like every episode.

604
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,160
It's really amazing.

605
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,360
So it's not only worth it to keep up with new stuff, but you're going to find stuff

606
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,880
on there that you're not going to find anywhere else.

607
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,320
They also got original stuff they got.

608
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,440
There's a new season of The Awesomes, the cartoon from Seth Meyers.

609
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,200
You might know him from late night television.

610
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,400
They have all 10 episodes of the first season so you can get prepped for that new joint on

611
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,360
August 4th.

612
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,880
Listen, this is $8 a month and that is very, very reasonable for the amount of stuff you're

613
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
getting, but we can give you a two week free trial.

614
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,880
Just go to huluplus.com slash my brother, huluplus.com slash my brother.

615
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,840
I can't stress enough, it's important that you use that code because that says like,

616
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,960
hey, my brother, my brother, it's worth it.

617
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,040
Yeah, they'll keep giving us money also, which is like that.

618
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,520
I'll be honest.

619
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,240
That's what I like.

620
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,280
I like that part.

621
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,480
I like money, too.

622
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,040
And if you want money, you know the best way to get it.

623
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,720
Coding.

624
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,680
That's right.

625
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,520
Coding has become the most desired job skill of 2014.

626
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,040
Man, do you mean coating like you would put something onto something covered in chocolate?

627
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,000
No, coding like bits and bytes and boops and bleeps.

628
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,480
Coding.

629
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,720
And the easiest way to learn coding, in our opinion, my opinion, is one month HTML.

630
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,560
It's the easiest way to learn to build websites.

631
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,160
What you do is you guarantee them 30 minutes a day for 30 days.

632
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,800
And you know what?

633
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,920
Most of the lessons, you don't even have to do 30 minutes.

634
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,280
Justin, you've been doing it, right?

635
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,680
I have.

636
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,400
I'm halfway through one month HTML.

637
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,800
You have an actual website built day one.

638
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,840
You build something.

639
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,120
Are you ready to drop that URL on the air?

640
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes.

641
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:50,720
Oh, yes.

642
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,360
Thank you, Griffin.

643
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,560
If you go to JustinMcElroy.net, you will be able to see my personal website that I built

644
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,720
with one month HTML.

645
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,920
It's got everything.

646
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
It's got photos.

647
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,360
It's got video.

648
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,720
It's got links.

649
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,720
It's like the Hayden Christensen of websites.

650
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,800
It's got fun flash games for children.

651
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,320
It's got everything.

652
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,280
And there's a community of 12,000 people, other students, learning online.

653
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,960
And the cool thing, I finished this project, this website, and I sent it in.

654
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
You know, it is a correspondence course, but you do get a lot of feedback.

655
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,760
I sent in my website, and they actually sent back like a five minute long video where they

656
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,960
just sort of walked through my code and made some suggestions for things that I could tweak

657
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,360
and fix.

658
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,080
That's awesome.

659
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
Yeah, it's incredible.

660
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,440
And they've got a lot of other courses.

661
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,840
They've got one month rails and other.

662
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,760
That's the one I'm going to dip into that, I think.

663
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,260
Yeah.

664
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,740
I've learned Ruby on Rails and a lot of other stuff.

665
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:54,820
You can go to onemonth.com slash my brother and get 25% off of one of these courses.

666
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,860
That's a pretty great deal.

667
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,580
So one month HTML, 30 minutes a day for 30 days, and you will learn one of these programming

668
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,420
languages and you will be a lot more valuable as an employee.

669
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,220
And you get a one time 25% discount on your class if you go to onemonth.com slash my brother.

670
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,340
Justin, I have to warn you.

671
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,220
Lesson I learned the other day, don't ever tweet about what you think about a coding

672
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,980
language because I tweeted about PHP and how confusing I thought it was.

673
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,900
I started a fucking firestorm.

674
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,740
I did not know that.

675
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,420
I mean, apparently coding languages are the new like Sega and Nintendo argument from the

676
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:34,980
early 90s.

677
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,300
Really?

678
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,260
A lot of people want to weigh in on that.

679
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,340
A lot of people are like, yeah, PHP is dirt.

680
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,300
A lot of people are like, my dad is made out of PHP.

681
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,980
Like it got fucking it got fucking real in my Twitter feed.

682
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:51,140
Hypothetically, is there a video or website one could go to to find out what any of this

683
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,460
means?

684
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,580
I mean, just like say someone were really bad at interneting, right?

685
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,980
No, I think that's all I think that's what one month is.

686
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,860
You start starting.

687
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,140
I have to go to there.

688
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,380
Yeah.

689
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,860
I have a message for Samuel Kay from Mallory who says it's not your birthday, but I didn't

690
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,900
want to wait six goddamn months to wish you a good one.

691
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,860
Here's to many more Let's Plays and anime podcasts, anime podcasts, sorry, together

692
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:24,100
in the coming years and rest assured in the very distant future when you finally kick

693
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,300
the bucket, I'll skin you, wear you like a coat and play an elaborately cruel prank

694
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,260
on your loved ones.

695
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,140
Hail Satan.

696
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,460
Everything about this makes this one of the top 10 money zone spots we've ever had.

697
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,340
Yeah, no, that's really good.

698
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,860
And I tell you why, she has a very comprehensive plan for Samuel for his whole life.

699
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,780
And that's a true friend right there.

700
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,660
I also love it when people can't wait to give us money.

701
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,420
I can't.

702
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,180
You know, she's going to come right back around.

703
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,060
That's the thing about money zone.

704
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,420
Like first taste, you know, it's like you get a taste for it.

705
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,620
You won't even have anything to say.

706
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,780
Like that dude last week, he was like, hit me up on my Moby.

707
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,820
It was like, I don't actually want to say this.

708
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,820
I just want to keep giving the McRoy brothers money.

709
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,780
Can you stop?

710
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,460
Can you not edit the greatest money zone message ever, please?

711
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,020
What was it?

712
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,900
Thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

713
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,420
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

714
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,140
So good.

715
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,340
That is the mark.

716
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,060
I got to say, Mallory, you came awfully close.

717
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,420
Solo wit.

718
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,820
Let's see if Vincent Longa can dethrone.

719
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:32,100
And I got a message for Alicia Longa.

720
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:32,660
Okay.

721
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,020
So they're obviously related.

722
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,820
Some fashion.

723
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,700
Let's dig a little.

724
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,220
Let's crack this mystery with the next sentence right below.

725
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,380
Happy Dirty 30, my lovely wife.

726
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,060
You got me a Vita for my bday.

727
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:50,500
So I got the brothers McRoy to say happy bday to you on our favorite podcast,

728
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,380
which I feel is better than last year's evening at Medieval Times.

729
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:55,860
Disagree.

730
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,300
Incorrect.

731
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,740
Medieval Times is the greatest restaurant that's ever existed.

732
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,260
Here's to another awesome year.

733
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,980
And remember, just because it's your birthday doesn't mean

734
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,780
you can put your finger in my belly button hole.

735
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,460
Gross.

736
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,900
That's happy bday.

737
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,780
Happy bday.

738
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,380
Don't put your finger in there.

739
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,060
It's where, like, all of your parasites go to chill.

740
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,820
It's like a hot tub for your body's billion parasites.

741
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,340
So maybe just think about that.

742
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,260
Congratulations on the Vita, though.

743
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,700
So it's a nice little platform.

744
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,380
Why don't you guys go to Medieval Times?

745
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,060
If there's a Medieval Times close to you,

746
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,380
you should be there every day supporting the Green Knight.

747
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,180
Yeah, you're a Green Knight, man.

748
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,700
Oh, God. All day long.

749
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,420
All day, every day.

750
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,780
It's the only sport I care about.

751
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,540
If they televised Medieval Times, oof.

752
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,220
Basically, the only thing I want to do with my life

753
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,300
is go to Medieval Times, and it's never happened.

754
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,020
You've never been?

755
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,420
When I say that sometimes, and people think it's like,

756
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,940
when I said I really wanted to go to the Jekyll and Hyde Club in New York,

757
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
and everybody thought, like, oh, how fun and ironic.

758
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,700
Like, no, you don't know me at all.

759
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,580
You don't get it.

760
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,380
You don't get me.

761
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,020
God, when we do our live shows, we have to go to one of our Medieval Times.

762
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,260
Can we rent out the whole Medieval Times?

763
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,380
And will they let us knight?

764
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,460
Can we knight it up?

765
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,980
I don't want to knight.

766
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,180
Yes, you do.

767
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,180
Look deep within yourself.

768
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,620
I was just Googling Green Knight

769
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,020
because I thought it was the name of the Martin Lawrence film.

770
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,660
But no, of course that was Black Knight was the name of that film.

771
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,540
And I fucked that up.

772
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,620
I fucked that up right proper.

773
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,860
Yeah, not good work there.

774
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,580
This is Biz.

775
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,460
And I'm Teresa.

776
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,860
And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

777
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,860
Not a parenting podcast.

778
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:34,740
Guess what?

779
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,340
We both just had babies.

780
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,300
Again.

781
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,180
Check out the show enjoyed by breeders and ballers alike on iTunes or MaximumFun.org.

782
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,380
Listen, guys, how about another Yahoo?

783
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,300
I feel like we've only had one this episode.

784
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,340
You feel like that because we did.

785
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:57,620
It did, but this Yahoo is sent in by level 466 Yahoo Shaman Drew Davenport.

786
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,300
Thank you.

787
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,300
Can we just start calling them Yajurus?

788
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:07,060
Yajurus, if it's not from, as long as it's from Drew, let's just call them Yajurus.

789
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,220
Okay, this Yajuru was asked by Yahoo answers user Leia, who asks.

790
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,460
Oh, fuck.

791
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,220
Fuck, is lava real?

792
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,860
I've just finished watching the film Shrek.

793
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,340
And there was a scene in the movie where there was a dragon and lava.

794
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,700
And I was just wondering if you can get lava in real life.

795
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,460
Also, are Shrek slash Ogres real?

796
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,580
Okay, this isn't a crazy question.

797
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,220
Lava does seem very weird.

798
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,980
Yeah, let me ask both of you.

799
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,420
Y'all ever seen lava?

800
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,300
I have not.

801
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,500
I have not seen lava.

802
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:46,900
Travis?

803
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,100
I've seen it on like the TV.

804
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,140
Oh, fuck, no.

805
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,820
Have you felt it's radiant heat?

806
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,420
No.

807
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,940
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

808
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,140
Could be Hollywood bullshit.

809
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,300
Now, Griffin, to be fair, there's lots of things I've never seen in real life.

810
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,060
But lava seems kind of fantastical, right?

811
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,580
They say it's rock.

812
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,420
I ain't never seen a fucking rock move like that.

813
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,700
It's a plasma, isn't it?

814
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,460
It falls within that category.

815
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,780
I think it's a plasmoid.

816
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,660
It's a plasmid.

817
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,020
It's a plasmid.

818
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,780
It is a plasmid.

819
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,460
There are times where I'll get confused on issues like this.

820
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,980
I will sometimes forget, and please don't make fun,

821
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,580
but I will sometimes forget if unicorns are real or not.

822
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,700
Not to say that there are unicorns today,

823
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:35,540
but I will sometimes have brief moments where I try to remember

824
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,260
if that is a historical animal that is no longer extant

825
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,220
or if it is, you know.

826
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,180
Now, Justin, in your defense, here's the thing.

827
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:51,700
A horse with a horn on its head versus a giant 40-foot tall dinosaur

828
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,340
with giant sharp teeth and huge...

829
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:57,540
It's like, which one's a little bit more believable that it actually existed?

830
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,500
Yeah, we have horses with horns on their head.

831
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,340
They're called deer and moose.

832
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:02,660
Yeah.

833
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,060
That's very believable to me.

834
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,900
But that's what's always crazy if I might lay my cards on the table.

835
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,380
Yeah.

836
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,620
People, dinosaurs, totally accept it.

837
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,980
You talk about dragons and everyone's like,

838
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,620
ha ha ha, this guy and dragons.

839
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,300
Yeah, guess what a pterodactyl was?

840
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,340
A fucking dragon.

841
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,900
It's a dragon.

842
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,780
Yeah, it's a fucking dragon right there.

843
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,740
How about narwhals?

844
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,060
Like, narwhals are whales with unicorn horns.

845
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,560
Uh-huh.

846
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,900
Why is it so preposterous to think that unicorns may have been around?

847
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,120
Yeah.

848
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,660
A bigfoot is just like a gorilla person.

849
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah, that can happen.

850
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,060
Yeah, that can happen.

851
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:39,140
A super hairy dude loses his fucking mind and wanders into the forest.

852
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,620
What's up?

853
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,260
That's a bigfoot.

854
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,700
I don't give a fuck what you want to call it.

855
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,340
Now it's a bigfoot.

856
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,780
Now you are a bigfoot.

857
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,100
A long-nosed monster was a plesiosaurus.

858
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,660
You get a super tall goat that only has the one horn.

859
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:52,500
I don't care what the fuck you like scientifically.

860
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,300
That's a phylum korygongan.

861
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,220
No, that's a fucking unicorn.

862
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,620
I don't need to like splice its fucking DNA and be like,

863
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,500
oh, that G and C are next to that A, so that's not a unicorn.

864
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,340
It's clearly the goat phylum.

865
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,060
No, that's a-

866
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,900
You know there's a fish with arms?

867
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:09,960
Yeah.

868
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,020
That's a mermaid, guys.

869
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,780
Yeah, that is a mermaid.

870
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,940
I mean, like, alligator, basically, is a-

871
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,380
Have you ever seen an okapi?

872
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:17,700
Yeah.

873
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,420
Okapi?

874
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:18,980
Yeah.

875
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,500
It looks like two animals put together.

876
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,500
That right there is a griffin, my man.

877
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,300
That's a griffin.

878
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,700
So deal with that.

879
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,220
But fucking liquid hot rocks?

880
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,700
No way!

881
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,740
That's unbelievable.

882
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,620
That's crazy.

883
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,060
Hi, I've seen rocks before.

884
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,780
They're hard and cold.

885
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,020
They're super, super hard.

886
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,900
And cold.

887
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,700
I got a-

888
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,460
Sometimes they're liquid and really hot.

889
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,260
Nah, sorry.

890
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,940
I went over to a buddy of mine, his house.

891
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:48,100
He made a hot rock out of like a big old smooth rock

892
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,220
and he put it on some rock salt and put that in the oven

893
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,660
and then we cooked wagyu beef on it.

894
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,700
And what the weirdest thing is, when that rock came out of the oven,

895
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,540
it wasn't a liquid, what?

896
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,260
You know, I've gone down in the caves before

897
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,540
and you know what they are?

898
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:01,860
Cold.

899
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,420
They're super cold.

900
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,380
It's cold in there.

901
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:03,780
It's weird.

902
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,740
It's like the low you get.

903
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,780
You go down into the earth, it's cold.

904
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,380
It's almost like heat rises.

905
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,220
Griffin put a-

906
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,820
Okay, if you want to get something-

907
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:14,020
Griffin put a rock into the hottest thing that there is

908
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,420
because if you want to get something hot,

909
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,420
there's only one thing you turn to, it's the oven.

910
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,500
So nothing can get anything hotter than an oven.

911
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,940
Yeah, they used to call it a microwave

912
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:23,380
because it's called a microwave oven.

913
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:24,020
Yeah, right.

914
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,980
They used to just call it a hotter because that's what it is.

915
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,100
It's the hottest way you can hot something is that.

916
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,340
So he did that and then he put a rock in there

917
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,220
and it didn't melt.

918
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,100
So I don't know.

919
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,500
You tell me where we're at.

920
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:36,980
Science.

921
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,020
It's weird.

922
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,780
You think you're hot shit.

923
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,740
You know what's hot shit?

924
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,460
The oven.

925
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,740
The oven is hot, okay?

926
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,940
So let's talk about Mike Myers for a second.

927
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,900
He's kind of let himself go, right?

928
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,700
And at that point, like I know it was a movie role

929
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,300
and it was Hollywood magic

930
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,660
and then that movie wasn't technically live action.

931
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,060
Technically, like there were human voices behind it.

932
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,860
Fine, whatever.

933
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,300
They looked human enough to me.

934
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,060
At what point is Mike Myers stopping Mike Myers

935
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,980
and start being Shrek, you know?

936
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,500
He's done fucking nine of those now.

937
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,220
He has spent, listen, the amount of time that goes in

938
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,100
to recording those movies,

939
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,620
he has spent more time being Shrek

940
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,780
than he has not being Shrek, right?

941
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,060
From what I've read on BuzzFeed,

942
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,340
he's really hard to work with.

943
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,900
So I guess you could say he's a bit of an ogre.

944
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:25,380
Yeah.

945
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Yeah, food for thought.

946
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,580
Why doesn't Mike Myers do movies anymore?

947
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,780
Cause he's an ogre.

948
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,340
He's an ogre.

949
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,300
He's big and green.

950
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,180
He only likes like playing with like earwax and stuff.

951
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,940
It's been a while since I've seen the Shrek films.

952
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,620
Mike, we're big fans.

953
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,980
Mike, I love your work.

954
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,780
Thank you for listening.

955
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,540
Please don't eat my bones.

956
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,340
Also, I've seen the trailer of Love Guru like 30 times.

957
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:48,580
Yeah.

958
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,940
Can't bring myself to watch the movie,

959
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,140
but I'm kind of obsessed with it.

960
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,860
It's a shame, right?

961
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,620
Cause it's his last human movie.

962
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,540
You can already see the transformation beginning.

963
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,180
They try to cover it up with prosthetics, but no.

964
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,380
No, he got-

965
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,260
Can't hide his nature.

966
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,180
He's got little wiggly funnels up there.

967
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,780
I work at a small local restaurant.

968
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,700
One of my coworkers doesn't wear deodorant.

969
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,020
Oh.

970
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:11,300
He says that he doesn't want all those chemicals in his body

971
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,300
and I don't want to smell like a mall.

972
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,500
I want to smell like a mall.

973
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,860
I don't want to smell like a mall?

974
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,140
A mall.

975
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,460
Oh, does he mean like Hollister and like Abercrombie and Fit

976
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,100
and they like-

977
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,660
Exactly.

978
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,060
Okay.

979
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,980
Brands and commercialism, right?

980
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,740
He wants to smell like a man.

981
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,460
Like Doody.

982
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,500
Like a dirt man.

983
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,860
Like a Doody man.

984
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,780
His body odor gets pretty bad.

985
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,060
Yeah, I think that's connected.

986
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,100
And I'm pretty sure customers notice.

987
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,420
How do I help him realize that he needs to stop

988
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,500
trying to pull off the McConaughey

989
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,580
and utilize some smell goods?

990
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,300
That's from smelling bad in San Antonio.

991
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,780
Okay.

992
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,100
Let me, wait, I just realized something.

993
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,460
I didn't realize this putting together,

994
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,780
but do you ever notice that sometimes without meaning to

995
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,300
we have like theme episodes

996
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,300
and this is the third question about a restaurant.

997
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,460
That is restaurant life.

998
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,540
We got a lot of restaurant questions.

999
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,220
Can I just get out in front of this and say, I get it.

1000
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,780
And like, I've known people who did not use deodorant

1001
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,660
because maybe they have like super sensitive skin down there.

1002
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,980
Notice he's using the past tense, by the way, folks.

1003
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:10,900
No, I know.

1004
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,900
So I have a friend here in Austin who doesn't wear it

1005
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,020
just because like, they don't, they're not super crazy

1006
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,300
about having a bunch of chemicals in it.

1007
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,340
They have sensitive skin.

1008
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:18,900
I get it.

1009
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,700
I got sensitive skin.

1010
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,460
I only have like one or two brands of deodorant.

1011
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,300
I found that doesn't like, just like blow my shit up down there

1012
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,420
or in there, I should say.

1013
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,340
I totally get it.

1014
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,740
And I think that you, there are people who get away with it.

1015
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,700
Like my friend doesn't stink.

1016
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,100
It doesn't, he just doesn't,

1017
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,020
he just doesn't produce a lot of smell down there.

1018
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,180
But if you work in a fucking restaurant,

1019
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,900
like I think that's, I'm willing to give you credit,

1020
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,420
like do what you want, chase your bliss.

1021
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,180
But if you work in a restaurant, a place that like,

1022
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,700
it is kind of important that you,

1023
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,300
at least at the very minimum, don't affect the smell

1024
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,100
in the room.

1025
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,020
That you are smell neutral.

1026
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,060
You gotta be at zero smell on the pH scale.

1027
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,540
Yeah, that's a non-starter, guys.

1028
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,940
Ooh, I just had a million dollar idea.

1029
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,440
Okay.

1030
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,740
Deodorant that smells like food.

1031
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,180
Oh my God.

1032
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,740
So rather than you smell like, yeah,

1033
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,740
rather than smell like a mall, you smell like a food court.

1034
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,220
Justin.

1035
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,180
Check out my cinnamon pit.

1036
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:16,180
Justin, when he hit puberty before us,

1037
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,700
I remember this very distinctly.

1038
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,660
I had many occasions to smell Justin's armpits,

1039
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:22,420
and I think it was, he used to do the thing where he'd put

1040
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,580
his fingers in his armpits and then like put them in my face

1041
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,540
to make me smell them.

1042
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,620
And I always thought they smelled like ketchup.

1043
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,220
That's not a joke.

1044
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,660
I remember Justin's pit smelling like exactly like,

1045
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,300
or McDonald's, like that sugary ketchup.

1046
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,060
Justin once convinced me that in place of deodorant,

1047
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,940
you could rub orange peels in your armpits.

1048
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,980
Oh, Justin.

1049
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
And that shit burns.

1050
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:45,620
It hurts.

1051
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,660
You know, I've never thought about this,

1052
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,140
but Justin, you owe me like a hundred apologies for the

1053
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,900
terrible, terrible thing that you did to me.

1054
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm very sorry.

1055
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,780
Does that count?

1056
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,280
No.

1057
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,700
Now here's the thing.

1058
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,220
I have a perfect, like a really great solution for this.

1059
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,700
Are you ready?

1060
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:02,200
Mm-hmm.

1061
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:11,460
You make this person, make this man some homemade natural

1062
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:17,620
deodorant as a gift, work really hard on it and make it

1063
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,140
special and put a bow on it.

1064
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,540
Here's a quick recipe.

1065
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,860
Three tablespoons, coconut oil, three tablespoons,

1066
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,420
baking soda, two tablespoons, shea butter, two tablespoons,

1067
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,700
arrow root and essential oils.

1068
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:33,620
Mix it on up and there's like some stove stuff here,

1069
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,220
but you can Google it or whatever.

1070
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:37,860
And then make him some natural deodorant as a gift,

1071
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,660
gift deodorant and put like a brand, make a fake label,

1072
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,700
like Jerry's natural, I'm assuming his name is Jerry,

1073
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,380
Jerry's natural stick.

1074
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,780
Do not smell like duty man.

1075
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,060
Jerry's special do not get fired ointment.

1076
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,140
Jerry's special, the customers are gagging bar.

1077
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:55,640
Yeah.

1078
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,500
That's the thing, like Griffin, you're absolutely,

1079
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:02,020
cause the friends I have that don't, they're very outdoorsy.

1080
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,300
They're very beachy.

1081
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,020
They live, you know, they spend a lot of time rock climbing

1082
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,820
and hiking through the woods.

1083
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,100
And ain't that some shit?

1084
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,620
Ain't that like that friend of mine is like kind of outdoorsy

1085
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,460
and like was camping and shit like that.

1086
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,500
And then he doesn't stink.

1087
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,260
And then I go see like an outdoor theater production

1088
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,980
and I fucking like smell like dog shit afterwards.

1089
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,540
Do you think it's like people who are really protective

1090
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,300
of their kids and keep them away from germs?

1091
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,860
So like their immune system is really weak.

1092
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,340
And like, that's the thing we're making our smell immune system

1093
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,940
really weak by putting on deodorant.

1094
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,780
And if you just embrace it, you become very protective.

1095
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,020
You're very defended against smell.

1096
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:38,820
I'm going to do this.

1097
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,340
I'm going to go off it and I'm going to write a memoir

1098
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,140
about that year that I went without deodorant.

1099
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,020
Eat, pray, stink.

1100
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,020
No, it's just going to be called my stinky year.

1101
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:50,660
And it's going to be a New York times bestseller.

1102
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:51,700
Watch out Elizabeth Gilbert.

1103
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:52,980
Who's that?

1104
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,460
Oh man.

1105
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,980
My book got bumped from number one.

1106
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:55,780
Who did it?

1107
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,340
My stinky year by Griffin McElroy.

1108
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,340
I never should have inspired him to chase his dreams.

1109
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,100
Too bad you did.

1110
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,500
You inspired me deeply.

1111
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,380
I just graduated college and I'm home for the summer

1112
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,260
as I search for jobs.

1113
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
So I was wondering what the proper protocol is

1114
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:11,540
for asking people on dates

1115
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,540
when I know I'll be leaving town in the fall.

1116
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,300
Is it weird if I start seeing people

1117
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,820
who are also still in college?

1118
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,220
That's from New Prospects in New Hampshire.

1119
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,300
The second thing, no, that's no.

1120
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,140
No, that's totally fine.

1121
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,820
The first thing I think that the key is being upfront.

1122
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,340
Like, like why, why spend three months like living like a monk

1123
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,180
just because you know, you've got to get like, yeah.

1124
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,620
Take someone out on a date.

1125
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,380
You're not proposing marriage.

1126
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,940
You know what I mean?

1127
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,740
And can I tell you something?

1128
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:41,700
That is like for a lot of people,

1129
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,620
especially people who are in college,

1130
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,260
that is going to be like a refreshingly liberating way

1131
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,380
to approach it.

1132
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,740
Like, listen, let's just,

1133
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,580
let's just get some practice in here

1134
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,420
and keep each other company.

1135
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,500
Hey, do you want to just have a good time

1136
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,420
with no expectations for the future?

1137
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,060
Well, don't say-

1138
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,420
Trying to like solve this shit.

1139
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,300
Do not say, do you want to have a good time?

1140
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,980
No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.

1141
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,140
But I'm saying that that is the implication of the thing

1142
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,740
is like, you're just going to hang out

1143
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,780
and enjoy each other's company and it's cool.

1144
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,300
The great thing is that if you know

1145
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,700
that there's an expiration date on the relationship,

1146
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,140
you're going to get out there

1147
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,700
and you're going to make the most of the time

1148
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,460
you have together as a couple.

1149
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,180
You know, so many couples spend days

1150
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,700
idling away in front of the TV,

1151
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,460
but you're going to get out there, you know?

1152
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,940
You'll, you, you two will go skydiving.

1153
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:30,980
You could go Rocky Mountain.

1154
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,580
Oh Jesus, this every time.

1155
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,860
2.7 seconds on a bull man named Fu Manchu.

1156
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,100
Yeah.

1157
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,580
What I'm suggesting is to date like you were moving.

1158
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:40,820
Yeah.

1159
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,820
Can I bounce just a quick like devil's advocate

1160
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,780
off the two of you though?

1161
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:46,820
Uh-huh.

1162
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,780
What if it's love?

1163
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,300
Well, then it solves itself, right?

1164
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:55,700
Does it?

1165
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,460
Well, cause here's the thing.

1166
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:00,340
If it's love, then do you really want to run the risk

1167
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,540
of not finding it?

1168
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,180
Oh fuck, that's a good point Travis.

1169
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,940
That's a good point Travis.

1170
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,420
Thank you.

1171
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,780
I haven't watched the trailers

1172
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:10,100
for this Fault in Our Stars movie very closely,

1173
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,420
but I think this is about the same thing.

1174
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,340
Yeah, it's about two people who are moving.

1175
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,980
Two people who are moving and they decide to date each other

1176
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,420
even though they know they're moving.

1177
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,980
And it seems like, I mean, even if it doesn't pan out,

1178
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,660
you're still going to make a lot of green.

1179
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,580
It seems like those people are just raking in the devil.

1180
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,700
They're doing very, very good.

1181
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,300
Yeah, they're doing very well.

1182
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,260
So maybe try that.

1183
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,980
I think she's like training to be an astronaut or something

1184
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,820
cause she's got that oxygen tank.

1185
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,860
Yeah, she's going to the moon.

1186
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,220
And then she's just over the moon about this new fella.

1187
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,020
They should have called the movie Over the Moon.

1188
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,700
If they, I mean, if we're dealing with astronaut stuff,

1189
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,260
then typically you want to get some sort of space reference

1190
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,780
in there, but, oh, stars.

1191
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:51,940
Yeah.

1192
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:52,980
Sorry, stars, yeah.

1193
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,420
That's actually why she's going to,

1194
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,500
I just heard from the president.

1195
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,660
The sun is, the sun's all fucked up.

1196
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,260
The sun's all fucked up, but I have to go to space to fix it.

1197
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,420
There's a fault in our, are you saying yes?

1198
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,500
Yes, Dr. Mitchelson.

1199
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,180
There's a fault in our stars.

1200
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:08,580
Oh man.

1201
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,940
But also I'm dating this new guy,

1202
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,180
so we're going to see how that goes.

1203
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,620
So maybe I'll go fix it.

1204
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:16,740
Maybe I won't.

1205
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,580
But then at the end, spoiler, she does go fix it.

1206
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,260
We actually just described the exact plot

1207
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,020
of the Danny Boyle film, Sunshine.

1208
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,300
That was exactly what we just,

1209
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,660
the sun's all fucked up.

1210
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:30,100
We better fire a ship in it.

1211
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:31,940
You're welcome, Earth.

1212
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,100
And Armageddon, right?

1213
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,020
Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good,

1214
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:36,740
I think that's the same thing.

1215
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,900
What's the movie where the center of the Earth,

1216
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,820
the magma stops spinning?

1217
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,100
Yeah, well, let me put it in quotes, magma.

1218
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,580
The magma, which sounds like a made up D&D monster.

1219
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:48,820
Yeah.

1220
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,100
This Yahoo was sent in by Troy Hoffmuckle.

1221
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,340
Thank you, Troy, for all of the submissions.

1222
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Trixie Bell.

1223
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,900
My jaw popped and I yawned while I said that.

1224
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:01,620
That was terrible.

1225
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,580
Trixie Bell asks,

1226
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,500
is it okay to take a five-year-old to a restaurant

1227
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,260
with suggestive names for the food?

1228
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,260
My husband and I are babysitting our five-year-old niece,

1229
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,620
and we want to go out to eat at this

1230
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,340
rock and roll diner kind of local place.

1231
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,540
It's a clean place.

1232
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,540
It's not like Hooters or anything,

1233
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,220
but all the menu items have suggestive

1234
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,060
or slightly inappropriate names.

1235
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,860
Like their chicken soup is called cock in a bowl,

1236
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,300
and their banana split is called banana hammock.

1237
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,060
Very suggestive.

1238
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,020
Do you get it?

1239
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,900
And another chicken dish called naked breast.

1240
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,140
Do you get the suggestion?

1241
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:37,860
This one's called-

1242
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,580
Do you get it?

1243
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,660
This one's called fat cock.

1244
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,300
Do you get it?

1245
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,820
This one's called a dick, and it's a hot dog.

1246
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,260
This one's called pussy.

1247
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,980
Do you get the-

1248
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:54,180
Sorry, can I just make a quick observation

1249
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,540
that cock in a bowl is not a thing.

1250
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:57,700
No.

1251
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,540
It's not like wink, wait, get it?

1252
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,820
A cock in a bowl.

1253
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:01,860
I think that's actually-

1254
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,860
It's not a clever play on words.

1255
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,020
I think that's what British people call

1256
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,620
missionary position.

1257
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,100
Cock in a bowl.

1258
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,380
Thank you, Travis.

1259
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,900
I was hoping one of us would do it.

1260
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:15,780
I just want to say this too.

1261
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,540
I want to defend Hooters for a minute.

1262
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,060
Have you ever been to a Hooters?

1263
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,100
They don't need-

1264
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:20,980
No, no, no.

1265
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,340
Have you ever been to a Hooters?

1266
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,500
I would say that that is less sexually explicit

1267
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,940
than something that uses cock in a bowl

1268
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,380
to describe a chicken dish.

1269
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:31,940
That's the thing.

1270
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:33,140
I think that's the point they're getting at.

1271
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:36,340
I would go to a restaurant with only male waiters

1272
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,980
and also all those male waiters balls are showing

1273
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,860
and the name of the restaurant would be like the ball pit.

1274
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,660
And you would go and then they'd be like,

1275
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,380
what would you like?

1276
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:51,620
And I would say, could I have like roast beef with au jus?

1277
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,580
And they would say, yes.

1278
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,380
What would you like?

1279
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,580
I would like the prime rib.

1280
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,220
Fantastic.

1281
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,820
Those are delicious this time of year.

1282
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,540
Rather than go to a restaurant where it's like,

1283
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:00,980
what do you want?

1284
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,500
The rotten asshole?

1285
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,420
Like, whoa, why is it called that?

1286
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,740
I'm wearing a tuxedo because I'm your waiter.

1287
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,300
Do you want the rotten asshole?

1288
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:12,980
That was weird.

1289
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:13,700
That took a turn.

1290
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,220
I don't like that.

1291
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,740
No discussion of this sort would be complete

1292
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,980
without a visit to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

1293
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,980
But I said that and it's not that good

1294
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:26,740
because I just got the menu.

1295
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,220
It's not that great.

1296
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,460
It's just kind of boring a little bit.

1297
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:37,140
I thought they had like Jimmy Buffett themed snackaroos.

1298
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,940
Well, I mean, it's hard because they do have,

1299
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,180
there's the booze and a blender,

1300
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,540
which is they bring you a who's to blame

1301
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,060
or a tropical fruit margarita

1302
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:51,460
in a 22 ounce take home blender cup.

1303
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,820
And it is delicious.

1304
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,500
So hold up, a blender cup,

1305
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,660
by which you mean just the top part of a blender

1306
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,180
with the blades and shit in it.

1307
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,100
No, so it's a novelty,

1308
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,060
but they take it from one blender into another blender.

1309
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,220
That seems excessive.

1310
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,660
Some other drink.

1311
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,540
Okay, so I wasn't looking-

1312
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,380
They have really high blender overhead.

1313
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,180
I wasn't looking at the drink section

1314
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,780
when I said there are awesome names.

1315
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,820
If you're a fan of his,

1316
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,740
you are going to get a treat here.

1317
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:18,020
Last mango in Paris.

1318
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:19,460
That's a song, but a drink.

1319
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:20,820
Who's to blame?

1320
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,500
That's from the song Margaritaville.

1321
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,100
Fence to the left, another lyric.

1322
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,700
Livin' it up.

1323
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,740
That's the name of a drink.

1324
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,780
A shaker of salt.

1325
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,900
It's just a salt shaker

1326
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,060
that you have to eat in front of the waiter.

1327
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:35,220
I think my favorite appetizer at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

1328
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,500
is the clam munchers.

1329
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:36,740
Yeah.

1330
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:37,860
So good.

1331
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:40,980
Uh, there's a five o'clock somewhere drink

1332
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,860
that you can order.

1333
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,660
Are these part of like a boat drinks umbrella

1334
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,220
or is there a thing-

1335
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,100
No dipshit.

1336
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,860
There's a whole boat drink section.

1337
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:53,540
Bama Breeze, Rum Runner,

1338
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,220
Don't Stop the Carnival,

1339
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,180
Chocolate Banana-

1340
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,500
Don't Stop the Carnival is something

1341
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,340
that an alcoholic would say.

1342
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,420
I think that all you have to do

1343
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,100
is add please in front of it.

1344
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,380
Please don't stop the carnival.

1345
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:05,880
Please.

1346
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,160
Please.

1347
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,760
And of course there's shots too

1348
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,880
under the boat drink section.

1349
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,560
You can get a boat drink shot

1350
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,120
of the Why Don't We Get Drunk in Ellipses

1351
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,560
and of course that was a reference to the fact

1352
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,160
that when he originally released the single

1353
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,200
Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screwed

1354
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,320
the record label wouldn't let him put the word screw on there

1355
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,160
so there's actually just a picture of a screw

1356
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,840
in the in the truck.

1357
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,960
That's grosser.

1358
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,560
Yeah, way grosser.

1359
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,760
Slightly grosser, right?

1360
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,840
God, I want to go to this place so bad.

1361
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,480
There's no-

1362
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,600
I'm living-

1363
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,800
I'm 33 years old.

1364
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,600
I'm about to be a dad.

1365
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,520
I'm living a life without irony.

1366
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,920
All I want to go do is go to this place

1367
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,880
and drink them all until the names are funny

1368
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,080
and then keep drinking.

1369
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,400
Listen, you come visit me in Cincinnati.

1370
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,800
I will take you to Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville.

1371
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,640
There is no fucking-

1372
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:54,440
There is no less beachy scene

1373
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,200
than eating at the Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville

1374
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,480
inside a casino inside a Cincinnati.

1375
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,120
There is no less beachy vibe than that.

1376
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,600
I'm sorry.

1377
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,520
Let me fix that for you, Justin,

1378
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,400
because they play all kinds of fun beachy videos

1379
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,840
on the closed circuit television.

1380
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,760
So do you want to see some busty babes

1381
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,200
bouncing at a tailgate?

1382
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,840
Some parrot heads in their colorful shirts

1383
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,360
enjoying a kegger?

1384
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,160
Yeah, you do.

1385
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,360
Oh, and what's that?

1386
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,080
Oh, it's Jimmy Buffett performing with Lionel Richie.

1387
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,200
Oh my god, it's amazing.

1388
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,480
It's like you're at the beach.

1389
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,040
The only problem with the beachy videos

1390
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,000
is like every once in a while

1391
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
the pit bosses wander over to flip it over

1392
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,920
to like their closed circuit cams

1393
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,200
to watch the tables.

1394
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:38,920
That is correct.

1395
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,480
The Jimmy Buffett is also the security office.

1396
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,360
It's a lot of fun to work there.

1397
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:46,440
Yeah, it's a blast.

1398
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,680
I went to one that was close to our house,

1399
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,560
our apartment in Batavia, Ohio,

1400
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,360
which was basically inside a mall our apartment was.

1401
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,280
We went to that once

1402
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,200
and I think I went with dad and Carol

1403
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,120
and we sat next to the stage at the Jimmy Buffett,

1404
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,720
but there was no live music that night.

1405
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,440
They just had a TV hooked up to a PlayStation

1406
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,560
and a little boy played Guitar Hero on mute

1407
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,800
literally right next to us,

1408
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,720
literally in touching distance.

1409
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:14,600
Where was this?

1410
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,480
That was at Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville,

1411
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,920
Batavia, Ohio.

1412
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,880
Are you sure that that wasn't a cheeseburger in paradise?

1413
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,040
I'm sorry, it was a cheeseburger in paradise.

1414
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,680
How does that fucking dude get two restaurants?

1415
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,320
He'll be hearing from his lawyers.

1416
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,480
Now Jimmy Buffett has to sue himself again.

1417
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:35,640
There's another year's worth of time

1418
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,240
where we're not going to get a new album

1419
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,400
because Jimmy Buffett has to sue himself.

1420
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:42,280
Thank you all for listening to our program.

1421
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,640
We sure appreciate you checking in with us

1422
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,640
and spending a little time.

1423
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,000
Thank you to people tweeting about the show.

1424
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,160
Chris Gard, The Duke, Iveka Fulnovic,

1425

1426
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,840
Rashawn, Diana, so many others.

1427
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,040
A lot of really nice comments about our interview

1428
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,400
with Elizabeth Gilbert last week.

1429
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,680
She was like a blast and we would love to have her back

1430
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,560
at some point.

1431
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:18,280
I had a friend here in Austin who said they listened

1432
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,280
to that episode because they saw it on Facebook

1433
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,480
and didn't think it was true.

1434
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,920
They thought we were lying about having Elizabeth Gilbert

1435
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,720
on the show.

1436
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,520
This is pretty great.

1437
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,360
So thank you to everybody tweeting about us.

1438
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:35,560
If you want to share our show with people you love,

1439
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,400

1440
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,440
We're right there.

1441
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,800
And if you could give us a review or a subscription

1442
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,960
on iTunes, that would be amazing.

1443
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:44,840
Yeah, that's good.

1444
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,320
We also have been putting up some really, really awesome

1445
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:50,280
animated videos on our YouTube that Tyler Crowley made for us.

1446
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:51,720
Go check them out.

1447
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:53,960
It's just nbnbam is the channel name

1448
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,000
and they're really, really awesome.

1449
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,280
And if you like them, good news.

1450
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,680
We're going to try to get some more on there.

1451
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,040
And I think you guys are really going to like it.

1452
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,040
So go subscribe to our YouTube channel

1453
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,680
and tell all your friends about it and share all the videos.

1454
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,720
Also, in case you missed it, we announced that we joined up

1455
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,200
with this booking agency called Billions.

1456
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,120
No big deal, but they are actually a pretty big deal.

1457
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:17,240
They do booking for Welcome to Night Vale,

1458
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,080
which is a great show if you're not listening to it,

1459
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,160
and a bunch of really great musical acts.

1460
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,680
They're going to help us set up some tours next year.

1461
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:32,120
We are going to try and hit a lot of places in America

1462
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,560
and maybe a little bit of Canada.

1463
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,480
We're still figuring it out, still planning it out.

1464
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,160
But yeah, we're going to kick that shit in a high gear

1465
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,800
starting next year.

1466
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,760
And of course, we'll let you know once stuff firms up.

1467
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,400
So hopefully we'll get to see you soon.

1468
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,160
That's my hope.

1469
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,200
That is my hope as well.

1470
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,920
Also, thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters

1471
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,600
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1472
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,960
on the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1473
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,560
You can find that record anywhere where records are sold.

1474
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,120
Probably.

1475
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,800
Yeah, just Google it.

1476
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,080
You can get it on the internet.

1477
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,920
And I think that's going to do it for us.

1478
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,520
Thank you so much, everybody listening.

1479
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,240
Thank you.

1480
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:09,640
Thank you.

1481
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:09,960
Thank you.

1482
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,600
Thank you.

1483
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,000
Please listen to the other Max Fun shows.

1484
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,280
There's a ton of really good ones.

1485
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,480
Sawbones is a good jumping off point

1486
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,440
if you like Justin's dulcet tones.

1487
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,600
It's a smooth transition to the other shows.

1488
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,080
It's a smooth transition.

1489
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,840
There's one of these people I've heard before.

1490
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,000
Then there's other really good ones.

1491
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,960
Jordan Jesse Go, One Bad Mother, Lady of the Lady,

1492
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:33,880
Wham Bam Pow, Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

1493
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:34,680
There's a ton.

1494
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:37,720
We can't, it would take us 10 minutes to list them all.

1495
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,080
But go check it out.

1496
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,640
There's a lot.

1497
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,120
There's a lot.

1498
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,200
This final Yahoo was actually, it was sent in by Drew Davenport,

1499
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,280
but he wanted to make sure that I announced that it was actually

1500
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,800
his friend Jeff found it.

1501
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,960
He did not want to claim, and he's a stand up dude, right?

1502
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,800
He's not even going to, he knocks it out of the park every day.

1503
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,080
And then when his friend knocks it out of the park,

1504
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,520
he doesn't jump on it and claim credit.

1505
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,040
Well, he doesn't need it.

1506
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,440
Doesn't need it, I guess.

1507
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,240
He's got plenty of credit.

1508
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,200
So thank you, Jeff.

1509
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Tammy Yordoz who asks,

1510
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:10,360
can your butt start higher than the crack?

1511
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,400
I'm Justin McElroy.

1512
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,040
I'm Travis McElroy.

1513
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,440
I'm Griffin McElroy, and my butt starts at the nape of my neck.

1514
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,520
My butt starts at the nape of my butt,

1515
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,400
and it gets to dad's straight on the nape of his neck.

1516

01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,400
Hi, my name's Dave.

1521
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,440
And my name's Graham.

1522
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,720
Now, what do we have to do to put you in a brand new podcast today?

1523
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,120
Yeah.

1524
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,480
What, do you want me to drink bleach?

1525
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:00,600
I'll do it.

1526
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,800
Yeah, Dave will drink bleach.

1527
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,560
If that's what it takes to get you to listen to,

1528
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,360
stop podcasting yourself on maximumfun.org.

1529
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,880
Don't make Dave drink bleach.

1530
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,320
Just listen to the show.

1531
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,760
He will, but don't make him.

1532
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:19,480
Stop podcasting yourself.
