1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,640
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm live from the floor of the Republican National Convention,

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,560
and Griffin, I understand that you just got back from Mexico. I couldn't decide which one to do.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,600
I did both. We gotta use a fisherman's knot to weave these two things together.

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,000
I just, I couldn't pick one to do, so I did them both that we said.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,200
Okay, here it is. I've got it. Okay. Ready? I just saw a headline that says the GOP is now

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,960
going after women and Latinos. Okay. Griffin. Yeah, there was a-

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Mexico. Let me tell you.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,760
So now my brother, my brother and me is going after Latinos.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,240
Now, Griffin, I understand that you actually had a stipulation that you would only be exposed to

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,680
other Caucasians. That was the one rule in your travel. You were actually traveling from one

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,480
Caucasian bubble to another. That is true.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,720
And being blindfolded in between. Is that accurate?

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,640
It's not blindfolding. It's a blinders system. It's a pair of goggles. They call it white vision.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,760
It's complicated because they put these blinders on you, and then each hallway that you walk down

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,400
in the resort has special lanes. Okay.

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,640
That you walk down. So the blinders shut out the far left and right lanes,

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,680
which really saves you from a lot of hassle vis-a-vis non-whites.

22
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Which is very much how the Republicans may view the world.

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,880
Okay. This is good.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,400
This is good. This is political and international. It's just-

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,440
I'll be the footnotes at the bottom of the queue to pull it back to a Republican National

26
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Convention.

27
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll tell you this much. When I was sitting on those silky alabaster beaches,

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,240
contemplating the ocean, as I do, I can't tell you how many Romney coladas I had down there.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,240
If you like Romney coladas-

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,560
You know what?

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
Do you know what goes into a Romney colada?

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,400
They're very refreshing, but they're each $12,000.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
Each?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
To me seems overzealous.

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
Instead of making you drunk, it makes you just kind of boring.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,680
Just a little sleepy.

37
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,280
This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

38
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,440
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

39
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy. I don't feel good about how we did that.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,120
Did we get good jobs?

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
I don't think we did good jobs, no.

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Griffin, the one thing that you should have learned from Mexico is no regrets, you know?

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,080
Which is also the Romney campaign slogan.

45
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,680
No regrets.

46
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:21,920
Full speed ahead.

47
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,600
Never look back. Romney, 2012.

48
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,320
Fuck it. Fuck it. It's like my 12th time trying this. I have nothing left to lose.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,640
You want to see my taxes? I want to see the future.

50
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,000
Why is everybody- Why are you in the past?

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,920
I want to talk about how much money I'm going to make next year.

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
I'm going forward, which is why I've hired a baby to be my vice president.

53
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,440
Come on, baby. We're going to the future. Come on, baby VP.

54
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,280
Baby VP. Okay, how would you not vote?

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,560
I think I would- I don't agree with Mr. Romney's politics.

56
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,360
If he did put a baby on the ticket, I would be-

57
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,720
What if he actually showed the baby, like, sitting on the ticket, sitting on a ticket?

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,120
And you did, like, Romney was at his podium,

59
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,920
and then you had, like, a small baby podium next to it,

60
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,440
then you put a baby dressed like Mitt Romney with a Mitt Romney wig on.

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
And he's wearing a toupee.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,240
I would vote for that. Hey, Romney, if you're listening, you're welcome.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,520
Just imagine that VP debate, too, right?

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,800
Because you would have our VP whose name escapes me.

65
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,280
His what? Sorry?

66
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,120
His name escapes me at the moment.

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Oh, man. You know.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,100
Joey B.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
You know the guy?

70
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
Joey B.

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,920
Joey- Joey Bag of Donuts is up there.

72
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,960
Oh, Joey Bag of Donuts, eh?

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
He's doing his thing up there.

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,920
I can't remember the goddamn vice president's name.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,560
I've been out of the country more days than I've been in the country this-

76
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,960
Don't you have to take a test to get back into the country?

77
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
This is hugely embarrassing.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm pretty sure it's Joey Flip.

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
Is it not Joey Flip?

80
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,200
Flip Wilson?

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,320
Flip Wilson?

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
Vice president and known cross-dresser, Flip Wilson.

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,240
Okay, I want to see a VP debate with Joe- Joseph Gordon-Biden.

84
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,760
Yo, he was so good on Third Rock from the Sun.

85
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,480
I love his work in Brick.

86
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,200
I want him up there. I want a baby up there.

87
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,080
And one of them is going to poop his pants, but the other one is going to say

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,040
something offensive accidentally about the gay community.

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,920
And it's going to be great.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
Which one was which? I don't know.

91
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,040
It could really go either way.

92
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,680
He pays your money, he takes your chances.

93
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,960
Let's get into the advice.

94
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,440
I just forgot the vice president's fucking name for two and a half minutes.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,840
You're not even like an American anymore, really.

96
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,240
I peeled.

97
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,720
I peeled a layer of skin from my elbow to my fingers like a lady's delicate glove.

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Why are you taking me on this journey right now?

99
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,440
And that skin contain your memories of Joe Biden?

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,080
Possibly.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,960
This is the part of me that remembers Joe Biden.

102
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,080
This is my Derma Biden Titus.

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,520
And this is the part of the Derma layer in which Biden.

104
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
I tell you guys what, one time I had Biden Titus.

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
I had to have my Biden removed.

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,560
But you know what?

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
Travis is still living the life he wants.

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
He doesn't need no Biden.

109
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,120
That's right.

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,000
Nor no man, because he is strong and proud.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
A few months ago, I broke up with my boyfriend of 1.5 years and friend of 10 years

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
because I had a strong feeling that I am gay instead of just bisexual.

113
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,320
However, a couple of months past the breakup,

114
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,600
I realized that instead of not being attracted to all men ever,

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,560
I was just not a drink, not just not attracted to his lazy ass anymore.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,960
Okay.

117
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,200
My question is, if I start to date a new guy,

118
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,440
my ex slash friend is definitely going to bring up the whole being gay thing.

119
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Got it.

120
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
How should I tell him the truth without completely crushing his soul?

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,600
Why are you laughing at this?

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,040
A confused lady in need, because here's the only thing about it,

123
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,760
is that you can never talk to him again.

124
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,080
Yeah.

125
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,480
He can't ever, ever, ever know.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,720
Right.

127
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
You can't ever talk to him again.

128
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
He has to go to his grave thinking that it was a misunderstanding.

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Now, this is also a rare week in which Justin has put together the question list.

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,120
And I did not know until the end of the question that it was a lady.

131
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,240
And I thought that this was a dude who broke up with his dude boyfriend

132
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,440
because he thought he was bisexual instead of like full gay.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,400
And I was really confused by the premise.

134
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Are you dyslexic?

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Yes.

136
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,280
I hadn't read the question list until this.

137
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Travis is actually dyssexic, which is where he confuses genders and sexualities.

138
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,160
No sex per here.

139
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,320
I think that it is, I think you are doing your ex a disservice

140
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,720
if when he's like, what the fuck?

141
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
If you're not like, oh, no, no, you're really unattractive right now.

142
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,520
You are living an unattractive lifestyle.

143
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,680
As it turns out, you are the bits.

144
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,040
You are the bits.

145
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,800
You are a stinker.

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
And I don't want to be with you no more.

147
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,480
Listen, it turns out I am not I am not full blown gay.

148
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,280
And for that, that mistruth, I apologize.

149
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
I was confused at the time.

150
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,160
I wasn't quite possibly sure.

151
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,880
Now I would define my sexuality as everything but Mike.

152
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,320
You know when you order an antipasta and you expect it to be a plate full of everything

153
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
ever cooked except for pasta.

154
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
You want some Skittles in there.

155
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,800
You want a hamburger.

156
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,840
You want a hamburger.

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,560
Some fondue.

158
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,440
Right.

159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,480
It's like when you order a hamburger, sometimes it's just easier.

160
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,280
It's like I want it with everything except Mike.

161
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,840
Can you imagine?

162
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,720
But that would that would that would be predicated upon there being a sexuality out there.

163
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,760
That's just like Mike sexual.

164
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,640
I want Mike.

165
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
And that's all I can think about.

166
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,640
But this is this is the world we live in, right?

167
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,200
There's there is a there is a polar opposite for every person.

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:12,240
So the good news is that although me myself am an anti Mike aficionado, I like everything

169
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:21,280
but you somewhere out there is a micro sexual that just wants to get it done, you know,

170
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
with Mike, with you specifically, Mike.

171
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,960
If you could back away from the door, I am feeling a little uncomfortable by how close

172
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,440
you've gotten.

173
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
Oh, man.

174
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
Oh, boy.

175
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,240
I would also like to be in Mike's shoes in that moment when you walk in with your new

176
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,960
boyfriend and he just double takes like what what what?

177
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,400
Oh, no.

178
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,680
You could you could go.

179
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,320
You know what?

180
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Gender roles are very loose right now.

181
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,840
You could insist that to your ex that the man you're dating is a woman.

182
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,280
I don't think he's going to get in there for a look.

183
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,320
That dog.

184
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,520
That dog won't hunt.

185
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,640
That dog will not hunt.

186
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
That dog has no legs.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,640
That dog does not.

188
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
That dog can roll around.

189
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
He can bark.

190
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,880
I guess I guess I guess the reason you asked me why I was laughing earlier and I I don't

191
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,440
mean to mock the pain of of others.

192
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:23,920
I I just can't imagine what it must feel like to date someone and they they say not I dislike

193
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,440
being in this so much.

194
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,640
I think that I don't want to be with an entire one half of the world.

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,320
I am writing off half of the world's population because of the extent to which you have repulsed

196
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,680
me and like that's never the case in these situations because typically I would imagine

197
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,840
if someone realizes that they're they are gay and they have to leave a heterosexual

198
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,800
relationship that's that's almost always the case.

199
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,840
And I would imagine it's very difficult for both parties.

200
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,960
This is that rare instance where the parents are getting divorced and it is in fact because

201
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,560
of something the child did.

202
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
No, it's that rare anomaly.

203
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,040
I can't.

204
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,200
OK, I can't pretend to understand what it's like to be in this situation on either side

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
of it because I've never been on either side of it.

206
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,280
But I can't believe that you come to that realization because of one because of of one

207
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,720
person because of one relationship.

208
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,160
No, no, I get what Justin's saying.

209
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,760
What I think what Justin's saying is that you don't say, oh, I'm gay because of this

210
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,720
one person.

211
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
But to say, am I gay because I'm not attracted to this person anymore?

212
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
And then realize, oh, no, no, no, it's totally cool.

213
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,080
It's not everyone else.

214
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,720
It's them.

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,220
Right.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,320
Right.

217
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
I'm saying I don't know.

218
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,480
It seems like that's again, I can't pretend to understand, but it seems unlikely to think

219
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
like, well, I've had Mike.

220
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
So like, that's all the guys.

221
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,720
I don't think that's I think that it's probably indicative of a lot of things.

222
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,040
It does explain his T-shirt.

223
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
Once you go, Mike, there's no more like I understand that now.

224
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,160
Travis, you didn't quite nail the dismount.

225
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,240
The Russian judge has generously given you an 8.5, so you are going to go home with a

226
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,040
bronze.

227
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,440
Thank you.

228
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,080
Olympics.

229
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,080
It's a theme show.

230
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:15,760
You know, I OK, so as far as how how to.

231
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
Oh, man, you don't know.

232
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,040
No, listen, no, listen, because this is this is serious because this is a person you've

233
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
known for 10 years and is obviously right.

234
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,120
I'm trying to shepherd a good bud, but not like a Dayton bud.

235
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,720
And here's the thing.

236
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
You don't know this person fucking check shit because you're finding yourself finding your

237
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,200
sexuality and your needs and your desires and what gets what gets off your rocks.

238
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,840
And if explain it to him exactly like that, just say you're not what does it for me anymore?

239
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,000
You don't get my motor rep.

240
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,800
And I thought that was indicative of all the guys.

241
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,800
But now I've just realized that it's not because of all the guys is Mike.

242
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,400
And I would actually take a moment to think about whether or not it was completely just

243
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,280
your repulsion with Mike that put you off of men forever or if maybe if you're being

244
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,400
100 percent honest with yourself, if there wasn't some part of you that thought, gosh,

245
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,120
if I was, it would be such a make this a lot.

246
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,880
It would make this so much easier because a lot of times your brain is going to hear

247
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
you thinking that and it's going to bridge that gap for you because your brain wants

248
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,600
to avoid bad situations.

249
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
And you know what?

250
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,800
Even if that's not the case, even if I'm full of shit, that's a pretty good thing to tell

251
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,300
Mike.

252
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,000
That's a good out.

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
That's a good out.

254
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
Like, I know you're into excuses.

255
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,240
Get out of it.

256
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,760
You know, I have to look at this as there's also a little bit of you hear it all the time

257
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,160
where people say, like, you know, once they break up with someone, they say, I just don't

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,880
want to be with anyone right now.

259
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,720
I just want to be by myself right now.

260
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,160
So I think that this is a pretty common feeling that maybe is just.

261
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,880
Oh, that's all that is all horseshit, though, right?

262
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

263
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,120
That's what I think until the moment when they realize that that's not true, they just

264
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,560
don't want to be with that person.

265
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:04,800
Right.

266
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,440
That's what I'm saying.

267
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,680
So I think that this is just set in a different frame, but a pretty common feeling, you know,

268
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
I just want to be single right now.

269
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
But you don't really just don't want to be with that person.

270
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,160
I don't know.

271
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,280
We're out of our depth.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,480
Just just be honest.

273
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,200
You don't know this person or a lot or use that lie.

274
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,360
I told you about the lie is also good.

275
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,400
How about a Yahoo?

276
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Please do it.

277
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,640
This one was sent by Steven Ketchum.

278
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,440
Thank you, Steven.

279
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
Ketchum, Ash Ketchum's brother.

280
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Milan, who asks.

281
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,440
How are some people able to get a lot of likes on Facebook?

282
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,880
10 points for the best answer.

283
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,560
There is this guy who I know on Facebook.

284
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,000
We're in college who can post something and often gets 20 plus likes on most of his posts.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I know people say it depends on how many friends you have, but that's not always true because

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
we both have the same number of Facebook friends.

287
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,840
900.

288
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,440
But I barely get 10 likes on my status where he can easily pull off 40 likes on a really

289
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,960
good status of his.

290
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
He's not one of those attention seekers.

291
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,120
He doesn't get post every 10 minutes.

292
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
It seems to be only two to three times a week.

293
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,080
But when he posts, it's like people stop to read what he writes.

294
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
This guy's like Facebook Martin Luther King Jr.

295
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,440
I know it's just listening to his shit.

296
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
I know it's just Facebook, but it baffles me.

297
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,680
How do some people just natural?

298
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,840
I guess you would call it Internet popularity more than some others do.

299
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,360
Can you imagine if you had a baby and like it just turned out he was a prodigy at posting

300
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,160
on Facebook?

301
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:48,320
He's the he has one talent and that is he's the one he puts those posts up.

302
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,440
What if you fucking planned your whole life around one status update?

303
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,560
You would do your entire life, just the one, and you would you could even like drop the

304
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,040
date for it.

305
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,560
It could be in sync with the Mayan apocalypse.

306
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,920
And you could make that one Facebook blast that everybody on earth would read and like

307
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,520
form a religion around.

308
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,320
I love it.

309
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,880
You see where Dave said he made a sandwich today?

310
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,440
It's the only thing he ever said, but he means a lot.

311
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,400
It touched me.

312
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
That's OK.

313
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:26,560
So I follow people of disparate backgrounds on Facebook, and these are the three things

314
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,960
that you can put in your status.

315
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,280
One, you can put in complaining about bosses.

316
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,320
People love that.

317
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:44,800
Two, you can put in pictures of your kids, then something something about being lucky.

318
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,320
The third one is complaining about Facebook.

319
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,560
Those are the only three things that are on Facebook.

320
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,920
Now, are you saying that the OK, so you're not saying these are the three things you

321
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
should post?

322
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,120
No, I'm saying these are the only three things you can post because they're the only things

323
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,920
on the service.

324
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:11,280
Now, but wait, what about like a crude drawing of Obama taking away America's guns and stepping

325
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,240
on the Constitution while Jesus cries and you post in it, you say, my daughter draw

326
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,200
this this morning.

327
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,160
Please pass it along if you like it.

328
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,280
And then if you don't like it, if you don't repost, you're a communist.

329
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,520
Yeah.

330
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,680
And then thirty five million trillion people all post like it and thumb it something or

331
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,200
the other way around.

332
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
I mean, the other side has got them, too.

333
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:33,840
Yeah.

334
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,760
I just can't think of any right now.

335
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,160
Yeah.

336
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,880
None as I would say stirring.

337
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,080
Why is he stepping on the Constitution?

338
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,160
How did he even get out on the street?

339
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,320
There's one where like Mitt Romney is like making a farty face and there's some comment

340
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,080
about like women on there or something.

341
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,200
Yeah, sure.

342
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,760
I saw something on my Facebook who's a family friend and they posted a quote from John Adams

343
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,000
about how the America would have no religion but God and they didn't pass my smell test.

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,480
So I went I went to Google and I went to Google and I Googled John Adams quotes and I Googled

345
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,200
quotes by this specific quote.

346
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:23,600
And then I found out the truth of the matter is it is a combination of several quotes,

347
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,360
none of which were made by John Adams.

348
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,080
And I typed all of this into the response box of this person's Facebook before I stopped

349
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,200
and said, fuck, what have I done?

350
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,840
Yeah, because your whole afternoon was gone by that.

351
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,040
That's the whole fucking day was rebutting.

352
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,720
It was a fucking book report on this guy's Facebook tweet.

353
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Yeah, the whole day was spent on rebuttals that I couldn't do anything with that time.

354
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,760
I'm not getting it back.

355
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,560
Maybe that's how he taught you.

356
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,160
And if that was his trick all along.

357
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,840
Oh, man.

358
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Oh, man.

359
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:10,800
And then the same guy later was talking about how he put the IRS asked him how many dependents

360
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,560
he had and he put on 11 million welfare moms, two million crackheads.

361
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,640
And I thought and I thought, man, but this guy's a Christian, too.

362
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,800
I thought, man, I bet I'm going to this is a fucking this is true.

363
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,960
I thought, man, I want to Jesus love take care of poor people.

364
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,280
I want to find a Bible verse where Jesus said that.

365
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,520
No, Justin, you're just a cog in the machine.

366
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,520
So I literally got to this exact same place again where I'd selected some choice Bible

367
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,240
verses that was really going to put it in his pursuit.

368
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,360
And then I stopped myself and I did it again.

369
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,400
This is why Facebook is amazing, because it's the only propaganda that allows you to propaganda

370
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,280
back and then have propaganda back at your propaganda.

371
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,800
Yeah, this is this is great.

372
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,040
Justin is like a lot of people are never going to see this side of Justin, except for me,

373
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,280
the side of Justin that I have to talk down when somebody says something mean to him on

374
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
the Twitter or Facebook because he's about to go off.

375
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,000
Justin is basically like Internet Batman, only instead of like instead of like getting

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,960
super strong.

377
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,560
It's also about somebody I care about.

378
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,080
That's also something I'll get mad at.

379
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,680
But you're like Internet Batman.

380
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,880
If like Batman, like if the Joker was doing something bad and so the Batman started training

381
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
his body and then would like get a bunch of tools together and then would like go and

382
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,680
like step outside the Batcave and then think about how awkward the confrontation is going

383
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,640
to be and then just like goes back inside and plays Bioshock or something.

384
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,120
Yeah, I also can I jump back to the Yahoo question real quick?

385
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,680
Yes, yes.

386
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,920
Yes, I also like this idea of having a Facebook rival that they have no idea that you are

387
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,040
their Facebook rival.

388
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,280
Sure.

389
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,960
So every time when it's like their birthday, you like change your information.

390
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,160
So it looks like it's your birthday.

391
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,320
And then you see who gets more posts on the wall or when like they put a picture of a

392
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,000
baby, you find a picture of a baby.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,680
You put it like now this is my baby.

394
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,280
You see who gets the most likes.

395
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,600
Or you kidnap them and then you take control of their Facebook and then their likes are

396
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,480
your likes.

397
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,840
Give me your passwords.

398
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,880
Yeah, it'll be like,

399
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,960
Swear to me.

400
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
God damn it.

401
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,880
That woman who posted that picture of Obama feeding the Constitution to a baby playing

402
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,800
with a kitten is my Salieri.

403
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,840
She's got 250 likes on that bitch.

404
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,680
That's such a good picture.

405
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,480
God damn it.

406
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,160
I can't believe she beat me to that.

407
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,280
I'm going back to Reddit.

408
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,200
We'll find something really good to get her back.

409
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I got this great velociraptor thing.

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,080
Oh, it's going to make her look so stupid.

411
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,480
And I wrote like fucking 800 words about why the chronology of this does not work out.

412
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,760
Who is the baby?

413
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,720
What does he represent?

414
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,200
Facebook.

415
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,640
Here's the truth about the Facebook.

416
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
And it's sort of my whole...

417
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,080
It's not just for me.

418
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,040
It's not just Facebook.

419
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,760
It's life.

420
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,320
You know?

421
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,200
Uh oh.

422
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
You got to write Matthew McConaughey in Mexico.

423
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,400
No, listen, listen, let's get these stinky, sticky bongos out.

424
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,160
Let's just let's rap about this.

425
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,720
Fucking how is anyone ever supposed to miss you if you're always there?

426
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,960
Are you saying to disappear for a while?

427
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,920
Was that on the, uh, was that on the note?

428
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,480
The tweet stream of quotes from the notebook?

429
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
Because I do follow that.

430
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
Hey, listen, for real.

431
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,840
Listen, if you're a bird, I'm a bird.

432
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
I mean, fuck.

433
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,840
I'm going to puke.

434
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:44,880
Fuck.

435
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,720
Listen, seriously, for real.

436
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,200
Seriously.

437
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,480
Listen, for real.

438
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,960
This is F-R-E-A-L life lesson.

439
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,520
How, like, if you're always tweeting and booking and LinkedIn and then about everything you do,

440
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,440
no one's going to give a shit.

441
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,760
You got to compress.

442
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,760
And even then, nobody gives a shit about anything you do.

443
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,920
The reason that your friend gets all these likes is because he says something broad.

444
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,480
He says something that means something to everybody, not just him.

445
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,080
Went to five guys today.

446
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,200
Too many fries.

447
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,960
Zero likes.

448
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
No, everybody likes fries.

449
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,920
No likes, no shares.

450
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,320
You know why?

451
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,520
Because everybody went to fucking five guys today.

452
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,760
Yeah.

453
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,120
You know what?

454
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm going to drop some Carnegie on you.

455
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:31,520
Here we go.

456
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:40,960
Because you can win more friends in two weeks of getting interested in other people

457
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,600
than you can in two years of trying to get other people interested in you.

458
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:55,200
You put up a Facebook status that is about your life and how much it blows slash rules.

459
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,960
I don't like either one of those.

460
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
If it rules, I feel jealous.

461
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,320
If it blows, I feel empathy.

462
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,560
I don't like either of those emotions.

463
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,000
If you put on your status like five o'clock somewhere, you know I like that.

464
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,960
Because I'm into that.

465
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,400
I feel that.

466
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm with you on that.

467
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
Or get engaged.

468
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Because that's what I did, and I got fucking like 350 likes in two hours.

469
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,840
I love this, Travis.

470
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,120
You have just given birth to the king of ideas.

471
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,000
Cracked it.

472
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,120
Get engaged.

473
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,920
Or just every-

474
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,600
And then end it and then get engaged again on cycle.

475
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,160
That's a little extreme, but there are a ton-

476
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
Opened up my new business today.

477
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,240
Three days later, business went under.

478
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
Should have had a better plan.

479
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,080
Anyone know a good music to listen to?

480
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,560
And then say like, pray for me.

481
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,200
Pray for me.

482
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
I've got to go pray on it.

483
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,400
Like, oh my god.

484
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,280
Anybody got any choice quotes about prayer and its meaning and value?

485
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,040
Anyone got some sweet Bible verses for me?

486
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,840
Need them.

487
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,360
Last weekend was my birthday.

488
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,960
Happy birthday.

489
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
No, no.

490
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,680
Happy birthday, Justin.

491
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,000
Not me.

492
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,560
Like, like, like.

493
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,960
Like, like, like, like, like.

494
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
I'm going to share that with all my business friends.

495
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,040
Oh, one other idea.

496
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,360
Find a picture of an old guy in a military outfit and then say,

497
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,720
this was my pop pop.

498
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,720
He passed away this week.

499
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,360
Or something like that.

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
Oh, like, like, like, like, like, like.

501
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,520
People will put him in my Gmour high school sweethearts.

502
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,200
People are going to like that.

503
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
This is my G-Paw.

504
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,600
Red blood Americans.

505
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,840
This is my G-Paw in the war.

506
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
I like how your G-Paw looks.

507
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
I want to be his LinkedIn professional buddy.

508
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,280
I want to buddy link with him.

509
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,240
Like, like, like.

510
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,720
I named my farm bill after my G-Paw.

511
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,160
I re-tweeted your grandpa's pussy farm.

512
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,000
Last weekend was my birthday.

513
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,480
I got a little swerve on some devil's juice.

514
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,840
You've mixed your idioms there.

515
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,800
That's not an idiom.

516
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,520
We're going to move on.

517
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,560
I woke up the next morning with a busted up face.

518
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,520
Broken nose and multiple scrapes.

519
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,360
I work at a corporate job where things like this will not look good.

520
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
Can't pass it off as a Fight Club incident.

521
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,400
I need to come up with a good explanation for this.

522
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
That isn't, I got drunk and don't remember.

523
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Any help here in B&B AM?

524
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,320
Bill.

525
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,640
Bill.

526
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,360
Couple things I need to know here.

527
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,840
Yeah.

528
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
One, most importantly, why can't you pass it off as a Fight Club incident?

529
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,280
Why do such squares work at your workplace?

530
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,840
Two, do we need to CSI this shit and figure out what happened?

531
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,120
Yeah.

532
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,760
Like, what kind of scrapes are we talking about, Bill?

533
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,680
Do you have any scrapes on your palms?

534
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,840
If not, you did not try to catch yourself or you got into an altercation with someone

535
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,120
and it was not falling, so it punched you in the face.

536
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,000
That's good.

537
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
Check the blood splatter, too.

538
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:02,720
Bill, I do want to say, we'll get back to the problem with your corporate job.

539
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,280
You know what?

540
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,320
Let me just wrap that up.

541
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,680
Tell them you fell off your bike.

542
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,160
Move on.

543
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,400
Yeah.

544
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
All right, tell them you got the shit beaten out of you.

545
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,120
It doesn't matter.

546
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,240
Let's talk about the first half of your question.

547
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,400
See if you can see where the gap is.

548
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,200
Last weekend was my birthday.

549
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,000
Happy birthday.

550
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,720
Happy birthday.

551
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,200
That's good.

552
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,520
Yeah.

553
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,480
Click, click, click, click.

554
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,560
I got a little swerve on some stuff.

555
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,480
Little swerve on some devil's juice.

556
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
Oh, Bill got drunk.

557
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
I woke up the next morning with a busted up face.

558
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,920
Okay, hold on.

559
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,440
Now, wait a minute, Bill.

560
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,880
There's a gap there.

561
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,040
That's a pretty big gap.

562
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,760
I can say in all of my years of enjoying alcohol, I have never gotten so drunk that I've woken

563
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,960
up the next day, busted up, broken nose and multiple scrapes and gone,

564
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
well, something happened.

565
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,040
Yeah, sure.

566
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,240
No, I've woken up with two jellyfish on my chest like a bra.

567
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,160
Sure, who hasn't?

568
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
We've all been there.

569
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,560
I've woken up surrounded by busted up faces.

570
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,680
I just screamed like, oh, no, not again.

571
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,600
Yeah, sure, sure.

572
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,360
One time I woke up and I'd eaten the majority of the contents of a sandbox.

573
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
That was a bad one.

574
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,080
It wasn't even your sandbox.

575
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
It wasn't my sandbox.

576
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,800
One time I went to sleep and I dreamed I was eating a giant marshmallow and then when I

577
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:37,120
woke up, my pillow was gone, but it turned out I had pica and I was deficient in many

578
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
pillow-based minerals.

579
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,240
You just told a joke that everybody ever has heard at summer camp, but you took it and

580
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
you made it smart for the 21st Century podcast.

581
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,520
And slightly depressing because you couldn't help it.

582
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,880
It was a compulsion.

583
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,560
Yeah, apparently the paint they used in my low-income housing project was lead-based

584
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,680
and gave me pica, so I ate my pillow.

585
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,440
Did you not have anyone with you, Bill?

586
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,720
What kind of fucking friends let you fall on your face?

587
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,440
Bad ones.

588
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,400
Bill fell.

589
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,400
If you ever see people carrying people out of a bar drunk, this doesn't happen, Bill.

590
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,880
Yeah.

591
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,680
Bill, your resolution for this year of your life, be get better friends.

592
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:22,240
Get sturdier, more like of a bracing kind of friend.

593
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,740
Right.

594
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,360
How do you win them, you ask?

595
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Well, you can win more friends in two weeks of being interested in other people than you

596
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:33,760
can-

597
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,480
So you get interested in how you're going to hold them up.

598
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,000
And also, you can make more friends by not drinking so much that you stop being alive.

599
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,440
Okay, I want to bust this myth, Mythbusters style.

600
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,940
Okay.

601
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,280
It is not more fun to get so drunk that you can't fucking remember the fun you were having.

602
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,520
Yeah.

603
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,240
Right.

604
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,440
Like, that doesn't, like-

605
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,240
You can only hope-

606
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,360
I remember being that old.

607
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,720
I remember being 22 and in college and thinking that the only way I was really

608
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,840
celebrating my birthday is if I got so drunk that I couldn't remember.

609
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
That's stupid.

610
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,320
That's like saying I want to spend a bunch of money to go see a movie and fall asleep during it.

611
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,720
Unless you hire an archivist or some manner of scribe to follow-

612
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
A bard, perhaps, to follow you around.

613
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,440
A bard.

614
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay, if someone's writing an epic poem about it, then yes.

615
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,560
Travis, what's that one bard from Hercules named who writes songs on Hercules?

616
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,040
Ioli?

617
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,160
Iolus.

618
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,120
Travis, you know this.

619
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,080
I think it's Iolus.

620
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,560
Yaris.

621
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,760
It was played by Ted Bundy.

622
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,000
No?

623
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,560
No, it wasn't.

624
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,920
Ted-

625
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,720
Ted Raimi.

626
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,440
Ted Raimi.

627
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,120
And he was Andy Iolus.

628
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,840
What is it?

629
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,880
Iolus.

630
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,760
Aw, geek check.

631
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,200
Really?

632
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,880
Because you asked, like, eight times.

633
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,600
I got you.

634
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,400
I got you.

635
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,240
Griffin's gonna edit it so it's like-

636
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,560
He was actually on Xena and not Hercules.

637
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,400
Oh, man.

638
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,640
Travis, Griffin's gonna edit that in a way that's, like, makes it sound like a sick geek check.

639
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,480
I'm gonna pour a cup of water into another cup and make it sound like pee

640
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,920
and, like, the pee's going into your diaper.

641
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,360
Now I'm even more worried about the fact that maybe that's not the right name.

642
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,000
And I would look like a stupid geek.

643
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,120
I thought it was Jafar.

644
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,080
I'm pretty sure that's off base.

645
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,720
Joxer.

646
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,000
Joxer?

647
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,120
Then who is Iolus?

648
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,360
Oh, was that Bruce Campbell's character?

649
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,160
I think it was.

650
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,600
Good news, Travis, you have thoroughly dismissed my geek check.

651
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,760
You have passed the test or failed it.

652
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,480
I've lost track.

653
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
But was that Bruce Campbell's character?

654
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,280
I need you to check that now.

655
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,360
I'm not doing that.

656
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,080
Justin.

657
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,880
Moving on.

658
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,160
But Justin.

659
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,080
Let's go to the money zone.

660
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,120
Justin!

661
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,320
Do you like to fuck?

662
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,200
Fuck.

663
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
But you're bored with it.

664
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
Do you like to fuck on the cheap?

665
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,320
Do you like to fuck?

666
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,080
Not cheap, Travis, because these aren't cheap toys

667
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,800
we're talking about at ExtremeRestraints.com.

668
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,480
We're talking about value.

669
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
They're cost effective.

670
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,480
More inches per dollar.

671
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,520
You trying to fuck?

672
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,360
Sorry, I hadn't said it.

673
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,720
I wanted to say it because it sounded fun.

674
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,040
ExtremeRestraints.com is, and I don't think I'm out of line here,

675
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,880
it's an adult super store.

676
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
They've got everything.

677
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,720
It sure as fuck not a kid's super store.

678
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,480
It is an adult play land.

679
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,320
And I also want to stress, before we give the wrong idea,

680
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,880
they're super nice and it's a super great place.

681
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,680
They're the best.

682
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,480
Seriously, if you are going to buy sexual pleasure,

683
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
if you're going to buy marital aids, and you should,

684
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,240
this is the place to go.

685
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
Or premarital aids.

686
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
Okay, well, okay.

687
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,000
Okay, well, no, that's okay.

688
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,720
But it is a place to go.

689
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,640
They're really nice and it's super classy and great shit.

690
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,360
So much good feedback from the community.

691
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
So many purchases, so many happy customers,

692
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,320
and by happy, I mean they've cum buckets.

693
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,080
And if you want to buy a cum bucket,

694
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,640
that's on the third page, I think.

695
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,560
It is actually an augmented version of the game Mr. Bucket.

696
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,680
You put the balls in your mouth.

697
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,120
And you do indeed put the balls in your mouth.

698
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,000
Yeah, in fact, it is not actually that augmented at all.

699
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,400
It is basically just they sell Mr. Bucket.

700
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,160
And I know what you're asking, you're saying,

701
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,800
but Travis, I've priced cum buckets before,

702
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,160
and they were always 20% too expensive.

703
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,360
That's what's held me back.

704
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,360
Well, I've got good news.

705
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,080
That's right.

706
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,040
With the coupon code MIDDLEST, M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T,

709
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,960
and they're really super cool people that totally get it.

710
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,520
Very discreet, very discreet.

711
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,160
Very discreet.

712
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,080
And they make this fun, which it should be.

713
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,240
And their workers legit listen to My Brother, My Brother,

714
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,320
and Me while they're packaging your stuff.

715
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,840
Yeah, so imagine that a urethral sound probe

716
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,880
that you put in your urethra has been bombarded

717
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,680
by M-B-M-B-A-M at some point in the process.

718
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:28,320
Oh, that's great.

719
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:35,440
It's like we're singing a lullaby as the Master Blaster dildo.

720
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,520
No, there's gotta be a funnier thing.

721
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,240
Dildmatron.

722
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,520
It'll come to you.

723
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,800
So even if you're unsure, just go check it out

724
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,040
because you might surprise yourself

725
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,520
and find something on there that's interesting.

726
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,640
We've done 20 of these spots,

727
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,040
and we're sure you've enjoyed every single one,

728
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,680
but you've never thought, ah, that's just not for me.

729
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,640
Maybe it is for you.

730
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,520
Go Google it.

731
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
Go buy 20 cock rings, put them together,

732
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,000
make it look like an extra long lifesavers package.

733
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,880
And I want to say, I want to put in a brief note also

734
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,680
that as long as you're on the internet,

735
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
check out Squarespace 6.

736
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
You want to build a website,

737
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,680
you see all these other people get into websites,

738
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,880
maybe you want to build a website,

739
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
not a competitor at extremetrapace.com.

740
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,840
Well, you could build a website where you talk about

741
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,000
how awesome extremetrapace.com is.

742
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
Yeah, you can build the first extremetrapace.com fan site

743
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,680
with Squarespace 6.

744
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,080
Let me give you the big points you're going to notice

745
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,760
when you boot this up for the first time,

746
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,920
especially if you're a Squarespace 5 user,

747
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,040
you're ready for the next level.

748
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,520
Can I make a-

749
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,560
Beautiful new templates.

750
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,320
It's got a drag and drop interface,

751
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
got responsive design, and social media connectivity.

752
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,520

That's it.

756
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,840
If you want to get likes on the book,

757
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,320
you have got to get some cross post functionality in there.

758
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,400
That's the big thing about it right now,

759
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,920
is cross post functionality.

760
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,880
So listen, you're going to go to squarespace.com

761
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,480
and we're saving you money this week.

762
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,080

Saving you values by using the code MYBROTHER8.

764
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,600
That's M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R, the number eight.

765
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,080
No spaces.

766
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,880
No spaces.

767
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,480
You can save 10% at Squarespace.

768
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,920
So like, the internet's out there and there's plenty of space.

769
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,360
I know it seems like it's full,

770
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,160
but there's, there's a space for your idea.

771
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,800
My sister's going to appear in a local independent film.

772
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,400
She's super excited as this is her first acting experience.

773
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,600
And I'm proud of her for pursuing her dreams.

774
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,840
I'm looking forward to going to the premiere and supporting her,

775
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,120
but here's the problem.

776
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,440
There is evidently a risque love scene

777
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,280
and I feel weird about seeing my little sis in flagrante,

778
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,640
even if it's simulated.

779
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,240
How should I handle this?

780
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
Pretend I have to pee whenever things look like

781
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,760
they're heading to the bedroom.

782
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,400
Develop a sudden intense interest

783
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
in the bottle, bottom of my popcorn bag.

784
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,320
Prudish in Pennsylvania.

785
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,800
Well, don't do that because your dick's down there.

786
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
Yeah, that's your, and speaking of which,

787
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,120
it will probably not look great

788
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,880
is as soon as your sister gets naked,

789
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
you have to excuse yourself to the bathroom.

790
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,440
Yeah, gotta go to my bunk.

791
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,800
Bye.

792
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,760
I'll be in my bunk.

793
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,320
Here's the thing.

794
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Suckers.

795
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,920
You just watch the movie like an adult.

796
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,800
Yeah.

797
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,400
Listen, your sister's got a fine ass set of boobies.

798
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,560
No, I'm saying that she's pretending.

799
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,760
You sit there and enjoy.

800
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
Hey, hey, don't make me turn this car around.

801
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,400
Enjoy your sister's bosoms.

802
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,360
Don't pretend like you're not curious.

803
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,400
That's my thing.

804
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,080
And this is the best way to check them out.

805
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,600
No, we can't go down this road with you guys.

806
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,040
No, listen, for real,

807
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,160
this is the best way to check them and peep them because it's gonna be artsy and shit.

808
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,680
Check them and peep them.

809
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,560
They're artsy.

810
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,800
Never gonna get bad luck from Jesus or otherwise.

811
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,440
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like.

812
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,800
Like, like, like, like, love.

813
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,200
Sis, you look fantastic.

814
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,720
Psalm tonight.

815
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,840
Long story short.

816
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,480
Good work.

817
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
Like, like, like, like, like, like.

818
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,280
Game of Thrones.

819
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,240
I finally get it.

820
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,760
Like, like, like, like, like, like.

821
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,400
Oh, Jesus.

822
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,040
Oh, shit.

823
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm sorry, Prudish.

824
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,600
Um, there is so many.

825
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,560
There are so many.

826
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,680
We're joking because there's so many unknown fucking gradients.

827
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,320
Yeah.

828
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
How bad is the movie?

829
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,680
That also, what is the love scene?

830
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,280
What if it's really tasteless?

831
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,400
And if it's really tasteful and awesome and well shot and you never have to see it.

832
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,560
But if it's the fucking sex scene from the room,

833
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,200
get the fuck out of there along with everyone else.

834
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,600
Travis, that is comparatively mild.

835
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,800
Are you fucking kidding?

836
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,680
It goes from the sex scene in Forrest Gump

837
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,280
to the fucking ass to ass scene in Requiem for a Dream.

838
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,920
Like, things can get so bad in there.

839
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,600
Yeah, it can get really bad.

840
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,680
Things can get real thorny.

841
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,800
It's going to be tense.

842
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,920
You got to cut the tension.

843
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,400
Just wait.

844
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,640
But you can help your sister and this film company by saving 20% at ExtremeRestraints.com.

845
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,520
Wait for an opportune moment and then just shout.

846
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,080
Do a sit up.

847
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,760
Because I think that, first off, that's some great sister griefing right there.

848
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,960
I mean, you need to use this as a great opportunity to attack as your sibling.

849
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,680
Are you saying he should shame his sister's naked body in front of everyone?

850
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,240
Wait till in her first film appearance?

851
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,480
Wait till it's projected two stories high and then point out that maybe,

852
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,720
maybe cutting back on the snack or something.

853
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,160
It's like mom's pizza rolls have had quite an effect on your midriff.

854
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,400
Gross.

855
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,840
It won't be that weird.

856
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,880
It's only going to be weird if you make it weird.

857
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,320
And just pretend you're French.

858
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,760
Okay, real quick.

859
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,320
Just real quick.

860
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,520
If the podcast start for the next episode is my dick.

861
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm quitting the podcast.

862
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,520
Okay.

863
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,400
So let's not, but like an artsy dick.

864
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,360
Maybe someone did a cast up.

865
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,280
Oh God, you can't go.

866
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,520
You can't go to the movie.

867
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,200
You want to go to be supportive.

868
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,400
You can't go.

869
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,400
I just decided you can't go.

870
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Sorry.

871
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,320
If you, the thing is if, okay, if it's a premiere and they know the actress is there

872
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,040
and then there's a nude scene, they know her family's with her.

873
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,280
They are going, you have to be there.

874
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,560
They are going to look.

875
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,160
Everyone is going to look.

876
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,040
Especially if it's, it's a fucking local film.

877
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,640
Like everyone knows it.

878
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,280
You've got to invest yourself in the emotion of the scene.

879
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,360
That's the only way you're going to get through it.

880
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,160
Like if you weird yourself out about it, it's going to get weird.

881
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,320
If you just really think about how touching it is and God, I hope it's touching.

882
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Cause if it's like some brown bunny stuff, I don't know what to tell you.

883
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,040
You are just in a bad way.

884
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,840
This, this represents a time in which getting so drunk that you cannot remember what happened

885
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,840
may not be a better.

886
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,080
Yeah.

887
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,960
Maybe just hoist a few or eight before.

888
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,800
Can I inject what may be an unpopular opinion though?

889
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,720
Do you know what would be really more uncomfortable than going to the movie and watching your

890
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:15,520
sister bone down or up is if you went and everything about the movie was really terrible

891
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,480
and then you had to pretend that you loved it for me.

892
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,160
That would be more uncomfortable than watching, than watching like Justin and Travis in a

893
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:32,960
Caligulon orgy scene if they were in the movie, listen to me, listen to me, yes, maybe let's

894
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
yes, yes, yes.

895
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,480
You have a horrible imagination and you're a terrible person.

896
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,040
It can get weird.

897
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,120
It can get weird up in there, but let me finish my point.

898
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,600
Okay.

899
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,280
Go on, please continue.

900
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:53,120
I would rather watch that in a good movie where you both did good acty jobs than a movie

901
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,440
than a movie where you both tastefully, tastefully made love.

902
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,920
No skin at all.

903
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,080
You could be wearing wet suits and dry humping, but you act really bad and then for the rest

904
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,520
of my life, I have to carry that weight.

905
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,720
I feel like some shit just came out, but listen.

906
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:22,720
You're saying the after effect of having to say I loved it because you watched them have

907
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,560
sex is weird or because it was terrible and you had to lie.

908
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,000
It's going to be better.

909
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,360
You can joke about, oh, man, you really took that hog, you took that hog so good.

910
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,480
I was really proud of the way you took that hog.

911
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,880
You really, it was like wild hogs in there.

912
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,520
You did not hold back and I was deeply impressed.

913
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,640
I haven't seen a hog embrace that openly since at the end of Wild Hogs when Tim Gunn hugged

914
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,360
Tim Allen and then David Alan Grier watched.

915
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,400
I haven't seen the movie.

916
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
You can goof that, but you know what you can't goof?

917
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:07,680
Man, you are just not going to make it here.

918
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,720
This is not going to work.

919
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,720
This is not going to be your jam.

920
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,280
Look on the bright side, it's going to be uncomfortable for you and it's going to be

921
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,360
better than the utter shame your parents will feel.

922
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:23,040
They're just going to be really embarrassed and wonder where they went wrong.

923
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,360
Look, Darlene, we made that and now it's having sex in front of us 80 feet tall.

924
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,280
In front of, oh, all of our friends and oh, there's some neighbors.

925
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,680
Look at that bosom, man.

926
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
She is really getting slam jammed up there.

927
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,200
Glad we made that.

928
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,440
How could they afford Mickey Rourke for this movie?

929
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,480
This is great.

930
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,000
That's our DNA up there getting slam-o jam-o'd by Mickey Rourke.

931
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,520
Hey, please pass me the knives.

932
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,360
I'd like to die a bit more if that's okay with everyone here.

933
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,080
I'd like to be less alive than I am currently, which is to say all the way dead and not like

934
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,200
Bill and Ted dead where I come back later as soon as your hijinks.

935
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,800
I mean, dead as fuck.

936
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,680
Like Oblivion embracing the sweet Oblivion.

937
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,880
This sprite is delicious.

938
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
What a good acting you did.

939
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm so proud of you.

940
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,640
I hope we all go to Applebee's afterwards and talk about it.

941
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,440
I hope you do.

942
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,560
I'll be dead.

943
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,960
By the way, I just want to say that accounting degree I paid for is really paying off.

944
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,080
Let's just finish the show.

945
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,760
We're only at like 45 minutes.

946
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,480
It was great.

947
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,560
We've helped literally no one.

948
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
We laughed at the first person.

949
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,640
We gave no helpful advice to the second person.

950
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,480
Made fun of them for being an alcoholic.

951
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,000
And the last person, we told them to enjoy a sister boner.

952
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,560
We're great.

953
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,680
Let's keep going forward.

954
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,360
The way I imagine it is people listen to this show one chapter at a time spread out over

955
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,160
the week.

956
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,720
So since they did not have Monday and Tuesday to go through with us, that means that they

957
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,520
only need five sevenths of the show they normally get because it doesn't have to last them as

958
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:03,840
long.

959
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,040
Does that make sense?

960
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,080
None of it did.

961
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,440
In fact, it stopped making sense so soon that I didn't listen to most of it.

962
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:11,680
Good.

963
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,040
You guys want to hear a great joke?

964
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,840
It's on Yahoo.

965
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,120
Okay.

966
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,080
Justin Cain sent it in.

967
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,440
I've never read a Yahoo joke before.

968
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,160
We'll see how it works.

969
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,560
Ronnie says, how do you make a horse laugh then cry?

970
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,040
To make a horse laugh, you go up to the horse and whisper in their ear, my dick is bigger

971
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,680
than yours.

972
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,480
To make a horse cry, the guy shows him his penis and it was bigger.

973
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,880
That is a pretty that almost beats my Pika joke.

974
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,800
Almost comes close.

975
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,440
Yeah.

976
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,320
The top answer on that says horses don't care about penis size.

977
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,160
Bullshit, they don't.

978
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,760
They don't even speak English, you guys.

979
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,120
You don't evolve penises that big without some sort of underlying biological imperative.

980
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,480
And a man with a penis larger than a horse's is to be pity.

981
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,920
He will never have a full erection and could not lay with a woman even if he could.

982
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,560
Weird.

983
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:10,960
Yes.

984
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,320
Do you guys want another Yahoo?

985
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,120
I guess.

986
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,400
It was sent in by Krista Whalen.

987
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:16,960
Thanks, Krista.

988
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user Gaara who asks, can a spirit get you pregnant?

989
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,920
My friend's boyfriend just died 10 days ago and she thinks his spirit had sex with her

990
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,120
while she was sleeping.

991
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,440
And when she woke up, she had blank in her Virginia.

992
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,560
Is it possible to get pregnant from a spirit?

993
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:52,320
Do you know what a sad commentary it is that I had to wait to the end of that question

994
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:56,400
before I could remember whether or not we have answered this question?

995
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,240
It was literally to the point where you had a blank in her Virginia before I realized,

996
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,720
no, I guess we haven't specifically talked about this.

997
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,760
Four of our variations and also it's a Tuesday.

998
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,800
Oh, OK.

999
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,040
Yeah.

1000
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,880
Variations on a ghost come theme, I think, is what we've had.

1001
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,200
Right.

1002
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,880
That is also my favorite Miles Davis record.

1003
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:21,440
Sure.

1004
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,840
If you've never enjoyed variations.

1005
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,040
I go to the alternate.

1006
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,120
The alternate title was kind of boo.

1007
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,520
Kind of goo.

1008
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah.

1009
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,880
Kind of boo goo.

1010
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,120
I guess.

1011
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,600
I mean, once you read a question like that, is it possible?

1012
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
No, don't even answer that question.

1013
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:44,480
Isn't it possible?

1014
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,640
I mean, isn't it possible?

1015
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,840
Listen, guys.

1016
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,240
OK.

1017
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
Medical science is still finding new things out every day.

1018
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:52,720
OK.

1019
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,480
So yes, the answer is yes.

1020
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,960
OK, so you're saying there's infinite life in the universe and it's always expanding.

1021
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,600
So why can't your friend find a little bit of ghost come around her vagina?

1022
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,080
Yes.

1023
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,720
For what?

1024
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,800
That sentence was the grossest.

1025
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,360
Yeah, nothing.

1026
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,720
I like I like that this question is not my friend has gotten pregnant and claims that

1027
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,960
it's from a spirit, but the fear.

1028
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,680
Yeah, yeah.

1029
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,120
That, oh, God, I hope she doesn't get pregnant from a spirit.

1030
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,520
Sure.

1031
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,280
Let's let's let's read something else.

1032
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,240
This is this is off.

1033
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,840
Let's say anything else.

1034
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,040
OK, guys, I want you to know.

1035
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,960
You know, the oldest was the friend on Hercules.

1036
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,320
Our holocaust was the name of Bruce Campbell's thief character, which appeared on both shows.

1037
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,280
OK, OK.

1038
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,480
I just wanted to clear that up.

1039
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,600
I didn't want all the emails.

1040
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,360
How is there any debate about that?

1041
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,360
We didn't clear that up in the question.

1042
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,960
I apologize for whoever is building a thing outside of my house.

1043
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,080
I don't want to I don't want to talk too loud because they might hear me.

1044
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,080
But it's it's six, 16 p.m.

1045
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,760
Who the fuck is building something now of all the building?

1046
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,680
I'm too afraid to look out because he's like literally he's looking at the window.

1047
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,680
Guys, I'm on the first floor.

1048
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,960
He'll literally see me.

1049
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,400
Look out the window.

1050
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,680
You're a coward.

1051
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,760
It's completely, completely irrational.

1052
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,600
But if you're building something, people are going to look.

1053
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,280
He probably wants people to look.

1054
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:11,840
I'm going to see.

1055
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,440
But what if he's building like what he's making a murder room?

1056
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,880
What if he's making a murder room?

1057
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,200
What if you look out the window and he's building a coffin?

1058
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,080
It just points at you.

1059
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:21,520
Maybe.

1060
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,360
But you know what would be more awkward?

1061
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,960
If he was making art and he was bad at it and made eye contact with me.

1062
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,800
And also he was naked.

1063
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,360
In Griffin's spectrum of social anxiety,

1064
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,320
literally the worst thing that can ever happen to anybody is someone making bad art.

1065
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,040
You think I'm joking.

1066
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,960
You probably actually know that I'm not joking,

1067
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,120
but the people who are listening probably think I am joking.

1068
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,720
I don't want to comment on that.

1069
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:52,640
Let me see what this let me see what he's making the Hindenburg.

1070
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,040
It was terrible, but at least there was a drawing on the side.

1071
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,240
Yeah.

1072
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,400
Maybe there was someone on there doing a bad monologue,

1073
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,160
which are playing piano badly,

1074
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,920
in which case that would have all made it a literal birdhouse.

1075
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,520
A literal birdhouse.

1076
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,960
He's building a birdhouse.

1077
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,240
A literal birdhouse.

1078
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,360
It's 617.

1079
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,480
No kids in sight.

1080
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,160
He's on speed.

1081
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,840
This birdhouse.

1082
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,680
He had to build that right now and it could not wait.

1083
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
He has to work through his meth energy.

1084
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,440
This birdhouse is for Ronnie.

1085
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,200
Ronnie's had a hard week, even though it's only Tuesday.

1086
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,560
Ran out of meth on a Sunday.

1087
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,800
Gotta build a birdhouse.

1088
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,080
I can't listen.

1089
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,880
We've built this.

1090
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,040
We have done built this birdhouse and I'm not going to talk anymore about people.

1091
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,360
So thanks for listening to our podcast that we share together.

1092
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,000
You've gotten through it again.

1093
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,760
I know you said you wouldn't be back.

1094
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,960
And yet here you are.

1095
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,080
So now who's the weak one?

1096
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,400
Sorry it was so late.

1097
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,000
And also it's so short.

1098
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,360
But it's not short.

1099
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,640
It's going to be a great length.

1100
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,520
Perfect length.

1101
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,080
Pretty short.

1102
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,920
But it's been a fucking insane month, you guys.

1103
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,400
I don't need your sympathy.

1104
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,440
I want it.

1105
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,400
But yeah.

1106
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,600
You want sympathy because you got a free trip to Germany

1107
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,680
and then you got to spend a week in Mexico?

1108
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,400
I pity you.

1109
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:10,640
Listen.

1110
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:11,280
So sad.

1111
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:11,680
Listen to me.

1112
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
Unlike, unlike, unlike, unlike.

1113
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,080
Okay.

1114
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,280
Okay, but listen.

1115
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,880
I forgot what I was going to say because Travis got real mean there for a second.

1116
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,360
I'm sorry, Griffin, but I want to go to Mexico.

1117
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:23,840
I know.

1118
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,920
But I want to go to Harmony.

1119
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,840
It's all over now is what I mean to say.

1120
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,520
I want to thank.

1121
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,800
We've got an NBNBAM Wisdom Twitter follow.

1122
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,760
We didn't create it.

1123
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,040
A friend of ours did.

1124
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,680
Not a friend.

1125
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,280
I mean, it is a friend of ours.

1126
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,240
But we don't know who the fuck it is.

1127
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:40,960
We don't know who it is.

1128
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,080
We just know it's a friend.

1129
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,800
Can we keep it that way?

1130
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,080
Can we keep it like Zoro?

1131
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,240
Yeah, they need their.

1132
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,840
I actually know who it is and they need their anonymity code.

1133
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,880
Tell me who it is right now.

1134
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,080
I can't tell you.

1135
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:54,640
At NBNBAM Wisdom.

1136
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:03,200
And there's also a similar wonderful Tumblr that is actually NBNBAM-Wisdom.tumblr.com.

1137
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,360
The two were created independently of each other.

1138
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,640
So you figure that one out.

1139
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,320
So thanks to both of them.

1140
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,360
Just a quick question.

1141
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,560
Sorry, I hate to keep interrupting, but just Travis, just real quick.

1142
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,360
Is it Gary Oldman?

1143
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,000
I can't say.

1144
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,480
Fuck!

1145
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,360
Is it Paul Ryan?

1146
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:18,960
I can't say.

1147
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,360
Okay.

1148
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,480
Is it Arianna Huffington?

1149
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,840
Yeah.

1150
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,160
No!

1151
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,440
God damn, I can't say!

1152
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,320
Is it a he or a she?

1153
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,200
Does he wear glasses?

1154
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,720
Is it Troy Aikman?

1155
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,640
Does he have a beard?

1156
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,360
Does he have red hair?

1157
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,640
Those are all the people that I know.

1158
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,480
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

1159
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,560
Thanks to Jacob Dixon, another Huntington, West Virginia native.

1160
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:45,760
Uh, Landon Bell, Steph Kingston, Perch Snickers, Shredspread, Joey Blanton, uh, Aaron Kreitz,

1161
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:54,480
BigBadGunner, Latu-tst-tst-tst-er, uh, FollowHereThere, Scoot, Zernick, everybody tweeting about the

1162
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:54,800
show.

1163
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,080
If you want to share it, NBNBAM is the hashtag.

1164
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:05,600
Bit.ly forward slash it's my bim bam is the, uh, is our, our, uh, sampler.

1165
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,880
If you want to share that with someone.

1166
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,320
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1167
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,720
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1168
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,480
Thanks for letting us use that tune, guys.

1169
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,840
Thanks guys.

1170
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,120
It's a good, it's a good jam.

1171
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:22,240
But I want to thank Ted Ramey for allowing, uh, his personality to be used on the show.

1172
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,800
Thank you for your likeness, Ted.

1173
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,480
Is it Ted, is Ted Ramey him?

1174
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,240
Is it, it's not, it's not Ted Ramey.

1175
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,200
I would, believe me, guys, I would tell you if it was Ted Ramey.

1176
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,880
I bet it's not somebody famous at all.

1177
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,880
No, it's gotta be somebody famous.

1178
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,080
Why would you say that?

1179
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:40,880
I'm just.

1180
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,440
It obviously, it doesn't count otherwise.

1181
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,480
I mean, they're not famous yet.

1182
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,360
They are one day going to be famous because of this Twitter account when they fucking

1183
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,560
just take our goofs.

1184
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,520
Fucking not persona non grata.

1185
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,960
Just take them from, just take them from us and repurpose them.

1186
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,400
Griffin, give me the last question.

1187
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,120
How are you guys cool with this?

1188
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,040
This guy is like a perfect, it's like Carlos.

1189
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,120
It's like the Carlos Garcia of Twitters.

1190
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:03,600
I would.

1191
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:10,000
It's like, it's like Carlos Garcia if he named his, his something like Joe Rogan jokes.

1192
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,560
Yeah, I do want to say that I wish he would.

1193
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,720
I don't trust anybody that has an egg on Twitter.

1194
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,760
I need you to change your egg to something us theme.

1195
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:19,040
Yeah.

1196
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,960
Okay, Griffin hit me.

1197
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,480
Can you get us hatching from the egg?

1198
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,600
I'm ready.

1199
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,360
We're hatching from your egg.

1200
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,320
I will Photoshop that for you if you want or somebody will.

1201
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,200
Here we go.

1202
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,360
Krista Whelan sent this one in, thank you, Krista.

1203
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,320
Return to form.

1204
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,360
