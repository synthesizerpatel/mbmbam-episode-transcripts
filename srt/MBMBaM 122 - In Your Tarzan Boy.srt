1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,320
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my brother, my brother and me. This is an election alert.

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Travis. Scandal, scandals and scams here on the political front. My brother, my brother and me

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,600
gate 2012. Electioneering. Ladies and gentlemen, all we've heard from the politicians is that they

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
want us to rock the vote. Get out there and rock the vote. Rock the vote. Rock the vote, baby.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,360
Rock the vote. Don't tip the vote over. Yeah. Inspired by their please, we brothers decided

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,120
to make an effort, and for the first time in our adult lives, vote for a presidential candidate,

11
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:29,040
and we were barred from voting. I showed up at my polling place, and I was like, I'm ready to punch

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,440
my ticket for the campaign that you, the listener, want me to vote for. And they said, this is a

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,920
Kentucky Fried Chicken, sir. Please get out. They said, this is an elementary school that is currently

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,720
in session. You cannot be here right now. Barring my voting, can I please have a super donut? As

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,040
long as I'm here at this school. Not that it will in any way, quelch the injustice. No. That has,

16
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,960
quelch is quelch award. Quelch is, sure. Squelch? Squelch is when, I think it's like the form where

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:11,280
people eat poop. Okay. So listen. Quelch and you queef at the same time. Oh God. Here's what I'm

18
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,920
concerned about. More than, I am concerned, obviously, that I don't get to participate in

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,600
our nation's greatest franchise. There it is. That's the big one. Second big one is that Jay's

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,480
told me, I'm going to fucking die now. I'm going to fucking die. Because he offered me a choice,

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,080
and it was vote or die. Did you say Jay's? Jay's, it's short for Jay Z. The nation said,

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,640
you can't vote Griffin. And by the nation, I mean the principal of McCluskey's elementary school

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,520
nearby. McCluskey's is what the elementary school is called. And I can't vote, so I'm a fucking dead

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,840
man now. I don't know how it's going to happen. Well, he's had a good run. But death is just

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
looming around the corner, I guess. Jay Z has an army of assassins. They're hiding in the rafters.

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,960
So is it just like P Diddy and Jay Z just roll around town being like, you vote? Did you vote?

27
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,960
You didn't vote? Dead. No, I imagine they have people for that. It's sort of like,

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,080
have you seen the new season of Making the Band? Yes, of course. So in episode two, they make him

29
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,320
get him a cheesecake from Jersey, and they have two hours to do it. And then the episode after

30
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,040
that, they go around and they kill disinterested youths. I see. Yeah, that's what happened to Biggie.

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,280
They were like, Biggie, did you vote? And he's like, only in the national elections,

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
not on the local bond issues. And they shot him for that. They shot him. That's something they

33
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,480
shot him for. Guys, flip your fucking ballot. Vote on the back. Yeah, come on. You know,

34
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,040
there's stuff back there. You think you punch, you go straight. President Bartlett is disappointed

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,680
in you if you don't vote on the back, bitches. Oh, can we start our own thing? Like, there's

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,200
important stuff. Like, if you go straight ticket, you're not going to get it. Can we get like a,

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,640
can we get t-shirts with like flip that bitch on it? Flip that bitch. Flip that bitch and vote its

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,240
ass out. Jed Bartlett says flip that bitch. I want to get into the advice because theoretically,

39
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:04,240
that's what this program is about. But I did want to call everybody's attention to two emails that

40
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:12,000
just showed up in my inbox as I was preparing to look at our question list for the first time.

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,480
Two emails back to back from Amazon. The first is alerting me that my book about how to be

42
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,560
fiscally responsible has shipped that I ordered on Friday. Ironically, it cost $3,500.

43
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,960
The email directly after that alerts me that my DVD of the complete series of Captain Power has

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,240
shipped. It occurs to me that the email of the book about financial solvency should just read,

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,840
don't do that thing you did above. If you can keep yourself from doing that, I think you will be in

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,800
good shape. Step one, delete Amazon. Yeah, right. Borrow yourself from Amazon. This is My Brother,

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,040
My Brother, Me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm

48
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Guys,

49
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,440
you got to reg to voe. Literally, it's the easiest fucking thing in the world. Yeah. Yeah,

50
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:20,160
you can get online and reg to voe at regtovoe.org. Reg to voe.org, just double checking that.

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,240
Number two, or write T-O-O. It's a very confusing URL. And then whether you go with Barry or if you

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,200
go with Mitt, either way. Either way, our nation ends up a winner because of democracy. Or if you

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,280
go for some weird third-party candidate, some crazy, stupid fucking third-party candidate.

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,040
Yeah. Or maybe if you just want to shit your vote into the sun. Whatever, it's up to you.

55
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,200
I respect your stupid fucking choice. Yeah. Do that dumbass thing you did. But if the nation

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,400
fucks up, it's your fucking fault, you big... If you want to write in us, this is an option.

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,720
Yeah. Something you can do. If we get 5% of the vote, we get funding. So that's pretty nice.

58
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:11,920
That's great. I had a sign pasted in the window of my Cutlass Sierra that just said,

59
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:19,280
Bush and Gore make me want a Ralph. And that was in 19... What is it?

60
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:27,200
1974. That was in the year 2000. I used to be so young and so willing to just shoot my vote

61
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,440
into the sun. You were also a... I actually registered Green Party the first time I

62
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,680
registered. Yeah. I registered independent, I think. You were actually a charter member of

63
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,400
the Bob Dole Patrol, if memory serves. Right. That was a political action group that I was

64
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,600
in when I was 16 that was devoted to the fact that Bob Dole is kind of funny. So that was

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:02,640
not a lot of big changes. Poetically, there's a nice syllogism with Bob Dole and the word patrol.

66
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,000
And when you put them together, it sounds like a thing that you can really be a part of.

67
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,280
Yeah, it sounds really good. It was like a Bob Dole street team.

68
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,040
Syllogism may not be the right word for that, but it sounded like the right word to use in that

69
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:24,480
scenario. So anyway, questions, advice, help. My boss at work has an odd way to say a passing hello

70
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,880
and it's confusing me. Walk by me and say, what do you think? But not asking about anything in

71
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,680
particular. This happens a few times every day and I don't know how to respond. What kind of

72
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
thing should I say? Should I come up with a standard response or should I mix it up a little

73
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
bit? Help me, brothers. That's from Confusion Cincinnati. There's literally so many ways to

74
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,080
respond to this. What do you think? My favorite being, what do you think? Yeah. Just turn the

75
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,360
mirror up to nature and make him go, that doesn't make any sense. Exactly. Does this guy have a

76
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,680
fucking aphasia? What is going on? Maybe he's losing weight and so every time he sees you,

77
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,440
he wants to know what you think of this slimmer silhouette. What do you think? How's this visage?

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,280
What do you think of this lean body? I guess, what can you do? That's a pretty good response,

79
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,360
right? What do you think? What can you do? No, I think you've got to randomly pick an adjective

80
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,680
that you can give to him as a response. Like, oh, pretty wet or something like that. See,

81
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,440
I was going to say a noun and you're going to be like, potatoes. Well, that doesn't make sense

82
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,800
because when he's asking, what do you think we're going to have for lunch? Okay. But he would say

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,520
that, I think. What do you think? Maybe there's someone that always sees your boss before you

84
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,960
that says, do you guys want to go out after work? And then the boss is saying what you think about

85
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,280
it. But you were not part of the A part of the conversation. Okay. And so he dips your head. And

86
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:07,040
then your response to what should we eat for lunch is potatoes. Potatoes. Mash them, boil them,

87
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:18,080
stick them in a stew. I don't know. Travis is a bore, so it's good. Grub? Grub? Travis is Timon

88
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,320
and I'm Pumba and we have a comedy podcast. It's called Timon and Pumba. And not Griffin.

89
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,440
And not Griffin because he's not down with bugs. Hey, maybe that's a good response. What do you

90
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:42,640
think? Hakuna matata. I love it. Maybe is an option. Hakuna matata. Okay, here's what you do.

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,720
What do you think? If it's Wednesday, you say hump day. And then if it's Monday, you say pump day.

92
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,560
Tuesday's jump day. Thursday's dump day. Friday's sump day. And Friday's sump day. Right. So you

93
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:08,400
just kind of really keep them off. This to me seems like the aesthetic ideal, like the culmination

94
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:19,520
of all sort of insubstantial office phrases. Like all of the things like, I guess it's Monday and

95
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,000
looking forward to the weekend. I feel like this is, he has boiled it down into a single freight.

96
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,040
He seems like the master of office ology. Hey, have you guys ever heard of Dilbert?

97
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,960
Yeah. The only response that is appropriate to this is like a prolonged atonal shout.

98
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
That's what it'll come to. This is what office conversations devolved into.

99
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
Yeah, this really is the next step before just like-

100
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,840
Just slapping each other in the face. Let me hit you with this confusion,

101
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,800
sister Nanny. How's this grab you? How long do you have? Oh man. That sounds good, right?

102
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,240
What do you think? How long do you have? And then you go about your merry way. Yeah,

103
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,520
because he doesn't want to fuck with that. He's dueling with you. He sets you up to see like,

104
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,360
can you say something even more inane than the thing that I just said? And then he says,

105
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,200
oh, well me, I've got all day. And then you just stand in the hallway and stare at each other.

106
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,200
And then that's your whole- Why don't you carry around in your pocket

107
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
a magic eight ball? Okay.

108
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,800
And every time you ask, shake it and be like, ask again later. Think about it. Think about it.

109
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,600
Okay. Why don't you just say, why don't you say hello, you creepy fuck, instead of the thing

110
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,840
that you just- Why don't you talk to me? Why don't you quit your job?

111
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,760
Listen, I'm not someone- Get a different job.

112
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm not a cog in this office machine. I'm a human fucking being. I was born,

113
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,960
like you were born, except I was born in a bathtub. Listen, I'm going to die one day.

114
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,440
I have dead friends and relatives. We've all shared the same pain and heartache.

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,720
We're all just trying to get by. Just fucking talk to me like a human being.

116
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,200
But here's my question about this. Is there any difference between like,

117
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,320
what do you think and like, hey, how's it going? What's up? How you doing? Like,

118
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,640
the answer doesn't fucking matter because nobody really wants the answer to the question.

119
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,760
You know, because if they did, they'd stop and be like, hey, are you doing all right?

120
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,840
How's it going? What's up? It's always said in passing. What do you think?

121
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,880
It's just a string of words that sounds in some way pleasant, but non-committal.

122
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,600
And it's hard because people give me a hard time for doing everything in my power to try to ignore

123
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,680
the fact that people are around me or to try to keep from acknowledging people's presence.

124
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,040
But I'm just trying to avoid conversations like this. We have nothing to say to each other usually.

125
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,560
That's it. I'd rather have this than somebody that just goes, hey, as they pass you and you're like,

126
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,000
are you just acknowledging the fact that I exist?

127
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,080
Can we just all high five? You know, like, hey, up top.

128
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,400
Wordlessly, emotionally high five.

129
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,000
Exactly. Like cursory, perfunctory, professional.

130
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,720
You don't have to make it an event every time. Just like you're walking by. Boom.

131
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,160
And then maybe like they did a really great job in the account and you're like, hey, down low.

132
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,920
You know? Down low. Too slow.

133
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
You make it count. Sorry, boss.

134
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,280
Ugh. Griffin.

135
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:36,400
I could never work in a fucking office, man. It's, oh God.

136
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,440
I would be the weirdest dude at the office. At this point now, my like, I used to work in,

137
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
when I worked in newspapers, I would work in offices and I managed to like keep a

138
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,520
uh, fucking leash on whatever my situation is. But now that I've been working at home for this long,

139
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,560
I would li- Oh my God.

140
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,240
I would be so high strung. If somebody walked up to me and said like,

141
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,080
what do you think? I'd be like, just please no. Please no. Please.

142
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,880
I would be that guy who stacks up books around his cubicle so you can't see what he's doing.

143
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
Like I would be the weird hermit in the corner.

144
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,120
See, I work, I work in an office, but it's a theater office. And so like,

145
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,640
if I were to transition to like a real adult place, then they probably wouldn't approve of

146
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,440
my mind and my friends games of like flipping people off during meetings as long as nobody

147
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,560
noticed. And like me sitting in my cubicle and converting Nerf guns into steampunk weaponry.

148
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:30,800
Like-

149
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,080
We used to have, we used to have a game like that when I worked at Best Buy

150
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,720
where my friend Stevo, who, as people call him Stevo, it wasn't a nickname.

151
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,880
My friend Stevo would, whenever a boss was, had their back turned to us,

152
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,360
he would flip them off. And he would always say, he was giving them a quote,

153
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,640
cold one right between the shoulder blades. That's how he would describe it. Did you see that?

154
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,800
I just gave Deborah a cold one between the shoulder blades. Like yeah, you got her again,

155
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,120
Stevo. I guess. I guess.

156
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,200
How about a Yahoo? This one was sent in by Jack Mack. Thanks Jack Mack.

157
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
Hi for listening, Stevo. Hey, who's listening?

158
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,080
He's not. He's dead. Thanks Jack Mack. Yeah, this one was asked by Yahoo!

159
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,200
answers user Natalie, who asks, what's the point of drinking so much water if you're just going

160
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,240
to pee it all out? Thank you.

161
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,200
I'll drink full water bottles a day because I hear about how important it is to drink lots of water

162
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,720
and then I have to pee all the time? What's the point? It comes right out, like 20 men after I

163
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:40,240
drink it. No, but really. Okay, seriously though. Yeah. Why is my, okay, listen, I know this seems

164
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,520
like a crazy question, but why is science telling me to drink eight glasses of water

165
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,000
if I'm just going to pee it? My body doesn't even pee it, you guys.

166
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,080
Yeah, my body's not using that liquid, right? That's true. That is true. That's true because

167
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,800
whenever you pee, your pee is, and I don't want to get gross, but it is just the exact fluids that

168
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,440
you put in your mouth that went through your body like a silly straw and then it comes out. That's

169
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,520
like sometimes you drink a lot of Coke and then you pee and it's just Coke, you know? Or when you

170
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,000
drink a lot of Ecto Coolers and it's just straight Ecto Coolers. Chav, you shouldn't be drinking,

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,320
sorry, they stopped making Ecto Coolers in like 1985. You shouldn't be drinking those.

172
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
It doesn't go bad, Griffin. It's already green. What's going to happen? It doesn't go bad. It

173
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,240
goes spooky. Oh, it's thick like mood slime. Yeah. Also, I sleep 18 hours a day. Okay.

174
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:41,440
Not on purpose. No, this is important. See guys, the water catches all the stuff that's in you

175
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,040
that's bad and then it takes it out of your body. Okay, compare it to the movie Osmosis Jones. What

176
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,560
does it do? Osmosis Jones. So you got fucking Chris Rock and he's Osmosis Jones and then you

177
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,520
have the big pill guy that's played by David Hyde Pierce? Yep. And he's in there and they're

178
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,840
fighting, okay, and they're fighting all the guys. But what if instead of those two, there was a

179
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:11,520
bunch of water and we'll say that the water is played by... God, I just can't think of a funny

180
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,080
actor off the top of my head. Jon Hamm. Medea. It's played by Medea, the actor.

181
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,560
Imagine that movie, it was six minutes long because that's how long it takes for fluid to go

182
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,200
through your body. Uh-huh. Right. And Chris Rock is there and he's speaking like Chris Rock like I

183
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,360
can't. Just give it a try. Without alienating our listeners. So Chris Rock is there, he says,

184
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm Osmosis Jones. And so he's there and he's fighting the crime. And then all of a sudden,

185
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,600
the movie's over because a flood hits them, like sort of like deep impact and everyone dies. But

186
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,960
then it's good that they're dead because they're poisonous bacteria. Osmosis Jones is just the

187
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,600
story of the day Bill Murray forgot to drink water. That's all that happens. Did you guys remember

188
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,320
they're in Bill Murray's body? They totally were. Would it be great? I would love to see a remake

189
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,680
of Osmosis Jones that took place in Travis's body. It would be like fucking Dante's Inferno.

190
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,840
Hey, don't you guys think... Did you guys ever watch Slim Goodbody? You know, the picture of...

191
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Wouldn't it be awesome if just once you could see like an awesome dookie inside him? Slim Goodbody?

192
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,080
Yeah, like one ribald... You're saying like if you could look through Slim Goodbody and see a

193
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,640
pit performing... Just one episode, like a deleted scene somewhere where he's like eyes aren't...

194
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:43,200
And a bunch of corned beef. I gotta get fit and then go shit. I'm packing a solid... Excuse me,

195
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,920
everyone. I'm packing a solid bolus in here. This is going to turn... Hey, Slim, is that a balloon

196
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:58,080
full of heroin inside you? Did you ingest that? That's horrifying. Let's get real. Let's get real.

197
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,920
Let's drop the stigma and let's just get real science in this, okay? Okay, finally. It feels

198
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:13,040
great when you pee and you look at the pee and it's totally clear. You feel like you're doing

199
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,800
such a great job keeping yourself healthy. You feel like you just did a hundred sit-ups because

200
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,920
you know that your drink game is right. Yeah, right. I think that is its own reward. Sure.

201
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,640
Because it's like, you know, potty training and then you go to the big show and you really step

202
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,440
it up. Yeah. Gold medal. There's a lot of internal processes that you don't know about.

203
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,520
Do you guys ever get... It's like nine o'clock at night and you feel like dog shit and you realize

204
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,800
it's because you literally haven't drank a drop of water all day. Yeah. That happens to me. I keep

205
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,440
a bottle just pumping. It happens to me. I'll look down and I'll see like, oh, there's an empty glass

206
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,200
of wine and a beer and two empty Diet Sunkist cans. It's like, ah, fuck. That's all I drank today?

207
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,080
Then you'll pee in them. Why would you fucking do that, Travis?

208
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,160
Because they're right there. He doesn't have to be. He's not drinking any water,

209
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,800
weren't you listening? He would still pee with wine. It's just red.

210
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,040
You don't know what you're fucking talking about. What are you talking about? You're not a scientist,

211
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:17,440
like, Griffin. Did you miss when I said it's time to get real science? No. And you were like,

212
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,960
I want to get weird science. Let's get Kim Cotrol up in here. Was she not? I think you could... I

213
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,760
love the after movie pee. That's always such a good one. When you really... I mean, it is essential.

214
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,640
I think that there are some movies that I actually remember more fondly because of the awesome,

215
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,720
awesome pee I had afterwards. But at the same time, there's nothing worse than the revolt that

216
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
happens in your body when you're in the... I remember I was watching Captain America in theaters

217
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,480
and an hour in, all I had to do was pee. And I was so mad at my body. You got to go. You got to go,

218
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,080
or else you'll make it to the end of the movie and your friends will be like, what did you think?

219
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,040
You'd be like, I fucking hated it. I was so stressed out the whole time. And now I have

220
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:10,880
liver problems. Yeah. It makes the fight a lot more climactic. Just beat him. Just beat the red

221
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,680
skull. Just hit him. Just shoot him with a gun or something. Jesus. I am incapable of that.

222
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,440
Just shoot him with a gun or something. Jesus. I am incapable of making it through a whole

223
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,040
movie without peeing, which I should probably talk to a doctor about. It's mostly because

224
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,640
I watch movies at the draft house. And so I'm constantly drinking while I'm watching the movie

225
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,640
and that stuff just goes right through me. So I've actually gotten very good at identifying

226
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,120
the moment in a movie where it's like, oh, here comes some exposition. I can go. I have a minute

227
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,960
and a half. I'll run. I don't want to turn into an app, but you guys know there's an app for that,

228
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,480
right? Wait, really? What? Yeah. It's called Run Pee. Uh, and I use it in every movie and it tells

229
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,560
you when to go pee and then it gives you a timer for how long you can go. And then it tells you

230
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,280
what you missed so you can read it while you're peeing. That's fucking brilliant. It's free. Yeah.

231
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,800
It's called Run Pee. I would use that as a review for the film because if it tells me like, oh,

232
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,040
there's a good like 45 minutes there where you can just go, you can pee, you could read a magazine.

233
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:15,280
Really indulge yourself. And then I will know that that the director is just wasting my time.

234
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,520
My dad, when we go, I go to the movies sometimes with dad and when I get back,

235
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,760
he'll try to fill me in on what I missed. Right? Oh no, don't worry. No need. I timed mine.

236
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,080
Thanks daddy. But I just peed on my iPhone.

237
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,800
Daddy. Yeah. That's the other thing about it is it has a, it has a receptacle for you. Just to

238
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,080
make sure that like all your, your chemicals are balanced and you're getting the right amount of

239
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,320
nutrients. Daddy, I'm sorry. I made a whoopsie on my iPhone. Please don't, please don't talk.

240
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,120
But I really enjoyed Road to Perdition. Thank you for bringing me to this movie in 1988.

241
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,800
Daddy. Sorry. I peed on the iPhone. Oh my God. This iPhone's for the future.

242
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,480
Hey, why did I pee on my futuristic iPhone? Every year I go to at least seven or eight

243
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,280
concerts with various friends. Most of them pay me back for the tickets I buy in advance.

244
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,360
The trouble is the small group of friends, I particularly have trouble with some of them,

245
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,960
the ladies, pay me back for their share of the tickets. These aren't date scenarios,

246
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,080
more like platonic outings between members of the opposite gender who are interested in similar

247
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,480
music. My question is, how do I get my female friends to cough up the cash or if they won't,

248
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,280
should I just exclude them from any future outings and risk possibly losing concert buddies? That's

249
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,200
from Cash Drop in California. I don't think- Travis, I'm going to go ahead and ask that you

250
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,080
not chime in on this one. No, I was going to give real life advice. This is real. This is solid,

251
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,160
straight talk. Travis has seen how the other half lives. This is my advice. I think that you need

252
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:54,560
to operate like a money lending organization and that if someone establishes good credit and they

253
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,960
pay you back for the things, then you can extend to them a line of credit in the future. But once

254
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,520
this has failed to occur, you need to get- Break their fucking hands.

255
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,680
No, you need to give them money upfront. Sorry.

256
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,960
And if they want to go to the concert, you say, okay, great, it's going to be $25.

257
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,040
And then you get that and say, great, I'll go order the tickets right now.

258
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,120
Yeah, gender has absolutely no role in this. Regardless of the gender of your friend,

259
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,520
if you buy them something with the understanding they'll pay you back and they don't pay you back,

260
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,560
don't fucking buy them any more things. Next question.

261
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:31,680
I'm horrible at this. I know that I am a terrible offender in this, especially if it's someone

262
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,840
else's idea to do the concert and they're like, do you want to come? I'm like, yeah, I guess so.

263
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,200
I feel like I'm terrible about it and I don't defend it, but I feel less obligation to pay

264
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,160
them back quickly than if it was my idea to go. That's awful, right?

265
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
Yeah, that's pretty bad. Yeah, it's bad.

266
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm a terrible person.

267
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,960
I'm a terrible person. Seriously, there is no middle ground. You can either stop buying them

268
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,280
shit and deal with the fact that they're not going to go with you, or you can pay

269
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,520
for their company. And at that point, it's basically prostitution.

270
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,280
Unless it's a barter system.

271
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,480
That makes them a courtesan.

272
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,200
Unless it's like, I get this concert, you get the next one, and that's established.

273
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,800
But that's not what's up.

274
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,200
But that's not what's up, you're inventing that.

275
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,720
I know, but I'm saying maybe that's the way to go if this person, you know,

276
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,000
if they want to go to the concert, but they don't have the $30 to pay for the ticket,

277
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,920
then you say, okay, well, you get the next one.

278
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,000
Or they just don't get to go to the concert. I don't want to see a bunch of fucking poor people

279
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,080
when I'm trying to watch The Fleet Foxes, except they look like poor people.

280
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,520
It's really hard to tell The Fleet Foxes.

281
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,120
The only poor people I want to see are the ones that are in Cloud Cult. Other than that,

282
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,240
if you're in the audience, you should look. You should have wine.

283
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:48,800
Hide your eyes.

284
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,880
Basically, hide your eyes, please.

285
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,760
Your poor eyes.

286
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,120
I was trying to think of the people, the magnetic zeros.

287
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,600
Oh, they all look up. Oh, my God.

288
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,680
Okay, Griffin, can you edit in there what I said Cloud Cult can be in?

289
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll do you one better. I will just edit in the name of a much, much cooler band.

290
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,080
Okay, all right.

291
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,120
You know, I was reading through Seventeen Magazine advice, like I do,

292
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,680
and there was a question in there in which, so they have a section where people can write

293
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,320
in to the website and then get it like crowdsource answered.

294
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
Why are you pimping other advice?

295
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
Oh, because it's bullshit.

296
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,920
So then the question that the young lady had asked was,

297
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm going to a hipster concert, but I don't have any hipster clothes.

298
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,160
What can I do to dress hipster with the clothes that I have

299
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,120
and how does one act hipster at a hipster concert?

300
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,360
Okay.

301
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,080
And I think my favorite thing about it was that the word hipster was used 12 different times

302
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,680
in 12 different ways. Hipster doesn't mean anything anymore.

303
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:49,920
Yeah.

304
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
In case anybody was curious.

305
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,280
Justin and his friends used to think that I was a hipster because I liked Arcade Fire,

306
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,360
but guess what? They won a fucking Grammy.

307
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,800
So that's-

308
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,920
So guess who's?

309
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,640
Guess who's?

310
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
Well, I don't understand your point.

311
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,840
It's like, I don't know, it seems like you'd be like,

312
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,560
you're a hipster because you listen to Neil Young.

313
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,000
Like, yep, sure do.

314
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,280
Whoopi Goldberg won a Grammy. Like, what are you saying?

315
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm saying-

316
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,800
It means nothing.

317
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,240
That's precisely what I'm saying.

318
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,840
They are in the same class as Whoopi goddamn Goldberg

319
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
and there's nothing hip about what-

320
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,960
There hasn't been anything hip about Whoopi Goldberg since fucking Sister Act 2.

321
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,120
God, that was a good flip though.

322
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,400
Fuck yeah, it was.

323
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,960
I mean, she had a cameo in the Little Rascals movie. That was pretty good.

324
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,200
She was looking good in Sister Act 2.

325
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,400
She is a woman.

326
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,200
That's all I'll say.

327
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,280
And I love when she played the goalie in Mighty Ducks.

328
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,240
A few weeks ago, one of the guys in my dorm-

329
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,760
Hold on, hold the fucking phone.

330
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,400
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

331
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,880
I was just hoping I could drop that one and then move on.

332
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,840
I was trying to.

333
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,160
Travis-

334
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,400
Thank you, Justin.

335
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,440
I couldn't let it stand.

336
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm gonna give you 15 seconds to either apologize or explain-

337
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,880
Wait, I can explain it.

338
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,380
Okay.

339
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
Because the goalie in Mighty Ducks is named Goldberg.

340
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Thank you.

341
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,880
Yeah, that's all Travis's brain has.

342
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,160
It's like, it sounded like reptilian instinct at this point.

343
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,600
Yeah, he's gotta jump from one ledge to the next so quickly that I can't even keep up with it.

344
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,960
It just has no time.

345
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,960
It can't stop to survey the comedy scenery.

346
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,640
Listen, the ground is lava.

347
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,760
I can't even stop.

348
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,040
I just gotta keep moving.

349
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,040
Travis is like Pippi Longstocking avoiding the black tiles in his kitchen.

350
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,760
He's just leaping moment to moment.

351
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,520
You stopped.

352
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,000
I was trying to drive the train on and I was throwing a vine across the ravine so he could

353
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,720
swing on and you were just snipping it from above.

354
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,800
Thank you, Justin.

355
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,240
Like in Donkey Kong Jr.

356
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,480
Hey, a few weeks ago, one of the guys in my dorm asked me out.

357
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,520
I said no.

358
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,040
Not looking for a relationship right now, especially not with him.

359
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,720
After I friendzoned him, he began following me.

360
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,480
I go to the cafeteria.

361
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,920
He comes too.

362
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,800
He bought a wow subscription after he saw that I had one.

363
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:15,680
He texted me five times in an hour while I was at an indie games festival asking me where

364
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,960
I was and when he found me, he followed me for the rest of the day.

365
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,160
My dorm mates him inform me.

366
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,120
He comes to our room and asks where I am more than a few times a week.

367
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm seriously freaked out by him.

368
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,160
What should I do?

369
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,200
That's from OMG.

370
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,360
Leave me alone.

371
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:31,680
Fuck.

372
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,040
Well, he's baby ducked to you.

373
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,600
He did.

374
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,520
Yeah, you've been baby ducked.

375
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
I'm sorry.

376
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,600
When you say it, this is potentially felonious what this man is doing, but when you describe

377
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,440
it that way, it's almost adorable.

378
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,520
Yeah, he's imprinted on you.

379
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,080
Mm-hmm.

380
00:29:48,800 --> 00:30:00,080
You sound like the sort of person who is probably too nice to lay down the law in the way it

381
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:09,040
needs to be laid down like you need to not be ambiguous or too kind about this.

382
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
You need to shut it down.

383
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,200
You need to full-blown justified this kid.

384
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,200
Yes, you need to go all the font on this fool and you can't worry about this person's feelings

385
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,200
because they don't care enough about your feelings to not take you to skived out town.

386
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,680
Yep.

387
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,960
Like you've got to shut it down.

388
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,680
Because the friend zone is like the polite penalty box.

389
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,160
You know what I mean?

390
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,040
You're not out of the game.

391
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,080
You haven't been thrown out.

392
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
I thought we weren't going to use that term anymore because it's fucking stupid.

393
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,520
If you decide to be friends with someone who has asked you on a date and you said no and

394
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,360
they've shown like you're saying no, but I do want to be friends with you.

395
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,000
Guess what?

396
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
You don't want to be friends with this person.

397
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
That's the thing, right?

398
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,600
And that's why the friend zone is so is erroneous as an idea.

399
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,520
I mean, either you're friends with somebody or you're in a relationship with somebody.

400
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,840
You want neither from this person.

401
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,120
You want them to be in the, you don't want to put them in the friend zone.

402
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,800
You want to put them in the phantom zone.

403
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,720
You want them gone for good.

404
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,640
I think you just need to be straight up with this dude and be like, hey, listen, you're

405
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,320
skiving me out and I think that we need to not speak.

406
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,120
Just straight up.

407
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,640
Tell him, hey, I know that what you think you're doing is super charming, but do you

408
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,400
know how no love story has ever started?

409
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,120
Never.

410
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,760
Not ever.

411
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,920
This thing you're doing.

412
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
This is it.

413
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,240
That has never happened.

414
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,320
You know, hey, did you ever see that scene in the notebook where the guy did this thing

415
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,120
that you're doing to me?

416
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,640
Oh, you didn't because it was deleted.

417
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,520
Oh, it wasn't deleted.

418
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,920
It was never filmed because it's fucking skeevy.

419
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,640
Skeevy Nix.

420
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,920
Why don't you just call him Skeevy Nix?

421
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,400
Back off, Skeevy Nix.

422
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,240
Skeevy Martin, get out of here.

423
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,680
Skeevy Martin.

424
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,480
You guys, you know whose fault this is, right?

425
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,040
The fault for this.

426
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,000
Thank you, Travis.

427
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,240
Yes.

428
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:12,560
You take the boom box scene, the perennial symbol of unrequited love for our generation.

429
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:20,240
You take out in your eyes and you replace it with like old Fortuna or some shit and he's

430
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,040
a stalker.

431
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,880
Yes, there's one of two circumstances going on here.

432
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,360
He thinks he's being incredibly charming and has no point of reference for the fact that

433
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,720
he is actually creeping on you and being a stalker or two, he is stalking you and has

434
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,920
some serious problems.

435
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,640
Either way, you need to ditch this fool.

436
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,640
Yeah, you need to shut it.

437
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,480
You need to tell him directly and you need to start taking steps to like you really need

438
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
to extricate yourself from the situation.

439
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,840
This is not healthy and it's not whether or not this guy's like a complete and total

440
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,360
weird beard or just like a misdirected youth.

441
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,520
Like you need to be very direct in the situation and take steps to.

442
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,760
Because clearly this person does not pick up subtle cues.

443
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
No, right.

444
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,280
That's it.

445
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,880
I mean, they don't pick up subtle cues.

446
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,640
You have to be direct.

447
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,280
Shut it down.

448
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,080
Hey, do you guys ever think about that scene from Say Anything and think about how well

449
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,000
he threaded the needle because there's literally no other song that he could have played that

450
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,320
would have made that scenario swing the way that it did.

451
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,360
Swing in his favor.

452
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,160
Yeah, it's pretty.

453
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,080
If he had busted out like Tarzan Boy.

454
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,400
Oh, man.

455
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,960
Do you think that?

456
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,560
No, no, no.

457
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,280
I'm sorry.

458
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:48,160
If someone's blaring Tarzan Boy from a boombox, I may not get into a serious relationship

459
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,400
with them, but we are going to go have a party.

460
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,960
Yeah, sure.

461
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,400
We are going to go party together.

462
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,680
That's like a Jungle Rhythm.

463
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,160
You can't.

464
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,400
You really can't deny it.

465
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,400
You can't deny him in that.

466
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,360
Did you know on Spotify there's a six and a half minute version of Jungle Boy that was

467
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,920
on the official LP, the Jungle Boy.

468
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,080
It's called Tarzan Boy Summer Edition and it's six and a half minutes long.

469
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,760
So oh my God.

470
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,000
Yeah, that's enough to that's enough to I mean, you can just put it on repeat.

471
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,040
And then let me think.

472
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,080
Let me do the math real quick.

473
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,440
Ten times in an hour.

474
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,640
Twenty four hours.

475
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,920
So you could listen to it 240 times and that's your whole day.

476
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
And unlike the 239th time, you've won her heart.

477
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,600
Yeah.

478
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,960
So just camp out there, brother.

479
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah.

480
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,100
Yeah.

481
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,800
Guys, can everybody just stop?

482
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:44,400
Can we stop following people and thinking that this is like this is a message to every

483
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,160
man who has bought into the Cusack lie.

484
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:55,360
OK, following a woman around incessantly is not going to win them over.

485
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,840
It's not how we're not going to melt their hearts.

486
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,640
It's not how it works.

487
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,360
Here's how it works.

488
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,080
You ready?

489
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,600
Hey, you seem fun.

490
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,040
You want to go on a date sometime?

491
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,600
No.

492
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,120
OK, cool later.

493
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:05,760
Talk to you.

494
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,080
Never.

495
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,600
It's not like I had a big conversation with a friend of mine yesterday where he was saying

496
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,840
that there was this girl that was interested in and he didn't know how to let her down.

497
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,160
And I said, just tell her you're not interested.

498
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,680
And he said, well, I did that.

499
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,240
And she asked me why not and got in this big discussion.

500
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,160
Hey, everyone, if someone says they're not interested in you, no good comes from trying

501
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:26,720
to convince them.

502
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,640
When you say that you're going to when you say that you're like you responded that by

503
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,480
saying that you're going to whittle them down, it makes you sound like John Wayne fucking

504
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:34,980
Gacy.

505
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah.

506
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,600
And at the very best, I mean, the very best you break this person's spirit and you spend

507
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,480
the rest of the relationship with them, kowtowing to them and like working your ass off to try

508
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,840
not to upset them because of how hard you worked at it.

509
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,360
It's like terrible.

510
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,480
You are it.

511
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,120
Stop it.

512
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,840
Every guy, girls, I don't think are at women.

513
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,880
I don't think are as bad.

514
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,560
I would say it's probably nine to 10.

515
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,280
The split.

516
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,200
Ninety ten, probably because women have like self-respect.

517
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,680
Yes.

518
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,640
So if someone says I'm not interested in you, say to yourself in your head, all right, I

519
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,720
then it's probably time to move on and find someone that is interested in me.

520
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:17,520
And and with this horse, this this friend zone horseshit, if you want to be friends with

521
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,200
a woman, be friends with them.

522
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,440
Yes.

523
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,200
If you want to be in a relationship with them, ask them to go on a date with you.

524
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Don't start a friendship with someone under the under the completely misguided assumption

525
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,920
that you're going to say something during your friendship where they'll realize you've

526
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,200
been there all along.

527
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,840
You know, you know who else has been there all along?

528
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,440
Fucking a stalker.

529
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,400
My friend said to me he was talking about how he was not physically or romantically

530
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
interested in this woman.

531
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,480
And he said, but, you know, I am emotionally I could see it working.

532
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,000
I said, that's called friendship.

533
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,960
Like if you are emotionally connected to someone, but there is not a physical or romantic

534
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
attachment, that's called friendship, you guys.

535
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,680
Yes, of course, the person feels special.

536
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,800
They're your friend.

537
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,680
They're your friend.

538
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:10,320
And if they're not attracted to you and you you like pursue them hoping to melt the the

539
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,720
iceberg of repulsion that they feel towards you, that ends up with you wasting your valuable

540
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,360
time, your your youth.

541
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,920
Stop it.

542
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,800
And I can say this because I did that in college.

543
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,840
Everyone's done that.

544
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,880
There's been someone that they felt well, no, you think I've ever had a God among men.

545
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,320
You think I've ever had a problem getting this dick wet.

546
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
OK, all right, let's let's go.

547
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,720
Let's get real.

548
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,560
Hey, listen, I'm getting your dick.

549
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:38,880
No, no, no.

550
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,200
Hold on.

551
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,600
Hold on.

552
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,720
Before we make our awkward transition in the money zone, I just want to say you can disavow

553
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,480
everything we just say if it's true love.

554
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,400
Griffin, well, of course, it's true love.

555
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,760
If it's true love, you got work for it.

556
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,800
Griffin, Griffin, it's that kind of statement that all of the

557
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,560
good guys true love.

558
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,960
Maybe maybe she's the the the canvas on which you'll paint your masterpiece.

559
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,520
You love me.

560
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,840
It's really hard to say, but but if it's you can listen to us for matters of the brain.

561
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,960
But when it comes to matters of the heart, it's got to take precedent.

562
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,960
So like if you just got it, Griffin and then Griffin poisons the well.

563
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, money zone.

564
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,800
I don't I paid the rights to to Baltimore to bust out Tarzan Boyd there.

565
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,120
It was a fair use under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

566
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,160
Yeah.

567
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,680
You know, get the girl is only half the trick.

568
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
The other half is keeping her.

569
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,720
And how do you keep the fire alive in the bedroom?

570
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,520
You ask.

571
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,200
You chain them to the wall.

572
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,080
Let's pretend.

573
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:09,760
Well, that's an option, Travis, with the extreme restraints.com is is your one stop

574
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,160
super shop for pop tops and 50 Shades of Grey related items.

575
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,960
They got that now.

576
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,600
Did you know that?

577
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,120
That items inspired by 50 Shades of Grey.

578
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,960
Hey, this looks like a crazy book.

579
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,280
Yeah, I'm looking at the things that is.

580
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,480
This seems like kind of a crazy one of the items inspired by 50 Shades of Grey is the

581
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,880
book 50 Shades of Grey, which you see that and you're like, well, yes, but what you don't

582
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,120
know is that it feels good to spank with.

583
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
It's got a nice your dick inside the book.

584
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,080
It's got this carved out hole in between the papyrus and just rub on it.

585
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,160
You're going to love the way this book feels.

586
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,320
All the pages are made out of puff plus with lotion and it feels lovely in there.

587
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,120
You got they've got some Thai jelly anal beads.

588
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,600
I would probably keep all but related beads to American produce products.

589
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,160
I'm not sure.

590
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,440
I'm not sure that I would go to Thailand for things.

591
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,040
Now, because you put five in and four come out and then all of a sudden that's your whole

592
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,960
day, your whole day is about that now.

593
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,160
You should also you should also probably get a special drawer for that kind of thing.

594
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:22,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

595
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,000
You don't want to mix it up.

596
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,680
And if you have kids, please make it a high drawer, please.

597
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,960
They don't need this.

598
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,040
I'm with some kind of child safety lock on it.

599
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,600
I'm looking at a gentleman wearing elbow length latex gloves.

600
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,800
That's an option.

601
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
And actually in this picture is flipping me off.

602
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
So I don't know where I went wrong.

603
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:40,880
No, no, no.

604
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,680
You don't understand that finger has a purpose.

605
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,200
Oh, it's going somewhere.

606
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
It's going somewhere wonderful.

607
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,640
They've got a water bottle douche kid here, which is ironic because I think everyone carrying

608
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
a water bottle around is kind of a douche.

609
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,680
We make a we get we get it.

610
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,640
OK, we get we have a good time here on my brother, my brother and me.

611
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,440
But these these sex aids, by which I mean the things that help you have sex.

612
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,160
They're they're valuable.

613
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,800
They're they're precious treasures and they're going to shake things up in a way that you

614
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,640
don't even understand right now.

615
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,440
You're scared of them.

616
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,640
You might be scared.

617
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,000
Just make take the leap.

618
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,600
You know who also scared Christopher Columbus and he discovered America.

619
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,520
Oh, my God.

620
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,800
I'm discovering your America of fucking an extremist.

621
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,440
You may think that you're going to India, but what's that?

622
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,520
It's your asshole and it's blown out.

623
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,040
You should have trained it before.

624
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,320
Actually, super blew out.

625
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,800
You got that.

626
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,320
You got to train it with these special gauged butt plugs.

627
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,760
You're going to love the way it feels.

628
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,200
You're going to love the way it feels.

629
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,360
It's you're going to like the way you look.

630
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,080
You may be looking for for spices, for exotic spices.

631
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:56,720
Instead, what you're going to find is that things happen when things rub up against your

632
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,680
prostate.

633
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,480
Back to you guys.

634
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,160
So go to extremistchase.com and you can use the coupon code middle list and you'll save

635
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,200
20 percent.

636
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,720
You could save 20 percent on the forced orgasm tower, which is what I call my dorm.

637
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,680
Like you guys, I know that we've been doing extremistchase.com

638
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
promos for the last couple of weeks now, so maybe it's turned into like white noise when

639
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,040
you get to the money zone.

640
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,560
I'm telling you, if you haven't gone yet, if you haven't checked it out, there is something

641
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,400
there for you and maybe two things there for you and maybe some weird things there for you.

642
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:37,280
But not it's only weird to us because we're total missionary style prudes.

643
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,760
Right.

644
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
Baptist household prudos.

645
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,360
Hey, how about a yahoo?

646
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,120
Griffin, I was going to ask you for a yahoo.

647
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:49,040
We're going to read another question because you're trying to fucking bogart the show with

648
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,760
your normies.

649
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,120
Guys, read both at the same time.

650
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:53,920
Here we go.

651
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,800
This yahoo answer is recently found out what we're not really doing.

652
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,880
This is sent in by Krista Whalen.

653
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,400
Thanks, Krista.

654
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,200
You know it's good.

655
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,040
That's like the Nintendo seal of quality.

656
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
It's by yahoo answers user Chris who asks, what is the hole on the penis called?

657
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,440
Travis, do you?

658
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,400
I do know.

659
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:12,960
Do you really?

660
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,120
I mean, it's the urethra.

661
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,440
Nope.

662
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,920
Yeah, nope, nope.

663
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,160
Their urethra is the tube that connects the penis hole to the piss bag.

664
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,720
The hole in the tip of the penis is called the

665
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,560
debt ceiling.

666
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,920
Is your penis not?

667
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,040
It's technically called the debt ceiling.

668
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,760
That's why they're always talking about raising the debt ceiling.

669
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,080
Right.

670
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,600
That's why it was such a kerfuffle and a little racy.

671
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,360
That's why it was such a hot button issue.

672
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,400
That is sort of the colloquial name if we want to know the...

673
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,960
Because I took one anatomy class in high school that I did not do very well in.

674
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,600
And the scientific name for like scientists, what they refer to it is the front anus.

675
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:03,920
The front anus.

676
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,360
Interesting.

677
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,360
I always thought it was the maw.

678
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,640
Is it not the maw?

679
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,240
Well, it can if you have the special mutation that turns it sentient,

680
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,080
then that is technically what it's called.

681
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,280
I've always just called mine big mouth billy bass.

682
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,520
Okay.

683
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,480
Okay.

684
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,560
Good, good.

685
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:32,720
Hey, if you at home have ever made your penis hole like a mouth and used it to talk to yourself,

686
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,360
go ahead and write into the show and let us know what happened.

687
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,880
And then apply to work at puppetry of the penis because you're well on your way.

688
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,280
Don't let me feel so alone anymore.

689
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,920
For a long time, that's what I hoped puppetry of the penis was.

690
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,800
That it wasn't like, look, I turned my dick into Loch Ness Monster or something.

691
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,040
That it was like Sesame Street with dicks.

692
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:50,880
So hold on.

693
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,480
So wait.

694
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,920
They manipulated the urethral opening into so it looks like mouths

695
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,000
and then they sang like show tunes and shit, like Sin and the Clowns?

696
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,840
Well, in my mind, they were doing songs mostly from Little Shop of Horrors.

697
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,040
Like feed me.

698
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:09,520
Yeah.

699
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,320
Well, don't feed him.

700
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:11,760
No.

701
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,320
God, no.

702
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,400
Unless you go to ExtremeRestraints.com.

703
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:14,880
Stop.

704
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:15,840
Okay.

705
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,160
Okay.

706
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,520
It's called the-

707
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,760
There's a whole weird Chuck Palahniuk book about that, by the way.

708
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,240
Hey, guys.

709
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,600
What's it called?

710
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,240
It's called the me-

711
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:24,960
I don't know what it's called.

712
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,200
I read a section of it in Playboy once where he was like putting wax shit into his penis.

713
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,360
Travis, I mean what the hole is called.

714
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,520
Go ahead, Griffin.

715
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,600
It's just called hole.

716
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,160
Okay.

717
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,040
No, it's called the-

718
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,000
It's called meatus.

719
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,000
M-E-A-T-U-S.

720
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,840
That- Wasn't that the nerdy friend on Boy Meets The World?

721
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,320
He'd be like,

722
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
meatus, can we copy your Spanish homework?

723
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,880
Wait, why is it a sandworm?

724
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,080
If you look into it, it's like staring into the mouth of Cthulhu.

725
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,240
Man, we did not get as much mileage out of that question as I would have hoped.

726
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,400
So, here's my question.

727
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,560
I want to ask you guys on the show because hopefully-

728
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,280
So, the hole at the tip is called the meatus, right?

729
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,780
Uh-huh.

730
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,000
What's the other hole called?

731
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,320
The one that's going in sideways?

732
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,880
I don't know, Justin.

733
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,920
Yeah, it's about an inch below that one and it's like a sideways hole that goes through

734
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,200
to the other-

735
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,680
What's that?

736
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,440
So, you know how you could-

737
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,080
You know how when you pee it comes out three ways?

738
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:38,480
Sure.

739
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:38,720
What is-

740
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,440
Like a glaive.

741
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,480
What is the hole-

742
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,200
Like a glaive.

743
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,800
What is the other hole called?

744
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,680
It's called-

745
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,060
Okay.

746
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,000
I believe that's a Prince Albert.

747
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,480
Travis, it's time that we tell Justin.

748
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:55,860
Yes.

749
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:57,600
Tell me what?

750
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,760
About the thing from our childhood.

751
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,080
I don't remember anything from our childhood.

752
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,480
No, it's-

753
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,280
You blocked it out.

754
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,640
It was before you were born and-

755
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,140
Okay.

756
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:13,540
Well, no, I guess it had to be after you were born because it would be hard to really get

757
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,460
in there in vitro.

758
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,260
Sure, sure, sure.

759
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,700
But something happened to your penis that was really funny.

760
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,700
What was it?

761
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,460
It was really funny.

762
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:30,980
It was like they were doing the circumcision.

763
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,860
They were bracing you.

764
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:33,940
Okay.

765
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:39,860
And let's just say that a crazy man ran into the room and stabbed your dick.

766
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,620
It had nothing to do with the bris.

767
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,060
It was just that your dick was already out.

768
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:50,980
Your dick was on the table and a crazy man just ran into the room.

769
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,780
He's like, what are you-

770
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,460
Yelling, Baba Booey, Baba Booey.

771
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,420
And then he's like, hey, you bracing?

772
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:00,420
And then he pulled out an ice pick and he stabbed your baby dick.

773
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,140
Man, I hope.

774
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,460
I hope.

775
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,260
I will say this, though.

776
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,260
The laughter was deafening.

777
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,700
Like everyone got it right away.

778
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:08,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:15,220
Like when he planted it firmly into the table and it was like inside your baby dick.

780
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,340
Like this ice pick was like inside your baby dick just like grinding away.

781
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,940
And it was kind of doing that like, you know, something vibrates after you stab it into the

782
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:21,940
table.

783
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,300
I don't remember any of that.

784
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,340
Well, no, you're a baby.

785
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,460
And then the nurse was like, you know, fighting tears of laughter.

786
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,020
Like, we got to do something or this kid's going to lose his dick.

787
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,260
Tell me at least, tell me at least our parents friend zoned the guy.

788
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:34,580
Yeah.

789
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,980
Oh, yeah.

790
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,820
They were like, you can't come over here anymore.

791
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,820
Now, here's my question.

792
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,940
I think the obvious question.

793
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,420
Why did they tell you and not me?

794
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:46,740
Oh, we laughed about it for days.

795
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,340
You weren't alive.

797
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,060
You weren't alive.

798
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,460
You weren't alive.

799
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:56,100
When I think about this crazy stranger running into the room and stabbing you, you're so

800
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,180
vulnerable, just stabbing your baby dick right through it.

801
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:01,380
Like it.

802
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,900
It's chuckle city, to be honest.

803
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,860
Oh, God, it never gets old either.

804
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,500
You know, I don't understand.

805
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,220
How do you understand?

806
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,220
Why would he do that to me?

807
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,100
It's hilarious.

808
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,620
Because it was Gallagher.

809
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,460
Do you remember when Gallagher Gallagher was really I do remember it was before he

810
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,940
discovered like his watermelon thing and he was trying to look for and he would show up

811
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,940
at hospitals and parents would be like, fuck.

812
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,260
And then he'd be like, hey, hey, time to stab some baby dicks.

813
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,380
And then he would just do it.

814
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,140
He would do like three or four in one go because he was a busy guy.

815
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:44,340
So like he wanted to get as much mileage out of each hospital visit.

816
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,620
But he was workshopping.

817
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,460
I mean, you can't blame he was workshop.

818
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,500
Don't heckle.

819
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,180
He was trying to work out a bit.

820
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,100
This actually makes a lot of sense because I've never found Gallagher very funny.

821
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,820
And I've always wondered why it was you have a deep seated memory of when Gallagher came

822
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,900
through and definitely stabbed you in the dick.

823
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,380
This is not liable because it's true.

824
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,700
No doubt about it, folks.

825
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,460
It ain't liable if it's true.

826
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,300
That's what Muhammad Ali said.

827
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,780
Hey, I recently found what I thought was a really cool, unique watch and immediately

828
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,280
bought it.

829
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,900
I think it fits my style and personality.

830
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,860
But the first three friends I showed it to had slightly negative reactions to it and

831
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,180
didn't understand what was so excited about.

832
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:29,220
Should I shrug it off or should I take this as a cue to reevaluate my choice of fashion?

833
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:32,100
I still like the watch, but it seems I'm the only one.

834
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,060
That's from Fearful of Fashion faux pas.

835
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,180
Here's a link to the watch.

836
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,220
I'm not going to click it.

837
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,140
I'm not going to click it before I give this advice.

838
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,500
This is what your watch should look like.

839
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,140
A round face with either a leather or steel.

840
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:50,020
The strap doesn't fucking matter as long as it's not goofy.

841
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:54,180
And then there's 12 numbers on it and there's two hands that go around and tell you what

842
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,700
the time is on the watch.

843
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,980
That's fashion point number one.

844
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:04,020
If it's like a bunch of LED lights that only you can read because it's in binary, then

845
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,940
you done fucked up somewhere.

846
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,860
I'm going to be honest with you, friend, though.

847
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,700
I'm looking at the picture of the watch.

848
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,100
I don't know what it means.

849
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:16,740
If it shoots a hologram into the sky and then you have to read it on the ceiling, then you

850
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,100
have you have slipped up somewhere fashion wise.

851
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,660
In my opinion, as a fashion item, as a bracelet, it's very good looking.

852
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,780
As a functional timepiece, I don't understand.

853
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,500
If you can play a Tiger Electronics game on it, then whoopsie.

854
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,940
You goofed.

855
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:42,740
In my opinion, the only good watch is one that also makes phone calls and is an iPhone

856
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,260
because what are you doing?

857
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,140
You know what I did?

858
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,340
I got I need a one when I did all my international traveling, got on Amazon, bought a ten dollar

859
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,180
goddamn ten dollar watch from Casio.

860
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:55,620
And it's little.

861
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,260
It's black.

862
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,060
It's discreet.

863
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,300
And it tells you what the time is with twelve numbers.

864
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,100
This is this is where I get a little bit mad at fashion.

865
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,620
OK, it is this idea of like the funk.

866
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,940
The watch is a functional thing like you buy it so you know what time it is.

867
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:17,940
Whether you buy a ten dollar Casio watch or like a four thousand dollar watch, it does

868
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,620
the exact same.

869
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,340
OK, but this is a crazy thing, Travis, because that's that's all of fashion.

870
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,500
We wear shirts so that bees don't sting us in the chest when we go outside.

871
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:32,500
And then the shirts get a potato sack would accomplish that.

872
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:32,900
Right.

873
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,980
Shirts get then shirts got crazy.

874
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,780
Shirts got crazy after we wore them.

875
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,500
I know this is what I'm saying is my problem with fashion.

876
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,340
And now dragons and fake tattoos $300 for a shirt that looks like a shirt you buy at

877
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:51,460
Goodwill, except you get to say you spent $300 on it and you bought it at such and such.

878
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,420
Yeah, dog.

879
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,540
That's fashion.

880
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:58,340
But Griffin, why are you screaming at me like I'm not agreeing with you?

881
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,980
Because it's like you're surprised by this.

882
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,820
Like we wear shoes so that when we go outside, dogs don't bite us on the feet and give us

883
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:05,460
diseases.

884
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,700
This is a problem, Travis, that I would like to file under.

885
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:16,660
I think my theory on these problems are if an entire generation of people have lived

886
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,620
before you and been unable to solve this issue, it's not worth thinking about.

887
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,500
I know that what I'm saying is not incredibly revolutionary.

888
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,460
That was the best that was the most uplifting thing I've ever that was if you could wrap

889
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,020
up the entirety of our generation's political views into one sentence, it would be that

890
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:38,100
sentence, it would be that thing, or if presented even shorter, ah, fuck it.

891
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,420
Fuck it.

892
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,300
What's on the internet?

893
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,180
Back to the question I asked you, here's what I think your friends were reacting to

894
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:46,820
on this watch.

895
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:54,020
I get the impression that you bought this watch, that what drew you to it as a fashion

896
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:57,300
statement is how incomprehensible it is.

897
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:58,980
Yes.

898
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:02,580
And I think your friends were looking at it going, that doesn't make any sense.

899
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,940
I don't know what I'm looking at.

900
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,780
And so, I mean, if that's what you were going for, you nailed it.

901
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:10,900
Slam dunk.

902
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:20,180
Well, the other thing is, like, you probably, if three people have commented on your watch,

903
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,700
then you probably said, hey, look at my new watch.

904
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,860
Or like, what do you think of this new watch?

905
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:27,700
It's like, don't do that.

906
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:28,420
Just wear it.

907
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,620
If you like it, wear it.

908
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,140
But don't ask people for feedback, because they're just jealous of you.

909
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,380
They're jealous of you and your incomprehensible watch.

910
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,820
If your watch has letters on it, you know what I mean.

911
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,180
The watch, okay, for those of you at home, the watch face has three words on it.

912
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,300
Try to describe it.

913
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,340
Okay, it's got three words on it.

914
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:53,300
To the left is past, to the right is future, and in the middle is present, with a line

915
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:58,100
pointing up to what looks like two dials that show the hour and minute, I guess.

916
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:07,780
I don't think it's, I think the watch face spins behind this facade, and so the actual

917
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:14,340
numbers line up with the present line instead of having lines, I'm so angry right now.

918
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,220
And it also looks like, because, I don't understand.

919
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,460
Your watch confuses and scares me, sir.

920
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:30,340
I think, I think it's not too late to return it, and maybe get this watch I got, it's on

921
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:34,500
Amazon, it's $10, it's a little black dress of wristwatches.

922
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,980
That was the Amazon review, and that's why I bought it.

923
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,980
You know what I mean?

924
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:43,780
I feel bad for, I feel bad for, I don't want to salt this guy's fashion game, but I just

925
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:45,620
want you to have nice things.

926
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,700
And I don't, here's, oh, okay, so here's what I'll say about this fashion watch, sir.

927
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:56,260
If you're wearing this out to like some incredibly fancy awesome event, I could justify it.

928
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,340
Like a special occasion, like the cufflinks of watches, I could justify it.

929
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,100
What are you saying?

930
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:07,060
I'm saying that like if he was going to some, you know, fancy event, and this was his special

931
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,540
occasion watch, but to wear this every day when you like go to work at Jimmy John's or

932
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,500
whatever, don't fucking wear this watch.

933
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:19,060
You're saying that this crazy watch is a cool thing to wear to parties, and then you can

934
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:23,060
be like, hey, Mr. President, did you see my novelty watch?

935
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:27,460
No, I'm saying that if it's a fashion statement, and this is what you're doing, and that's

936
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,980
what you're going for, this isn't something you whip out your wrist and say, check out

937
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,460
this watch.

938
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,140
You just wear it, and you be cool, and you do whatever.

939
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,460
I guess it is functional, because it hides all the times that you don't give a fuck about.

940
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,100
You know what I mean?

941
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:41,780
Nobody's ever like, hey, what time was it an hour and a half ago?

942
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,940
And you look down at your watch, like, I can't help you, buddy.

943
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,060
I only know about the present.

944
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,340
I'm thinking about looking towards the future.

945
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:49,300
You know what I want?

946
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:54,020
I want a watch like this, but it only tells me what's up 20 minutes in the future.

947
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:54,980
And they say, what time is it?

948
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,940
You say, I don't know, but in 20 minutes, it's 1145.

949
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,740
And then I got to go watch early edition.

950
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:01,060
Later.

951
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,900
That's what Looper is about.

952
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,020
Man, have you guys seen Looper?

953
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,940
I haven't seen Looper.

954
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,660
Good, man.

955
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,700
Joseph Gordon Levitt is a rising action star.

956
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,300
I am the president of a student organization at my college.

957
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:17,220
We recently got a new batch of members, mostly girls, and some of them are cute.

958
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:18,900
One in particular has caught my attention.

959
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,860
Normally, I just ask her out, but I feel like my position in the org would make it weird.

960
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,380
Is there a conflict of interest here?

961
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,420
Any help will be appreciated.

962
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,660
That's from Stumped in San Marcos.

963
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,140
Before we start, let me go ahead and say that if you ever say we got a big group of girls

964
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:38,180
and one in particular caught my eye, it also makes you sound like John Wayne Gacy.

965
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,700
There's a lot of things.

966
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,660
There's a lot of things you can say that makes you sound like a serial killer.

967
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:49,780
I would like to take a vote on the show, but I would like to submit, and I don't know if

968
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:56,900
I can get a second on this, but I would like to submit that the most important facet of

969
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:03,620
this has been withheld from us to the extent that we cannot make adequate-

970
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,140
It's what is the organization.

971
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,900
What is the organization?

972
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,740
Is it pizza team?

973
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:10,420
A team of people who love pizza?

974
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,220
Of course not.

975
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,740
People who love pizza?

976
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,620
You don't want to mess with all the rules and bylaws of pizza team.

977
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,780
Is it pizza club?

978
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,980
No, it's pizza club.

979
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,620
That's different.

980
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:28,420
I mean, seriously, is it a club that's built around the abolishment of fraternization

981
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,860
between the different sexes of students?

982
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,980
That's a weird club.

983
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,020
That's a weird club.

984
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,540
Hey, you two stop touching.

985
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:39,700
Dudes and dudes and ladies with ladies.

986
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,220
I thought I told you.

987
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,500
Yeah, you got student council.

988
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,580
There's presidents and vice presidents in college.

989
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,900
Are you the president of the student body?

990
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,060
Because that might be an issue.

991
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:54,180
Oh, but it's such a great line to be like, I'd love to be the president of your student

992
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,980
body, and then you take off your shirt.

993
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:02,260
Is it a GLBT group?

994
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,500
Because I don't think things are going to go your way.

995
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,020
I do not think you said those letters right.

996
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:11,860
I think you said a GBLT, which is-

997
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,340
A McDLT, I'm sorry.

998
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,460
It's a BLT, but with graham crackers on it.

999
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,900
Yeah, it keeps the hot side hot and the cold side cold, which is nice.

1000
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:27,620
I was saying gross about the sandwich, not about the LTGB lifestyle.

1001
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,380
I don't know why it has to be about ranking priority.

1002
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,780
You know, like as long as you get all the letters in there, people know what you're

1003
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,500
talking about.

1004
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,020
You could say some of them twice if you wanted to.

1005
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,300
It's like, and then it just turns into DNA.

1006
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,660
It's a GLBTLGBT.

1007
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:49,060
GLBLTLBTA Gattaca.

1008
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,860
It's got to be, I don't know, man.

1009
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:56,100
There's no way that you're not exploiting your power.

1010
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:58,260
What power?

1011
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,500
Of the fucking presidential power.

1012
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:07,220
Okay, but like, I'm sorry, you guys, but is there not a point in this where you go,

1013
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,580
hey man, you should just ask the girl out because you're in college and what group you're

1014
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:11,540
in doesn't really matter?

1015
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,740
No, here's how it's going to play out.

1016
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,540
You ask her out.

1017
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,060
She says yes, obviously.

1018
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,900
You guys hook up, you go on a bunch of dates, you realize you're in love, you buy her a

1019
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,220
ring, you have a long engagement, you get married, you have kids, and then you realize

1020
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:29,300
45 years in the future that she was only doing it because she was trying to move up the ladder

1021
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,380
of whatever this organization was, and it's going to break your heart, it's going to

1022
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:37,940
break your kids' hearts, and your grandkids' hearts.

1023
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:43,060
So wouldn't that be horrifying when you're 67 to realize that it was only because you

1024
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:44,980
were president of the Young Liberals Club?

1025
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,980
I don't know.

1026
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,380
I think if it's Young Liberals Club, I feel like everybody's fucking anyway.

1027
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,900
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1028
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,380
I feel like most groups are there in college, I don't even know.

1029
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:00,900
I feel like most groups are just there to party down on each other, you know what I

1030
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,780
mean?

1031
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:03,060
I think student government association-

1032
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,180
They are built for fraternization.

1033
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,860
Student government association, when it's like election season, tensions are high, so

1034
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,980
are pheromones.

1035
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,540
A lot of late nights, you know?

1036
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:18,180
A lot of, you know, sitting around the war table and then just throw all the pieces off

1037
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,140
that war table and then make a fuck pile.

1038
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:28,500
My favorite scene in 90s documentary The War Room is the scene where George Stephanopoulos

1039
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,820
just buries his cock in James Carver.

1040
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,700
Oh my god.

1041
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,420
Oh no!

1042
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:34,500
Yeah.

1043
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:35,860
Yeah.

1044
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,580
I like, me likey.

1045
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:38,820
I have-

1046
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:39,700
It's on the Blu-ray.

1047
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,740
Blu-ray deleted scenes.

1048
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,020
I really just got dizzy.

1049
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:43,860
I got dizzy.

1050
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:45,460
Because all the blood rushed to your erection?

1051
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:52,500
Can I say, there was some part of my brain that I thought was dead as I tried to make

1052
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:58,100
my way through that whole phrase that entire clause was trying to shut me down.

1053
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:01,380
It was like trying to hold back the tide, though.

1054
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,980
It's like when the bulkheads start to shut down as the ship sinks and it's like, oh,

1055
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:07,060
we've lost all the guys in engineering.

1056
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:11,540
You woke up and a part of your brain that made you realize that you were gay but only

1057
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:16,260
for James Carvel, which is very unfortunate because that dream probably ain't gonna come

1058
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:16,500
true.

1059
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,580
Yeah, that ship done sailed.

1060
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:22,100
Hey, listen, thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast.

1061
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,860
What am I supposed to do with this boner now?

1062
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,940
Because there's nothing I can do with it.

1063
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,500
I have got a rage occasion.

1064
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,740
It's not like there's fucking James Carvel porn on the internet.

1065
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,620
I can't even close my eyes and imagine what that dude looks like naked.

1066
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,460
I just imagine there's baldness everywhere.

1067
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,180
It's just all elbows.

1068
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:42,660
I just imagine he fucks with Louisiana charms.

1069
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,460
There's just angles everywhere, inexplicably.

1070
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,780
It's like fucking like a Van Gogh painting or something.

1071
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,980
Hey, so anyway, thanks for listening to our show.

1072
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,860
Thank you so much to people tweeting about it.

1073
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:00,100
They're using the NBNBAM hashtag.

1074
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:11,140
People like Radioactive Jedi, Bransonatron, Ross Gott, Sir Seahorse, Bedhugs, AstroInnovator,

1075
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:20,180
Fox and Stars, AngeredFalconMC, Getting, Jessalynzo, HilaryThinks, and so, so much more.

1076
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:26,980
I would like to just give a shout out to Iggy K, who drank three trash monkeys before moving.

1077
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:31,700
Not immediately after did he move, but the next morning, which I'm sure it was just awful.

1078
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:35,140
You're a fool, sir, and you've done it so, so wrong.

1079
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,340
I don't think I've drank three trash monkeys in my life.

1080
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:42,820
We also have a Facebook group that has thousands of members, and you should join.

1081
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,780
Holy shit, really?

1082
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:47,540
Yeah, we've got nearly 4,000 members.

1083
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:50,420
We're basically bigger than Jesus.

1084
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,620
It's basically bigger than Jesus.

1085
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:55,540
Go to Facebook, search NBNBAM, and you'll find that group.

1086
01:03:55,540 --> 01:04:01,780
You'll see a bunch of people talking about My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1087
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:06,420
You can also do the same thing on the forums, MaximumFun.org.

1088
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,260
People are discussing the shows and things they like, and it's a great community.

1089
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,420
I just looked up Jesus on Facebook.

1090
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,500
He's got 4.8 million likes.

1091
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:15,140
We're on the way.

1092
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,020
We're like one-tenth of a percent on the way.

1093
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:22,660
You gotta start somewhere.

1094
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:25,300
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for our theme song.

1095
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,500
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1096
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,460
Thank you, John Roderick.

1097
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,180
He'll be at MaxFunCon East, which I believe is next month.

1098
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,820
I don't know what session he's giving, but maybe artisanal beard growing,

1099
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:43,300
or how to write the fucking rockin'est songs that there are.

1100
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,380
But make sure you sign up for it if you're going to that.

1101
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:55,380
We have an exciting promotion coming up, Max Fun Day, October 15th.

1102
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:56,340
Mark it count.

1103
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,780
Just take off work, because it is a national holiday.

1104
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:00,740
It's going to get crazy.

1105
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,220
We're going to have some special stuff.

1106
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:07,940
I think we're going to have a special bonus app for donors, so you can get twice your flow.

1107
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:14,340
It's going to be huge and fun, and there's going to be giveaways and fun crap, so be there.

1108
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:17,620
Uh, this final Yahoo answer is sent in by Aurora Case.

1109
01:05:17,620 --> 01:05:18,420
Thank you, Aurora.

1110
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mr. Dang, who asks,

1111
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,740
Is it okay for a dang 30-year-old man to watch Goosebumps?

1112
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,020
I'm Justin McElroy.

1113
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,300
I'm Travis McElroy.

1114
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,900
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1115
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:36,420
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1116
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:37,460
Kiss your dad.

1117
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:38,580
School wear on the lips.

1118
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:44,900
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1119
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:45,940
Keep your heart.

1120
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,100
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

1121
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,140
Keep your heart.

1122
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,060
