1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, welcome to my brother and my brother mean advice show for the modern era. My name

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,240
is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. My name is Travis McElroy. I'm your middle

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,200
brother. I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Check that calendar. What day is it?

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
It just, I just see a bunch of ones. It's just all ones.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,840
Nav one. Nav one, and you know what that means. Punch it. That Christmas creep is on.

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
Punch it to 88 miles an hour. Happy anniversary. Back to the future.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,880
Today was the day. Today was it.

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,160
They took down his Halloween decorations and back to the future and put up his

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,760
Christmas decorations. We on that creep now, guys. I'm excited.

14
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,240
That creep popped off. Nav one. That means the creep is on.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,760
Halloween's over. Halloween's done with. That means there's no more holidays until

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,600
the holidays. Isn't it weird how you can leave your

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,640
Christmas decorations up for a little while, but if you have your Halloween decorations up

18
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,920
one day after Halloween, you're a sicko. You just look like a sicko pervert.

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,840
I like your pumpkin there, pervert. You weirdo. What did you want to hold onto

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,320
that death, huh? A death and despair. Oh, you carved out Master Chief's face

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,760
and a pumpkin. That's really great, pervert. That's really good for you, pervert.

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,680
You should be very proud of yourself. Yeah, spooky skeleton in that tree, I see.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,960
Maybe, you know, like I've got kids, so... I gotta tell you, maybe it's a Christmas

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,040
creep side effect, but by the time Christmas is done, I'm like,

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,920
woof. Okay, good. Thank you. Goodbye, Christmas. I enjoy you very much.

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,320
So happy to have you gone. I feel like I didn't even get enough Halloween

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,720
this year, and I was really trying to get deep into it.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,560
I really like a Halloween extension. The problem is, Justin, because I thought

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
about this. Everybody accepts that Christmas, you can start celebrating on November 1st,

30
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,920
right? You can start decorating, and the music plays, and everyone's like, yeah.

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,360
But if you start doing Halloween stuff, if you dress up on October 21st,

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,600
people are like, what the fuck? No, Danny, it's more than a week away. Be cool.

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Cool. My local Rite Aid started, like, I went there this morning, right?

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,920
And the creep had, like, just disassembled. Like, there's people just throwing piles of

35
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
Dracula's out the window. Like, please, make room for Santa's, please.

36
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,720
I went to a Marshall's the other day. Yesterday. The Halloween day. All Hallows Eve.

37
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,080
I fucking walked up in that spot, and they had Halloween stuff next to Christmas stuff.

38
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,960
It was like the creep was starting to encroach. Like, oh, come on. Get out of here,

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,400
Dracula's. You're done. You're done. You're done. All Dracula's must go.

40
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
It was weird seeing them in the same place. Like, oh, Santa versus Dracula. That would be

41
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,760
fucking sick. I went to the Halloween store, and I heard somebody asking if everything went on sale

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,960
the day after Halloween. And it occurred to me, like, they're probably just going to box that up

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,520
and sell it again next year, right? There's not big shifts. No, we got to get the new models.

44
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,480
We're going to get the 2016 Dracula's in here. Much more streamlined with cup holders.

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,480
These days have three sharp fangs. Everybody knows that. That's what the kids are into.

46
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,400
You know that new Dracula you've been looking for?

47
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,360
Do you guys remember on the last episode, I talked about batting zero out of a thousand

48
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,320
for putting on Halloween costumes that anybody recognizes?

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,760
That after last night, my perfect record of badness has not changed.

50
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah. No recognition.

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I got a kick out of your costume, which was a...

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,720
It was a birdhouse in your soul. I bought a birdhouse at Target,

53
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,920
because I didn't buy a costume until yesterday at, like, 4 p.m.

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,400
And we were going to a thing at 545, and so I went to the Target. It's really on me. Like,

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,440
I have no one to blame but myself, and I saw a birdhouse. I was like, that'll do.

56
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,840
That didn't do. It didn't. That didn't do for anybody.

57
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,480
It didn't. That dog did not hunt.

58
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,320
No. That dog sat on the floor.

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,200
You did fashion a harness for it, which I thought was quite impressive.

60
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,560
Staple gun and elastic. So you were in that thing, huh?

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,360
I was in it to win it. Made it really hard to piss. Had a big birdhouse right there.

62
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
My sight lines.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
Well, the spooky times are over, and we all met Christmas creeps now.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,080
And thank God. It was getting a little too spooky for me. I don't know how it treated you guys,

65
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,080
but, like, one of my neighbors went all out. It had mummies in their yard. Mummies?

66
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,000
You don't think that's taken a little too far?

67
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
Did that scare you, Griffin?

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Mummies are real, though, is the thing. Like, people actually did that to people.

69
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,080
You know what I mean?

70
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,640
Yeah. Mummies are real.

71
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Skeletons, I guess, are kind of real because they're inside you, but they can't do anything.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,960
Mummies were real. Mummies were and are and will be real.

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,240
Mummies alive, right now.

74
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,320
Guys, listen. Mummies alive. That show's title was a fucking warning.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,080
Mummies alive.

76
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,480
Hey, guys.

77
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
Hey, listen. Speaking of being on that creep,

78
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,360
tickets are now on sale for our Candle Nights Holiday Family Fun Spectacular.

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,040
It's a pan-religious, pan-sexual, personal pan holiday just for you.

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,680
And tickets are on sale now if you go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights 2.

81
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,880
And we've sold a good number of tickets already. Like, a solid number.

82
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
But there's an even better number of tickets still available.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,160
Yeah.

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,040
So go get those and then come to Huntington with us.

85
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,200
Are we doing costumes for that? Because we had costumes last year and it was pretty fun,

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,320
but I don't know what other, other than the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future,

87
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,960
like what other trio of, I guess, wise men?

88
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,640
We could do the wise men. That seems pretty on the nose.

89
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,520
It seems, yeah.

90
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,880
And I like it. Don't get me wrong. On the nose. And I like it.

91
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
See, Griffin, that's your problem with costumes. It's okay if it's recognizable.

92
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,280
I went to a party last night.

93
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,680
You can do a thing that people go like, oh, I get it.

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,720
I went to a party last night where I didn't know literally anybody,

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
and I was near a table getting a drink and there were a bunch of people sitting at the table

96
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,480
whispering and finally one woman like stood up and was like, sorry, what is your costume?

97
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,800
I was like, oh, it's a birdhouse from your soul.

98
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,480
And she was like, I don't- I was like, oh, it's like the They Might Be Giants song.

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,440
And somebody at the table yelled, what is it? What's his costume?

100
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,280
And she yelled back, she yelled back, something esoteric.

101
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,960
And I was like, yeah, I guess that's-

102
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,600
And did you then just turn and walk right out the door?

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,960
Because that's what I would have done.

104
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, I would have left.

105
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,040
So come to our holiday show. It's going to be really good.

106
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
And I'm going to try to make it more Jewish this year.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,160
Last year was very Christmas-y and I'm going to try to make it more-

108
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,480
Well, we're going to do a rotation.

109
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Okay.

110
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,320
That's the good thing about candle lights. It can- it can- it's amorphous.

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,320
I actually wanted to-

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,280
It can actually be a little spooky. We could have some Jewish mummies up there.

113
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
I don't even joke about that.

114
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Yes. I actually have struggled with this and maybe listeners can like give us some guidance here.

115
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I know like what stuff- like I know that pretty much anything Christmas-y is like

116
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,520
fair- fair use, right? In terms of like being fun.

117
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,400
Hahaha. But like I don't know with like Jewish stuff.

118
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't know what is like a fit- like it seems like a lot of that stuff is holy.

119
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
And I didn't- like I made a video, a dumb video, promoting candle lights.

120
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
And I needed to put- I wanted to put something like- I had some Christmas-y,

121
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,040
Santa-type stuff and I wanted to put something Jewish in it.

122
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
And I was going to have like a cool menorah on a table.

123
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
But like I don't know if that's holy or not. Is that holy?

124
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:16,880
That's cool.

125
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,800
Is that not allowed? I ended up going with a dreidel because that seems pretty benign.

126
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,480
That's about as innocuous as it gets.

127
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:29,120
Yeah, a menorah is totally cool, dude. That is the Hanukkah equivalent of a Christmas tree.

128
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,840
But I have to know the limits of the symbology, Griffin.

129
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,560
If I stay on that stage and use a menorah to light an American flag on fire-

130
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,600
Well that's taking it a touch too far, my boy.

131
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
Yeah, I don't know where the line is, Griffin.

132
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
That's what I'm saying. I don't know where the line is.

133
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
Hold on. You say you would light an American flag on fire with a menorah

134
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
and you don't know that that's over the line?

135
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,240
No, I would assume the line is there.

136
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,440
Like, I definitely see that as an outside boundary of the line.

137
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,280
When you take three to four steps back from that, I have no idea where I'm at.

138
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,640
If I rigged a menorah to shoot Nickelodeon Gak out at the audience-

139
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,440
That would be fucking sick. Everyone would love that.

140
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,600
I don't think so. I think it would be offensive to people. I really do.

141
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,120
Well, offensive to people in the splash zone, sure.

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,720
Sure. Well, they saw the signs outside.

143
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
It's not- You may get wet. You will get wet

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
with holy menorah emissions. You may get gacked.

145
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah, you may get gacked. I don't know.

146
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
It was- All right, let's do the show.

147
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
Yeah, we'll talk about this afterwards.

148
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,040
It's a fair point. I was-

149
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,320
It's a fair- Yes.

150
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,440
We're young Southern Baptist boys that just don't want to step on anybody's toes,

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
but we want to be as inclusive of our Jewish friends as possible because it is a-

152
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,200
Then we have to have a Gak Christmas tree and a Gak Kwanzaa.

153
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,400
And we need some non-religious, just general, like, solstice stuff up there.

154
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,320
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, for sure.

155
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
And I don't actually- Maybe somebody could tell me, like,

156
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,480
can I even dip my toe into Kwanzaa? Can I even drive by Kwanzaa and take a look?

157
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Of course. Of course.

158
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
You can window shop Kwanzaa. I'm not going to be part of the problem.

159
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,520
Dear Mabim Bam, I ordered pizza the other day with my friend. Since my friend was at the house,

160
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,240
I did the courtesy of paying for the pizza. When we finished the delicious za, there were leftovers.

161
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,240
My friend then proceeded to start packing up the leftovers in order to take them home,

162
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
even though I paid for the pizza.

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,720
Am I within my rights to keep the leftovers, or should I stop being so fussy?

164
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
The pizza cost $40. That's a good pizza.

165
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,520
What? Including delivery, which is fairly expensive.

166
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,000
For just you and one other person? How much za?

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,800
This is my foie gras pizza. Did you have a-

168
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,280
Did you each get your own fucking pizza?

169
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,960
Did you have a stack of eight leftover pizzas, like the family at home alone?

170
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,120
Like, is that why they thought they could have some?

171
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
Considering work part-time, am I within my rights to keep the leftovers,

172
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:02,560
or should I stop being so fussy? That's from Sherwood likes some pizza in Sherwood Park.

173
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,480
What's up, Griff?

174
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
It's just their friend has committed so many-

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,360
Pizza crimes.

176
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Pizza crimes here. It's like, first of all, the person who pays for the pizza

177
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,240
should most of the time keep the pizza.

178
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,800
The only thing that can be like a variable in that situation is who is hosting the evening.

179
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,240
Because by taking a pizza that you broke bread with somebody in their house,

180
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,120
and then you take it out of their house, that's theft.

181
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
That's theft, according to the law.

182
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,840
It's theft.

183
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,800
It's just- Okay, here's the scenario that works out.

184
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Like, you apparently ordered six pizzas.

185
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,720
There's five whole pizzas left over, and they say,

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,000
please take some.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
That we don't have room to store all of this pizza.

188
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
No, we insist, take some with you.

189
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,240
But to just like finish the day, I'm like,

190
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,840
well, guess I'll be heading home.

191
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,000
As you like scoop it into your backpack.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,120
Get the fuck out.

193
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
Because did you like ask for like Ziploc bags?

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,720
You- Yeah.

195
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,680
Oh, you're the worst.

196
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,400
You're the worst.

197
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
This is the worst.

198
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,240
Let me- Let me-

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,280
The payment issue like completely solidifies it.

200
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,840
You paid it, your house, your pizza, that's theft.

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,720
Pizza crime.

202
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,880
I'm calling the pizza police right now,

203
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,400
and they're gonna kick in this person's door.

204
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,760
Send me their information.

205
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,560
I'm not a cop.

206
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,000
I have to, I would have to tell you if I am,

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,880
but I know cops.

208
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,640
Pizza cops.

209
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
If you bring a six pack of beer to a person's house,

210
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
and you don't finish that six pack,

211
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
you still leave it at their house, right?

212
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
Because it's their- It's a party payment.

213
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
It's their house.

214
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,120
At that point, it's their house.

215
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,680
I want to drink those beers later,

216
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
and I'm going to drink some more beers when I go home,

217
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,360
and I don't have any at home.

218
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
But it is important in that scenario

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
that you leave some sort of toll or tax,

220
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,200
where you, like, if you have a six pack,

221
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,480
you drink two, there's four left.

222
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,520
You leave at least one.

223
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,000
Or just leave a small toy.

224
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,840
That also works.

225
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
You just have to swap it out,

226
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,680
or like a bag of sand the same weight

227
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
as the beer that you're taking.

228
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,760
Exactly.

229
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,640
I would challenge, Travis,

230
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,920
I would challenge your assertion that if someone

231
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
offers leftover pizza,

232
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,280
that you are then permitted to take it.

233
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,560
I would challenge it based on an irrefutable law

234
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
that I've been working on called

235
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,840
the elasticity of pizza deliciousness.

236
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,800
And here's how it works.

237
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
After you finish pizza,

238
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,040
and you've eaten a lot of pizza,

239
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,480
you look at the pizza,

240
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,760
and you think, ugh, never again.

241
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
I'm destroying my human body with pizza.

242
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm never gonna eat pizza again.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,840
Everybody, take some of this pizza with you,

244
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,480
because I don't want it.

245
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I'm just gonna throw it in the garbage.

246
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,840
The next morning you wake up,

247
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,320
it's 11 o'clock, you're a little bit hungover.

248
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
You would move heaven or earth

249
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,840
to get one of those toasty slices

250
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,280
right into your belly.

251
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
They knew that.

252
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,520
I'm saying this law is so universal

253
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
that you should not legally be permitted

254
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
to take leftover pizza under any circumstances.

255
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,440
But what if there's not room to store it

256
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,560
in your refrigerator?

257
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,280
That's not the case.

258
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Stop throwing bullshit variables into this.

259
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,280
This person has a big empty fridge.

260
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,240
It's empty.

261
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
It's pizza-less.

262
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
They've got a pizza shelf,

263
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,000
a pizza crisper drawer.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,680
Also, listen, question asker.

265
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
Can I just say, if you're working part-time

266
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
and money is an issue,

267
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,520
you could get like two pizzas

268
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
for like $15 from Domino's.

269
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,360
Get cheaper za.

270
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
Why are you getting $40 pizza?

271
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,360
Pizza Hut's got a carryout order

272
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,960
for $10 any.

273
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,760
Go with that.

274
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,840
You can do 11 if you order due delivery.

275
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,880
You only get one go-around.

276
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,240
Eat the best pizza you can.

277
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,840
That's my whole thing.

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,520
That's sort of like what I'm all about.

279
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,360
I realize that's a privileged position to take,

280
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,560
but I think pizza's worth it.

281
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,320
I mean, that is the best pizza that I could get.

282
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,280
It is really good.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,560
That's sad for me in a major way.

284
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,560
My name is Griffin,

285
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
and I'm here to say that you should

286
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,680
eat better pizza every day.

287
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,320
Do you guys want a yahoo?

288
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,640
Yes.

289
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm not done with this by a country mile.

290
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,840
Well, it's cut and dry.

291
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,320
It's cut and dry.

292
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,440
This is fucking bullshit.

293
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,880
If you bring something to somebody's house

294
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
for all of you to consume,

295
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,080
it's theirs.

296
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,800
It's their house.

297
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,280
It's theirs.

298
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:13,920
It's their house.

299
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,560
It's theirs.

300
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,480
Stop fucking taking shit out of the house.

301
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,440
This is easy.

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,400
No, not unless.

303
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,640
No, this is un-unlessable.

304
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,440
There is unless.

305
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,080
You're a criminal.

306
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,560
You're a thief.

307
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
You're the fucking pizza burglar.

308
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
Rubble rubble, that's you.

309
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,680
What if there's a precedent established

310
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,200
and this question asker

311
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,160
did something similar at this person's house?

312
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,280
Two wrongs don't make a right.

313
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,360
But three lefts do.

314
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
Do you guys remember that Reliant K album?

315
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,720
What about, okay,

316
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
what if there were two pizzas,

317
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,880
two extravagantly expensive pizzas ordered,

318
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,080
but one was for each like,

319
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,160
okay, what if one was specifically crafted

320
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
by the person who stole the pizza?

321
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,960
Like they incepted it with like their favorite olives

322
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
and ham and turds or whatever,

323
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,320
and it's just for them, right?

324
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,640
They said like, just get me a tom.

325
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,840
It's not beyond who paid for the pizza.

326
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,960
Think about this for a second.

327
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,280
Paying for the pizza is simple.

328
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,720
Anybody could do that.

329
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,000
What this person did

330
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,560
is they looked at a huge list of ingredients

331
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,960
and they opened up their third eye

332
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,200
and they just like conceived of the perfect pizza for them.

333
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,120
Like it's their creation at that point.

334
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,720
Isn't there some ownership

335
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,880
that they've been vested at that point?

336
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,380
No.

337
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,560
Yeah, how about Yahoo?

338
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,760
Yeah, I'm just, it actually is a little disquieting

339
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,920
that you basically just endorsed breaking and entering.

340
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,000
That's what I'm upgrading it to, breaking and entering.

341
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,560
I'm pretty pizza picky though,

342
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,480
and I don't want people leaving pizza

343
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
that has pineapple around.

344
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,280
Like I don't want that.

345
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,920
You can pick it off

346
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
and then it's still got that good cheese on it.

347
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,680
I don't want to fucking hear it.

348
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Now if they chipped in,

349
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,120
if the person put in 20, is it then okay?

350
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,680
Yeah, well still probably no, it's their house.

351
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I think there has to be a discussion.

352
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,200
Like you're robbing someone

353
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,680
of their most valuable natural resource.

354
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Not natural.

355
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,880
Then you need to have a conversation about it regardless.

356
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,040
I think you always have to have a discussion.

357
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,160
Gonna be an uncomfortable discussion.

358
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,920
We have to move on.

359
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,800
I'm getting mad.

360
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,320
Real super quick though.

361
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
You want to reheat pizza just in a perfect fashion?

362
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,600
Get a waffle iron.

363
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh yeah.

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
Fold the pizza on half itself.

365
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,800
You will be astounded at how good that is.

366
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,280
And then bury it in the backyard for three weeks.

367
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
Then dig it up when the time is right.

368
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,240
Guess what?

369
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,120
Now you've got kimchi.

370
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
That's how kimchi is made.

371
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Do you guys know, I hate to break the flow,

372
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
but I feel like we just haven't had a flow yet

373
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,800
in this episode.

374
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,320
So I want to get this in under the wire.

375
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,240
Do you guys know about the Switch Witch?

376
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,120
Okay, I saw this on Shark Tank.

377
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,640
It pisses me off something fierce.

378
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,400
Yeah, the Switch Witch.

379
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,440
Do you know about it, Trav?

380
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,080
No, I do not.

381
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,560
We went to the drive-in yesterday to see Hocus Pocus

382
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,240
and they did car-to-car trick-or-treat.

383
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,960
It was really cute.

384
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,880
Kids were coming car-to-car and trick-or-treating

385
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,680
and it was great.

386
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,160
I bought Mike and Ike's and Rachel hated that

387
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,600
because I like Mike and Ike's and she thinks

388
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
I'm the only person in the world that likes Mike and Ike's

389
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,800
and so I just got candy that she knew.

390
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
She knew that I got candy that only I liked

391
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,880
so that if we didn't give all our candy away,

392
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,960
I would have a bunch of Mike and Ike's and guess what?

393
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
That is exact how it is, how it panned out.

394
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,120
And the kids didn't seem so psyched

395
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,240
about the Mike and Ike's anyway.

396
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,360
Anyway, this mom came by and she had two kids,

397
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,560
the two little kids and I gave them a bunch of Mike and Ike's

398
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,360
and this boy actually stuck his hand into my giant bag

399
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,760
of Mike and Ike mini-sized packages,

400
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,960
pulled out like 20 bags.

401
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
I was like, hell yeah.

402
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
She was like, it's his first Halloween.

403
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,440
I was like, he's a natural.

404
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,560
He's very good at this.

405
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,480
And she was like, well,

406
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,840
it's all going to the Switch Witch anyway

407
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,960
so it doesn't really matter.

408
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,000
And I was like, well, I gotta Google that.

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
You've said a thing that isn't a thing

410
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,600
so let me just Google that real quick.

411
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,880
And then when I found out what it was,

412
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,400
I wanted to track her down and say,

413
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm gonna need you to give me that candy back

414
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,080
because the Switch Witch is garbage.

415
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
All right, Trav, what is it?

416
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,760
It's like a shelf elf.

417
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,760
It's like a shelf elf, right?

418
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
A shelf.

419
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,480
Switch Witch, you leave your hard-earned Halloween candy.

420
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
You leave it for the Switch Witch, okay?

421
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,760
In the end of the night,

422
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
once the night's over and you wake up the next morning,

423
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,560
your candy is gone and replaced with a present.

424
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,800
But you get to decide how much candy you want to give up.

425
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,680
The more candy you give up, the better present you get.

426
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,720
There's an economy of scales to this.

427
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,680
I hate this.

428
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,080
I hate this.

429
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,280
I hate it too.

430
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,920
The family that was selling one of my Shark Tank said,

431
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,440
we want to push this product

432
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,640
so there's a Switch Witch in every house in America.

433
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
And I just want to point out that, like,

434
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,680
you do understand that we're not idiots, right?

435
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,960
Like, the candy economy would definitely...

436
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
Like, if everybody knew that you were taking their candy

437
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,680
and throwing it in the trash

438
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,520
because that's what everybody did

439
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,360
and they fed it to some dumb witch,

440
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,840
there's no way anybody's gonna hand out candy anymore.

441
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
I am literally angry as a person who has bought

442
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,960
and handed out candy with this idea of like,

443
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,560
okay, and then we garbage it.

444
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,280
A lot of that isn't even touching a kid mouth.

445
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,040
I think about how much candy I handed out last night

446
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,480
that's not even touching,

447
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,440
not even crossing the sweet gums of a kid mouth.

448
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,400
What? Why?

449
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:23,760
No.

450
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,120
What are we all doing here?

451
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,520
This is as bad as burning an American flag with a menorah.

452
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,720
I will not stand for it.

453
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,400
This is worse.

454
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,920
It's at least beside it.

455
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
I did want to hit you guys.

456
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,160
As long as we're talking about candy,

457
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,640
like, we'll get back to the advice in a second.

458
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,160
I had a weird Halloween and I need to unpack it

459
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,960
is what I'm saying.

460
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,000
I need to unpack mine.

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,600
This is the first year that I took Charlie trick or treating

462
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,160
and I wasn't struck with this problem

463
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,600
until I started doing it

464
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
and I'm curious like how you guys would have approached it.

465
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,800
So I'm in the scenario where she definitely has a pumpkin

466
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
and I definitely am.

467
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Well, first off, like I'm an adult man.

468
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm obviously carrying a few extra pounds

469
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
and I'm carrying this baby around

470
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,520
who can't say trick or treat or at least she won't.

471
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,480
She can.

472
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
She just won't.

473
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:15,920
She won't.

474
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,360
She's being very obstinate.

475
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,240
Yeah, no kidding.

476
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,600
She won't say thank you or bye or anything really.

477
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,320
God.

478
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
And she clearly can't eat candy.

479
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
That is also true.

480
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,800
Okay, yeah.

481
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,480
But like I want to do,

482
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,240
but it's like a fun thing, right?

483
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Just like you're walking around the neighborhood.

484
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
So like I had two options.

485
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,160
One is like I go up and I'm like,

486
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,760
hey, give me some candy.

487
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,400
Look at this.

488
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,360
Look at this baby.

489
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Can I have some candy for my adult body?

490
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,840
Thank you.

491
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,920
And the other option-

492
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,480
It's not for me.

493
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,840
It's for the Switch Witch.

494
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,120
It's for the Switch Witch, did you see?

495
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,040
I'm hoping to get a new iPod.

496
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
The other option I had though

497
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
was to go to people's stores to be like,

498
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
no thanks, I don't need any candy.

499
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,760
It's just like, look.

500
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,640
Look at this baby.

501
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
You're just doing it for the XP.

502
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,160
Apparently I'm just grinding my memories here with this baby.

503
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,800
Mother fu-

504
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
Okay, listen.

505
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,000
Fuck.

506
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:08,800
Fuck.

507
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,000
Fuck though.

508
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,520
Fuck though y'all for real though.

509
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,880
Travis, tell them what happened

510
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,200
because I'm too fucking angry.

511
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,080
Here's what happened.

512
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,320
My audacity for no goddamn reason

513
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
stopped recording halfway through the episode.

514
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,200
Pooped right in the bed.

515
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,480
Got poop all over the sheets.

516
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,760
The nice sheets.

517
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,840
People ask us what programs we use to record

518
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,880
and I always tell them audacity.

519
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,560
Don't fucking use audacity for anything.

520
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,320
No, it's free garbage.

521
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,760
Free, that's why it's free

522
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,560
because they left it on the floor.

523
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,160
Anybody want this free garbage?

524
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,360
It's like we're yelling into a toilet

525
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,160
and praying to God that the toilet records our voices.

526
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,560
The thing that hurts about it is that

527
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,360
I feel that we are the earthly stewards

528
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,680
of a divine talent.

529
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,240
Yeah.

530
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,440
And we have been bad stewards.

531
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,040
We recorded, we used some of that gift

532
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,760
to record half a fucking podcast.

533
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
We spilled our seed on the ground.

534
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,120
That's exactly it, Travis.

535
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,680
We spilled our comedy seed on the soil

536
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,760
down there with the snakes and rats.

537
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,640
And now we're unclean.

538
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,080
Ceremonially unclean.

539
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
I don't have to do a whole smudging thing.

540
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,400
So many good goofs that have just been consigned to oblivion.

541
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,280
They're just lost now.

542
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,920
They're just lost now.

543
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,640
I remember them.

544
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,760
I still get a good chuckle.

545
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,400
Uh, should we just do a fresh 30?

546
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,760
Yeah.

547
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,880
Somebody's mowing their lawn now.

548
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,520
Yesterday was better.

549
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Yesterday was a funnier comedy day.

550
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,640
I have a cold now.

551
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,240
I didn't have a cold yesterday.

552
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,480
Yeah.

553
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:45,600
Yeah.

554
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,440
Well, let's just-

555
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,800
This is gonna be, this one's gonna,

556
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,520
the rest of the show's gonna be off the fucking rails.

557
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:51,840
Yeah.

558
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,120
And I hope you're all ready for it.

559
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
Let's spin it up.

560
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,160
I'm like, I'm barely hanging on.

561
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,600
I got my key in the ignition.

562
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,240
Let's twist it.

563
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,880
Uh, this Yahoo was sent in by Tim Atkin.

564
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,840
Thank you, Tim.

565
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

566
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,120
They're anonymous.

567
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,960
Let's call them Pquad.

568
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,680
Pquad asks,

569
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,720
I will never learn a backflip.

570
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,240
Hello.

571
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm trying to get over my fear of backflip.

572
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm trying to get over my fear of doing a backflip, but I can't.

573
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,160
I saw over 100 videos on how to do a backflip.

574
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,520
I can do a front flip pretty good, but I can't backflip.

575
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,600
I got the part where you fall on your back

576
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
and put your legs over your head.

577
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,800
All of those, the wrong you-er.

578
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,280
I do that good.

579
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,040
I have done that a lot of times.

580
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,680
I just don't have guts to do a backflip.

581
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,520
I even have my mom as a spotter beside me, who I really trust,

582
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,280
and I still can't do it.

583
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,160
I jump, get ready, then I won't flip back.

584
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
Any help, please.

585
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Thanks.

586
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,600
I just want to start off by saying what a world in which we live

587
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,680
that there's 100 videos available to our young people

588
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,120
on how to do a backflip.

589
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,680
Like what is not covered in the first one.

590
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,560
Right.

591
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,520
Yeah, right.

592
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,240
The fact that there were 99 and somebody's like,

593
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,640
nope, this is not instructive enough.

594
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,280
No, I need a different angle.

595
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,600
Oh, you're using the Bertolucci method.

596
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,400
I see, I see.

597
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:19,760
Fascinating.

598
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,080
A little rote, perhaps.

599
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,240
A little plebian.

600
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,680
I also really enjoy the fact that, okay,

601
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,000
so he's got the part where he falls backward

602
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,520
and he puts his legs up, right?

603
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,320
Yeah.

604
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,040
His mom's got him perfected on that step.

605
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,240
His mom's just like tighter, ankles in 15 degrees, perfect.

606
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,840
Now next, you gotta have guts.

607
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,840
So the only thing stopping him is not a physical problem.

608
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,640
No.

609
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,920
It's that there's a mental block in his brain

610
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,400
that will not let him do a sweet 360 backflip.

611
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I think it's just your inner ear, right?

612
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,640
Yeah.

613
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,120
It's your cochlear defense mechanism

614
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
triggering and telling you, hey, don't do that.

615
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,440
Hey, stop it.

616
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Stop doing that.

617
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
I see where this person is coming from because,

618
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,160
okay, so they can flip.

619
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,040
You gotta remember, Trev, that they are flipping

620
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,120
and landing on their back good.

621
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,600
Yeah.

622
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,800
They want to be on their feet after having done a 360 degree rotation, right?

623
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,480
So right now, they're getting to about 180.

624
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,120
Yeah.

625
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,080
There are still many degrees of just paralysis.

626
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Yeah, sure.

627
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,520
Just complete and total like incident

628
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
that they have to like clear in one pass.

629
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,880
But Justin, mom's not gonna let that happen.

630
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,640
That's why he's got his mom there.

631
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,840
You can't practice the part where you land butter side down.

632
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,200
You're dead.

633
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,040
Like dead ski dead 100%.

634
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,760
Welcome to heaven.

635
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,720
How far did you get?

636
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,920
About 270.

637
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
That's the worst one you could do.

638
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,160
I gotta tell you, man, if you'd made at least 280,

639
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,600
I think you would have been all right.

640
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,360
I mean, 270 is the worst.

641
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,520
You went full 6 p.m. and you can't do that, dog.

642
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
Now, can I get back to midnight?

643
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,000
You landed right on your C6.

644
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,720
Damn, son.

645
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,320
That's a bad one to hit.

646
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,120
That's a rough one.

647
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,480
It's one of the best ones I made.

648
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,040
I made that one.

649
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
That's what I call that one.

650
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,360
The paralysis bone.

651
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
You gotta watch out for that one.

652
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Tricky bone.

653
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,800
Tricky, tricky bone.

654
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,320
How to give humans a weak point, you see?

655
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,160
That was it.

656
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,200
That's the only one.

657
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,160
How does anyone learn about like who did the first backflip?

658
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
That's a good question, Travis.

659
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,160
Yeah, that is good.

660
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,760
The answer is Ben Vereen.

661
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,720
So it was probably like 1977 and Ben Vereen did it.

662
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,880
And people were like, what?

663
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,160
How much coke did I take?

664
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,080
Excuse me?

665
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:46,640
Sorry?

666
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,040
Even Ben Vereen didn't know what had just happened.

667
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,960
Like he was trying to do a front flip and like just did it backwards.

668
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,160
Yeah, yeah.

669
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,880
Well, he was drunk.

670
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Classic drunk Ben Vereen did a backflip.

671
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
I shouldn't have done that, he said.

672
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
He tore a hole in the universe.

673
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,640
Have you guys ever done a backflip?

674
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
Yeah, I did one today, earlier today.

675
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,080
I woke up and did my pee, my morning pee.

676
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,440
I did a flip off the toilet.

677
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,040
No, I've never done a fucking backflip.

678
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
I'm just curious if you guys have ever done a backflip before.

679
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,080
I don't know if I've done any flip.

680
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,440
I think I've done a somersault.

681
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,880
That's the one where you just roll on the ground the whole time.

682
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
I don't even like doing somersaults because your butt hits the ground really hard.

683
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
And it's close to C6 territory.

684
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,440
It's not flipping and rolling, it's just not my speed.

685
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,560
You gotta wonk at it.

686
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,320
You gotta roll and then pop up.

687
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,600
Yeah.

688
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,480
But if I was that agile, I'd be doing backflips every day.

689
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,040
Well, yeah.

690
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,720
Maybe they need an impetus, right?

691
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,280
You have no biological need to do a backflip, right?

692
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,520
Maybe they need some sort of threat that they have to not get hit by

693
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,680
and that necessitates a backflip.

694
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,280
Oh, so like a blade coming at your knees?

695
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,800
Blade, the vampire blade?

696
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:10,960
Like, you know how your dad pushes you in the pool and then you learn to swim?

697
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,360
Yeah.

698
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,960
What is that for backflips?

699
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,600
But this is what I'm saying.

700
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,600
Like, I don't think there is a need for backflips.

701
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,920
I don't think that there is any problem that can only be solved by backflip.

702
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,640
Well, say that, but then you watch Ocean's Eleven.

703
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,400
Oh, right, that too.

704
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,960
Um, maybe this person's mom is giving them bad instructions

705
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,040
trying to keep them from doing more backflips.

706
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,320
Like, they're nagging them.

707
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,320
Right, it's the most dangerous, it's the most dangerous game is backflips.

708
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,400
And so the mom is like, yep, no, you did it.

709
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,440
You just did one.

710
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,400
That was a good one right there.

711
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,440
That was one right there.

712
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
You did, no, that was a backflip.

713
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,040
That was a backflip.

714
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,080
You just laid on your back and you put your legs up in the air and you kicked them.

715
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,800
That was good.

716
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,640
Have y'all ever seen somebody really beef a backflip?

717
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,640
It's terrifying.

718
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,440
It's the worst.

719
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
It's a very bad scene.

720
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,360
It makes people, like, no matter what age or...

721
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,040
Everybody comes together for the fear of that person's back.

722
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,440
When we were in middle element, was it elementary school or middle school?

723
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
It was at Miller Elementary, boy.

724
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,200
Go Owls?

725
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,080
Go Owls, the most terrifying.

726
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
Somebody there knew the Red Ranger from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.

727
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,320
It was like an associate producer's daughter or something like that.

728
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,480
And so he came to the school to tell us all about how drugs were banned.

729
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,640
And then he attempted to do a backflip off of the stage and beefed it so hard.

730
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,200
He was so coke high, which is the ironic thing.

731
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
He was so coke high.

732
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
He actually did a 540.

733
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,600
He landed on a C5 and I was like, oh, close one, Austin.

734
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,800
It was Austin St. John.

735
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,120
Can you not spread, like, fucking vicious rumors about Austin St. John's drug use?

736
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,680
No, you're right.

737
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,960
He's clean.

738
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,120
It was just karate energy that gave him the extra flipping strength.

739
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,600
But I remember, like, I was, like, nine years old and I was like, oh, that's bad.

740
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,400
He might...

741
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,040
He'll never...

742
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,720
He's certainly not gonna flip again.

743
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,880
Certainly not gonna pilot Megazord again.

744
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,920
That's definitely true.

745
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,000
Do you guys think...

746
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,560
I have a question for you about your elementary school years.

747
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,520
Did the landscape change in terms of, like, what lies...

748
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,080
Okay.

749
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,480
When you're in elementary school and you're out on the playground, kids lie constantly, right?

750
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,840
I got a Canadian girlfriend.

751
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
I got an uncle who works at Nintendo.

752
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,800
I'm good at basketball.

753
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,760
I'm good at basketball.

754
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,600
My dad knows the Red Ranger.

755
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,560
I'm the king of Spain.

756
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,400
I've switched places with a pauper.

757
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,800
When that girl actually managed to materialize the Red Ranger, that must have changed the

758
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,280
whole game in terms of lying out there.

759
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,080
It was pretty sick.

760
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,360
But then that excitement was short-lived because I watched him absolutely chomp a flipper.

761
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,360
Just absolutely chomp a beef.

762
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,960
And then that little girl ran up to him.

763
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,000
You embarrassed me, Austin St. John!

764
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
You embarrassed me, Austin St. John.

765
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
No, no, Power Ranger.

766
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,160
I like that.

767
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,880
He set up a foundation to help fix Austin St. John and it's time to raise some money for it.

768
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
Please teach Austin St. John how to flip good.

769
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
He doesn't have the confidence.

770
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,960
Can you imagine if you beef a flipper in front of like 47-year-olds?

771
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,280
You'll never flip again.

772
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,880
That's the ultimate shame.

773
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,800
Ironically, you know who's really forgiving?

774
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,080
47-year-olds.

775
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,480
You know what?

776
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,560
I had three near-simultaneous thoughts of, man, I hope Austin St. John doesn't listen to this.

777
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,600
And then, oh man, there's no way Austin St. John remembers this.

778
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,480
And then, yeah, he bet he totally does remember this.

779
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,640
Austin, what would you like to talk about in today's session?

780
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,600
The backflip again.

781
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,960
Again, Austin?

782
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,400
Again, I thought we had such a breakthrough last time when you just laid on your back

783
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,520
and you kicked your feet up.

784
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,020
Yeah.

785
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,840
Thanks, Mom.

786
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
I got super duper close.

787
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Stick to kipups, Austin.

788
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,440
Okay, here we go.

789
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
Let's raise some money for Austin St. John in the Money Zone.

790
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:13,600
Our first sponsor this week is Naturebox.com.

791
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,240
Well, I guess they just prefer Naturebox, but they don't normally put the...

792
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,680
Anyway, they have a ton of great snacks like peanut butter nom-noms and sriracha cashews.

793
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,520
I like the mini Belgian waffles.

794
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,560
Boy, those are nice.

795
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,960
Just like a little spot of natural peanut butter goes down real good.

796
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,920
Also, just smother them in chocolate.

797
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,640
Sure.

798
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,320
Nutella, pretty much any liquid.

799
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
I like their bacon uh-ohs.

800
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,680
That's not a real one.

801
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,720
Yeah, bacon, you haven't had the bacon uh-ohs?

802
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
At least brand new choices every single month.

803
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,360
Naturebox is full of flavor, but without any of the junk.

804
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,400
So here's the deal.

805
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,640
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you can unbox a world of taste and possibility.

806
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,160
I really like their salt promises.

807
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,120
Have you guys had those?

808
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,560
Again, not real?

809
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,680
No, no, no, those are...

810
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,840
I was kidding about bacon uh-ohs, but salt promises.

811
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,400
That's like a...

812
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,000
They're like little salty promises.

813
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,800
Griffin, have you tried the Melting Susans?

814
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
I have not tried the Melting Susans.

815
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,520
You gotta do it quick or they're gone.

816
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,640
Yeah, I really like caramel and there's a question mark at the end of it.

817
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,320
I like the salted peppermint missed connections.

818
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, those are very good.

819
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

820
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,600
Find out which of these are real and which are fake and get your first box of hand-picked

821
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,840
snacks sent direct to your doorstep.

822
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,280
I want to tell you guys about Zip Recruiter.

823
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,960
Zip Recruiter is a place where you can recruit millions of people to work at a single business,

824
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,460
I think.

825
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,220
No, wait, no.

826
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,060
That's a crazy business.

827
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,580
Have you ever wanted to have millions of employees in your small business?

828
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,780
Raise your own army.

829
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,380
Zip Recruiter is an army recruitment...

830
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:04,100
No, if you're short staffed, there's no time to deal with the dozens of different job sites

831
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,740
that are out there.

832
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,820
Monster, cooljobs.fart, was that what it was?

833
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,100
With Zip Recruiter, you can post to 100 plus job sites with a single click and be instantly

834
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,020
matched to candidates from over 6 million resumes.

835
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,540
You can hire all 6 million if you want.

836
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,060
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

837
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,060
Zip Recruiter has been used by over 400,000 businesses and you can try it right now for

838
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:27,300
free.

839
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,860
Go to ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

840
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,900
That's ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

841
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
Start surfing the human web.

842
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,700
I got a message for Tom and Jessica from Ashley Shannon and this is the entire message.

843
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,300
Hey guys, call me back.

844
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,660
All right, is that for us or?

845
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,220
No, it wasn't.

846
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:53,860
I also just want everyone to know that this was a best available time slot.

847
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,620
So God knows how long Ashley has been waiting for this call.

848
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,340
She could be like a cartoon skeleton with cobwebs by this point.

849
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,380
She probably is because I bet she got locked out of her refrigerator and she couldn't eat

850
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,700
any food and now she's a cobweb skeleton.

851
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,780
Tom's like, hey Jessica, do you remember an Ashley Shannon?

852
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,500
Do you remember Ashley Shannon?

853
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,740
She's all bones now.

854
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,700
We make the Pony Express look like Prodigy or CompuServe.

855
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,300
I have another message here and it's from Sarah and it's to Jesse.

856
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,900
And Sarah says to Jesse, hey Jesse, Jesse!

857
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,660
I wanted to wish you a happy birthday in Truman Bim Bam style since you were sweet enough to

858
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,340
do the same for me on my birthday.

859
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,260
I love you more than anything else in the world.

860
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,300
You better get ready.

861
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,620
I'll bring the love and you bring the powerade so we can replenish ourselves after we do

862
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,660
activities together.

863
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,700
You know, like they're playing some ultimate.

864
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,900
Oh, okay.

865
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,740
Ooh, I thought you meant boning.

866
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,260
Travis, Patrick McElroy.

867
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,860
Yes Griffin Andrew?

868
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,220
What?

869
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,540
We just said fuck like 18 times.

870
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,940
Well, that's because we lost a fucking recording.

871
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,220
That fucking sucks.

872
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,100
That was out of anger.

873
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,140
That's not profanity.

874
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,220
But we can't talk about fucking out of love.

875
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,180
No Travis.

876
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,260
Can I say lovemaking?

877
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,020
In many ways that's worse.

878
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,620
They need the powerade to replenish our fluids after lovemaking.

879
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,260
The sweet embrace of coitus.

880
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,380
We're eight.

881
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:31,060
Do you think Austin St. John makes love or does he just fuck?

882
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:41,220
Can you imagine having that his mouth just inches away from your ear and he whispers?

883
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,220
It's morphin time.

884
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:43,460
Yeah.

885
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,580
I'm gonna morph inside you.

886
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,220
What?

887
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,620
Austin?

888
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,380
Austin, no.

889
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,460
It's porkin time.

890
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,380
Let's move on with our lives.

891
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,980
What if Zordon, what do you think?

892
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,900
I've got a Zordon.

893
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,580
I've got a raging Zordon.

894
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,820
I hate this shit.

895
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,140
See, if that wasn't in the one we lost.

896
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:14,020
Ty is a pedantic person.

897
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:18,420
I think when he pronounces these words, it's in a very show-offy way.

898
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,700
Jairo.

899
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,660
Yiro.

900
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,620
Sacrebleu.

901
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,660
Sacrebleu.

902
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,700
Ayers Rock.

903
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,260
Uluru.

904
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,260
What you are witnessing is real.

905
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,420
The participants are not actors.

906
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,900
They are actual litigants with real cases.

907
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,300
They call in via Skype to Judge John Hodgman's court, the real people's court.

908
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,900
Now I call you to Judge John Hodgman's internet court.

909
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,140
Find it at Maximumfun.org or wherever you download podcasts.

910
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,140
I recently referred my friend to work at the same company as me

911
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:59,540
and he got the job, which I just found out comes with a nice $1,500 bonus before taxes.

912
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,900
He recently messaged me and said he thinks he should get a chunk of it.

913
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,860
What the fuck?

914
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,780
He is a single guy.

915
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,020
I have a wife, two kids, and a mortgage to pay.

916
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,740
Not relevant.

917
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,340
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

918
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,660
You could be a coke dealer.

919
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,820
I told him no, but in a nice way.

920
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,860
After all, we're only a few weeks away from buying candlelight presents

921
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,620
and also diapers are expensive.

922
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,220
Do I owe it to him to toss him a few bucks since I don't technically earn it?

923
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,860
Or is getting him the new job good enough?

924
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,900
Am I good?

925
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,340
That's from All Mine in Atlanta.

926
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,700
This is insanity.

927
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,980
The fact that you're trying to justify it to us like,

928
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,500
I have kids and I have to buy diapers.

929
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,220
That's great and all, doesn't matter.

930
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,420
I don't care if you said I'm gonna take that $1,500 and burn it.

931
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:48,660
I'm allergic to money and if I touch it, I get very, very ill.

932
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,860
I don't give a shit.

933
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,060
It's your fungibles.

934
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,500
His bonus is a paycheck.

935
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,020
It's a paycheck that you got him in the bank every two weeks, homie.

936
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,540
What are you talking about?

937
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,060
Do you get a cut of that?

938
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,820
Do you give him like $500 now and then you get 10% of his paycheck every like month?

939
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
You need a royalty on this deal.

940
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,100
Gotta get that, gotta get your long straw out.

941
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,900
You gotta sip, you gotta sip of that juice.

942
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,860
Is it possible?

943
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:21,940
Is it possible after like the pizza thing and then this thing that like people just don't have-

944
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,540
The society is just grumbling around us?

945
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:29,140
Yeah, like friendship is just not what it was anymore because I cannot imagine,

946
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,380
even like my closest friend who I have no problem saying like whatever to.

947
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,660
I can say anything to them.

948
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,620
The idea of being like, but I need some of your money.

949
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,780
Like, no, no, ew, ow.

950
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,380
This is bonkers and bad.

951
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,060
I think you and should break up with this friend and pizza,

952
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,620
would sure would like some pizza in Truett Park, break up with their friend.

953
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,620
You're each other's friends now and the other two friends can just fucking parasite off each other

954
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,580
until they run out of money or pizza and just wither up and die.

955
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,300
Unless.

956
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,820
Unless.

957
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,060
Check that calendar again.

958
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,540
What year is it?

959
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,140
Well, it's November 2nd now.

960
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,660
Yeah, but what year is it?

961
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,500
2015.

962
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,140
Sorry, did you just say 2015?

963
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,220
Sorry, do you mean 20-grifteen colon the con is on?

964
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,420
The con is still on, yeah.

965
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,620
The con is on.

966
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,260
Is it off on January 1, 16?

967
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:24,500
Yeah.

968
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,300
Then the apologies begin.

969
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,900
Got about 58 days.

970
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,100
So start, keep your conning, finish those cons up.

971
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,940
It's time to move on to the fucking prestige.

972
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,780
So what if this, okay, you get your friend a job.

973
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:39,940
Yeah.

974
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,460
Yeah, 750 in your pocket, 750 in his pocket.

975
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:43,780
Garbage.

976
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:44,420
He quits.

977
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,700
Okay.

978
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,900
How long does he have the job?

979
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:47,860
What?

980
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,460
How long does he have to keep the job?

981
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,340
It doesn't matter.

982
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,140
A day.

983
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:53,620
I mean, he literally, he like calls in the next day.

984
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,660
He's like, hey, it's Brian.

985
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,860
I got hit by a bus, bye.

986
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,460
And he's just gone.

987
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,180
I'm an angel now.

988
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,500
I'm calling you on an angel phone.

989
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,860
Then you show up.

990
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,900
He's back.

991
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,020
Fake mustache.

992
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,860
This is my friend, Ryan.

993
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,820
He is in many ways more qualified than Brian.

994
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,220
So far, so good.

995
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,540
I don't want to speak ill of the dead, but fuck Brian's whole work ethic.

996
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:18,980
Brian gets the job, 750 in your pocket.

997
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,420
Next day, you overhear a little chatter around the coffee maker.

998
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,580
Did you hear the tragic news?

999
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:28,100
Ryan moved to Aruba and was hit by a bus.

1000
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,580
That's probably a little more fiction.

1001
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,460
Hi, everybody.

1002
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,980
This is president Obama.

1003
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:37,060
I'm prioritizing legislation to just get rid of buses.

1004
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,420
They're fucking out of control.

1005
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,460
They're out of control.

1006
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,580
Did you see Ghost Dad?

1007
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,940
Then who's that knocking on the door the next day?

1008
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,580
Boss checks his day planner.

1009
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,140
What's that?

1010
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,100
I have a 1030 with a new hire applicant named Brian.

1011
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,860
Can that be right?

1012
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,740
It can.

1013
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,420
And guess who's about to make 750 more dollars?

1014
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:00,980
It's you.

1015
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,940
The con is on.

1016
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,660
Also, Brian.

1017
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,500
Next day.

1018
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,380
You and Brian.

1019
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,500
Next day, Brian.

1020
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,220
Hit by a bus.

1021
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,500
Brian's not even a name.

1022
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,420
I'm gonna miss him, though.

1023
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,620
This is my friend, Scryin.

1024
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,500
He's had a lot of work.

1025
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,420
He's really into seeing the future.

1026
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:17,380
Yeah, he's a soothsayer.

1027
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,380
This is a lot of work.

1028
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,140
Didn't foresee that bus, though.

1029
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,860
Because he's dead.

1030
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,740
750 more.

1031
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,700
This is Dryin.

1032
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,200
Dryin?

1033
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:25,540
Dryin?

1034
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,180
Travis, you're right.

1035
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,580
It is a lot of work, and that's why we got to simplify the process.

1036
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,860
Cut Dryin, Brian, Dryin, Ryan out completely.

1037
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,140
It's just you.

1038
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,780
Okay.

1039
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,940
Okay, you show up at work.

1040
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,620
Hey, boss, it's Doug.

1041
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,780
I've got another great candidate for you.

1042
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:40,740
His name is Jug.

1043
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,860
It's you.

1044
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,540
You're in a bowler cap and a monocle.

1045
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,100
Good day.

1046
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,060
Good day.

1047
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,260
Yes, I am Jug.

1048
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,620
I'm Jug.

1049
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,860
I'm prepared to work at your establishment.

1050
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,380
I will work hard.

1051
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,660
I will do good jobs.

1052
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,580
Can you just be like, yeah, I've got a candidate.

1053
00:43:58,580 --> 00:43:59,780
It's you, boss man.

1054
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,740
You're hired.

1055
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,100
I'm hiring you for your job.

1056
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,620
That'll be $1,500.

1057
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:04,660
Money, please.

1058
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,380
Money, please.

1059
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,620
I'll take it in small or large bills.

1060
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,140
You know who else we should hire?

1061
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,580
Debra from accounting.

1062
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:12,580
Bring Debra in here.

1063
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,540
Debra, good news.

1064
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:14,900
I'm hiring you for your job.

1065
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,260
Well, yeah, I already work.

1066
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,300
You're perfect then.

1067
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,260
A perfect candidate.

1068
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,220
Very qualified.

1069
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,580
I don't know.

1070
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,620
This still seems exact.

1071
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,660
Can I just embezzle?

1072
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Yeah, just embezzle.

1073
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:25,780
Or just steal.

1074
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,700
It just seems much more straightforward.

1075
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,900
Just steal.

1076
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,460
Just take.

1077
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,140
Can I just steal?

1078
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,700
Just steal and take.

1079
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,100
And don't try and get clever about it because that's how you get caught.

1080
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,540
Just fucking take.

1081
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,540
Yeah, just take.

1082
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,420
Because everybody assumes nobody's stealing.

1083
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,140
Yeah, but everyone-

1084
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:47,060
Unless you yourself are a stealer, in which case you're assuming everybody is all the time.

1085
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:48,340
This is the secret.

1086
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
Everyone's stealing all the time.

1087
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,460
I steal from this podcast a bunch.

1088
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,020
What do you steal from this podcast?

1089
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,500
I stole 30 Minutes Trash's recording.

1090
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:00,500
It's me, podcast Krampus.

1091
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:02,820
I've cursed Audacity.

1092
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,700
Just kidding.

1093
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,940
But we cut your head off and buried you in a grave and put a cross up and set a fire around it.

1094
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,100
Yeah, it takes two crosses.

1095
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,300
Damn it.

1096
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,260
You can't kill podcast Krampus.

1097
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,140
I told you, Travis, we shouldn't have gotten cheap on the crosses.

1098
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,300
Well, you know, ties are tight.

1099
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,020
It's candlelight.

1100
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,300
There's not a lot of money to go around.

1101
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,460
Also, you used Epsom salt.

1102
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,220
It takes kosher if you want to take down old podcast Krampus.

1103
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,740
That's what I had left over from my gout.

1104
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,420
Sorry?

1105
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,740
You heard me, Krampus.

1106
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:34,500
No, I heard the words you said.

1107
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,060
They didn't make sense since you have to put salt on your gout.

1108
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,980
You gotta soak it.

1109
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,860
Come on, Krampus.

1110
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,820
Read a book.

1111
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,740
100% certain what gout is.

1112
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:46,580
And I'm pretty sure I did a salt buns episode about it.

1113
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,940
Yeah, no, that's nothing.

1114
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:53,140
I know, I've seen gout as you guys swollen toe because you drink too much wine and you

1115
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,340
live too high on the hog.

1116
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:56,260
That's exactly it.

1117
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,460
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

1118
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:57,700
Please.

1119
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,580
Yes, I hope podcast Krampus doesn't steal it.

1120
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,660
I like the idea of podcast Krampus because I feel like it's a very relatable thing for

1121
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,020
podcast creators.

1122
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,460
It's just losing shit.

1123
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,140
I listen to a lot of worst idea of all time.

1124
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,180
Those guys have lost like a dozen episodes at this point.

1125
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,900
Fucking podcast Krampus is busy in New Zealand.

1126
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,900
This one was sent in by Yahoo Answers user game recognized game Rachel Sperling.

1127
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:25,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user boomhauer.

1128
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,660
Did I call Rachel Sperling Yahoo Answers user Rachel Sperling?

1129
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,780
I think you might have.

1130
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:33,620
At this point, it's not inaccurate.

1131
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,260
That's a good point.

1132
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,260
Boomhauer asks.

1133
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,860
If I'm at an MLB game and that's Major League Baseball, could I help my team?

1134
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,140
Sorry?

1135
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,140
Go Royals?

1136
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,020
I'm going to jump right on that.

1137
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,460
You don't have to say go Royals.

1138
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,020
They won it.

1139
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,820
But that's why I'm jumping on it because they won it.

1140
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,060
Okay.

1141
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,900
So now I'm a fan.

1142
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,540
Good, good.

1143
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:59,860
If I'm at an MLB game, could I help my home team get a home run this way?

1144
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,500
Say that I am at an MLB baseball game and a batter for my home team hits a ball and starts

1145
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,140
running bases.

1146
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:12,180
So as the opposing outfielders are looking for the ball to drop so they can throw it

1147
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:18,660
to home or to a baseman to try and get my batter out, what I do is throw another baseball

1148
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,220
on the field to distract them from the real ball that is actually in play.

1149
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,420
So they all go after my baseball and then even if they get him out, the ruling is reversed

1150
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,540
when it turns out that they did so with an entirely different baseball that wasn't the

1151
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,580
one in play.

1152
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,300
So just help my team get a home run through the classic Sun Tzu strategy of creating a

1153
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,780
diversion.

1154
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,260
Could this work?

1155
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,500
It happens all the time.

1156
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,140
It does happen.

1157
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,780
It happened in the World Series game five last night.

1158
00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:03,300
The problem you're going to run into is that once you enter a second ball into play that

1159
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,540
then they have to play the rest of the game with two balls.

1160
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,340
It's like, what's that?

1161
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:12,980
Said two balls.

1162
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:13,860
Oh, excellent.

1163
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:14,420
Great.

1164
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,660
Yeah, it's like pinball rules when you get a multi ball.

1165
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,020
They're both in there now.

1166
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,980
You have to get two batters, two pitchers, two catchers all working.

1167
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,180
Backup catcher.

1168
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,140
Backup catcher.

1169
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,180
Pull him out of the outfield.

1170
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,620
That's what the book Catcher in the Rye is based on because that's what they call the

1171
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,060
area just behind the plate.

1172
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,900
They call that the rye.

1173
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,500
So two balls are going simultaneously and you have to keep track.

1174
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:45,460
Usually the judges, you know, the baseball judges, the panel will paint one of the balls

1175
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,700
red to help keep track of it.

1176
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,140
And that's the double point ball.

1177
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,940
Yeah, that's the one that's full of bonuses.

1178
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:58,020
And if you catch that one, nobody can touch you for like 30 seconds.

1179
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,340
I feel like these rules are getting a bit complicated.

1180
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,020
But now you have to be careful.

1181
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,220
Don't hit the green one.

1182
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,620
If you hit the green one, your team loses a point.

1183
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,380
That's the innocent ball.

1184
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,660
But if you hit the sort of glowing one, then your bat becomes imbued with those properties,

1185
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,060
which is like a plus three strength.

1186
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,660
Yeah, and then you can hit all of the basement with your bat as you run around.

1187
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,660
Yeah, but watch out because they can fight back.

1188
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,460
They got knives.

1189
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,940
Two ball baseball started as a joke to me.

1190
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,740
It would be sick.

1191
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,300
And now I really want to, it sounds way better.

1192
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,060
Can I bust it out, flip it, and reverse it for you, though?

1193
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:34,180
Hit me.

1194
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,740
What's the worst part of baseball?

1195
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,580
When your team is fielding.

1196
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,740
Yeah, it's just the outfield in general.

1197
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,940
It's a giant barren land where nothing exciting ever happens.

1198
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,100
Let's just get rid of it.

1199
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:46,740
Just infield.

1200
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:50,100
Just the core diamond, right?

1201
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,620
But then let's duplicate that, flip it around, mirror image.

1202
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,500
We're talking about two batters batting at each other.

1203
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,340
Oh, so like full court baseball.

1204
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,140
Full court baseball.

1205
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:02,820
Yeah, two balls.

1206
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,860
That's where the difference is.

1207
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:07,540
Full court baseball, yeah, two balls, that's where the two balls comes in.

1208
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,700
No defense, no defense whatsoever.

1209
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,900
And two gloves, one on each hand.

1210
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,340
Why they got that free hand?

1211
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,820
Yeah, just sort of like a home run death battle.

1212
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,900
This is amazing.

1213
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,020
This is very good.

1214
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,860
Would this work in football?

1215
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,060
There's no defense.

1216
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,700
No defense.

1217
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:28,820
Just two teams trying to score points on each other.

1218
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:29,940
Yeah, at the same time.

1219
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:31,700
Two footballs, double the pigskin, baby.

1220
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,140
So that sounds way, because like that cuts out the point part.

1221
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,020
Let me say this.

1222
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,500
Maybe shorten the old football field.

1223
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,900
Like, you know, 100 yards is a long way.

1224
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,260
I can't imagine going that far.

1225
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,020
Oh, go ahead.

1226
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,340
Do you think I'm going for arena football?

1227
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,460
Because that's not what I was going for.

1228
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,500
Oh, dang.

1229
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,180
No, no one wants to watch arena football.

1230
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,140
No one even wants to hear us tell jokes about arena football.

1231
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,060
I'm just talking like 25 yards.

1232
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:55,460
Oh my God.

1233
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:56,660
Whoa, okay.

1234
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,860
Yeah, I can conceptualize running 25 yards.

1235
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,740
So like that's how far it would need to be for me to play football.

1236
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,940
This pro crazy football that is like a future sport at this point.

1237
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,100
Yeah, and it only goes like 15 minutes.

1238
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,980
I mean, oh, shit.

1239
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,020
Oh, fuck.

1240
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,940
Advertising is at a premium.

1241
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,620
That sounds real digestible, yeah.

1242
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,460
Yeah, this sounds like, this kind of sounds like NFL Blitz at this point.

1243
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,300
The street football.

1244
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,500
Sounds like NFL shits.

1245
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,780
Can I hit you guys with another idea that's even better than all the ideas

1246
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,060
that you two have come up with so far?

1247
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,340
Yeah, please.

1248
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,740
NASCAR driving in circles.

1249
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:34,500
What if half the cars are driving one way and half the cars are driving the other way?

1250
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,060
And then it's like everybody's playing Mario Kart,

1251
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,500
but half the people are really bad at it.

1252
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,500
So they get far behind and instead of trying to win,

1253
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,100
they just like try and take the other people out.

1254
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,420
I do have to point out that this is like,

1255
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,740
we're doing this in our real lives every day.

1256
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,620
And it's just called like,

1257
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,140
homecoming traffic, different lanes.

1258
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,020
Not really that thrilling.

1259
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,820
And so just to keep it safe,

1260
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,420
we'll put a concrete divider in the middle of the road.

1261
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,380
There's going to be a bright yellow line dividing the two lanes.

1262
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,180
And then you know how sometimes like during NASCAR races,

1263
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,980
there are people like camped out in the middle and like trailers and shit.

1264
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,620
We got to give them some way to like get out of the middle of the thing.

1265
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,100
So we're going to put like a special light at one point on the racetrack

1266
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,180
that like tells the cars to like, hey, chill out.

1267
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,020
Brian's got to go refill his Diet Coke.

1268
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,380
So like a light that changes like if it's greener,

1269
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:23,380
then they can keep going.

1270
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,260
But if there's like a red one, then they have to stop going.

1271
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,620
Is that kind of what you're thinking?

1272
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:30,580
And you know, if it were me driving in a circle all day long,

1273
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,380
I'd get really bored.

1274
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:32,260
So I'd want some like,

1275
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,140
some like off-shoot roads that I could pull off

1276
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,380
and maybe head towards other roads.

1277
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:37,940
Yeah, sure.

1278
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,700
I don't see why the race has to be,

1279
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,420
I feel like the race, you should have to like find your own way.

1280
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:46,260
And so there should be lots of different roads leaving the racetrack.

1281
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,660
And then we can also just put a bunch of like residences

1282
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,940
and businesses to sort of all around.

1283
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,780
Yeah, so maybe I pull off the race and then like I stop at the office.

1284
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,260
Is this what the movie Cars is?

1285
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,500
I think this is basically the movie.

1286
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,260
What if people get bored in car city

1287
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,100
and they want to watch a race?

1288
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,100
So they have to maybe build a smaller go-kart track

1289
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,500
in the middle of car city that you can go to

1290
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,580
to watch an unfettered race.

1291
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:13,220
Yeah.

1292
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:16,340
And then we just keep collapsing that in on itself

1293
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,740
until we're like model cars, hot wheels,

1294
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,860
just like three guys sitting around a hot wheels track,

1295
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,660
just watching them go.

1296
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,500
It's just race cars all the way down, baby.

1297
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,540
Can we do golf?

1298
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,260
Can we do golf?

1299
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,420
What would golf be in these sort of like heightened,

1300
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,100
like 1v1 terms?

1301
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,460
I feel like you would need more than one person.

1302
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,420
I feel like a golf course, very big.

1303
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,380
People, very small, like an army.

1304
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,820
100 people batting in a circle for a hole in the middle of all of them.

1305
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:47,860
Last man standing.

1306
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:50,020
You go laser tag rules, right?

1307
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:56,180
Each golfer starts at opposing sides of the golf court

1308
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,180
and each one has a hole and a flag taped to their back,

1309
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,900
like coming out of their back.

1310
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,940
Oh, fuck.

1311
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:08,100
You're just like beaming golf balls at like,

1312
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,140
hey, I got a hole in Doug.

1313
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,900
Just sink it, just sink a hole in Doug.

1314
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,100
Man, that was a par four Doug.

1315
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,220
That was an incredible, incredible shot, Henry.

1316
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,380
Yeah, he hit up a tree, but I still got him.

1317
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,260
Still got him.

1318
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,900
He did fall out of the tree, landed right on his C6.

1319
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,940
Do you know what though?

1320
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,900
This is a realistic application for a backflip.

1321
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,780
Like if you can reliably do a backflip,

1322
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:31,620
no one's ever going to score on you.

1323
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:34,340
Nobody's ever golf dunked on Austin St. John.

1324
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,020
Hasn't been done.

1325
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:38,740
What are you trying to do?

1326
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,620
Forward, nice try.

1327
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:43,780
Flip.

1328
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,020
Oh, I'll get you Austin St. John.

1329
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,380
Rubble, rubble.

1330
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,780
Well, I don't think the Hamburglar

1331
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,180
was a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers villain.

1332
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,460
He had to get work after there.

1333
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,500
Rita, what was her fucking name?

1334
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,620
Rita Repulsa.

1335
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,420
Damn, Justin.

1336
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,260
Nice, good pull.

1337
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:00,900
Good pull, right?

1338
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:02,980
Should we end the show?

1339
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:04,580
Uh, no.

1340
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,140
Okay, this has been my brother,

1341
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,620
my brother, me, and it's a vice show for the modern era.

1342
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,220
I hope you guys liked this second take.

1343
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:17,380
Yeah, we said different things, so that's good.

1344
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,260
So that other one's just lost the time in memorial.

1345
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,300
Sorry about that.

1346
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,020
God, I fucking hate podcast crampus so much.

1347
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,060
We should tell you, we mentioned earlier,

1348
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,260
but just to reiterate,

1349
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,300
we are doing the Candle Nights show

1350
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,580
again here in Huntington, West Virginia.

1351
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,260
We're going to have Sawbones there

1352
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:42,020
and it's going to be a lot of fun,

1353
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,020
a lot of frivolity.

1354
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,100
There'll be an after party afterwards

1355
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,420
where we can like hang out and chill together

1356
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:56,180
and we'll have better sound than we had last year.

1357
00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:00,100
We had some sound issues and so we'll have that fixed.

1358
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,900
If you're looking for a place to stay, by the way,

1359
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,460
the show's at the Big Sandy Superstore Arena.

1360
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,940
It's actually in one of like the smaller rooms.

1361
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,220
We're not like playing in an arena,

1362
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,140
but there is a Holiday Inn like right next door.

1363
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,060
And it's one of the nice ones.

1364
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:15,940
It's one of the nice ones.

1365
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,980
It's a nice Holiday Inn.

1366
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,660
And you'll be close to like shopping and some food.

1367
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:22,020
And industry.

1368
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,380
And industry.

1369
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:27,140
You're literally right next to the venue,

1370
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,140
so it's going to be sick.

1371
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,020
And City Hall and the courthouse.

1372
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,300
There's so much to see and do.

1373
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,860
Jim's Spaghetti.

1374
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,140
If you actually go to justinmaccroy.wordpress.com,

1375
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,620
I did a post last year about stuff you can do in Huntington.

1376
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,740
There's a lot of fun stuff to do.

1377
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,820
And this will be on a Monday instead of a Sunday.

1378
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,340
So like shit will be open.

1379
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:48,900
I want to say thanks to NatureBox,

1380
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,980
where you can order hundreds of great tasting snacks

1381
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,740
and get a naturebox.com slash my brother

1382
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,060
to sign up for a great box of great tasting snacks.

1383
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,460
I might, can I recommend Swirl?

1384
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,860
It's a new snack flavor that they have.

1385
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,460
Can I recommend Apple Attack?

1386
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,460
Apple Attack.

1387
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,020
Apple Attack sad face.

1388
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,860
Yeah, there's an emoji in there.

1389
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,980
Not a real one, again.

1390
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,740
We also want to say go check out

1391
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,140
all the other amazing maximumfun.org shows.

1392
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,140
Shows like Sawbones that Justin and Sydney do,

1393
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,180
where they talk about the history of misguided medicine.

1394
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,860
You can check out Jordan, Jesse Goh,

1395
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,220
Judge John Hodgman.

1396
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,060
I do a show with my friend Andy,

1397
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,620
where we talk about how to survive different apocalypses

1398
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,660
called Bunker Buddies.

1399
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,420
I produce and semi co-host a show called

1400
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,620

1401
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,100
All about dogs and dog enthusiasts.

1402
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:40,900
There's tons of great shows on there.

1403
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,100
Go check them all out.

1404
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,140
Check every last one of them out.

1405
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,740
I want to thank John Roderick in the Long Winters

1406
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,100
for his theme song, It's a Departure,

1407
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,780
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1408
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:50,340
He's a super great guy, that John Roderick.

1409
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,540
And the band's super great and the music is very great.

1410
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:56,900
And go listen to it because it's great.

1411
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,100
It's a great holiday album.

1412
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,500
Also, we haven't mentioned in a while,

1413
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,940
but if you've got a question for us,

1414
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:05,780
you can send it to mbmbamatmaximumfund.org.

1415
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,620
Just make sure that, you know,

1416
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,460
that there's some form of advice being asked for.

1417
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,220
Some people are just like, which one's better?

1418
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,820
It's like, okay, that's not,

1419
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,740
we don't really make those decisions.

1420
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,700
We give advice.

1421
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,020
So as long as you're asking for advice, it'll be great.

1422
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,980
Also, no bummers.

1423
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,860
No bummers.

1424
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:22,500
No bummers.

1425
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,780
Should we close it out?

1426
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,820
Yeah, we're done.

1427
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,180
Oh, I'm having a stretch.

1428
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,260
That's excellent.

1429
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,220
Excellent update.

1430
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:30,180
So sinewy.

1431
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,380
How about this one?

1432
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,060
It was sent in by level9000.

Thank you, Drew.

1435
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Navya, who asks,

1436
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,340
who invented the names of things?

1437
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,980
I'm Justin McElroy.

1438
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,100
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

1440
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,420
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1441
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,700
Kiss your dad.

1442
00:58:51,700 --> 00:59:01,300
Swear on the lips.

And I'm Teresa.

And we host a show called One Bad Mother, a comedy podcast about parenting.

1450
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,180
Not a parenting podcast.

1451
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,060
Guess what?

1452
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,660
We both just had babies.

1453
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:27,720
