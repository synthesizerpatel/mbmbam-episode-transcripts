1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,280
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Oh, sorry, Griffin, I need you to,

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,400
Griffin, I need you to go first. You should have freaking told me that, man.

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,880
I'm telling you now, Griffin. You caught me with my pants down.

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
Okay, do it. Let me see if I can even remember what to

10
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,640
say because I need you as like the, to be my prompter. Let me see.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,360
Okay, well how about this. I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis McElroy.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,720
And I'm Griffin McElroy, the young, and I'll, I'm do Griffin.

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Shit. Oh, I didn't see you come in there. Sweep,

14
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,720
sweep, sweep, sweep. I was just cleaning up after another maximum fun drive. Sweep,

15
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,480
sweep, sweep. Trying to put all of our wonderful characters and costumes and grease paint

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,800
back in the trunk for another year. Sweep, sweep, sweep, mop, mop, mop.

17
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,560
Hey, it's old, it's old Bill. And he cleans up after us and when we do the max fun drive and

18
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
old Bill, I got to say, we made a huge dirty mess this time, bud.

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,440
Yeah, there's a lot of unused dildo jokes around here.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,160
That's my fault. I've been stockpiling them thinking I'd get on a great run

21
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,720
about dildos and it never came. I actually, that is part of my, I bought a bunch of dildo

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,960
jokes from extreme restraints.com several years back and I haven't had a chance to burn through

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,760
them. Well, don't burn your dildos. That is bad for the environment. See,

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,680
that's just one of the jokes you guys could have used this year. You didn't.

25
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
You're leaving a lot on the table for this max fun drive.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,400
Uh, it looks like that extreme restraints won't do a refund on these dildo jokes,

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
but they will do store credit if we did want to do a bunch of lube jokes.

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
Something to keep in mind. You want to trade them in for lube

29
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,520
jokes? Will they exchange one dildo joke and give us a sample of the lube jokes

30
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
so we can get kind of an idea of what we're talking about?

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,720
Yeah, it just says, here it comes, careful around this, but careful

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,600
around this, but it's slippery when wet. This is just Travis leaning back in.

33
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,480
This one just says lube him. I barely know him. So that's good. That could be cool.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:10,800
Yeah. I, um, uh, I, I have a huge contraption, uh, with various gears and cranks and turning,

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,840
uh, things. It's a very complicated and it's just for slamming my butt. It's called a lube

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Goldberg machine. Oh, that's nice. And that's great. Okay. Yeah. There's a,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,160
this deal's going through, baby. Yeah. Hey, uh, just, this is old Bill still.

38
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
Old Bill, what are you guys talking about? Do you guys want me to stick around?

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,720
Nah, we're doing like a different intro thing now, old Bill.

40
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,080
Cause I was cleaning up after, cause this is the last week of the Maximum Fun Drive. Sweep,

41
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,880
sweep, sweep. And this is people's last chance to become a member here at Maximum Fun HQ. Sweep,

42
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,960
sweep, sweep, but just keep the lights on. Keep old Bill, uh, in, in, you know, I do a lot of

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,560
collectibles. I have a lot of porcelain figures that I can't afford without your max fund membership.

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Sweep, sweep, sweep, mop, mop, mop. Yeah. And that is Bill Maher, which is weird.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,200
That's so weird. That Bill Maher is the one who cleans up after.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
I don't do it for the money. I do it for the love, the love of the cleaning.

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
Well, you do do it kind of for the money, Bill. Well, for the porcelain figures,

48
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
but I don't live off of porcelain figures. I mean.

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,920
Um, who would have been funnier there? If I'd said Bill de Blasio.

50
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
Bill de Blasio? Billingfall.

51
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,880
Should I give him like the- Bill Nye? But that wouldn't explain the-

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,360
That wouldn't explain the accent. No, I'm Bill Nye.

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,280
Oh. Bill Nye the cleaning guy.

54
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,160
Do you think Bill Nye, people get him confused for Bill Nye saying his name in a cool way? Like

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,800
here comes Bill Nye? So did you guys want me to stick around and-

56
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
No, I don't want you to have been here in the first place, Bill Maher. I think your

57
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
shit's reprehensible. I'm a different Bill Maher.

58
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Okay. I'm the one who loves cleaning.

59
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
So this is the final episode of the Max Fun Drive. Fortunately, we've probably gotten all

60
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,640
the money from you that we're going to get because you're certainly not going to reward

61
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,440
us after this. I would say bad introduction. I should also tell you, this is my two weeks

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,800
notice. So this is old Bill's final episode too. You guys will have to clean up your own

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,440
dildo jokes after this. You won't have old Bill to push around anymore. Sweep, sweep,

64
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
sweep. I have a brief story to tell you.

65
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Okay. Is it about me?

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,640
Bill Nye was a regular in a restaurant called Fiorello's on the Upper West Side back in 2015.

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:37,920
Well, he was performing Skylight on Broadway. He went in one night and the staff said,

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,520
Hey, Mr. Nye, the other Bill Nye is in the back of the restaurant. I said, Oh my God,

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,880
the pair met and had pictures taken. So were they friends or foes? There was no conflict.

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,200
We were respectful of one another.

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:59,520
I was slightly sniffy because my name is rarer, but he doesn't know that. He was very gracious

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,040
and we had a laugh and he'd had this conversation with people same as I had. So it was quite

73
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,040
funny to finally be united. Okay. This story is great, but the person I want to celebrate

74
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:19,600
is the person who worked the restaurant is like, Oh my fuck. Oh my God, it's happening

75
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,600
and I'm going to fucking do it. That's the weird thing is like, I'm going to go to Bill

76
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Nye. I'm going to go to fucking, uh, uh, uh, what's his pirate? Davy Jones. Davy Jones.

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm going to go right up to Davy Jones and tell him that beloved site is Bill Nye is

78
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
in this restaurant too. He's going to love this shit.

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,720
The moment I would love to be in the brain of that employee for is when Bill Nye walked

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,440
in and knowing Bill Nye, he was a regular that like the, the air of possibility. It

81
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,760
wasn't just crackled. Yes. I'm just like, it's happening. It's all just like the fortune

82
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,240
teller said. Anyway, this is the final episode of the max fun drive. Please, if you have

83
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
not, uh, joined the network, if you do enjoy our show and the other stuff that we make

84
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
and you want to support us in a very, very direct and meaningful way, uh, you can go

85
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
to maximumfund.org slash join and, uh, sign up to become a member, find the monthly membership

86
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,360
level that, uh, works for you. We know it is a strange time, uh, and, uh, an extremely

87
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,440
bad time. Um, but we, uh, strange almost didn't seem to cover it. Strange doesn't cover it

88
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,920
at all, but we, we do need your, uh, support and your support has allowed us to grow over

89
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,960
the last 10 years and turn this into our jobs and allow us to do all kinds of really fantastic

90
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,280
stuff. Uh, and so, uh, yeah, go, go check out the different levels. We will talk about

91
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,760
them later on in the show, but once again, it's maximumfund.org slash join, and this

92
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,920
is the last week of the drive. So, uh, if you, if you have been thinking about doing

93
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:57,600
it, don't wait, let's get into questions. Let's like help for a change. Finally. Sure.

94
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,560
Finally, let's help someone. Let me just open the question. Yeah. Somebody try, I don't

95
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,320
know if you sent them. I might not have. Okay. I mean, I'm looking at them. The wheels have

96
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:17,280
fallen off here. Let's go ahead and get those over on my desk. Pronto. I mean, I'm, I've

97
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,560
got them. Yeah, you've got them, but does that help me? Oh, you know, I guess I never

98
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,920
really thought about it like that, Jamien. Let's have it, bud. Come on. I just sent it.

99
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,040
You couldn't even put a subject in. Wow. No, I was rushing. You said top speed. You can't

100
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,600
see top speed and then get mad at me for not putting this. Dear Justin, these are the questions.

101
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:44,960
Love Travis. What if I need to find the right archives later? I come to you today and need

102
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:52,720
a bit of advice. That was unnecessary. I sent applications to many a college. Many have

103
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,360
sent back swag as stuff they like to call it. Travis, do you know what swag stands for?

104
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:08,880
Uh, sweet. Willy. Agreed. Stuff we all get. Oh. Yeah. As they like to call it. Most of

105
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
it is garbage, but one college sent me the most exquisite shirt. It proudly proclaims

106
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
I'm a member of their class of 2024, which I am not. I've worn this shirt many a time

107
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,600
at home as it is extremely comfortable. I wore it in public once where someone yelled

108
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,640
from a six feet distance. Yo, mascot represent. They didn't say mascot obviously. I had to

109
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,800
pretend I didn't hear him. What do I do if this happens again? That's for misrepresented

110
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,840
alma mater in Maine. I, uh, I had a shirt from Shepherd University, which I did a tour of,

111
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,600
uh, when I was weighing my options that, uh, I only recently got rid of and I did wear

112
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,880
a lot and did have a couple of times where people was like, oh, fuck yeah. Shepherd.

113
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,320
I went there. What, what, what was your major? I'd be like, my major was going to Marshall

114
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,440
University. A fine, a very fine institution. And I'm sorry that I wore that shirt, but,

115
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,440
uh, it, it makes my, it makes my eyes pop. You know, but there's another for, I got a

116
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,360
version of this where I did go to the University of Oklahoma and I would wear an OU sweatshirt

117
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,480
and someone would say boomer sooner and then attempt to ask me about what I thought of

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,000
current football team. That's tough. That's tough. That's when you play the part of,

119
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,680
I didn't go to OU. I just liked this shirt. But I did. My thing is having people yell

120
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,840
boomer sooner at me. Yeah. Just like that. That's the only way I could feel alive.

121
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,920
Um, I mean, you gotta know that this is a risk when you wear a free shirt. Like there's

122
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,200
no such thing as a free shirt. I forget who said that. Um, it was Abraham Lincoln. It was

123
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,880
Abe Lincoln. Uh, and that's why he was the, what we call the topless president. Um, always had

124
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,960
even when someone tried to buy him a shirt or tried to sell him a shirt. He said nice. He said

125
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,640
nice fucking try. He said, you gotta wake up a little bit earlier than that to get old Abe

126
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Lincoln. And, and then unfortunately, um, someone did wake up quite early. Um, I don't think you

127
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
should wear the shirt anymore if you're not ready to, if you don't have like an arrow in this quiver,

128
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,400
you know what I mean? Especially since it says class of 2024. So it is not just like,

129
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,320
it doesn't just say like Marshall University. It says Marshall University,

130
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,600
class of 2024. Your shirt is a lie. It's a lie. It is weird though. It's a weird called shot for

131
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,720
this school, right? Like, well, I'm not going to come there. Well, but we gave you the shirt.

132
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,520
Maybe. The shirt said you did come here. Your shirt said you're coming. I mean, listen,

133
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,240
it says right here, it's an exquisite shirt. Seems like this college is so confident in this shirt

134
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,400
that they're like, once we send them the shirt, we got them. This is like when McDonald's sent

135
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,920
me a shirt that said I ate 100 Big Macs today. And then I was like, oh geez. I mean, I do want

136
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,640
to wear the shirt, but oh shit. Now it's like a prophecy. Now it's now we're, we're as final

137
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,040
destination. There's no escaping this. I'm going to eat a hundred big, big, big, big Macs today.

138
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,760
Yeah. Maybe you should just go to the college. Do you think about that?

139
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,840
Just freaking go and expand your horizons. Take some classes, learn a new language.

140
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,280
They probably have other cool shirts. Oh yeah. Experiment with yourself, with your body.

141
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,400
With your body.

142
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,600
With other people's bodies?

143
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,920
With consent.

144
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,320
With consent.

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,400
Do not experiment on people without consent.

146
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,800
But biohack your body. Give yourself like a-

147
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,880
Yeah, biohack your body. See if you can make your butt glow like a firefly.

148
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,840
Put a fucking flash drive somewhere in there. Give yourself like a, an antenna.

149
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
Oh yeah.

150
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,280
That's what college is for, is to put in antennas.

151
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,040
And what I hate about this, this show is I can't even zone out for 30 seconds and then snap back

152
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,200
in and have any idea what the fuck you guys are talking about. You know what I mean? I feel like

153
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
I should be able to check out every once in a while and check back in and be like, oh, I get

154
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
the bit. I know what we're doing here, but like antennas and stuff. What are you talking about?

155
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,120
You see, one time my friend Bob told me that people were inventing this biohacking thing

156
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,920
where I could inject myself with some sort of genome that made it so my muscles were engaged

157
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,400
all the time and would give me super strength. Now, to Bob's credit, I don't know how much of

158
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,400
that is what he actually said, or how much of that is what I just heard.

159
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:18,800
Hold on.

160
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,440
But ever since-

161
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,120
Very difficult thing, isn't it? Memory.

162
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,920
Yes. So ever since I heard that, I've just thought about like, hey,

163
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,600
can we hurry up and perfect that? Because that sounds really cool.

164
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,240
So you're telling me like you go to the optometrist and they're like, oh yeah,

165
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,160
Travis, it looks like your eyes, they do need a slightly stronger prescription. It looks like

166
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,720
your cones have deteriorated. But what you're hearing is like, yeah, we're going to give you

167
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,960
super cool laser glasses that are going to turn your eyes into x-ray eyes, and you're going to

168
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,760
love it.

169
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,280
I am always disappointed when I get the eye tests and they do the lens things and they're like,

170
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,160
better like this or better like that. And I want it to just keep getting better. Like where's that

171
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,280
glasses technology, right? Like if you know how to fix my eyes to normal, just keep going.

172
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,920
That's good. That's good. That's that Seinfeld shit. Here's a Yahoo that was-

173
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,480
That's not a joke. I'm angry about this.

174
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,080
I know, I know. Graham Roboc sent this one in. Thanks, Graham. It's from an anonymous Yahoo

175
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,600
answers user who I'm going to call Lucius asks, I dropped my library book in the toilet and I need

176
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,880
to return it by tomorrow.

177
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,800
So after pulling it out of the toilet, most of the pages were wet. Can I still take the book back?

178
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,720
If not, how can I dry it without damaging it even more? I don't know that there is a level of dryness

179
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,040
that is ever going to make it not a toilet book. Like you can remove, you can remove,

180
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,040
you can desaturate the book, but you cannot de-toilet-ate the book. It will always be a

181
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:55,120
toilet book forever now. And here's the thing, folks. Before you all jump to email us, dear

182
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:03,040
Justin, Travis, and Griffin, maybe it was a clean toilet. One, no such thing. Two, are you saying

183
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,240
that this question asker was just standing over the toilet, not using it, just like that's where

184
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
they had stopped randomly to read their book over an open toilet? I'm so glad Travis finally brought

185
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,680
this up because every episode we get these clean toilet people coming after us because we talk

186
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,600
about like, oh no, you dropped your phone in the toilet, it's done. Every fucking episode we get 50

187
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,160
emails like, oh, toilets can be clean if you clean them. People listen. At the toilet factory where

188
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,640
they make the toilets, somebody finishes screwing on the toilet seat and gives it one final spit

189
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:45,840
shine and then they look at it and they go, ugh, gross. It's a toilet where people do the worst

190
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,600
stuff we can do with our bodies, we do to these chairs. There is no cleaning them.

191
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,440
When they raise the toilets in captivity, the elders tell them there is no better life for you,

192
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:04,320
child. You must accept now you are a dookie machine. They don't aspire to anything better

193
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:11,840
than that. This is what they assume they're made for and that is unshakable. If you drop a book

194
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:21,120
in a toilet that's just come out of the store, it still has been raised to know that it accepts

195
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,720
only excrement and pee pee. There should be a fancy word for pee pee. I know, right?

196
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:34,640
Yeah. The good news is this, that a book was already written that lets you know at what

197
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:42,640
temperature books burn. So if you pop that book in the oven at 450, that's going to dry that out.

198
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,200
450 is going to get it done fast.

199
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,920
You may even want to, I don't know how precise your oven is. Calibration is important, but

200
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,960
you may even want to bump that down a few degrees.

201
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,280
No, no, no. If you're talking about how fast you can do it, 450, but Justin is right. You

202
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,920
are going to want an accurate temperature in there because sometimes it could be plus or

203
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,800
minus five degrees.

204
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,920
Yeah. And then you're going to fucking call Ray Bradbury and be like,

205
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,040
I have a complaint to regist- Oh, he's not. He's pat- Oh.

206
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,840
Do you think old Ray Bradbury was doing some really in-depth testing with that where he's like,

207
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,240
okay, 450, no, 452, definitely. Let me see. There's gotta be.

208
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,160
Yeah. So here's the good news. You can look inside of the library book for that little

209
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,560
card that I'm guessing is still in there that shows you how many times it's been checked out.

210
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:37,680
Yeah.

211
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:45,840
Let's say if your name is the third one on there, if you are at least the third person to have

212
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,400
been loaned this book, it's been in a toilet at some point. At some point-

213
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
In the toilet or around the toilet?

214
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,240
I mean, I'm not so much of a proof that I think if it's in a bathroom somewhere, that it has been

215
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,560
permanently befouled as it would if it had actually entered the commode perimeter. But if you're the

216
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,360
third person to get this book, odds are one of the first two people did drop it in the loo.

217
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,680
Now, one time I did leave a paperback copy of 1984 in the rain, and it did dry. But when it dried,

218
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,440
it was all wrinkly and crinkly, which I don't understand the chemical reaction that happened

219
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:32,480
there. But it was pretty obvious that something dynamic had happened to this tome. So I don't know

220
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,960
that you could, even if you dried it thoroughly, roll back up and be like, yeah, I finished it.

221
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,920
It was a real page-turner. Here you go.

222
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:47,680
Yeah, that's a good point. There is no, sorry. I don't know what kind of book conditioner you

223
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,800
need to rub all over these pages in order to get back there.

224
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,240
I would like you to trust me with another book now, please.

225
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,520
It's weird how even if a book dries out after you get it wet, it still looks wild.

226
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah.

227
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,240
Isn't that weird? The book's like, oh, finally, I can kind of stretch out a little bit.

228
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Oh, thank you so much. This is the real me.

229
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,760
How about another question?

230
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,960
Oh, Griff, I'd love that, bud. What I'd love even more is if it had just happened organically,

231
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,320
because I think we all felt the moment, and I was about to just launch into it.

232
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:24,720
Okay.

233
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,680
So just kind of, okay, just a note.

234
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,880
How about another question?

235
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,120
I recently got a new water bottle that's big enough to hold the recommended daily intake.

236
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,520
That's not possible. You don't think you're going to have a 64-ounce water bottle?

237
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,360
Nobody should be drinking 60. I scoff at 64-ounce. I have 64 ounces before breakfast.

238
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Wait, do you-

239
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
I'm putting away-

240
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm confused.

241
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm putting away 120 on the daily.

242
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,920
Are you okay?

243
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,120
That's a lot, bud.

244
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,120
You know what? If you look at that 64-ounce's recommendation, that doesn't take into account

245
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,840
height, weight, activity, none of that stuff. And it's also antiquated.

246
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,600
We need to be pounding water 24 hours a day.

247
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,880
Not so much that you die, lawyers.

248
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,080
Sorry.

249
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,200
But what about when I'm asleep?

250
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,600
Sorry, lawyers.

251
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,440
Not so much that you die, asterisk.

252
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,120
And Justin's not going to say don't pee so you keep all that good water inside your body

253
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,560
anymore, because he used to say stuff like that, and we did get in a little spot of legal trouble.

254
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:34,560
Yeah, you just- Anyway, it's not possible. I have a 20-ounce water bottle that I drink

255
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,040
six to eight times every day. You need more water.

256
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,880
And you're a big strong boy.

257
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,320
I'm a huge man.

258
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,880
That's not what I said.

259
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,360
I recently got a new water bottle. It's big enough to hold the recommended daily intake,

260
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,600
which we've established as a fabrication. But moving on. I've been filling it up in my

261
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,800
work's water cooler with no issue. But as I was filling it up today, two people got in line behind

262
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,360
me. One of my co-workers started talking about how we only have a limited number of water jugs

263
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,560
for everyone to use. How should I just take one of the huge gallons back to my desk and joked if I

264
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,280
was going to replace the bottle when I was done? What's the etiquette here? Should I fill my bottle

265
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,840
up at home instead? Should I step out of line if other people are behind me? I just want to stay

266
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,160
hydrated. That's from professionally parched.

267
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,560
Your co-worker is a fucking asshole.

268
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah, I think a good tactic here is to sort of hoist up your leg and lift open the bottom of

269
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,880
one of the pant legs and tell them to huff the farts right out of there. If that's the fucking

270
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,200
energy and attitude they're going to bring to your doorstep.

271
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,480
Your job has so few bennies, right? Like you get, what, maybe if you're lucky, insurance.

272
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:50,080
Maybe like a parking space, right? Maybe even a company car. But water is a basic human building

273
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,640
block.

274
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Shitty! These co-workers who are complaining are like,

275
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,640
yeah, I mean, we've all signed on to work until our bodies die and we'll be kept at

276
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,320
sort of the poverty line the whole time, but too much free wawa over there, don't you think, Jeffy?

277
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,600
No, okay. I want to leap to the co-worker's defense, which they don't list in our podcast,

278
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,280
so I don't know why I'm doing this. But if this person does have, and we have to assume a 64 ounce

279
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,160
bottle of water, because I feel like anything larger than that would be wild. I mean, I've

280
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:31,360
maybe seen big gulps that are bigger, but very rare. This is a lot. I mean, this is a tankard,

281
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:39,360
okay? This is a big, big old, big old jug. If you just want to get up and enjoy a cup of water

282
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,400
and someone is like taking five minutes to fill their tankard, I think that you're into like

283
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:53,840
grocery rules, right? I have one thing, you have 50 things, I'll go ahead. Oh, you only have one

284
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,480
thing, you go right ahead because I don't want to hold you up with my 100 things that I'm buying.

285
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,480
I feel like if you're going to fill up a huge jug of water and there's somebody behind you that

286
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,280
just has one of those delicate little cones for no one, then you should let them have their delicate

287
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,720
cone of water like they're a fucking hummingbird that knows shit about hydration.

288
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,480
What I like to call the memory of a drink. Imagine if one of those paper cones probably

289
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,800
holds six ounces of water, right? If that. If that, right? So your daily amount of hydration

290
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,400
is 10 times, oh sorry, I'm reading now four ounces, okay? So that's basically not applicable.

291
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,840
I have to get a calculator out now to figure out. 16. Let's say we're working off 64, it's four

292
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,840
ounces. That's 16 cups of water. Imagine if you were standing behind someone and they filled that

293
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,120
cup up and pounded it 16 times right in front of you. Now that'd be amazing. It'd be amazing.

294
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,920
How about this? The next time that asshole coworker is out there, because here's the thing,

295
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Justin, you're not wrong about the grocery rules. I do agree with you on that. If they had said,

296
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,360
may I fill my cup real quick? That's not what I said though, is it? No. So here's what you do.

297
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Next time you see them getting up, you beeline over there and get in front of them, and you have

298
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:16,560
taken an empty water jug jug, and you're just going to transfer all the water left in the jug

299
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,240
into your giant jug, and then take your empty water jug back to your desk, leaving an empty

300
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:30,240
water jug on the top. And then the juice is running. And then it's going to come at a premium.

301
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,480
You've moved all the full jugs to your desk where you sit atop them in an H.T.O.O. throne.

302
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,440
And what will you do after you're fired that day?

303
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,440
I mean, they can't fire you at that point. You're fucking a Morton Joe.

304
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,840
You are the keeper of the water. The water flows when you say it does.

305
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,920
I drink your bottled water.

306
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:00,640
I've abandoned my job. You don't have time to work. You're hoarding water.

307
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,080
It's the fucking gall. Are you going to replace that? The fucking gall of it.

308
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:17,120
No one wants to be here. It's water. Can you not just fucking chill? Go to the sink. The sink

309
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,760
water is fucking fine. I'm giving you a 10 minute excuse not to work. You're welcome.

310
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,360
We should be in the boss's office fucking tearing them limb from a limb for what they're doing for

311
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,680
us. And then we are going to take this building hostage and dismantle the entire fucking economy

312
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,720
brick by brick and nail by nail. But you're in here like too much water, Dougie. Are you fucking

313
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:53,360
kidding me? Yeah, this is something that the ruling class has invented to keep the peasants

314
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
occupied. It's not even counting deck chairs on the Titanic. It's like someone coughed in

315
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,240
the Titanic while it was sinking. And another person was like, can you cover your mouth?

316
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:14,320
How rude. It's like somebody fucking drop kicks you off of a lifeboat on the Titanic. So all

317
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,760
the riches can get on it. And you accidentally bump into another poor on the way. And they're

318
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:28,000
like, what's your fucking problem, man? You think there had to be, I bet what you're describing with

319
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,720
the coughing did happen at least one time on the Titanic. Oh yeah. That would be so choice.

320
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,120
Could you tell me a little bit about Max Fun Drive? All right. Let's say that I love supporting

321
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,120
the things that I love. And I'm already at Maximumfun.org forward slash join. I'm ready

322
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,920
to pledge some money to help keep these wonderful shows going, but I'm doing it out of the goodness

323
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,800
of my heart. But guess what? I'm going to get some gifts in return. If I pledge $5 a month,

324
00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm going to get over 200 hours of bonus content. Our amount of stuff there is wild. There's

325
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,200
commentary tracks for our TV show. We've had episodes where our wives do the show

326
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,400
for us out of, which was one of my faves because it didn't require any work. And they're better

327
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,880
at it than we are. And they're much better. Better at it than we are. Their advice is actually like

328
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,840
worth taking, which is a big departure for us. If you can pledge $10, there's many other shows with,

329
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,520
I mean, many dozens of other programs to enjoy. If you can pledge $10 a month, you can get all

330
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,920
the boco, as I hate saying. But you're also going to get one of 40 different enamel pins

331
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,160
from your favorite Max Fun show. There's other gifts. $20 a month, there's a game pack with

332
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
Max Fun dice and cards. But really what you're doing is you're pledging money to help keep the

333
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,480
shows you love coming. Out of every pledge, a small portion of it goes to Max Fun. And then

334
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,800
the rest is divided amongst the shows that you say you listen to when you sign up. So it's a way of

335
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:11,280
directly supporting these shows. That money goes to, well, for starters, it helps us pay our bills

336
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,200
and feed our kids and put clothes on their backs, which is so cool of you. But also buy audio

337
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,880
equipment and hosting and everything else. So we very, very, very much appreciate your support.

338
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Literally, this is not a line. It is the only reason we are able to do what we do,

339
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:41,200
especially currently with the world as shitty as it is. We can't go tour, do any sort of live stuff

340
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,440
or anything like that. So we really are depending on you. So please, please, please, please, please,

341
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,360
please, please, please, maximumfun.org forward slash join. This is the last time you're going

342
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,840
to hear about it on our show, except for maybe a brief reminder at the end. If you've been waiting

343
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:04,240
until the last moment, this is practically it. Please, maximumfun.org forward slash join. If

344
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,000
you're already a member, we really appreciate you. You're the best. Thank you so, so, so much.

345
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,360
And please, if you can find it in your heart and you're not already a member, please go ahead and

346
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:20,560
join us. And we should just say, I mean, we're pitching this, right? This is the max fun time

347
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:25,840
of year. But if you're not able to, we also understand that. Man, it's uncertain out there.

348
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,640
We were just talking about like, we haven't been able to tour. We haven't been able to do stuff.

349
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,280
We get it. It's tough out there for everybody. And if you're not able to, you can do things like

350
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,600
share that maximumfun.org slash join link. You can use the hashtag max fun drive. You can share

351
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,880
clips with people. You can retweet tweets about the show, anything like that. All that support

352
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,040
matters to us too. We also have a thing this year called boosting. In the past, we have talked a lot

353
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,160
about like upgrading your membership and maybe you're not ready to move up to a new level this

354
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,160
year, but you still want to give a little bit more to support the shows you love. You can do that by

355
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,600
boosting, which allows you to incrementally increase your membership without having to move

356
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,040
up to the next level. It won't qualify you for the rewards other than the bonus content because

357
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,760
every member gets that. But it's a way to support a little bit more if you're looking to do that.

358
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,240
How about another Yahoo from Yahoo Answers. Yahoo, the website, they do email and they

359
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,640
do answers. Those are their two services they provide. This is one of the latter. It was sent

360
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:36,240
in by Emma Camp. Thank you, Emma. So Yahoo Answers use James who asks, how do I get the most out of

361
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:44,560
my time at the Olive Garden? We talk a lot about sort of like maximizing, exploiting the Olive

362
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,840
Garden economy is this constant source of conversation on this show. We've talked about

363
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,240
like minimum age requirements for even entering the Olive Garden facility, which is important.

364
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,320
We've squared that away. This is more, listen, it's tough to get out to restaurants right now,

365
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:10,320
isn't it? And by tough, I mean morally indefensible, but also tough. So when you're there,

366
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,200
we know your family, but how can you really make each fucking moment matter?

367
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,920
What's great about that question, Griffin, I'm so glad you brought it to the table,

368
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,800
is like it is subjective in such a poignant way, right? Because one could argue pasta and bread

369
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:35,040
are very filling, right? So you can't just say eat some pasta and breadsticks, right? Because then

370
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,840
you're going to get full very quickly. But also counterpoint, you can't say just like eat some

371
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,600
like lettuce and cherry tomatoes and get the most lettuce and cherry tomatoes you can, because are

372
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,640
you really getting the most out of your Olive Garden experience? Yeah, so wait, now this is

373
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,120
interesting. Instead of coming to a compromise between those two ideas, we should measure which

374
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,400
one is the best. But just to say the two extremes are you enter the Olive Garden and never eat

375
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,800
and never leave. They won't kick you out. It's a fucking Olive Garden. Yeah. You can just kind of

376
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:13,280
ride your family. They cannot kick you out. You're their dad now. And you can just kind of chill

377
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,440
and never eat and be there forever. And there you are making the most out of your time because you

378
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,920
have given yourself infinite time. The alternative to that is you walk into the Olive Garden and they

379
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,840
shoot you in the face with a spaghetti gun. And then you get what you get, you slam what you can

380
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,720
slam, and you turn on your heels and walk right out the door. This is a lot like asking about

381
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,360
life, Griffin, when you think about it. It's interesting that you say that. Yeah, should you

382
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,200
live a timid life, but be in the Olive Garden for as long as you can, or lead an adventurous,

383
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,040
aggressive life, but only have a limited time in the Olive Garden? Okay, you guys are fucking

384
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,760
wasting time. When you first show up, you're going to be waiting for a table. Tell them,

385
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,960
while you're waiting, you can get half off wine, okay? So that's one thing that you need to know

386
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,440
right now. And I know that from my time as an employee. That's huge. That's going to be

387
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,720
maximizing your budget and also your time. Well, before you even do that, though,

388
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:23,040
be saying the word, be shouting the word spaghetti as you walk in the door. As you are in the

389
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:30,960
vestibule, in the airlock from the front door to the door in, be saying spug, like ready to

390
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,920
get it going. May I take it one step further? Please. Call as you're driving there and request

391
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,920
that a server meet you outside with a basket of breadsticks so you can be eating the breadsticks

392
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:50,960
as you walk into the building. Good. Have them hang breadsticks from string from the ceiling

393
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,160
that you can nibble on as you sprint at full speed to the table they've prepared for you.

394
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:01,120
Maybe you open your car door to drive to the Olive Garden. What's that on your driver's seat?

395
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,000
Basket of breadsticks. Hey, hey, guys, I have stumbled on an article called Olive Garden Hacks,

396
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,600
24 secrets straight from your server. Yes. Because I wanted to make sure that that half off wine

397
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,000
thing was legit. I'm worried from the journey I'm about to take you guys on. I'm worried we're not

398
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,120
going to have time to do the rest of the podcast, but I'm just going to. Now we do have some money

399
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:31,520
zones. Should we go ahead and do the money zone? There's 24 secrets here. We got to cancel the ads.

400
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,240
Yeah, we may not have time for the ads. Okay. There are some that are less wild, right? Split

401
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,200
your meal with your partner in order to use two coupons at once. Okay, that's a little annoying,

402
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:49,120
but sure. Here's the first one. Never pay full price for your kids to eat at Olive Garden.

403
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:54,720
Olive Garden, about once every two months, two to three months, Olive Garden runs week-long

404
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,120
promotions where kids can eat for only $1. Unless you just got to have those breadsticks now,

405
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,800
I recommend waiting for these promotions. Can you imagine staring your kids straight in the

406
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,720
fucking face and be like, they're like, mommy, can we go to Olive Garden? Like, well, when you

407
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:13,280
cost a dollar, we can. Absolutely not. We're just going to keep aspiring to it. Don't buy the wine.

408
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,440
Bring your own cheaper bottle instead. What? And you bring your own wine to Olive Garden. They're

409
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:27,520
going to charge you a $7 corkage fee. That's insane. Okay. That's unbelievable that that

410
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,280
structure is in place. For that to work, then that means that whatever bottle of wine you bring has

411
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:45,760
to be at least $7.01 cheaper than what you were. Almost certainly, yes. The markup there has to be.

412
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,520
You probably will be saving. Just the idea of being at Olive Garden and you reach into your

413
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,240
giant cargo short pants and pull out from the cargo shorts, the pocket, a bottle of wine and

414
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,840
say, I'll be paying a corkage fee for this wine I brought. Get this. You can sample up to three

415
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:10,240
wines for free. The sample pour is three ounces. That can't be right. That's nine ounces of the

416
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,760
good stuff. That can't be right. This is number 12 on this list. Employees get 50% off meals after

417
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,320
their shift. This is one of the highest employee discounts I've seen. Considering a career in the

418
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,280
restaurant industry and you love pasta, you're all set. That's not a tip. That's not so much a hack,

419
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,320
really. That's a pivot of your life. Hey, honey, you want to go to either Olive Garden tonight?

420
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,240
Give me a second to fill out this employment form online. Let me call my boss at the hospital to tell

421
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,760
him I'm quitting being doctor. This person must have sold the article as 24 tips and then started

422
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,920
to get really desperate because number 16 is ask your server to box up half your meal when they

423
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:03,120
serve it to you. Voila, two meals. What? No. Not at all in any way, shape, or form is that the

424
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,760
truth. And how is that an Olive Garden hack and not a just sort of like- That's a life hack.

425
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah. Hey, when you bring me the meal, box up half of it before you bring it to the table.

426
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,800
Someone's been doing their research. Yeah, you heard that you can get two meals for the sprites

427
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,680
of one that way. Daddy, I'm doing my math homework. What's 16 divided by two? Oh, you mean like at

428
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:34,640
Olive Garden? Okay, this is good. Order half and half soup if you can't decide which soup you want.

429
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,680
Olive Garden has four different kinds of soup. You guys know, I'm saying with me, minestrone,

430
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:48,560
chicken gnocchi, zuppa, Toscana, and pasta. How do you decide? You mix and match. Ask your server to

431
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,960
mix the zuppa Toscana soup and the chicken gnocchi together, or enjoy the pasta e fagioli with the

432
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:03,040
veggie heavy minestrone for less calories. So basically, your tip is to be a soup lunatic

433
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,880
who just says, hey, I'm sure you worked on these recipes or whatever, but just go ahead and dump

434
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,480
them all in one vat for me. And if you could bring a straw with that, I'd appreciate it.

435
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,080
I just wanted to check and see if you guys were ready to order. Yes, could you ruin some soup

436
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:28,160
for me, please? Of course, of course. You know what? How about just give me one fifth a portion

437
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:34,320
of all five mixed together? Yes, of course. Yes, the soup mess, as we call it.

438
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,280
I ask for an Italian soda, even though it's not on the menu. So it's not on the menu anymore,

439
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,560
but you can order an Italian soda with the flavors from the Olive Garden lattes. I think that if you

440
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,440
ordered an Italian soda from the server at Olive Garden, they would stare at you blankly and then

441
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,800
lie on the ground until you left. All of these tips do seem to assume a certain level of engagement

442
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,360
from the Olive Garden employee, that they wouldn't just say like, no. And the last tip here is buy

443
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:12,000
Olive Garden dressing in grocery stores. So I guess maybe you could bring your own bottle of

444
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,560
dressing and just pay the corkage fee on that. Like, oh no, I brought my own. Thank you.

445
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,280
Now we really, really should go to the Money Town, though. All right, let's go. Come on.

446
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:41,680
What more needs to be said? They're comfortable. Well, the ad has a lot of more.

447
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,200
Okay, now I was trying to do like a prestige-y thing. What more needs to be said? They're

448
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
comfortable, yes, but they also want you to be comfortable expressing yourself

449
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,680
because they've dedicated, okay. Do you remember when I said let's try and get through these

450
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,760
fast and now you're doing it like some sort of like damaged magician robot? I was trying to do

451
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,600
it like it was like an Apple like presentation, okay. You sound like a broken clockwork man.

452
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:13,920
Please do it faster. Meonies is dedicated to making the world's softest undies in classic colors,

453
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,920
but also fun prints like dinosaurs and surfboards. I have ones that have slices of pizza on it

454
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,720
that I really, really enjoy. Every time I put it on, it makes me feel like a real tubular dude.

455
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,920
And these super soft fabrics start with sustainably sourced beechwood trees

456
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,200
that magically turn from pulp to yarn to undies. And I never want anyone to explain to me how a

457
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,760
tree becomes my underpants. They're just great. So if you want to try these tree-based underpants,

Celebrity wine why not?

474
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,000
Huh.

475
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,600
Celebrity wine why?

476
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
This is the mashup.

477
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,480
Ma- ma- mashup.

478
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:10,960
Celebrity wine why squad? Welcome to Celebrity Wine Why Munch Squad. It's a podcast within a podcast

479
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,960
within a podcast that profiles the latest and greatest in brand eating and wine.

480
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:21,200
Um this is not a celebrity wine per se but it is a where the world's wine and the world of

481
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,160
Munch Squad meet. Uh so this is uh extremely exciting for me uh to finally get these two

482
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,960
great brands together and it's funny that I'm bringing two great brands together because uh

483
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,040
thank you to Chris before I move on for sending this along. Um the pack is back.

484
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:46,800
Cheez-It, White Cheddar, and Refreshing House Wine Rosé combine for two- a year two toast.

485
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,320
Just in wine- just in time, sorry, unintentional pun, just in time for National Wine and Cheese Day,

486
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,680
Cheez-It and House Wine, which are neither, uh offer the perfect summer pairing.

487
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:07,200
The FOMO-inducing Cheez-It and Wine Box that had everyone buzzing last year is back.

488
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,880
What? Wait, so remember when everyone was buzzing a year ago about this?

489
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,080
But more than that the implication being that I might see perhaps some sort of influencer on

490
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:25,360
Instagram enjoying this Cheez-It and Wine Box combination and I would be like oh god I'm so

491
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:32,160
afraid I'm missing out. Yes. Okay. Uh this year's limited edition offers a brand new summer ready

492
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,440
combination. Cheez-It, White Cheddar, and House Wine Rosé. Why do they continue to put the White

493
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,480
Cheddar after Cheez-It? I don't know. That's very irritating. Made with 100% real cheese. Cheez-It,

494
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,440
White Cracker- House Wine. House Wine. I mean with 100% real cheese. Cheez-It, White Cheddar,

495
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,640
Crackers. I don't know man we keep squeezing the cheese and this incredible rosé keeps squishing

496
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:07,120
out of it. Your guess is as good as mine dude but don't stop the cash cow. That's some slippery

497
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,160
language made with 100% real cheese. All that is guaranteeing you is a single molecule of cheese

498
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:20,160
at some point in the process. White Cheddar Crackers pair perfectly with the crisp refreshing

499
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:27,280
flavor of House Wine Rosé. All in one convenient package. If your idea of convenience is carrying

500
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,560
around a sloshy box of crackers from your living from your kitchen to your living room. And also

501
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,080
definitely uneven weight right? There's no way. Oh for sure. For sure. The wine side must be heavier

502
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:44,240
than the Cheez-It side. Yeah it's like an adult box of nerds. Uh it no secret it's no secret that

503
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,240
rosé is the ideal beverage for peak of summer. That's true you know rosé used to be so we're

504
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,880
looked down upon but there's a lot of great rosés. Are you saying it right and I've been saying it

505
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:01,760
wrong all my life? How have you been saying it Travis? Rosé. Pink. But you're saying it like

506
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:12,320
rosé. It doesn't matter. The crisp flavor of everyone's favorite summer drink. The tasty combo

507
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:24,400
is perfect for socially distant happy hour. Hey boss. Imagine. Imagine the socially distanced

508
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:32,400
party where the only the only concessions available are a single box of Cheez-It and wine.

509
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,880
But which by the way um is distributed through a spigot on the front of the box which I would

510
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,040
argue makes it the least perfect beverage to have at your socially distant happy hour.

511
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:50,480
Now I will say just as far as like getting it across the room my friends and I did used to

512
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,840
play space bag in college where we would take the bag out of the box of wine and hurl it across the

513
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,800
room at each other yelling space bag and if you got hit by it you had to drink but if you caught

514
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,800
it the other person had to drink. Yeah space bag. We know space bag. Yeah so you could get it across

515
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,960
the room easily without having to get in within six feet of each other but as Justin has indicated

516
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,800
there is a point in all space bag games where you have to put your mouth on a spigot. And that ain't

517
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:24,000
gonna get the Fauci seal of approval. No the tasty combo is perfect for a socially distant happy hour

518
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,160
a virtual book club or a cozy night on the couch. You know we all contain multitudes for sure but

519
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:38,080
I'm not sure there's a huge demographic that loves books almost as much as they love chugging

520
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:46,320
down dirty crackers with rotten strawberry water or a cozy night on the couch watching reality tv

521
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,800
with a few friends. We're actually not doing that anymore. I don't know if you all actually heard

522
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,160
that that's not actually what we're doing anymore. This is definitely someone who's writing this

523
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,920
copy and they could think of two things and they're like and you know when everything reverts

524
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,120
back to the way it was. You know these are for dirt bags too that don't give a shit about people

525
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:14,160
they can enjoy our thing. And this is you it could be enjoyed by yelling while yelling at people in

526
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:22,240
the supermarket. Following the success of our first edition of cheese it and wine which sold out in

527
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:28,000
minutes. What? We knew we had to bring the partnership back this summer with a new flavor

528
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,960
pairing said Jeff Delona senior director of marketing for cheese it. Was it sold online?

529
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:39,040
Yeah it's just online only. White cheddar is a long-standing favorite of cheese it fans and what

530
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:44,560
better match than light refreshing rose. Not only does it perfectly complement the cheesy goodness

531
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,920
it's also the unofficial wine of summer. You could just call it the official wine of summer I don't

532
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,960
think summer's gonna fucking suit you. Limited edition cheese it white cheddar and house wine

533
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:04,640
rose will be available online for $29.99 at OriginalHouseWine.com beginning at 2 pm eastern

534
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,680
on July 23rd. Don't worry it's already sold out. Oh okay cool I was worried because I knew I would

535
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,440
have to look deep into my soul and and like decide if I was gonna buy it or not and I'm glad that they

536
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,360
have saved me that level of introspection. Well Travis great news I have found listings for a box

537
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,480
of house wine rose and a big box of cheese it's white cheddar and a listing for super glue.

538
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,120
So you can kind of just do your own thing and I would argue that mine has double cardboard

539
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,960
in there to protect from fluid cracker contamination. Yeah but Griffin if I do it myself

540
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,360
that's nothing. There's I'm on the website where you go to order it and um I just got really sad

541
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,400
for a second. Okay I missed it of course and they said our cheese it and house wine pairing boxes

542
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,400
are sold out but don't worry we wouldn't leave you hanging. Click below to learn more about

543
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,800
this collaboration and see our favorite house wine and cheese it cracker pairings so you can

544
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:11,040
recreate it at home. Oh no. And I just feel like the idea the fact that they they didn't think

545
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:18,960
that I could think of how to buy cheese it at home myself that I a human person would go to

546
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,440
the store and be like well they're in different aisles I mean the law's the law I can't I can't

547
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:32,160
recreate this at home. Help me help me brands fix this for me. It is also as if the the emperor

548
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:38,960
was the one who's like look at my new clothes and also I'm naked because like you've just said like

549
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:45,360
we didn't we just charged you money as Griffin put it to glue two things together you dummies

550
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,800
you could do this you didn't need us to do the magic was in you all along.

551
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:59,840
Uh I should point out that um the the regular box of wine from them cost $21.99.

552
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,800
This box this partnership when it was available cost $30 so you are also buying a $9 box of

553
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,400
cheese hits which is airplane. Uh they're white cheddar cheese hits so. Ah to be fair yeah that

554
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:21,920
is absolutely true Griffin absolutely true um my advice to these two companies make more of them

555
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,400
they keep selling out instantly if you like the money parts just go ahead and make more of them.

556
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,640
Some. A lot more. Some human being who already thought that they were pretty

557
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:41,360
eroded inside saw how quickly it sold out and thought should I have charged more for this?

558
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,560
I yeah I already thought I was kind of pushing it with that $30 price tag but could I have been

559
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:56,160
more of a dirtbag about this? I feel like I should have charged more. Yeah I already thought I was

560
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,880
you know charging a lot of money for cheese hits but people seem to really want to spend this

561
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:16,160
kind of money on cheese hits. Am I helping people? Wait a minute am I a hero? Um similar the the

562
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,600
press release continues undaunted similar to the many varieties of cheese hit our wines run the

563
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:27,680
full spectrum of flavor said Hal Landvoight winemaker for Housewine we've seen Rosé skyrocket

564
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,120
in popularity over the past few years apparently skyrockets so much that we've had to duct tape

565
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:39,280
into a box of cheese hits especially during the warm summer season for the second year of this

566
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,880
partnership we knew the pairing had to feature Rosé as the perfect complement to the real cheese

567
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:52,640
flavor in cheese it white cheddar. Okay. Um Housewine is the recipient of several Best Buy accolades

568
