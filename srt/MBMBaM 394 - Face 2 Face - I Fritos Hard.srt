1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Uh, hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:02,080
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,480
And I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:27,840
You know, folks, here we are. It's the end of a tour. The end of our four-day tour.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,920
And we are not as young as we once were. Time works. Yeah, and this tour has been

10
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,920
plagued with completely unavoidable injuries. Was anybody at the Minneapolis show last night?

11
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,360
I don't tell what happened, but I suffered a very brave injury.

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,240
On top of Griffin's unavoidable injury. Brave, heroic.

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,960
Griffin fell backwards in his chair. It's really the only injury you can sustain in our format.

14
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,320
We don't have a lot of pyrotechnics. It made the local newspaper headlines that said,

15
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,480
hero boy has good fall. Yeah, hero boy saved show with brat fall. I had the unavoidable injury of

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
one of the hosts of Hello from the Magic Tavern, Adol Raffaei.

17
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,960
You know how sometimes you unavoidably arm wrestle someone seven times?

18
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Because you unavoidably drink. Because you unavoidably drank bourbon.

19
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,880
And then you wake up and you're old and your shoulders and your arms hurt.

20
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,760
And then the next day, different parts of your body hurt. That's what old age is,

21
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:54,720
by the way, young people. I have sustained a 48-hour spectrum of injuries from arm wrestling,

22
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,880
some of which took 36 hours to develop. And I have a fever right now.

23
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:14,560
I had a fever so bad last night that I started trying to figure out who would be Justin tonight.

24
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
That's how bad this fever was. And I know, listen,

25
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,160
you're all listening to this right now and you're like, money back, please.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:28,240
And I get that. But no, no, there's no refunds. We need that body for like,

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,240
we need that money for operations, apparently to our old, old bodies.

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:40,080
Here's the thing. We woke up this morning real early and then we got on a train.

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Not just any train, the Empire Builder. The Empire Builder.

30
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,880
It's a line that goes from Chicago to Seattle. We took it just on the brief leg,

31
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:56,960
the two brief leg from Minneapolis to Milwaukee, which was only six hours.

32
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,920
And I don't think there's anything that six hours were at the end of it.

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,760
I think, oh man, I can't believe it's over. But that's the way I felt after this train today.

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,240
I couldn't believe that I had to get off the train.

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
It healed my back.

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah.

37
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,200
Yeah. It made me not have drunkenly arm wrestled Adil Rafai. It was amazing.

38
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,280
Justin still does have a fever.

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:29,760
Uh oh, but I'm feeling good now. I was feeling a little rough 45 seconds ago back there.

40
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,920
But then I came out and I got some me, I opened up a tall,

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,640
cool glass of Milwaukee energy and now you've fed it into me.

42
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,840
And I so appreciate that.

43
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,760
And just so you know, and I don't,

44
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't like to throw my power behind things lightly, but ride more trains.

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Yeah.

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
They're great. I want them to have a resurgence that I can take a train like to the grocery store.

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Even their announcements are like a hundred times better than airplane announcements.

48
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Can you have the, can we,

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,200
Hold on. I'll see if it'll work.

50
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,560
I don't know if we got permission from, there was a gentleman named Will.

51
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,040
Who kept doing announcements that were the best shit I'd ever heard in my entire life.

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,240
And I looked forward to them.

53
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,280
Cause he wasn't doing the usual like Southwest airlines, Austin powers impression.

54
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
All right, let's see if we can see me hear this.

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,520
Okay. I'll do my best.

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,360
Ice cold beer.

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,800
It is now being served in the cafe bar.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,840
So come on down, grab that sweet treat, that tasty snack, that cool beverage.

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,400
And don't forget that delicious cup of coffee always.

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,920
As well, I had, and you know what?

61
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,880
I didn't need those things, but you know, I had to get down there to see that guy

62
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,600
and he was as delightful as you would hope he would be.

63
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,560
It was amazing.

64
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,120
Thank you, Will.

65
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,080
Thank you, trains.

66
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,200
Thank you, choo choo train.

67
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,360
Should we do our thing where we do the questions?

68
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
So we got an advice show, as you've certainly guessed by now.

69
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,520
We're going to take an intermission.

70
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,600
So, I mean, not right now, but we will be taking intermission, intermission.

71
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
Like we're going to be taking several intermissions throughout the night.

72
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Justin will be asleep during the whole intermission.

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,320
Just straight up.

74
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,520
But when we got an eight minute diarrhea intermission, I'll let you know.

75
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,000
But when we come back, when we come back from intermission,

76
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
we're going to do audience questions.

77
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,160
So we want you to be thinking about those now, prepping and stealing yourself

78
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,080
for when you stand up and there's lights up and you're like,

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,400
oh shit, there's a lot of people here.

80
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
And you have to talk in front of them.

81
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,240
Please.

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,080
I have a coworker who immediately after crossing the doorway of the bathroom

83
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,160
starts unbuckling and unzipping his pants.

84
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,360
And as he walks to the urinal, he doesn't seem to have a medical condition

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
or even have to go with any urgency.

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,160
My question to you brothers is how close to the toilet do you need to be

87
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
in order to start getting ready?

88
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,640
It's a good who's that?

89
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,200
Who's that by?

90
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,720
No name.

91
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,440
Are you here?

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,240
Holy shit.

93
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,360
Are you nine feet tall?

94
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, I don't know if that came from the balcony or if they're nine feet tall.

95
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,600
It's a good question because if you think about it,

96
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
the if you're not close enough and Nina was the name,

97
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
I don't know why I didn't close enough in Nina.

98
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,080
OK, so the weird thing is, if you think about it, you if you start that

99
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
literally the second before you cross the threshold of the bathroom,

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,720
it's a crime.

101
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,320
And then you get across through the threshold

102
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
and it's not a crime anymore.

103
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,120
So what do we do?

104
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,640
What do we even do in here?

105
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,200
So I feel like from a legality perspective,

106
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,960
you're fine once you cross the threshold.

107
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,600
Holy shit.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,160
I've never thought about it before, but there I can't think of any other

109
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
one, maybe a bedroom, a room that's like it's OK if you do it in here.

110
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,680
It's not a crime.

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,880
Nude zone.

112
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah, like just that idea of like we have designated

113
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,120
that there's something in this paint that protects your nudity.

114
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,920
It's lead.

115
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,760
So so Jesus can't see you and Superman.

116
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,400
Jesus and Superman can't see what happens in the bathroom.

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
I would be I wouldn't I wouldn't do this,

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,480
not from a question of decency, but just of like.

119
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,440
Like my pants falling down.

120
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
I mean, that's funny once.

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,360
Yeah, or not if you get in the bathroom and you're just like,

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,240
well, like it's kind of you walk to the urinal with your pants around

123
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,920
your ankles like you're a toddler.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,640
That's what I'm saying.

125
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,160
It's maybe funny once.

126
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,840
Once if you're if you're that person and what they mentioned,

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,440
I don't think they have a medical condition.

128
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
What medical condition would necessitate?

129
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,840
I need constant breeze on my zone.

130
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,160
You know, the problem here is that we have lost something in the world

131
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,640
and specifically in this human decency.

132
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,880
No, but yes.

133
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,680
Bathroom attendance because it was their job.

134
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
What are they going to do?

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,440
It was their job.

136
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,800
No, you're suggesting it was a bathroom attendance job to let you know

137
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,640
and begin.

138
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Consummate your toilet.

139
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Yes, right this way, sir.

140
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,480
No, not yet.

141
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,280
I saw it.

142
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,160
Go right ahead.

143
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,200
When we dad and I flew in together and we

144
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
we and boy are his arms tired.

145
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,080
No, no, even I'm going to say no to that one.

146
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,880
No, we flew in through Atlanta and boy are his arms.

147
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,600
So our our airplane landed in Atlanta before leaving for another.

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,720
Third damn it stop and they had a bathroom attendant in there

149
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,160
and we were waiting in line.

150
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,640
You're going to I wish I had like a diagram,

151
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,120
but we were waiting in line for the toilet stalls

152
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,360
and there was a lot of urinals in front of us

153
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,680
and then there was a line of urinals to the right

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,200
that would have been out of sight for us

155
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,040
and there was a bathroom attendant standing right in front of dad and I

156
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,840
and he was going urinals and then pointed at the ones that were open to our right.

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,560
And then again urinals right here and then he said urinals right over here, fellas.

158
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,360
There's several urinals open right here.

159
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,960
Fellas urinals right here like five times

160
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,760
and eventually I have to look at this man dead in the eye and say, I'm going to poop.

161
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,360
Like I know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

162
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
Thank you. I'm going to you should have just walked over and pooped in the urinal.

163
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,040
You're the boss. When in Atlanta. You're the expert, I guess.

164
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,520
Yeah, it's your bathroom man. If you if you want to attend to that,

165
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,040
I guess that's your prerogative.

166
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,080
How about a Yahoo.

167
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,080
This Yahoo was actually sent in by a lot of people.

168
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,400
Thank you everybody who sent this one and it's by Yahoo Answers user Amber who asks,

169
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,400
What did Christian Grey say in the clean TV version of the movie Fifty Shades of Grey?

170
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,200
He said, I don't make love. I blank hard.

171
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,560
What word did he say there in the clean version of the movie suitable for TV?

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,520
I cannot but I cannot believe TBS would put in the elbow grip

173
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:08,240
required to get this cut going. Yeah, I get hard. I am. I am hard.

174
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,600
No. See, I don't think that would work either. I don't have. What is it? I don't make love.

175
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,160
I don't make love. I don't make love. I hump.

176
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,920
I don't make love. I hump. You don't understand what censorship is.

177
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,040
I feel like I don't make love. I love hard. I think you can. I don't know.

178
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,600
I love hard. I think you can. I think you can allude to having.

179
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,480
I think it's just like the F word that they're having a problem with.

180
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,400
Did I just? I think it's fuck.

181
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,320
Sorry, we're all grown ups here. Unlike TBS. It's going to be a ribald show.

182
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,280
Yeah. Um, I, I don't make love. I.

183
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,640
I. They edit it in a hand. That digital hand appears.

184
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,800
I don't make love. I, you know.

185
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,160
They use that digital hand so much during the movie.

186
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,760
So many times. It covers.

187
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,480
This is my secret room and here we're going to shh and do shh.

188
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,920
During the sex scenes, they edited in like eight of them just all angled at different.

189
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,200
That would be so good. Nobody wants to look at the black sensor bars anymore.

190
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
They just want to see like a guy up there just like,

191
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,720
and he's like watching as he keeps up with it. Like, Oh God, why are they moving so much?

192
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,680
I think they should just have digital parents fingers come in in front of the screen.

193
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,880
Just like four fingers cover what you say.

194
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,120
But digital guy who's blocking the whole screen would be great.

195
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,200
Cause he's watching and he's like, whoa, no way.

196
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Oh, your parents would be watching too. They wanted to watch an erotic film.

197
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,560
They're not going to miss out on some of the erotic scenes.

198
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
Yeah. It's there for that. No parent has put on an erotic film and be like,

199
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,880
Oh no, I keep saying erotic film. No parents put on an erotic film period.

200
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
You're all welcome to sleep well.

201
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
What if they just leaned into the censorship and it was like,

202
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,960
I don't make love. I study hard.

203
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,240
And you should do here's a pencil and a candle.

204
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
I pray hard. So extra hard and loud.

205
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,440
Sign my pray contract. This is 50 shades of pray.

206
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
Now they're missing a money-making opportunity.

207
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,120
I don't make love. I Fritos. What Christian?

208
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,680
You got my Fritos jeans. Put your Fritos on the floor.

209
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm going to spray Doritos all over your Pringles.

210
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,600
Are you ready to get flavor blasted? Are you ready to get flavor blasted?

211
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:08,800
And then you just feel like a bag of Doritos covering the sex scenes.

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,280
And a lot of movies with sex scenes that go on TBS or USA characters.

213
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,120
Welcome. What they do is they just zoom and like

214
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,040
tight crop on the non-sexual parts of the sex that's happening.

215
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,920
And I feel like for this movie, it would, it's just like a tiny frame.

216
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,360
Or just like a slow band like a photo frame background, just like his dog.

217
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
Just crops. If you cut all the sex scenes out of 50 Shades of Grey,

218
00:15:52,400 --> 00:16:02,000
it's basically a short film about a very rich businessman that does not go to work.

219
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,600
I haven't seen the second one. 50 Shades Harder. 50 Shades Harder.

220
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,440
50 Shades Danker. Is that the one?

221
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,400
And that one, he just goes to work the whole time.

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,920
We were talking about a question we were thinking about doing that we decided not to do.

223
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,800
But during the discussion of that, Travis introduced the phrase into the world,

224
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
50 Shades of Grey SMR, and we're not going to do anything with that.

225
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
It's just that I wanted to. Yeah, thank you very much.

226
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I'm so I was so proud of it. You know how like you hatch a baby bird

227
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,520
and then someone's like, I'm going to kill that.

228
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,680
You know, like, oh, I wish you would. I wish you would just stay.

229
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,680
That's how I felt. Stay in the world.

230
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
I wish you wouldn't kill my baby bird, but I get it. It's not funny.

231
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,040
I went to Penn Station before seeing Thor Ragnarok with one of my friends.

232
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,520
No spoilers. While at Penn Station,

233
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,240
my friend began to make sex sounds and faces while eating a sandwich.

234
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,280
This is a raunchy Randy affair. All the questions are sexually themed.

235
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,280
Sorry, we should have warned you ahead of time.

236
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,560
This is a very sexual. Because as we started to get sick

237
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:13,600
and beaten up, get horny. We're severely broken people.

238
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,200
I think I've got a fever. Yeah, you do.

239
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,960
When asked why he was doing this, he looked at me dead in the eyes and said,

240
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,200
it's just that good. He's a very enthusiastic person,

241
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,280
but this behavior takes that to a new level. Can I remain friends with him?

242
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,440
Should I just never go to Penn Station with him again?

243
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,520
Help me, brothers. Are you here?

244
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,040
Is your friend here? And if you are here,

245
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:44,240
please just a yes noise. Just a regular yes.

246
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
Would be fine? Okay.

247
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,160
Is it possible your friend had never had a sandwich before?

248
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,360
Because here's the thing. This is nothing against sandwich chains,

249
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,560
but to have a sandwich is like, my God. Yeah, it's not possible.

250
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,600
That's like legend. You can have a sandwich orgasm

251
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,000
and still be demure about it. Just like when Harry met Sally,

252
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
but you eat it and you're like, and then that's it.

253
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,680
I'm going to finish this sandwich. It's not all yelling and yelling.

254
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,480
That seemed to be more upsetting if she was trying to cloak it.

255
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:36,960
I'll actually have another table. If you could move me away from that woman,

256
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,040
that would be great. Do you remember off the top of your head,

257
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,800
which Penn Station offering it was, what sandwich it was your friend enjoyed?

258
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,040
The club sandwich? It wasn't even hot.

259
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,640
It wasn't even hot. It was a cold club sandwich.

260
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,200
There's not even like a good or bad with that. It's just the bread and the cheese and the meat.

261
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,040
When I lived in LA, if this is a story about a good sandwich you ate one time,

262
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
I'll walk off the stage. No, no, no, no, no.

263
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,200
It's when we lived in Culver City, there was university housing next to us.

264
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,480
And every Sunday for six months, we could hear someone make loud sex noises.

265
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,520
Yeah. And here's the thing, it was every Sunday from three to four.

266
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,560
And the thing was, there was no peak or valley to it.

267
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:41,520
It was three o'clock to three oh oh oh one for an hour.

268
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,520
And I bring this up because much like that,

269
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
your friend was trying to prove something about how much they were enjoying the sandwich.

270
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,920
Like, we get it. Or how loud an orgasm they can have.

271
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Both of which are kind of meaningless accomplishments, I feel like.

272
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,080
Did it continue throughout the day? Did he see Thor Ragnarok and like,

273
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,680
Oh, the fights! I love when Thor does this.

274
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,480
You get a free popcorn refill at such a great value!

275
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,400
Extra butter!

276
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,440
I've never sounded like that having sex ever.

277
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,040
Uh, how about a different...

278
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,240
What? What?

279
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,300
What?

280
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,760
I mean, I know what it is.

281
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,440
This just came in. This one just came in so hot.

282
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,960
I didn't even know I was going to do it.

283
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,560
So I found it on my iPad.

284
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
How did it get on your iPad?

285
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,800
It was on here and I forgot about it.

286
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,160
And then it popped up while I was looking for something else on a doll watch.

287
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,440
This is kind of a different one because usually we have a tapestry of a narrative.

288
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,080
And this is a much shorter kind of thing.

289
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,320
But I just wanted to highlight a user on eBay that posted a lot of haunted dolls.

290
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,760
They're regular Indiana Jones of haunted dolls with all of their discoveries.

291
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
Her name's Punkin' Leah.

292
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
One again?

293
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,680
Punkin' Leah.

294
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
And she does short stories.

295
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,240
Wait, the user is Punkin' Leah.

296
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,800
Punkin' Leah.

297
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,960
The doll doesn't write short stories.

298
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,460
No.

299
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Oh man, that would have been a good homework hack.

300
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,160
Here we go.

301
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,840
Here's the first one.

302
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
Haunted doll possessed by demonic entity.

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,320
This doll is so chilling.

304
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,680
She screams at random times.

305
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,800
Nights are favorable.

306
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,400
Has been caught turning her head on her own and my pets will even not go near.

307
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,880
End of listing.

308
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,280
Oh, that's it?

309
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,320
That's the listing.

310
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:55,920
New doll.

311
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
This doll scares the shit out of me.

312
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
It always moves on its own, which is terrifying.

313
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,080
And we've even heard laughs in the middle of the night.

314
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,280
I thought I could handle it.

315
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,720
This is the next level haunted.

316
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
I need it gone.

317
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,920
End of listing.

318
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Price to move.

319
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,480
I didn't even know.

320
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,040
Wait, how much?

321
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,440
How much?

322
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,080
Go back to that one.

323
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,580
How much?

324
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,760
$18.

325
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,800
I need it gone.

326
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,960
I didn't even know you could cuss on eBay.

327
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:24,800
New doll.

328
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
Don't let the sweet face fool you.

329
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,200
I've had many haunted items throughout the years,

330
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
but never one that completely moved in front of me

331
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,280
and bald daylight literally scared the shit out of me.

332
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,920
End of listing.

333
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,560
This sweet petite little thing is evil to the core.

334
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,560
I've woke up now numerous times with her in my bed.

335
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I have removed it from my house in hopes of preventing this from happening again.

336
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,760
I want her gone.

337
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,080
Any offer is considered.

338
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,560
$25.

339
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,960
Don't let the cute face fool you.

340
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
This possessed doll is terrifying.

341
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
She likes to disappear.

342
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
She don't like to stay where you put her.

343
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,120
And she even giggles at night.

344
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm ready for her to disappear forever.

345
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,400
She scares the hell out of me.

346
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,280
Please beware.

347
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,640
End of listing.

348
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,920
I do like that there's a sliding scale of this one scares the shit out of me.

349
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,160
This one just scares the hell out of me.

350
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,360
It's not as bad.

351
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,600
These are all from the same person and they were all posted within an hour of each other.

352
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,520
Hey, hey, Leah.

353
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
How are things at your house?

354
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,080
It seems like you've got kind of a wild house right now.

355
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
Hey, Leah, why not one bulk sale?

356
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,320
Listen, hey, do you want some scary as shit dolls at a low, low price?

357
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
Have I got a group deal for you?

358
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,800
I want all these bastards gone.

359
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,240
Here's my question.

360
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,640
Usually when you do a haunted doll watch, it's like,

361
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,360
they will watch over you when you sleep and they go,

362
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,320
healing power.

363
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,440
Who is scanning through eBay like,

364
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,520
where's the scariest part?

365
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,720
Where's the scariest fucking asshole I can buy?

366
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,200
I mean, they're all pretty scary to me, but.

367
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,720
I don't know.

368
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
It's scary at first, but then if you get one that's like,

369
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,400
I got you.

370
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,080
I have calming energies.

371
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
That would actually be right now.

372
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,520
Kind of nice.

373
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:11,760
All right.

374
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
Griffin, did you ever Yahoo?

375
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,920
I did.

376
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,440
And it is sent by level 9,000.

377
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,600
Yeah.

378
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
Drew Drew at Drew Davenport.

379
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,560
It's Yajuru answers user.

380
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,040
Sorry.

381
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,200
Sorry, something has gone wrong.

382
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,320
We're trying to reload the page and see if the data will appear on my laptop.

383
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,200
It has not appeared on the lap.

384
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,240
Cause I'm going to call this one.

385
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,160
Annabelle Randy.

386
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,120
Randibell asks.

387
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,960
If someone came up with the idea of a meat drink,

388
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
would you drink it?

389
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,880
It seems as if people will try anything these days.

390
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,080
What I want to order.

391
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,840
You did come up with the idea of a meat drink.

392
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,200
What if someone came up with, oh, wait, I just did.

393
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,920
Oh no.

394
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,600
I just came up with the idea of a meat drink.

395
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,400
We've made drink out of everything.

396
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:08,900
Yeah.

397
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,240
Vegetables.

398
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,740
Yes.

399
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,920
Fruits.

400
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,420
Yes.

401
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,520
Grains.

402
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,020
Yes.

403
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,520
Orbits.

404
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,020
Orbits.

405
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,520
Orbits.

406
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,020
Orbits.

407
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,520
Orbits.

408
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,020
Orbits.

409
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,020
Orbits.

410
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,520
Orbits.

411
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,720
The fifth element.

412
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,500
Zima.

413
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,000
Zima.

414
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,500
Zima.

415
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,400
The sixth element.

416
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,200
But now meat, you got to cloak it pretty good.

417
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,120
I think like V8 won't even, doesn't have the courage to put vegetable in it.

418
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
They're going to shorten it.

419
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,720
If they could just call that drink vegetables lots, no one would like it.

420
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,320
But you do have, they put an eight.

421
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,520
So it's a finite number.

422
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,680
Like, yes, there are vegetables and there's a limited number.

423
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,800
I'm drinking eight.

424
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,600
No veggies though, but so you got to hide the meat.

425
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,120
So what I think you should do is it should just say on the bottle Pepsi, but then in

426
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:00,480
really small letters below that it says meat and it doesn't have a lot of meat.

427
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,640
It could just be one little, when you start production, it could just be one tiny little

428
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,560
boba tea bubble of meat.

429
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,060
Yeah.

430
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,760
And you could be drinking your Pepsi unaware and just like,

431
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,840
Okay, a lot of you just went, oh, how often do you drink your Pepsi and think, I wonder what's in this.

432
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,080
So what I'm saying is you do that and then gradually over the weeks and months, you add

433
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,000
a little more meat into it and you make the font bigger on meat.

434
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,760
So eventually it just says meat.

435
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,240
And then at the bottom, like printed on the bottom, it says like a Pepsi Coke bottle.

436
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,880
And then at the bottom, like printed on the bottom, it says like a Pepsi Coke product.

437
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
And it's pretty much all meat at that point.

438
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,480
Just a big cylinder of meat in a drink.

439
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,680
This is great because I feel like the biggest roadblock of any new culinary idea is just

440
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,480
getting people over their hangups.

441
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,800
No?

442
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah, just do you have a solution for it or?

443
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,160
I don't know.

444
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:08,480
Maybe tell them they've been drinking meat all along and something else.

445
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Wouldn't be right.

446
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,280
I don't know meat, but like, what do you think is an orange juice?

447
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Oh shit, you're right.

448
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,280
Oh shit, you're right.

449
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I guess there's meat in it.

450
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,480
Orange juice is just like fruit meat.

451
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,680
I possess no critical thinking skills.

452
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,000
So yeah, I guess orange juice is meat.

453
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,960
You just got to get like a Kardashian and be like, I love meat drink.

454
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I love meat drink, by which I mean Sunny Delight.

455
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Paul's got my meat drink.

456
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
Hold on.

457
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,600
Thanks, Paul.

458
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,320
It's just coffee.

459
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,720
Hey, with booze, uh, broth, oops.

460
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Oh, man.

461
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Shit!

462
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
I just thought.

463
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Shit!

464
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
Damn it.

465
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
It is like a meat.

466
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Damn it.

467
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,600
You've been drinking it this whole time.

468
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,200
Well, hopefully you have not been drinking bra.

469
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,960
Hope we don't have an audience of octogenarians that have just been nursing broth this whole

470
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
time.

471
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,960
My God.

472
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,560
Damn it, it was right in front of us the whole time.

473
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Damn it, broth.

474
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,560
God damn.

475
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,600
I got, uh, another question.

476
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Okay.

477
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
All right.

478
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm an illustrator pursuing my art degree at an art school.

479
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,880
We get it.

480
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,080
In the area and noticed something troubling during my time at art school.

481
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,060
We have to take figure drawing classes, you know, where you draw naked people for hours

482
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,680
in basically the dark.

483
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,520
It's a great way to learn about the human body.

484
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,680
But whenever we have male models, many of my class rates, classmates refuse to draw

485
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,520
the Pippis.

486
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,760
How do you advise and encourage my fellow students to stop being cowards and draw that

487
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,640
dang dick already?

488
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,120
See, like we said, very sexual show.

489
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,800
Wait, wait, wait.

490
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
Are you here?

491
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Yeah.

492
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Very close.

493
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:04,440
When you say refuse, like refuse, is it like they just drove and someone loudly announces

494
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,280
I'm going to stop at the day and there's nothing you could say to, isn't this homework?

495
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,440
You can't, the dog ate the penis part of my drawing.

496
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:25,860
When you turn it in, does the teacher return it with like a circle and an X like, you came

497
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,280
so close.

498
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,640
Your art was wrong.

499
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,840
I am into this idea of just drawing all of it, including that nasty thing.

500
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:41,080
And then you just grab at the penis part of the art and you tear it away.

501
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,360
And then you could say like, got caught in the subway doors again.

502
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:56,520
If you were the person who was modeling for this and after the class you were like, I'm

503
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,200
going to go look at some of the art.

504
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,560
And then you looked at all the art and no one drew your dick.

505
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:12,240
You might have a second or two where you're like, why did I have to have my dick?

506
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,120
I mean, if you aren't going to, it's kind of a tree falls in the forest kind of thing

507
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
of like.

508
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,560
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody saw the tree stick.

509
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:28,360
If nobody, if you don't want to draw my dick, I don't want you to draw my dick, I'm fine.

510
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:36,220
If you're modeling and no one draws your dick, you pretty much just had your dick out basically.

511
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,120
Maybe like a nice bikini brief down there to make people feel more comfortable.

512
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
That's worse, I feel like.

513
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
It's worse, isn't it?

514
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:48,000
Here's what you do then, you have the model wears underpants.

515
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Maybe me on these.

516
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
And this is beautiful, beautiful by the way.

517
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Yeah.

518
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,400
This whole process is beautiful.

519
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,960
I don't want to stigmatize nude art drawings.

520
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Nude art is great.

521
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,520
They're wearing their underpants, right?

522
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,540
And then whoever wants to draw that can.

523
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,440
And then they leave and anyone who doesn't want to.

524
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,920
And then the real fun begins.

525
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,880
And then someone else comes in and they're wearing a bodysuit except for a cutout around

526
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,680
their penis.

527
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:18,800
And then anyone who wants to draw the penis can finish the drawing.

528
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:27,600
Alternatively, we take the art drawn by your coward classmates who are afraid of this beautiful-

529
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,320
Afraid of the human body.

530
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:38,680
And we just fill in the space by going online on literally any game that involves drawing

531
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:45,720
at all, any sort of universe, literally anything where anybody is allowed to draw anything

532
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
in an online environment.

533
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,080
And we take the ocean of dicks from those and we copy and paste.

534
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,960
What if you maybe sort of adjusted the pose of the life model so their pose was sort of

535
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
like, huh?

536
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
Undeniable.

537
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,680
Like pointing two fingers with the finger guns pointing at their penis.

538
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:10,760
Because then if you draw that and don't draw what they're pointing to, that is bad art.

539
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,520
We're about five minutes in, by the way, and that's the first time one of us said the word

540
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,520
penis.

541
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
Fair enough.

542
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,560
We're children.

543
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:24,400
I am right now picturing a television show.

544
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,120
Not how I thought that was going to-

545
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:33,560
No, maybe a YouTube series of somebody in like a green screen bodysuit except for a

546
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,360
cutout around the penis.

547
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,360
Oh, no, no, no, no.

548
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
No, I wouldn't watch that.

549
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,240
And then it's just the adventures of a penis hanging out in different places.

550
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah.

551
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
And listen, I know.

552
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
No, you don't.

553
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
I don't think-

554
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
But I'm a child and I think it's funny as shit.

555
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
All right.

556
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,720
But that place would have to be the bathroom or the bedroom, the two places that-

557
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,000
The two places you could shoot something like that.

558
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,680
Maybe come up with like, draw your art and then get like copies of your drawing in sticker

559
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
form.

560
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,560
And then you can just walk around and like add it to everyone's drawing and be like,

561
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
you're welcome.

562
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Collabo.

563
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Yeah.

564
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
You can borrow my penis that I drew.

565
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,040
I worked really hard on it.

566
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Maybe you should draw just the penis next time.

567
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,360
How about this, everyone?

568
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,360
We have another Yahoo.

569
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,120
I feel exhausted by the tone of the episode.

570
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,400
This one was also sent in by level 9,000 Yadru Dru.

571
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Dru Davenport, thank you, Dru.

572
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:39,160
It's from Yadru Answers user, Jonathan Santana, who asks, is it possible to build a toy with

573
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:50,800
fake muscles, skin, veins, bones, organs, et cetera?

574
00:33:50,800 --> 00:34:02,400
I want to have a toy Smurf with fake muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

575
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
You know.

576
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,280
Sorry, I read that wrong.

577
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,480
I want to have a toy Smurf with fake muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

578
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,640
You know.

579
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I don't.

580
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,880
So, where can I possibly order to get one and what would be an estimate on how much

581
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
it would cost?

582
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,160
Yes, I want it to be realistic, not fake looking.

583
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:29,320
This person wants to get into some Gargamel play, and I appreciate that, and I celebrate

584
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
them.

585
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,920
What does Gargamel play entail?

586
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,560
He asks, terrified.

587
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,040
It's just like, welcome to another Gargamel play video.

588
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,080
I'm going to squish some more of those delicious Smurfs with my sexy red boots, and then you

589
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,080
just squish them for money on a webcam.

590
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
But just Smurfs?

591
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,080
How did we turn this one?

592
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,080
Okay.

593
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
Okay.

594
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Hold on.

595
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:01,040
To that point, Griffin, if somebody says, I want a toy with muscles, skin, bones, and

596
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:10,360
organs, they're either going to crush it in a movie that they're making at home, like

597
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:17,680
autopsy it, that's worse, fuck it or eat it.

598
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,440
You just kind of slid that in there, I noticed.

599
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,880
I noticed you just kind of slid that in there.

600
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,000
No, I stand by it.

601
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:34,240
It's just, I'm so tired of talking about- I should make it clear, I know we're talking

602
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,000
about a lot of dirty stuff.

603
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,560
If y'all try to get up to those audience lengths and ask those dirty questions, I'll

604
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
disappear.

605
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:43,560
It's kind of an act one, act two thing, okay?

606
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
Oh, shit.

607
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,640
Do you think they want to make a fake crime scene and maybe they want to play Smurf Pro

608
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,640
and they want to have-

609
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
Somebody Smurf this guy.

610
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,640
Somebody Smurf this fucking dude.

611
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,640
His Smurf and Smurf guts are everywhere.

612
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
I'm going to Smurf.

613
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:03,640
Yahoo Answers user Drake Bijou answered, check in stores.

614
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,840
And that's the best answer.

615
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:13,000
Please, please, please, please go to your local Toys R Us or KB Toys.

616
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,920
Hey, I'm looking for a-

617
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,360
So let me know if you have this.

618
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,080
I know holidays are around, inventory limited, I get it.

619
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,720
And I should have been more proactive with this.

620
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm looking for a Smurf with real muscles, veins, skin, bones, organs, et cetera.

621
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
Real skin?

622
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Yes.

623
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,440
You heard me.

624
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
And I know-

625
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,720
The customer is always right.

626
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,880
I could just go on Amazon, but you know what?

627
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,720
I support local shops.

628
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Like Toys R Us.

629
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,200
Mom and pop shops.

630
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,640
Mom and pop Smurf body shops.

631
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
Buy your Smurf.

632
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
God bless.

633
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,680
Can you imagine if you went into a Toys R Us and said that to an employee, like, we don't

634
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,040
have it, but-

635
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
I know a guy.

636
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,320
I know a guy who can get the Smurf.

637
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,040
He's the grossest person ever.

638
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,600
That's kind of his thing is he's really gross, but he'll have what you need.

639
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,400
I really should have kept my head on a swivel with this question because I should have known

640
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,920
there's only really one use for a Smurf with real organs.

641
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,920
Yeah.

642
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,920
What's that?

643
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
I'm sorry, everybody.

644
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,920
What's that?

645
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
Perfect.

646
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,920
It's probably smudged in there.

647
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
Zach's already eaten.

648
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,080
I feel like I've disappointed myself.

649
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
That's all right.

650
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,400
Daddy, can I listen to your podcast?

651
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,400
No.

652
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,400
No.

653
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
Not this one.

654
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
No.

655
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
Daddy wishes he didn't listen to his podcast.

656
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,880
I don't see why the next generation should.

657
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,360
Hey, everybody.

658
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,360
This is Griffin.

659
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,440
Thank you so much for listening to our live episode from Jesus, like last November that

660
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,200
we recorded in Milwaukee.

661
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,680
I think at this point we've put up all of the shows from our Midwest tour.

662
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,440
We had such a great time, and thank you Midwestern territory for welcoming us with wide open

663
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,560
arms.

664
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:12,700
Sorry that we were turning the favor by turning in an inexplicably randy episode.

665
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,340
We're putting up a live show because Justin and Sydney just had a baby, and we are very

666
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,760
happy and very excited.

667
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,640
I'm going to be traveling this weekend to Huntington to go meet her, and yeah, we're

668
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,160
really excited, and so Justin's taking a little bit of time off.

669
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,360
We got this live episode for you, and we hope that you enjoy it.

670
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,500
I'm here right now to tell you about our advertisers this week.

671
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,080
Our first one is Squarespace.

672
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,240
Squarespace is great.

673
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,600
We used it to make McElroyShows.com, and I used it to make GriffinMcElroy.com.

674
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,800
It's super cool and easy to make a really good looking website.

675
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,240
You can turn your cool idea into a new website using Squarespace.

676
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,400
You can sell products and services of all kinds.

677
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,240
You can announce an upcoming event or a special project and more.

678
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,720

Hey, have you ever walked by a newsstand and seen a stunning magazine cover that makes

690
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,120

704
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,800
I also want to tell you all about Casper.

705
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
We are supported in part by Casper this week.

706
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,840
It's a sleep brand that continues to revolutionize its line of products to create an exceptionally

707
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,680
comfortable sleep experience one night at a time.

708
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,400
They offer affordable prices because Casper cuts out the middleman and sells directly

709
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,920
to the consumer.

710
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,160
We have a Casper mattress.

711
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,000
We all do, actually, that we all sleep on, and I got one in the guest room that I sleep

712
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
on, and it's so comfy.

713
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,960
I sleep on it only occasionally, and I've talked about my reasons for doing so, and

714
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm not going to get into it again, but they are gastrointestinal in nature, and I don't

715
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,480
think Casper loves it when I bring that up, but it's a very, very comfortable bed regardless

716
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,880
of why you sleep on it.

717
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,760
Casper brand mattresses combine multiple supportive memory foams for a quality sleep surface

718
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,280
with the right amount of sink and the right amount of ounce.

719
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,960
You can be sure of your purchase with Casper's 100-night risk-free sleep on it trial.

722
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,360
Terms and conditions, they do apply on that one.

723
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,720
Got a few Jumbotrons here.

724
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:43,480
This first one is to tell you all about Megan and RJ's quest to ruin classic literature

725
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,100
one book at a time on the podcast Oh No Lit Class, which is a very good name for a podcast.

726
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,800
You can listen to it at ohnolitclass.com or wherever you get your podcasts.

727
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,560
Oh No Lit Class is a comedy literature podcast hosted by two bitter English grads here to

728
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,640
tell you all the weird and sexy things you never knew about the books you had to read

729
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,640
in school.

730
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,920
They're a fun, foul-mouthed, rather they are, we're also pretty fun and foul-mouthed,

731
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,480
but they're a fun, foul-mouthed spark notes for your ears, mixing plot summaries, author

732
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,240
bios, and trivia with filthy jokes, bad impressions, and worse singing.

733
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,920
Learn what book was written as a petty act of spite, how the author of The Scarlet Letter

734
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,360
got stuck shoveling poop, huh?

735
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,720
And why Dracula absolutely deserves to be kink-shamed.

736
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,080
I don't know if I agree with that.

737
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,080
I don't own that.

738
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,440
Sometimes we just read the things that people write in the letters, although I do want to

739
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,440
know more.

740
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,920
Okay, anyway, that's Oh No Lit Class, ohnolitclass.com or wherever you get your podcasts.

741
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,280
I have a message here for Chelsea, and it's from Rob the Best, and Rob wrote that, so

742
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,240
keep that in mind as I read this message.

743
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,360
Hey Chelsea, you are such a great friend.

744
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,700
It is such a blast playing board games, world building, and spending hours theory crafting

745
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,440
Dark Souls lore together.

746
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,560
That's absolutely my jam.

747
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,720
Previously you paid the brothers to say that I was the best, and now I am paying them to

748
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,880
officially make you the coolest.

749
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,080
Seriously brothers, she is the coolest.

750
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,400
Here's to more Gundyr goofs.

751
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,280
There's nothing funny about Champion Gundyr.

752
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,560
You know, they've been through a lot, and they're a real pain in the ass for a boss.

753
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,720
Boy, I hope everybody listening to this is playing Dark Souls 3.

754
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,600
Anyway, congratulations Chelsea.

755
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,300
You are now officially the coolest.

756
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,300
Got another message here.

757
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,360
This one's for Bill, and it's from Gretchen and Casey, who say, Bill!

758
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,400
We're so excited that you're moving to Portland.

759
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,640
We're really looking forward to spending more, I don't know why I made that sound sarcastic.

760
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,160
We're really looking forward to spending more time with you in old ways.

761
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,800
Metal Gear?

762
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,280
Metal Gear?

763
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,920
And new, McElroy show listening parties?

764
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,920
Combine those two.

765
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,840
Ain't no, ain't no law against that.

766
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:54,200
May Mansionland West continue to grow in numbers and radness.

767
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,880
Love, Casey, and Gretchen.

768
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,000
Congratulations, Metal Gear?

769
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,320
Metal Gear?

770
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Metal Gear?

771
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,560
Hey, thanks for listening to the show, and thank you for tweeting about the show.

772
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,320
And thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

773
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,160
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

774
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
Thanks for the Maximum Fun Network.

775
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,080
Well, thanks to them, but thanks for them, God and Jesus.

776
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,340
So many great shows on the network.

777
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:22,600
Just go to MaximumFun.org, and you're just gonna love what you hear.

778
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm gonna hop off here now.

779
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,360
I think we'll probably have a new episode next, I mean, we'll have an episode next week,

780
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,760
but I think Justin will be back and ready to record.

781
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,240
So we will be around to knock out a new episode for you.

782
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,200
And I hope you'll stay tuned for that one.

783
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,200
So I'll talk to you next week, and goodbye.

784
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,760
Hey, this is Griffin McElroy.

785
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,280
Hi, this is Rachel McElroy.

786
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,720
And we've got a new podcast on Maximum Fun called Wonderful.

787
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Wonderful.

788
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,480
It's an enthusiast podcast where we talk about things that we're excited about and things

789
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,760
that you're excited about.

790
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,320
Things like overalls.

791
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,480
24-hour Sudafed.

792
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,840
The grand prize game.

793
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,400
The fact that wombats use their butts to kill predators.

794
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,380
The soundtrack to the movie Dick Tracy.

795
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,760
The beach potion we call Bud Lightline.

796
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,040
All these things and more every Wednesday, and we'll also talk about things that you're

797
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
excited about.

798
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,400
You can find us on MaximumFun.org or iTunes or wherever.

799
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,800
I don't know, just search Wonderful.

800
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
Google it.

801
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
You'll probably get there.

802
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,480
Travis is exhausted right now and probably will be for the remainder of the show.

803
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,280
You know how you're like, oh, when I go to a rock show and it takes them forever to come

804
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,120
on stage, they're probably like partying.

805
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:34,040
No, I had to use the bathroom, but it was upstairs, and we pressed for the elevator

806
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,120
and it was taking a while and I thought, I'll just run up eight stairs.

807
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:43,980
Eight flights of stairs, not eight huge one-story high stairs.

808
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,120
And I made it four floors.

809
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:50,840
And we had already called the elevator, so the elevator came down and we were like, don't

810
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
worry about it.

811
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
He's running up the stairs.

812
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,200
So they're like, okay, fine, and then he ran back down.

813
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,720
And I came slow, ran, thank you so much for that.

814
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,440
I hobbled back down the stairs.

815
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,720
I was like, what was I thinking?

816
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,340
And then we had to call the elevator again.

817
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,600
And when we say call the elevator, there's a literal person who's running.

818
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,600
There's Maya.

819
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,600
And they know our shame.

820
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Yes.

821
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Maya's running.

822
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,920
So we're going to start doing some auditions.

823
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
Okay.

824
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,440
All right.

825
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:46,840
We're going to turn this, we're going to turn things over to, oh my gosh, it's never happened.

826
00:46:46,840 --> 00:47:03,760
Hey everybody, welcome to Munch Squad.

827
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,320
It's a podcast inside a podcast.

828
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,600
What a delight.

829
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:12,720
Now, Griffin, why did you IP theft our brother?

830
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,720
I IP thefted our brother because in the two hours preceding the show, Justin was unconscious

831
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,040
for an hour and a half of it.

832
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:25,480
And I thought I would sort of help you out with a Munch Squad.

833
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:31,480
There's one pair of footprints tracked through an Arby's is where you carried me.

834
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,960
Here where you stepped on all the roast beef.

835
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,860
That was because there are horny people on the internet and my child.

836
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,860
We can't say the word.

837
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:46,240
All right, banned words for the half two of the show, horny, boner, any variation of pep

838
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,640
is peep is beeper.

839
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,360
Beeper is even off limits.

840
00:47:52,360 --> 00:48:00,040
So Taco Bell's done something returning Munch Squad favorite Taco Bell.

841
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:09,280
Well this is a, they're sort of, they're broadening the horizons of what Munch Squad can be.

842
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:19,440
It's a collabo project with food favorite Forever 21.

843
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,560
Press release, Taco Bell and Forever 21 are making wardrobes a whole lot saucier this

844
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,560
fall.

845
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Oh no.

846
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,560
Excellent.

847
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,560
Excellent.

848
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,760
Taco Bell and Forever 21 will come together this October, this is an older one, this October

849
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,160
to celebrate personal style and self-expression ahead of the launch of Taco Bell's first fashion

850
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,600
collection collaboration.

851
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,280
These two like-minded brands.

852
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,280
What?

853
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,280
Accurate.

854
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,280
Accurate.

855
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:50,280
Together.

856
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Together.

857
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,840
We both want to sell stuff.

858
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:01,480
Together at the intersection of culture and innovation.

859
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
Our joining.

860
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,680
Welcome to our Ted Talk.

861
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,000
Our joining forces to make fall wardrobes a whole lot saucier.

862
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,520
While they're at it, they'll help fans keep the heat up and the fun on in more ways than

863
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,320
one.

864
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:22,640
Unless these clothes are lined with hot sauce, there is only the one way that clothes keep

865
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,400
you warm.

866
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:33,840
By capturing the content that personifies, quote, forever Taco Bell, you literally just

867
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:40,200
described college.

868
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,920
The essence of the preview event, fans can actively take part in the ultimate fashion

869
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,320
afterparty.

870
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:53,600
Here's some quotes from Marissa Thalberg, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell Corp,

871
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,960
who has almost certainly been on the show before.

872
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,960
Certainly.

873
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,880
We often think of Taco Bell as the fast fashion of food.

874
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,360
What?

875
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,160
What could that possibly mean?

876
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,800
You don't even think of Taco Bell as the fast food of food.

877
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,760
We often think of Taco Bell as the fast fashion of food, given how we continuously introduce

878
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:21,040
innovative, limited edition products that everyone can enjoy.

879
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,000
So when it came to- Assuming they don't have IBS.

880
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Yeah.

881
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,160
So when it came time for our first ever retail collaboration, we knew our partner had to

882
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,960
be the leader in actual fast fashion.

883
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,960
Is that something?

884
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,240
Is that something?

885
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,000
We've seen our fans get individually creative in expressing their love for Taco Bell through

886
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
fashion.

887
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,120
No, you haven't.

888
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:49,960
You've seen sweatpants and more sweatpants.

889
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,560
And we believe this collection with Forever 21 is going to be everything they could expect

890
00:50:53,560 --> 00:51:00,640
from us in extending the Taco Bell lifestyle, sad, to fashion, original, affordable, creative,

891
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,120
a little quirky, and definitely fun.

892
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,120
So fun.

893
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,600
Can I jump back a little bit?

894
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:11,920
I love that they say, we often think of Taco Bell as something like, okay, you can think

895
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,280
about your own thing in whatever way you want, unless you can say other people think about

896
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
it.

897
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,280
It ain't true.

898
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:24,080
I'm going to read this next quote from Linda Chang, Forever 21 Vice President of Merchandising,

899
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:29,800
who says in her first sentence, we are excited about this partnership with Taco Bell.

900
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,800
This is what you got in the fashion industry, right Linda?

901
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,640
It's maybe a bit of a one-sided relationship.

902
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,520
Forever 21, hell yeah, fast food fashion.

903
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,720
That's nothing, but we're here for it.

904
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:43,720
Yeah, it's fine.

905
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,080
Like I said, we're just trying to beat Amazon.

906
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,880
Food like fashion is driven by trends and culture, I guess.

907
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,000
Merging fashion and food in this collection gives our customers a new way to experience

908
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,440
both our brands.

909
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,520
When was the last time food was driven by trends?

910
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,080
The only time that food, Taco Bell, and fashion have combined is when you get meat on your

911
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,640
pants from your Taco Bell accident.

912
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,580
That said, I am excited to hear there's a way I can experience the Taco Bell brand without

913
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,000
ingesting it.

914
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,840
I'm excited I'm going to do that other avenue.

915
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,320
Because you want to support them, but God, not through my mouth.

916
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,880
Yeah, this is the one human body I have.

917
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,520
I assume that their combination of sauce and clothing is sauce on clothing.

918
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,880
No, it's clothing that looks like sauce.

919
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,880
It's very fun and very Spencer's Gifts.

920
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Why not Spencer's Gifts?

921
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,680
Look in the deep dark truth of Merit Taco Bell.

922
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,320
All right, so we want to get to audience questions now?

923
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
Audience questions.

924
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
What?

925
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
I want to munch.

926
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,320
I want to munch.

927
00:52:50,320 --> 00:53:10,320
You know I was going to take care of you, Milwaukee.

928
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,320
Infermed or no, you will munch.

929
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,320
We will munch together.

930
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,560
This comes to us direct from Miami, is the date line on this particular release.

931
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:31,800
Burger King restaurants uniquely use fire to flame grill the Whopper sandwich.

932
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:38,520
Also known as America's favorite burger register mark.

933
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:43,800
Getting fired might not be fun, but at Burger King restaurants, getting fired like the

934
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:47,320
flame grill Whopper sandwich is always a good thing.

935
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,360
We're going to burn you so bad with our hot grills.

936
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,640
We're going someplace with this.

937
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:01,360
This is why Burger King restaurants will give a free Whopper sandwich to anyone who's been

938
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,960
fired.

939
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,200
But there's a hook.

940
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,920
You must publicly confess to getting canned on LinkedIn.

941
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:15,920
That's right.

942
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:16,920
What?

943
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:17,920
Own your fire.

944
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
No.

945
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,920
It says that.

946
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,920
Own your fire?

947
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,200
Own your fire, peasant.

948
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,040
Do you want a free burger?

949
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,040
Enjoy your free burger.

950
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,040
Ruin your career.

951
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
Unemployed person.

952
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,040
For $1.99.

953
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,300
So here's what you do.

954
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:43,020
With your life, the one that you have, you remember you have the one life, right?

955
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,000
With your life, you go to LinkedIn and post the following public message admitting you

956
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
got fired.

957
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
No.

958
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
There's specific wording.

959
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Quote.

960
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,160
Imagine seeing this out of context like, okay, three years in PR at Triple Point, and then

961
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,760
right below that it says, I got fired.

962
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,320
I want a free Whopper.

963
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,680
Hashtag Whopper severance.

964
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:16,080
Wow, I can't believe the founder of Google is applying for a job here.

965
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,080
Seems overqualified.

966
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,760
Let's check that LinkedIn.

967
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,400
Absolutely not.

968
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Absolutely not.

969
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,440
Before Google, they begged for a burger.

970
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,920
If you post that, you're going to receive a personalized link to get registered and

971
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,960
receive a Whopper severance package in the mail, which comes with a...

972
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,600
So here's the fucking thing, gang.

973
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,320
You lose your job and you got some time on your hands, and what you're going to do is

974
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,640
post about getting fired on LinkedIn because you want a free hamburger, and then Burger

975
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:51,620
King sends you a link to register for a thing where eventually they'll mail you a card for

976
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:57,600
a free hamburger that you will get the mail and be like, what the fuck is this?

977
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,560
I've been gainfully employed for three years.

978
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,000
Smash cut.

979
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,360
Door open slowly onto suburban home.

980
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,160
It has been said.

981
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,760
Let Travis finish his smash cut.

982
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,760
Smash cut.

983
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:12,760
Honey, how was work?

984
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,000
Well, I've got bad news and I've got good news.

985
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,440
Bad news is I got fired.

986
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,440
We've lost everything.

987
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:29,720
We've lost our benefits and you know how we just bought the house.

988
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,120
But good news.

989
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:36,000
I've got dinner covered in six months.

990
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,480
For one of us.

991
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,680
For me, not our three triplets.

992
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:41,680
It has been said.

993
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,560
It's a very sad story.

994
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,620
It has been said that when one door closes, another one opens.

995
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:53,960
This promotion is here by the providence of God.

996
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,240
That's my favorite end of It's a Wonderful Life.

997
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,960
You've lost everything, George, but I brought you this coupon.

998
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,680
In this case, it's a door to a delicious flame grilled whopper sandwich.

999
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:09,680
That's cool.

1000
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,720
It's a tiny door.

1001
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:13,480
It's a little door to a whopper sandwich.

1002
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,480
So anyway, that's the thing.

1003
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:16,720
Travis, do you have a munch squad?

1004
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,880
Well, I wrote a sad lib.

1005
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,880
No, he didn't.

1006
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,880
He did.

1007
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
He did.

1008
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,880
He did not.

1009
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,880
I did not.

1010
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
I did not.

1011
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,000
Because even I don't enjoy them anymore.

1012
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Okay.

1013
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Justin, I want to put out a formal apology.

1014
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm sorry.

1015
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I stepped to the throne.

1016
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I should have known.

1017
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1018
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's all good.

1019
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
All right.

1020
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Let's get lower lights on us and all the lights on them.

1021
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
All the lights that you have.

1022
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Because it's our show.

1023
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh my God.

1024
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Whoa.

1025
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,840
So we're going to ask your name and your question and then we're going to ask your name and

1026
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
your question.

1027
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,360
The only thing we can decide, we can do the most help on, we'll dig a little bit deeper

1028
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,560
into that one.

1029
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:55,400
It doesn't mean you lost if you don't get picked.

1030
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,400
It actually in many ways means you won.

1031
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
Yeah.

1032
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:01,560
You get to sit down, which is always a win.

1033
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,560
What is your name?

1034
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,560
Anna.

1035
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,560
Hi, Anna.

1036
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,560
What is your question?

1037
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:08,520
So when I first started dating my partner, he did this goof and I didn't listen to your

1038
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,360
podcast and I was really confused why he knew so much about farm life.

1039
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,580
Then during a recent Rose better best episode, I realized that farm wisdom wasn't an original

1040
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:24,400
goof of his, which did, he is here, but he does want me to say that he never actually

1041
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,760
claimed it was his own goof.

1042
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:31,240
He was just really cute and I didn't want to like ruin what we had going on and we're

1043
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:55,240
married now and I want to know what we should name our dog, and your name and question.

1044
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,240
My name is Lane.

1045
00:58:56,240 --> 00:59:03,040
I'm not sure I can top that, but just talk about some shit for a while and then twist

1046
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,360
it at the very end.

1047
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,440
Lane just speak from the heart.

1048
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:09,160
It's not a competition.

1049
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:16,240
I work in a tea shop and we have free samples, a lot of free samples right at the front and

1050
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,200
I'm not always right there to like hand them out to people.

1051
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:24,760
So when people come up and try it, I try and casually walk towards them and tell them about

1052
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,320
what we have there and they run.

1053
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,320
Okay.

1054
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:34,440
They just like once, one out of every a hundred will stay, but most of them just like bolts

1055
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,440
like, Oh, just try it by.

1056
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,440
Yeah.

1057
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,040
Just came in to score some free tea and then how do I, how do I get people to stick around

1058
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,040
for your ear?

1059
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:48,180
Now listen, I think yours was very funny.

1060
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,040
One word answer, name it goat.

1061
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,200
A dog named goat is a very good name.

1062
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,280
It's a good name for a dog.

1063
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I hope that helps.

1064
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:57,280
Anyway.

1065
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,280
Is it a good name for a dog?

1066
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,040
It's a great name for a dog.

1067
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,320
Goat is a fucking kick ass name for a dog.

1068
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,880
This is my dog, goat.

1069
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,840
And then when people ask you why you say it stands for greatest of all time.

1070
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,360
Can you, can you wait, wait, wait, go back to the mic.

1071
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,360
I'm not done.

1072
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:21,080
This is, can you name it something like, and I apologize, but bear with me like dookie

1073
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:30,720
butt and, and, and your house is going to have to burn down a little bit, but that's

1074
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,360
less great, but dog saves you.

1075
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,680
Newspaper has to write it up and that's awesome.

1076
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,040
It's going to be in the headline.

1077
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,160
Okay.

1078
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:48,280
So when you go to the people, do you sneak up behind them like a tea vampire and whisper

1079
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,680
in their ear, like, do you like what you're tasting?

1080
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,720
Like Vlad the Infuser.

1081
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:01,040
Are you, are you, don't, you only encourage him.

1082
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,840
It was a good one.

1083
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:09,120
Some, you're detecting some nice tannins, that one's got real good tannins.

1084
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,120
What are you buying?

1085
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,120
What are you brewing?

1086
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:16,320
Got a lot of good teas on sale stranger.

1087
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:23,320
When you, when you walk towards them, are you carrying like eight cups of tea?

1088
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,320
Like slosh, slosh, slosh.

1089
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,320
Come here.

1090
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
Oh no, wait.

1091
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,320
This is a good question.

1092
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,920
Are you walking towards them or are you running towards them?

1093
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,920
Usually walking.

1094
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,000
Are you ever holding two knives?

1095
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,240
To be fair, I think one knife would do it.

1096
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,240
One knife would do it.

1097
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
All right.

1098
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:47,520
So I'm, I'm thinking about if I, if I walk into this store and tea is like one of those

1099
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:54,320
things where you want to feel like you get it, but unless you are like a student of it,

1100
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,480
you probably also understand that you have no fucking idea what you're talking.

1101
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,480
Like I enjoy tea.

1102
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,200
I don't know fucking anything about tea.

1103
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,320
So if I see somebody coming over to me and be like, let me explain to you about tea.

1104
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:11,240
I will be like, I can't, I got to go, but, but if you walk over and you say, Ooh, I see

1105
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:15,440
you've chosen the best tea in the store.

1106
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,920
All of a sudden I'm like, Hey, I am a tea genius.

1107
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:22,520
Oh, can I take it one step further?

1108
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:23,520
Yeah.

1109
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,800
You have to wait outside.

1110
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,160
You can't come from the back.

1111
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,720
You have to come in from the outside and then like, like you are also a customer.

1112
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:35,500
Be so impressed at this other customer in the wild because nothing would make me feel

1113
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:42,600
better than someone who has no ulterior motive telling me I picked a good tea.

1114
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,560
The problem is that you're sneaking up from behind them.

1115
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,240
So the, what I'm going to need you to do is to hide behind the counter.

1116
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:56,800
And then as they're getting the tea, I want you to just slowly sort of etch up.

1117
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:01,040
You've always been having tea, Mr. Torrance.

1118
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,040
Did that help?

1119
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,040
Yes, actually.

1120
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,040
Oh, fantastic.

1121
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:10,040
I'm realizing, I'm realizing right now that maybe our second person didn't make it down.

1122
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,040
Hey, what's up?

1123
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,040
What's your name?

1124
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,040
Uh, Red.

1125
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,040
Red.

1126
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,040
Hi Red.

1127
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,040
What is your question?

1128
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:18,320
Red hates Linguini or loves it.

1129
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,520
My partner in crime is obsessed with the movie Ratatouille.

1130
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,520
Okay.

1131
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:23,520
Hell yes.

1132
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,800
And will not stop talking about the movie Ratatouille.

1133
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:30,340
And I'm starting to believe that she likes Ratatouille more than me.

1134
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:34,440
How can I get her attention back from the dirty rat people?

1135
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:43,040
That is the most fuckwild thing to be jealous of, I feel like.

1136
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,040
All right.

1137
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,480
And your question, your name and question.

1138
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:48,480
I'm Adrian.

1139
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,480
Hi Adrian.

1140
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,800
And this has been something that's been plaguing me for about two years now.

1141
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:58,640
About two years ago, I realized on my iPhone, there was a downloaded version of Who Let

1142
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:04,600
the Dogs Out, but it was a karaoke version.

1143
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,480
I didn't download it and my only, the only other person who shares my iTunes account,

1144
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,240
my mom also has no idea how the hell it got there.

1145
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,240
She says.

1146
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:13,240
Yeah.

1147
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:20,800
She doesn't know the password still, so I know it wasn't, um, and caveat, I can't get

1148
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:21,800
it off my iPhone.

1149
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:22,800
Wait.

1150
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,400
I've, I've now transferred it to two different iPhones throughout the two years and it won't

1151
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,400
go away.

1152
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:30,400
Delete it.

1153
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,400
No.

1154
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,400
I've deleted it.

1155
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,400
It won't.

1156
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:34,400
It's the mask.

1157
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,400
All right.

1158
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Okay.

1159
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,840
Wait, wait, wait, because I don't know which one we're going to do, but I do want to say

1160
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,840
this.

1161
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
Have you taken it to like a genius bar?

1162
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
I'm like.

1163
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,840
No, no.

1164
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
Stop.

1165
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
You've killed it.

1166
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,560
Uh, I think.

1167
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,880
I do have the audio evidence if you need to hear it as well.

1168
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,600
Oh yeah.

1169
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:00,520
I mean, obviously, uh, I feel like ratatouille is not going to hurt you.

1170
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,640
You need to get on board with ratatouille, share the love with, share the love with your

1171
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:04,640
partner.

1172
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,200
It's a wonderful cartoon mouse and all it wants to do is cook and a kitchen and make

1173
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,200
a kitchen.

1174
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,200
And the music is amazing.

1175
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
Music's amazing.

1176
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,720
And it's a beautiful film about the triumph of the rat spirit, the voice acting, the

1177
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:16,720
animation.

1178
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:17,720
It's a wonderful film.

1179
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:18,720
Everything's great about it.

1180
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,720
You have nothing to be afraid of.

1181
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,520
Unless, no, there's no unless you're super good.

1182
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,520
I promise.

1183
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:26,520
All right.

1184
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,520
Thank you.

1185
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:28,520
Thank you.

1186
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:29,520
Right.

1187
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,520
Here it is.

1188
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,520
Yes, please.

1189
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
Bump that shit.

1190
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,520
Full volume.

1191
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
That just sounds like the song.

1192
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Everyone be quiet.

1193
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,520
Be quiet.

1194
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:52,040
Now we're just listening to who let the dogs out.

1195
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,040
It sounds like that.

1196
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:54,040
It's actually us.

1197
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,040
It's actually me and Travis doing it.

1198
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,040
Someone shouted.

1199
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:57,040
Who let the dogs out?

1200
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:58,040
Who?

1201
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Who?

1202
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,040
Who?

1203
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,040
Who?

1204
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:02,040
Who?

1205
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,040
Who?

1206
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,040
Who?

1207
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:05,040
Who?

1208
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,040
Who?

1209
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,040
Who?

1210
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,040
Who?

1211
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,040
Who?

1212
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,040
Okay.

1213
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,040
Okay.

1214
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,040
It's a fucking fun tune, though.

1215
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,040
Listen.

1216
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
All right.

1217
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,040
Listen.

1218
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,040
Can I?

1219
01:06:16,040 --> 01:06:17,040
No.

1220
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:18,040
I'm sorry, Griffin.

1221
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,040
I'm sorry.

1222
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,040
We can all shit on who let the dogs out.

1223
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,400
But we all love it.

1224
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,840
You have got on your phone basically a party starter.

1225
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:31,560
Any awkward situation that you're in, if you just slowly start turning up the volume and

1226
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:36,080
people are like, is that the fucking Baja men?

1227
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,320
I have to ask a question.

1228
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,400
If you don't want to answer it, it's fine.

1229
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,280
But do you like to party?

1230
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,280
Do you like to party?

1231
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,280
Hard.

1232
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,280
Okay.

1233
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:53,680
Then you said that the two people who have access to your iTunes account is your mom

1234
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,080
and you, Adrian.

1235
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,760
And there's a third person that has access to it, and it might be drunk Adrian because

1236
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:14,000
Adrian not only downloaded it, she flipped a special switch that she knows about can

1237
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
never delete.

1238
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:20,320
Do not let sober Adrian delete permanent passcode.

1239
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,120
I mean, you know the culprit now, but there is it's beyond.

1240
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,760
She's a way better hacker.

1241
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,620
There's just nothing you can do about it.

1242
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:27,620
Does that help?

1243
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:28,620
Yeah.

1244
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:29,620
Great.

1245
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,620
Fantastic.

1246
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:31,620
Thank you very much.

1247
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:32,620
Okay.

1248
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,620
One last question.

1249
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,620
No.

1250
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:35,620
We've already got you picked.

1251
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,620
Yes.

1252
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,620
You've got it.

1253
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,620
Hello.

1254
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:39,620
My name is Morgan.

1255
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,620
Hi, Morgan.

1256
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,960
What is your question, Morgan?

1257
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:50,020
So back in June, my sister went on her honeymoon with her now husband to Las Vegas.

1258
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:54,880
She comes back and she hands me a key chain with my name on it and a picture frame from

1259
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,480
Las Vegas of like all the cool shit and a picture of her and her husband.

1260
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,200
And I told her like, oh man, thanks.

1261
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,200
This is great.

1262
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:12,320
But I'm kind of feel bad because I'm actually lying to her, so how can I, how can I layer

1263
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:17,400
down easy that this was actually the worst gift I've ever received?

1264
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,400
Okay.

1265
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:19,400
That's savage, Morgan.

1266
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:23,320
Morgan, it sounds like you maybe don't even want an advice.

1267
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:28,520
You just wanted the most public way to drag your sister.

1268
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,520
I'm sorry.

1269
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,520
We've been missing.

1270
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,520
Jorgen.

1271
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,520
I have no idea what this is.

1272
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,520
Great.

1273
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,520
Now you've dragged us.

1274
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:39,000
We're getting more and more popular by the day.

1275
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Okay.

1276
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Thank you.

1277
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And what is your name?

1278
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
My name is Eli.

1279
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Hi, Eli.

1280
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,000
What is your question?

1281
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
So I'm transgender.

1282
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,120
I identify as a trans man and I've only been using the men's.

1283
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,120
Thank you.

1284
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:51,120
All right.

1285
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:58,440
And I've only been using the men's room for about three years and the only thing I know

1286
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,320
about using the men's room is that we're supposed to make a like super aggressive,

1287
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:03,320
no eye contact.

1288
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:04,320
Yeah.

1289
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,320
Yeah.

1290
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:06,320
Yeah.

1291
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,320
I like the way you phrase.

1292
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:20,800
I was like, and so I'm just wondering if there's anything else that I don't know I'm supposed

1293
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:30,320
to be doing in the men's room.

1294
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:31,320
Morgan, thank you so much.

1295
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,400
Morgan, I think just only buy your sister airport gifts because I think that's the level

1296
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,400
you all are on right now.

1297
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:40,880
Also, put it away until your sister and her husband come over.

1298
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:41,880
That's how adults do it.

1299
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,360
How do you display a key chain?

1300
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,360
Okay.

1301
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:46,360
Good point.

1302
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,360
Does that?

1303
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,360
Thank you, Morgan.

1304
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,360
Thank you.

1305
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,240
Thank you.

1306
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:55,360
Some things you need to do in the bathroom, run water and make it sound like you're washing

1307
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,360
your hands.

1308
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:07,400
Jesus.

1309
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,680
One thing I like to do is not wash my hands and then as I'm leaving, say, I never touched

1310
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,680
it.

1311
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:17,640
He literally did this because I did this today at dinner.

1312
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,640
He said, I didn't touch it and left.

1313
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,440
I didn't touch it.

1314
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:22,440
Why should I wash my hands?

1315
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,440
I didn't touch it.

1316
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,440
It was really cool.

1317
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,080
Oh, this works a lot.

1318
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:34,800
Wash your hands, look up in the mirror and just go, and then walk out the door.

1319
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,920
That will always play because even if you're a complete stranger to the person next to

1320
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,480
you, they'll just think, yeah.

1321
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:50,200
One of the big good ones that they never tell you about in any of the books is you should

1322
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,560
try to start unbuttoning your pants as you walk through the door.

1323
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:01,360
So that way you're getting ready.

1324
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,360
Did we help?

1325
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,360
Does that help?

1326
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,360
Definitely.

1327
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,360
Yes.

1328
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:06,360
Thank you, Eli.

1329
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,360
All right.

1330
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,360
That is going to do it for us, folks.

1331
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,360
Thank you to...

1332
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,360
We're going to wrap up there.

1333
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:13,480
Thank you to the Riverside for having us this theater rules.

1334
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,480
Yes.

1335
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:18,440
And honest to God, we've been in a lot of theater and they're all really, really great.

1336
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:28,400
This one has a free Golden Tee golf machine upstairs, which we are fucking terrible at.

1337
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:34,960
Thank you to America's favorite, Paul Sabourin, for running...

1338
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,960
For being our...

1339
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
Our dad came up.

1340
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,040
Thank you to our dad, Clint McElroy, for...

1341
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:47,520
But Paul, Paul is kind of the dad of...

1342
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
He's our tour daddy.

1343
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,520
He's our tour daddy.

1344
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,520
Kind of.

1345
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
He made...

1346
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
You guys get on the train, okay?

1347
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:53,520
We did.

1348
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,520
Thank you, Paul.

1349
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:55,520
Thank you, Paul.

1350
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,840
If you liked when Paul came out and like sat down on iPads and stuff, go check out Paul

1351
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
and Storm.

1352
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,720
It is his musical group.

1353
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:03,720
It's fucking fantastic.

1354
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:10,480
And they will be on the Joko Cruise along with me and my wife, Theresa, and my dad and

1355
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,480
John...

1356
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,480
A hundred other people.

1357
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,480
And Jean Grey.

1358
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,480
A lot of amazing people.

1359
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,080
You can find out more details about that, JokoCruise, J-O-C-O Cruise.com.

1360
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,480
Also want to say, the posters, if you haven't got one, get one of those.

1361
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,640
They're done by Steven Sugar.

1362
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,640
They're fantastic.

1363
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,320
And they are beautiful.

1364
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:30,640
And thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1365
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,160
a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1366
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:34,160
And also, thank you, Milwaukee.

Final yahoo that was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson, thank you, Seth.

1384
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:58,360
Oh, sorry.

1385
01:12:58,360 --> 01:12:59,360
Real quick.

1386
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,360
Oh, man.

1387
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,360
We're not going to be able to hang out after the show.

1388
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,360
Yes.

1389
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,360
Because we have early fucking flights.

1390
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,920
Because Justin has a fever, Griffin fell over, and I arm wrestled too much.

1391
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:09,480
So I fly back to Austin like 6 a.m. tomorrow.

1392
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,480
Yeah, it sucks.

1393
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,480
Okay, anyway.

1394
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,480

1395
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,480
We love you all very much.

Thank you.

1425
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:33,660
I'm Jesse. I'm Jordan. And we've been doing Jordan Jesse Go! for almost ten years now.

1426
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:38,020
And it's not gotten any easier to describe. So we asked our fans to do it for us.

1427
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:44,140
Jordan Jesse Go! is a weekly conversation with two best pals, two hilarious friends,

1428
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,180
the hilarious smart kids, talking about hilarious stuff that happens to them, mostly really stupid

1429
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:54,860
stuff, awkward anecdotes, insane tangents, heartfelt stuff. It's like being thrown in

1430
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:59,200
the middle of a hilarious conversation between you and your best pal. It's a show that makes

1431
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,520
me laugh every week, which is pretty rare and wonderful. It might be the best thing on the

1432
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,960
internet. One of the funniest things you will hear. And it's the best part of my week. And

1433
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:13,400
has kept me company for the past seven years through all sorts of life. I love those guys.

1434
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,720
That's Jordan Jesse Go! the comedy podcast that's been named Best of iTunes. Every

1435
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:25,900
