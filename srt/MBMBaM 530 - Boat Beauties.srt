1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,720
Hello everybody, welcome, my brother, my brother, and me, and in my show for the modern era,

6
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,400
I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminaire, I haven't said that in a while,

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,040
Griffin McElroy, but it's still true. Guys, I'm so excited. Folks at home,

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,760
you're going to be so excited. We got a special guest with us this week.

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,080
You'll never believe it. It's the my brother, my brother, and me fall time prize mummy.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,520
What? Oh, the prize mummy's back.

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Do you just remember the prize mummy? The fall time prize mummy.

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
Yeah. The prize mummy.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
We did him back in what, 2012? Yeah.

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,920
I have no memory of the things you're saying.

16
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,600
We did prize mummy in 2012, 2013. I think that was the last one. We changed up the rules each

17
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,320
time. One, you had to rip a bandage off, and however much you got off, you got that much back

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,880
in store credit. That's right.

19
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,200
I mean, it sounds funny. I'm wild about it over here.

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,800
It was young as fuck. It was funny as fuck, and it's only going to be funnier.

21
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,720
He used to be the Halloween prize mummy, and then we did some focus testing, and that wasn't playing

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,680
super well with our Christian base, so he became the fall time prize mummy.

23
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,520
That might be why you don't remember him right away, but he's back.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,160
He's here sitting next to me. Very close.

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,040
The focus group also said they preferred the mummy to be dead, like a historical,

26
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,560
in a museum, dead mummy, and didn't get up and move around.

27
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,920
But at that point, what's the game? If you're not chasing the mummy down trying to rip off

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
its precious expensive bandages that you can trade in for store credit at Dick's Sporting

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
Goods, what's the fucking point?

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,800
It's been a little while. The mummy has asked if he could share some of his political opinions.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,800
He can't speak to air those opinions out, right?

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,640
Right. If he does try, scarabs fly out of his mouth, which is rather unpleasant, so I'd rather

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,320
he didn't do that. I guess just interpret him for a

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,160
trab and maybe clean him up a little bit. I'm going to try to.

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,600
Okay, so he's holding up a sign here. Okay, well that's interesting.

36
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,040
On this one, he's written that women should get the vote.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,640
Oh my god, prize mummy. Yeah, no, we did that.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,520
He's underlining an exclamation point, exclamation point. Okay.

39
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,760
Yeah. Oh, he's crossing it out.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,880
Oh, oh, oh, wait. Oh.

41
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,200
What's that mean then? He's now just nodding slowly.

42
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,160
Oh no. Oh, prize mummy.

43
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,480
I don't feel like any prizes have even been exchanged at this point.

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,800
No, he's kind of holding them hostage at this point. He's got them all tucked behind him

45
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,880
and he's holding a finger out at me and waggling it and pointing at his dry erase board.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,880
Trev, can you sneak a peek? Can you sneak a peek at the prizes?

47
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,240
What do we got? Oh, it's a, huh.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,080
It's a lot of cans without labels.

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,360
Can you ask him where he got those from?

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,520
Yeah, let me, oh my honey. Prize mummy?

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
I've already seen that it's cans. Where'd you get the can?

52
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,520
Okay, you're shrugging. You can't shrug.

53
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,880
You got the cans from somewhere. Where did he, he's doing like a,

54
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,280
I'll never tell. I'm a little stinker kind of thing.

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,160
Prize mummy, where did you get the cans?

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,960
I think, Trev, maybe the more important question is where did you get the prize mummy?

57
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah, where did you find the prize mummy?

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,360
Because as I understand it, he's apparently been idle for a few years.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
Yeah, well, no, this isn't the original prize mummy.

60
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,880
The original prize mummy is working in LA now.

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,800
This, I got this prize mummy off of Cincinnati Craigslist.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
But he told me he is a certified prize mummy with the guild.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,920
Yeah, he told you that. And what did that exchange look like when you,

64
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,760
I'm guessing, rented a budget truck to pick up, did it come with sarcophagus?

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Of sorts. It was mostly, can I be honest?

66
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:02,880
Yeah.

67
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,840
It was just an old foot locker that he was in.

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
The store, like the store?

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,040
No, Griffin, don't be ridiculous.

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,160
You bought a foot locker at an old mall?

71
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
And then there was just a mummy inside?

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,800
Now hold on.

73
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,320
No, okay, I can see the confusion.

74
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,560
I did not buy the foot locker shoe store, but I did buy an old chest, a foot locker at a mall.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,320
And he was inside of there reading a book.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,440
And the book was men are from Mars and women are from Venus, which was weird.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,720
That is weird.

78
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,080
And so I think mummy in the foot locker is a really good episode of Are You Afraid of the Dark?

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
I think that would be good.

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
And we could do a fun bit where he is wearing Air Jordans.

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,200
Was he buried in the foot locker?

82
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,480
So maybe he was buried in the box at the store?

83
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,040
Is that right?

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,600
Can you ask when he was mummified?

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,040
Because it's starting to sound like the answer might be like 1979.

86
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,800
Let me ask, when were you mummified?

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,520
Last week?

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,880
Last week.

89
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Okay, okay, that's not a mummy.

90
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,320
That's not a mummy, that's a dead person.

91
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,200
That's a dead body.

92
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,640
Okay, well, get out of here.

93
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

94
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Let's find out what these prizes are, though, before we go kicking this cadaver out.

95
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280
Can I open one can at least?

96
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,320
Can I open a can?

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,520
Okay, he's carefully picking which can.

98
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,600
How do you know what they are?

99
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,640
There's no labels.

100
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,760
Oh, okay, this one, I should open this one.

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,080
Okay, let me open this one.

102
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Okay, oh, oh, okay.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,720
It's, huh, it's alphabet soup.

104
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh.

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,920
Okay, but it's, oh, all the words are dirty words.

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,760
It's just spelling out dirty words everywhere.

107
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,560
He's giggling.

108
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
How is that possible?

109
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
Yeah, I don't know.

110
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
But no, you do know, you're there.

111
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,520
Well, it's just every time I shake the can a little bit,

112
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,160
the letters that float to the top are saying like poopy butt kind of thing.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
So it's like a magic eight ball, but it's soup.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,920
Soup?

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,600
Yeah, oh, he's casting a spell.

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,440
Okay.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:11,440
Okay.

118
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,600
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Oh, no, sorry, it's just a card trick.

120
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Sorry, I misunderstood what he was doing.

121
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,040
Oh, it's pretty good.

122
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah, that is my card.

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,040
Wait.

124
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,280
Oh.

125
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
Man, Trav, you really had us going with this prize mummy thing,

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,480
but I feel like the last couple seconds have really been a...

127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,120
Yeah, I think we understand now what this is.

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,400
Well, he left.

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,560
If I'm being honest, he left as soon as I started asking questions about the cans.

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,400
He got pretty squarely and he left.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,720
So I was covering for that because I didn't want you guys to know that he's loose.

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,840
And I'm sorry about that, world.

133
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,320
I set him free from the Foot Locker in the Foot Locker,

134
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,600
and now the prize mummy could be coming to your town today.

135
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,080
So he could be anywhere at this point.

136
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,640
Yeah.

137
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Do you think Brendan knows whenever this happens?

138
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
Well, he gets a call from the government, doesn't he?

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,560
Okay, yeah, sure.

140
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,920
Should we have asked him to do this bit with us?

141
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,960
Brendan Fraser?

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,560
It feels intentional now, doesn't it?

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,440
It does a little bit.

144
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:13,680
Yeah.

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
To not to keep him out.

146
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,200
Fuck, I would love to get Brendan Fraser on the show.

147
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,160
Fuck, I would love to do that.

148
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,960
God, I'd love it.

149
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,760
That would be cool.

150
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,560
That would be cool.

151
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
He doesn't have to talk about the mummy.

152
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,840
No.

153
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,800
Unless he wants to.

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,040
If he wants to, of course.

155
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,000
He doesn't have to talk about the mummy,

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
he just has to vanquish the Cincinnati mummy

157
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,600
that Travis has now just let loose upon the world.

158
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,240
Yeah, and I said I was sorry.

159
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,240
If anybody knows Brendan, that never works.

160
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,520
But if you do know Brendan personally,

161
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,680
I'd love to get him on the show just to talk.

162
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,840
I feel like there's so much we could talk about.

163
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll talk to him about Blast from the Past.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,280
Sure, absolutely.

165
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,120
I'll talk to him about his arc on Scrubs,

166
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,320
which is really good.

167
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,160
Oh, it's great on Scrubs.

168
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,280
George of the Jungle.

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Gods and Monsters?

170
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,840
Are you kidding me?

171
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,200
Come on, what a talent.

172
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
I love Brendan.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
Doom Squad.

174
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,720
Anyway, this is my brother on Brother Man.

175
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,800
Encino Man.

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,300
Yeah.

177
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,920
You know, Encino Man set up a big sequel.

178
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,520
The big sequel on Encino Man that they never paid off.

179
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm still a little chuffed, a little chafed.

180
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,680
Admit you Googled bedazzled.

181
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,800
There's no way you remember.

182
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,240
Actually, no one remembers the existence of bedazzled.

183
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
You tell me you Googled it.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,160
That was bedazzled with Elizabeth Hurley

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
was also in the film.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,840
That doesn't prove that you didn't Google it.

187
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,880
Maybe me and Travis are just big bedazzle heads.

188
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,380
Yeah.

189
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
This isn't my show.

190
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,200
And we're going to...

191
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,720
We're going to be helping everybody.

192
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
Whether they want it or not.

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
We have an excited promotion in the second half of the show.

194
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,960
We will talk about what to do with the teeth.

195
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,400
Just passing mention here.

196
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,320
Don't anybody else email us what you do with teeth.

197
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,120
Now it's bad.

198
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,960
Maybe you should explain for people who missed that episode

199
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,000
what you just said is probably the wildest shit they've ever heard.

200
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,640
They should listen to that episode then, I guess.

201
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,880
And I'm not going to backtrack for people.

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,600
We had someone had some teeth that they wanted to unload

203
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,760
and we offered to kind of like Craigslist it for them on our show.

204
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
So we had a bunch of people.

205
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,360
Well, you'll see.

206
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,560
Let's talk about it later.

207
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,600
Right now, I want to talk about you.

208
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,100
Me?

209
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,640
The listener.

210
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,760
Me?

211
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,040
No, not never you.

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,040
Here comes the questions.

213
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,560
I need to take a drug test for a boat captain's license I'm getting.

214
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
These can be expensive when your company isn't making you do it on their dime.

215
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,080
However, I'm also currently job hunting.

216
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,280
So the interviews I want to ask if there is a drug test

217
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,160
but because I want to take it since they will pay for it.

218
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,560
Wait, okay, hold on.

219
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,760
Wait, okay.

220
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,680
Okay, this person needs a drug test.

221
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,040
So they're trying to get a job so they can get a complimentary drug test.

222
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes, as I understand it.

223
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,380
Yes.

224
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,420
Yes.

225
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,080
How do I ask if there's a drug test in a way that indicates

226
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,560
I actually want to take the drug test?

227
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:21,700
Wow.

228
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,000
Charles, youngest of three brothers.

229
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,040
That is actually.

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,540
Jesus.

231
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,520
You have to float this as reverse reverse psychology where it's like

232
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,760
if you say like, oh, and is there a drug test?

233
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,960
Because I really want to take one.

234
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:38,160
They're going to think you're asking that because you don't want to take one.

235
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,040
How do you then flip it back judo style to the other side?

236
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,520
I tell you, there's another trick to it too.

237
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,440
Where you say, is there a drug test?

238
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,720
I really want to take it, right?

239
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
Or is there, let's start here.

240
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,200
Is there a drug test?

241
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
Now they're thinking it's because they're worried about drugs

242
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,840
and they take drugs and that's why they're asking.

243
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,920
But the other option is then you say because I really want to take it

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,280
and I'm not afraid of it at all.

245
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,440
And then they say, oh, okay.

246
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Well, then like, why even bother doing the drug test

247
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,880
if they're asking to take it?

248
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,880
They're probably good.

249
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,400
So let's not worry about it.

250
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Are you suggesting you roll up and you're like, what's up?

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
My name is Grungy Doob Lord.

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,800
And I really, oh boy, I got a question to ask you,

253
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
but I don't know if I should.

254
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:35,040
Y'all don't do, y'all don't do drug tests, do you?

255
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,720
There's, okay, risk of this, risk of this,

256
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,480
is that they're so enchanted by Grungy Doob Lord

257
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,800
that they actually are like, we normally do,

258
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,400
but I definitely do like you on staff and we're gonna wave it.

259
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,000
You have, if I may, an intoxicating presence.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,200
I am, if you'll forgive, addicted to Grungy Doob Lord

261
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,080
and I do wanna have you on staff.

262
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
So we're gonna wave the drug test

263
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,880
or I'll give you some of my piss.

264
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,720
Are you sure?

265
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
Cause I'm happy to take the drug test if you need me.

266
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,920
I wanna party with you Grungy Doob Lord

267
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,720
and whatever that it takes.

268
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,840
But I like getting high on the rules.

269
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,400
So as well as drugs.

270
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,600
So I mean, maybe if there's a drug test, that's cool.

271
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,800
I was gonna suggest that you just like be honest

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
because that would be like a very memorable thing

273
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,920
in an interview if you're like,

274
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,840
do you guys do drug tests?

275
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,280
Cause I'd actually love to take one

276
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,120
because I need it for my boat captain's license.

277
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,480
That'd be extremely memorable.

278
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,680
But if I'm a hiring manager,

279
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,320
that is gonna raise a huge red flag with me.

280
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
Like once you get permission to get out

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
in those beautiful waves,

282
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,560
then I'm gonna lose you to Lady C.

283
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,920
You ain't coming back.

284
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
You're Poseidon's girlfriend now.

285
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,360
You're not returning.

286
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,120
I am but a port that you have stopped in

287
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,960
on your way to bigger and better things,

288
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,800
by which I mean the ocean,

289
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,240
which is both bigger and better than any job I could offer you.

290
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,200
Unless the job is for an airline pilot,

291
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,960
at which point that is better.

292
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,320
That is one step above.

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
Yeah, but there's no way

294
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,960
they're gonna fucking trust you then.

295
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,920
There's no way the air pilots would trust a boat pilot

296
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
or a potential a wannabe boat pilot.

297
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,360
You can't have dominion over the sky and the sea.

298
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,200
What do you think you are?

299
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm saying, okay, the structure as we all know,

300
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,880
at the top is astronaut,

301
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,960
then airline pilot,

302
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,360
then boat captain,

303
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,240
then river boat captain,

304
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,320
then subway driver.

305
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Long-haul trucker I think beats subway driver.

306
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,680
Okay, yeah, long-haul trucker,

307
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,200
then subway driver,

308
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
then subway sandwich artist,

309
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,760
and then just any kind of digger,

310
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,640
anybody who just digs into the ground with a big drill, right?

311
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,640
I think they put them above the subway sandwich artists.

312
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,120
Oh, really?

313
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,360
And you also skip like train engineer, like above.

314
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,960
No, that's counted in river boat driver

315
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,400
because the railways are the rivers of the earth.

316
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,480
That's cool.

317
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
Metal rivers crisscross this beautiful land

318
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,680
that we call America.

319
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,080
Exactly.

320
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,600
And just America, we're the only ones with trains.

321
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,280
Well, still, I mean at this point.

322
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,320
We should do trains at some point, right?

323
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,200
America's going all around, hither and yon,

324
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,720
so freaking fast.

325
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,880
Man, America's really buying into trains, huh?

326
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
Should we buy into trains?

327
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,380
Nah.

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Nah, it's a sucker's bet.

329
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,800
Nah, we're still using those boats

330
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,520
that horses pulled along by the side of the river

331
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,840
because we don't know how sails work, I guess.

332
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,600
Hey, do you want to yacht?

333
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,920
This question is so regressive and weird.

334
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,440
The question's not regressive and weird,

335
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,240
but why do boat captains have to take a drug test?

336
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,640
Is it so important that- Captain Ron.

337
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,960
Captain, do you think Captain Ron

338
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,400
set a bad precedent?

339
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,200
He ruined it.

340
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,700
Yep.

341
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,980
Okay.

342
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,640
I'm just saying-

343
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,280
That doesn't make sense.

344
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
That's such a good answer.

345
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,200
I get why you maybe don't want your sky pilot

346
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,240
to be like under the influence,

347
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
but a boat captain,

348
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,840
I feel like it's pretty hard to crash a boat, right?

349
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,360
Well, I mean, okay, here's the thing.

350
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,640
I will say, I would like-

351
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,080
Well, I mean, it's to the contrary.

352
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,000
I mean, people are crashing boats.

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,600
But here's, to that point, Justin,

354
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
I would like my boat captain to be sober

355
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,120
at the beginning and ending of the journey.

356
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,440
In the middle there, lot of open water.

357
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
That's it, you're throwing a dart

358
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,720
and just letting it fly.

359
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,240
And while it's flying, just like,

360
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,800
hey, we're cruising, so now I'm cruising for a boozing.

361
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,480
Yep. Catch you later.

362
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,680
I'm thinking of, I guess,

363
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
cruise ships and yachts and shit like that.

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
If you're in a little speedboat,

365
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,120
yeah, you should definitely, definitely tighten up.

366
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,800
I got a Yahoo here.

367
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,160
And this one was sent in by Graham Roebuck.

368
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,760
Hey, beautiful, beautiful dovetailing here.

369
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,240
Thanks, Graham.

370
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,400
It's Yahoo Answers user Katie J who asks,

371
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,600
what's the easiest way to get a free boat?

372
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,520
I want a boat, but I don't have any money.

373
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,880
How can I get one for free?

374
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:38,800
Huh?

375
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,720
I mean, if you wait until a very intoxicated person

376
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
falls out of their boat, but the boat's still moving,

377
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,080
if you can catch it, round it up, free boat.

378
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I get, okay, first things first,

379
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,320
we need to define some terms, right?

380
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,920
Because boat could, like, are we not,

381
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,040
I mean, are we, and of course not a toy, Griffin,

382
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
but I'm saying, are we talking about perhaps

383
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,560
a, like, simple, you know, like floats on the water,

384
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,560
holds maybe like one person, like, you know, a duck?

385
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,680
Yeah, that's the minimum, yes.

386
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,600
Okay, then I have learned from watching many movies

387
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,760
that people often just leave those things,

388
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,760
like on the seashore, perhaps, turned upside down

389
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,200
with a crab living underneath it.

390
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,560
You might just find one, like, on a creek, you know,

391
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,440
washed up.

392
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
In a river delta somewhere.

393
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,440
Yeah, right, right, right, right, right, right.

394
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,360
So I think it's just that's persistence.

395
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,520
Now, if you're talking about a quality boat,

396
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
you're talking about a boat that others will envy.

397
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
Now you're speaking my language.

398
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,040
I was watching this series,

399
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
I can't remember if it was on TikTok,

400
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,520
it was probably on TikTok,

401
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,320
where somebody was doing some trading

402
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
and they started with, like, a bobby pin

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,080
and then they just went from person to person,

404
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
seeing if they could trade up

405
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
until they traded for a house.

406
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,920
So why not do that?

407
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
Start trading for a boat.

408
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,040
I don't want me to think about it, but that's not free.

409
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
Well, you get the bobby pin for free.

410
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
If you told me right now you would give me $100

411
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,440
if I could give you a bobby pin,

412
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
I don't think I could find,

413
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,080
like, I'm not sure I could find one.

414
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
Well, what's the equivalent you could find?

415
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,920
Justin doesn't have to be a bobby pin.

416
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,840
It could be a safety pin.

417
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,960
It could be a button.

418
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,720
You have a boat?

419
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,200
A boat for a boat.

420
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,960
I'll trade you this bobby pin for that boat.

421
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,400
Boat for boat.

422
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,440
Boat for boat.

423
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm a B for B.

424
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm on Craigslist looking B for B.

425
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,000
You gotta start with a small boat

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,200
and you start trading up

427
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
until you get to your own cruise ship.

428
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,400
Hey, no fucking games.

429
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,640
I'm trying to do a B for B trade here

430
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,000
in Austin, Texas, hit me up.

431
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,720
No fucking drama here.

432
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,240
Tell us about your boat

433
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
to see if anybody else is interested.

434
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,880
They bought their boat,

435
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
now they're having second thoughts

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,400
and they're like,

437
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,920
maybe this wasn't the boat for me,

438
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,960
but maybe, Griffin,

439
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,080
your boat is the boat for them.

440
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,280
So tell them about your boat.

441
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,580
Gray.

442
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:05,920
Ooh.

443
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,000
White, gray stripes, blue.

444
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
It looks like one of those

445
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,480
cups with the cool, sort of gray,

446
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
seafoam blue pattern

447
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,600
spraying across the back of it.

448
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,480
Like a Dixie cup?

449
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,080
Like a Dixie cup.

450
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,600
And on the back it says

451
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,760
boat.

452
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
It says hard boat.

453
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,680
Hard boat.

454
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,920
How big is it, Griffin?

455
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,200
How big is your boat?

456
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,400
Six feet.

457
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,560
Wow, nice.

458
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,680
Is that?

459
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
How wide is it?

460
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,720
Six feet tall.

461
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,160
50 feet long.

462
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,280
Wait, and how wide?

463
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,320
Griffin, this is so important.

464
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,800
How wide?

465
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,320
Six feet.

466
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,040
It's a submarine.

467
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
So it's six feet?

468
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,840
It's six feet tall and six feet wide

469
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,520
and 50 feet long.

470
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,560
Yeah, if you're in a hard boat,

471
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,280
you know what's up.

472
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,320
Carry or go out to the ocean,

473
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,760
rent a boat.

474
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,000
Okay.

475
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,280
Okay, I have two plans.

476
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,520
Rent a boat, keep going.

477
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,480
Free.

478
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,320
Free boat.

479
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,360
It's free.

480
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,160
That's a free boat.

481
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
If there's a deposit,

482
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,800
listen, let's fucking allow

483
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,920
this one technicality.

484
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
If there's like a $150 deposit,

485
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,440
but it's still a free boat.

486
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,800
Yeah, if you compare it to boat,

487
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,280
it's free.

488
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,600
So that's the one option.

489
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,800
If you don't want to get all nasty about it,

490
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,240
what I would do is rent a boat,

491
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,680
get a big tank of boat gas

492
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,680
and then drive around in the ocean

493
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,680
looking for someone that has run out of gas.

494
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,640
Sorry, regular gas or boat gas?

495
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,680
No, yes, of course.

496
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,400
Sorry, thank you.

497
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Chunky, extra chunky boat gas.

498
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:54,560
Yeah.

499
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,560
Now we're not talking about sailboat oil,

500
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,360
right Justin?

501
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,040
We're talking about specifically

502
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,400
engine boat gas, right?

503
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,280
Yeah, for engine boats.

504
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
Yeah, boat gas.

505
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:06,960
Okay.

506
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,000
So you drive around,

507
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
you find some wood,

508
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,800
it was run out of boat gas.

509
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,040
Okay.

510
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,680
And they're like,

511
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,720
fuck, this sucks.

512
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,840
I'm never getting home to my beautiful husband

513
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,880
and my eight sons.

514
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,520
Don't worry about it, sir.

515
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
I have boat gas for you.

516
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,120
Okay.

517
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,000
The only trade that we need to make is

518
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
I need that boat.

519
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,120
But you have a boat.

520
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,680
It's mine.

521
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
But no, this is a rental.

522
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,600
You take this rental back,

523
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,240
and I'll fill up your boat with boat gas,

524
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
but it's mine.

525
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
This is a B2B trade.

526
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,600
Yeah, no games.

527
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,440
The rental's still going to get back

528
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
and that person gets to live on.

529
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,240
Now, I want to hit you with a second sub plan.

530
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,920
This one's extra spicy,

531
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,800
so you really want to send the kids out of the room,

532
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,160
but starve them out.

533
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,960
Oh no.

534
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,440
Okay, wait.

535
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
So they run out of gas.

536
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,960
There's actually,

537
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,160
now that I think about it,

538
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,640
they have,

539
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,720
if you want to get Mad Max about it,

540
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
they have nothing to offer you,

541
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,720
you know, so just wait until they have perished.

542
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
Now, you're going to risk a Coast Guard rescue in this option.

543
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,080
Yeah.

544
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,160
And you, and let me tell you, friend,

545
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,040
if the Coast Guard shows up at your park next door

546
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,080
like a vulture,

547
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,840
they are going to have a word with you.

548
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
I'm just waiting for a free boat.

549
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,480
Yeah, I was going to take this and they died.

550
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,200
I was just waiting.

551
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,440
I wasn't actively hurting them,

552
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
but I wasn't helping either.

553
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,560
I wasn't helping.

554
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,520
There's no rule that says I have to help, officer.

555
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,120
International waters.

556
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,760
You are 20 feet from the beach.

557
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,480
They could have swam then.

558
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
This person deserves whatever they get.

559
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,160
Guys, I'm thinking about it.

560
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,200
There's so many fucking ways to get a free boat.

561
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,400
It's wild that we all don't have boats at this point.

562
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,440
I'm sitting here thinking about all the boat captains

563
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
I could seduce and take their boats from.

564
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,240
Why haven't I been doing that already

565
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
just for the sport?

566
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,760
Yeah, I mean, my ways don't involve

567
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,240
as much sort of murder or wrongful death

568
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,480
as the two of you are sort of floating.

569
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,120
Whoa, whoa.

570
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
Neither of mine involved in murder.

571
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
I said seduction, Griffin.

572
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,720
Consensual seduction.

573
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,640
Seduction that you then throw them

574
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,920
over the edge of the boat.

575
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,360
No, Griffin, I seduced them on land

576
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,560
and then once our lovemaking has exhausted them

577
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,160
beyond their ability to mobilize-

578
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
You steal their boat.

579
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,800
I steal their boat and then I sail it to the next port,

580
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,080
seduced again.

581
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,960
The perfect crime.

582
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,360
And Griffin, can I tell you?

583
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,560
I give that boat to my newly seduced captain

584
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,360
and take their boat.

585
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,920
You don't try and sail two boats at the same time?

586
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,320
You fucking-

587
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,760
No, I tried that in college.

588
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,440
Yeah, didn't work.

589
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,320
One foot on each one.

590
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,520
It always sounds good, doesn't it?

591
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,120
Yeah, it sounds good.

592
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,640
It sounds good.

593
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,200
You go to boat rental place to go back to that well.

594
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,720
You go back to boat rental place.

595
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,360
You sail away in a beautiful, beautiful boat.

596
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,800
If you do a deposit, it's fine.

597
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,840
You eat that deposit.

598
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,320
It's gone.

599
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,920
And then you park it up the jetty

600
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,960
and you come back without it and you say,

601
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,120
ah, wouldn't you fucking know it?

602
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
Big storm.

603
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,440
The perfect storm.

604
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,400
White squall.

605
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
Very localized.

606
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,720
Very localized.

607
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,280
Sunk to the bottom of Davy Jones' locker.

608
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,320
Anyway, can I get another boat?

609
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
And my deposit back.

610
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,800
It wasn't my fault.

611
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,080
White squall.

612
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
Perfect storm, please.

613
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,920
And you have insurance, right?

614
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,520
That's also, that is an insurance loophole

615
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,520
that if it's perfect storm, you are not liable for that.

616
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,480
What are you gonna do?

617
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,000
What the fuck are you supposed to do?

618
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
The storm is perfect.

619
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
If you can avoid it, it ain't perfect.

620
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
A lot of times you see a storm

621
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,160
and you think it's about to knock your boat over

622
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,520
and it looks almost perfect.

623
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,200
You're like, fuck, I hope this gets a bit worse.

624
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,080
Because if not, I'm gonna be in kind of the,

625
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
you're gonna fall in between perfect, like imperfect storm.

626
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,040
A pretty good storm.

627
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
Yeah, a pretty good storm.

628
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,680
Oh man.

629
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,760
You could also inherit your granddaddy's boat.

630
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,880
That's just another option.

631
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,040
Yeah, yeah, but you gotta be good to your granddad, don't you?

632
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,120
Yeah, that's not worth it.

633
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
I just also really wanted to real quick,

634
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
there's a sidebar here with trending questions

635
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,720
and one of them says, are yacht and boat owners right

636
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,160
that support Trump or no,

637
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,080
but also they misspelled yacht and they spelled it yatch

638
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,720
and that's the only way I'm referring to that type of boat

639
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
from now on and I would encourage our listeners

640
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,840
to do the same, get me a big fucking bright turbo yatch.

641
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
Turbo yatch with a big engine,

642
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
chock full of fuel, me and my friends out on the water.

643
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,600
Lots of boat gas.

644
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,840
Lots of bruise, lots of extra chunky boat gas

645
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
with boat jelly floating around in there.

646
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,840
Just sailing around on our yacht.

647
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,680
Maybe some boat beauties.

648
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,080
Oh, come on, Travis.

649
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
Some shrimp, shrimp cocktails.

650
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Yes, I said boat beauties.

651
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,600
Oh, sorry, I forgot that Travis calls shrimp cocktail

652
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,400
boat beauties.

653
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,640
Shrimp cocktail is, I'm glad somebody finally had the guts

654
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,920
to say it, is the wildest dish ever.

655
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,880
Like you imagine that one a lot as a kid.

656
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
Shrimp cocktail, someone put it around in a circle

657
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,640
and then fill a glass with ice and said,

658
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,520
I guess it's done.

659
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
They put a little cocktail sauce somewhere adjacent

660
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,640
and you get a cocktail.

661
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
It's like somebody just delivered a handful of loose shrimp

662
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,040
and they said, where do I put this?

663
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,120
And they said, well, you finished your drink.

664
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
Just put it in there.

665
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,520
Travis renaming shrimp cocktail as boat beauties

666
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,200
might be the true legacy of this show

667
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,040
long after it is gone.

668
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,080
Because I'm thinking about it.

669
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,360
I've never seen a shrimp cocktail going around

670
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
at some sort of event or even sitting on a table

671
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
at an event and not done the finger wiggling,

672
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,160
like, ooh, what are these?

673
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,200
Don't mind, but I might help myself too.

674
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,320
Shrimp cocktail seems like something somebody did

675
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,000
as a joke in the forties.

676
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,800
You know what I mean?

677
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,520
Like, and here's a shrimp cocktail

678
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,920
because it's a bunch of shrimp in a cocktail glass.

679
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,760
Everybody got a good laugh about it.

680
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
And then there was one idiot there who's like,

681
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,520
I guess that's how fancy people do it.

682
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,120
Yeah, I'm going to do this forever.

683
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm going to do this at everything I go to forever.

684
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,040
It's a British thing.

685
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,960
What is?

686
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,880
Shrimp cocktail.

687
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,480
They call it prawn cocktail over there.

688
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,160
It's probably a fanocratic joint,

689
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,400
which makes actual perfect sense.

690
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
The great British meal.

691
00:28:51,920 --> 00:29:01,920
Okay, this was a three-part meal that was a shrimp cocktail

692
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,880
and then steak and chips and a black forest cake.

693
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,120
Ooh, decadent.

694
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,520
That sounds so good right now.

695
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,320
Decadent.

696
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,040
So you start with the boat beauty

697
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,680
and then you're going to get yourself into

698
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
what they call the landlubber

699
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,040
and you're going to wash it down with a forest cake.

700
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,600
With a black forest cake.

701
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,040
Couldn't think of a fun name.

702
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,840
Couldn't do it.

703
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,040
Think of a good name for it.

704
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
Well, it's already got-

705
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
With a fudgy boy.

706
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,080
Sorry, I got a biome in it already.

707
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,800
You know what I mean?

708
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Yeah.

709
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,440
Yeah.

710
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,760
With a wooden boy.

711
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,000
Don't think a wooden, a nice Pinocchio.

712
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,520
My boyfriend and I went to Publix the other day.

713
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,160
Brag.

714
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,120
I decided, yeah.

715
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,560
Yeah, I decided to bring my tote to save on some plastic

716
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,800
since I didn't have a lot of groceries to buy.

717
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,120
After my boyfriend finished his groceries,

718
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,280
I put my tote bag in the bagging area

719
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,560
to catch your notice and said,

720
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,000
oh, thank you for being so considerate

721
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
and bringing your own tote bag,

722
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,080
which was nice.

723
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,160
But then before I could say anything,

724
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,680
he says, I'm just kidding.

725
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,560
I don't know how to react.

726
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,440
So I laughed it off,

727
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,560
but it seemed kind of weird.

728
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,400
Is it some kind of inside joke to bring in personal bags?

729
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,760
What the fuck?

730
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,720
What the fuck happened to you?

731
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,920
This is from Going Green in Georgia.

732
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
In Austin, you're not allowed to,

733
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,840
like you have to pay money for the bags at grocery store

734
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,600
if you want groceries there.

735
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,080
So you have to bring it,

736
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,080
you are incentivized to bring your own bags

737
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,440
because environment.

738
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,400
So it seems wild for it to be a goof or a gag.

739
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,360
I'm just kidding.

740
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,720
Can you imagine?

741
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
Can you imagine if I was really someone

742
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,160
who cared about the environment?

743
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,720
You don't know me,

744
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,080
but it's extremely funny.

745
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,280
If you do know me,

746
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,400
you would be busting up.

747
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,480
They call me Wasteful Wallace.

748
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,080
It's my whole deal.

749
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,800
Does the tote bag say something kind of goofy on it?

750
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,680
Fuck Publix.

751
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,920
Kroger for life, fuck Publix.

752
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,360
Giant eagle eat Publix's dick,

753
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
but in a bad way.

754
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,320
It should be clear.

755
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,680
Maybe it was a Mr. T ate my balls tote bag.

756
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,180
Fuck.

757
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
Thanks for bringing that in.

758
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,200
Yeah, can't sleep clowns will eat me.

759
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,400
My honor roll student ate your honor roll student

760
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,600
who was a dragon.

761
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,100
Wait.

762
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,420
Cool, man.

763
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,300
I love that one.

764
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,980
That's badass.

765
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,220
My other tote bag is a Jetta.

766
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,380
Do not meddle in the affairs of dragons

767
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,820
because you are crunchy and tastes good with ketchup.

768
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,700
I saw that one and it sent me to hell for three days.

769
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,300
I saw it in college and I still remember it to this day.

770
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,380
And I lay down on the ground and I went into a tomb

771
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,300
and my father woke me up after three days.

772
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,420
He said, you're back, son.

773
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,340
Everyone follow this guy.

774
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,940
I'm going to get out there and do some good.

775
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,500
Just kidding.

776
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,860
That's wild.

777
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,260
I was kidding.

778
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:12,820
When did that happen?

779
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,380
I've never brought a cloth bag to the store before.

780
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,020
Oh.

781
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:19,140
Then you've never lived.

782
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,100
I do keep all the plastic bags in the,

783
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,300
you guys remember the pie safe?

784
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,180
Oh, sure.

785
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,940
I still got the pie safe and I keep it full of plastic bags.

786
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,580
Recently, the back of this came off and I fixed it

787
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,820
because it's made of wood.

788
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,260
I'm capable of doing so.

789
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,020
You conquered that element.

790
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,100
And then I was stuffing the bags back in

791
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,100
and I found one from Kroger and it had an anniversary on it.

792
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,060
It was celebrating this anniversary of Kroger

793
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,620
and the bag was from 2008 and I didn't know,

794
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:06,180
is that still recycling or is that just me treating my home

795
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,300
like a bag tomb?

796
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,820
I didn't know what to do with them at that point.

797
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,060
Justin, I think if you really stop and think about it

798
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
and maybe expand that question out a bit.

799
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,700
That's what I'm trying to do.

800
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,500
And you said, I have some aluminum cans

801
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,420
and what I've done is filled my basement with all of them

802
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,020
and then closed my basement door

803
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
and just don't go down there anymore.

804
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,460
Is that recycling?

805
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,100
I think you know the answer to that question.

806
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,340
You could frame it like I made a shitty, uninhabitable basement.

807
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,380
That's what I have repurposed these cans into.

808
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,260
And guess what?

809
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,820
It's art.

810
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,860
Your pie safe full of garbage bags, of grocery bags,

811
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,860
that's gonna be there until the end of time.

812
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,260
That's art now, is what that is.

813
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,900
That is true.

814
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,140
But you should really start using cloth bags

815
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,020
at the grocery store.

816
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,460
It's pretty choice.

817
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,940
And you can recycle those plastic bags.

818
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,380
I don't go to the grocery store.

819
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:01,700
Okay.

820
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,940
I don't leave my house.

821
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,620
There's a pandemic on, okay?

822
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,300
And I think you need to start finding some things

823
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,140
you could do with those plastic bags.

824
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,500
Maybe make them into clothing for your children.

825
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,580
I put them in the back of my jeans.

826
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,620
I can fit about 30 back there and it's a nice juicy look.

827
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,580
Oh, I see.

828
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,060
But that's only 30.

829
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,340
So I got the ones from,

830
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,460
that basically gets me through like May or June of 2008.

831
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,740
And then there's several,

832
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,460
I mean, there's many, many, many more years to go

833
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
and I don't have that much pant room.

834
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,980
Gotta buy bigger pants, it sounds like.

835
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,300
Yeah.

836
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,900
Is that an answer?

837
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,700
That'd be cool.

838
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,140
If you had huge pants, chalk a block full of plastic bags.

839
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,900
I could hear you coming a mile away.

840
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:50,660
Fucking Jeff Jalili would have a hard time with me.

841
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,780
Sorry, who's that?

842
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,620
It's a guy that attacked me.

843
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,820
Is he Kerrigan?

844
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,700
Oh, I see.

845
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,020
You're patting your leg.

846
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,300
You're protecting yourself.

847
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,660
He would take a cigarette and be like,

848
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,460
not today, Jeff.

849
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,300
Well, that's good because it'll save your ice skating career.

850
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,660
I mean, you're kidding,

851
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,140
but I like to keep my options open.

852
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:11,940
Okay.

853
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,100
I thought it was just to maybe keep the farts in.

854
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,180
If I saw you walking down the street,

855
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:23,300
your pants were huge and full of plastic bags,

856
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,260
I'd be like, uh-oh.

857
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,060
And I assume you've taped them at the cuffs

858
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,660
so that the bags don't fall out.

859
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:33,140
Or I think you're part of the new Borat movie

860
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,300
and that I'm being tricked somehow.

861
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,500
How can I, okay, thank God somebody said it.

862
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,940
How do we keep doing a show in a world

863
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,660
where there's a new Borat movie?

864
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,900
I think you need to burn your soundboard, Justin.

865
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,980
I think you need to ritualistically send it out

866
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,140
on a boat on the river and shoot it with a firing arrow.

867
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,580
Did you make this happen?

868
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,500
Did I kind of bring Borat back?

869
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,100
Interesting, interesting.

870
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:59,300
Oh, quick, do some Austin Powers shit real fast.

871
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,420
Back to back.

872
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,060
I know, I wish.

873
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,140
I don't have any buttons for that.

874
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,060
You have failed me for the last time.

875
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,420
Don't say that so quickly

876
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,020
because right now we're about to head to the money zone.

877
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,580
I might figure out a way to fail you there.

878
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:24,900
It's time for stamps.

879
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,940
Look at the clock.

880
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,300
It's stamp o'clock.

881
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,500
What the fuck, my clock actually says stamps on it.

882
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,940
Now look at your watch.

883
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,380
It's time for stamps.

884
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
I just bought this watch.

885
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Now look at your oven timer.

886
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,820
It's time for stamps.

887
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,180
Oh, it's downstairs.

888
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:42,680
Whoa.

889
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,460
Also, while you're down there,

890
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,900
take those biscuits out of the oven.

891
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:52,500
No, don't eat them.

892
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,140
They're too hot.

893
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,380
Oh, deary.

894
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,140
With stamps.com, you can-

895
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,420
Can we all just shut up?

896
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,020
I'm getting good at this.

897
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,180
Justin, now you give him something to do.

898
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:12,820
Okay, Griffin, look at the stamps in the-

899
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,860
There's a drawer down below your feet.

900
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,660
No, it's bats.

901
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,260
It's made of eggs.

902
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,780
Griffin, there's a bunch of horses that are bringing the mail.

903
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,060
Oh no, someone shot the horse.

904
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,700
Bang, bang.

905
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Hey, oh, Griffin, look at that.

906
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,860
It's Richard M. Nixon, and he's about to tell us more about stamps.com.

907
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,460
And his mouth's full of peanut butter.

908
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,660
Oh, I didn't do any tricks on him this time.

909
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,060
I didn't do any crimes this time.

910
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,780
I did them last time, but not anymore.

911
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,220
Boy, I sure am sweaty.

912
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,060
Anyone got a big glass of water for me?

913
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,780
With stamps.com-

914
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,020
Can I please read this fucking ad?

915
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,860
Yeah, I was about to do it for you,

916
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:04,500
because I thought you were incapable.

917
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,180
I didn't think you had the fortitude.

918
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,580
No, I'm not afraid anymore, Justin.

919
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,220

00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,860
All one word.

944
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,220
Do you guys remember when old Tricky Dick Nixon

945
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,820
got kind of sweaty during a debate

946
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:10,340
and then it was in every American history textbook

947
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,180
I ever read in high school?

948
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,340
That's a pretty fucking wild standard.

949
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,020
That's a pretty fucking wild bar, yes.

950
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,980
Anyway, Squarespace is a,

951
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,380

952
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,980
you can go to the website I created on Squarespace.

953
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,900
It's called the Washington Post.

954
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,100
Whoa!

955
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,420

promote your physical or your online business

960
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,540

972
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:12,580
Bwaah, bwaah!

973
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,500
I am not a crow!

974
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,380
Oh, oh, Nixon's dead.

975
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,660
I think he is actually.

976
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,500
I think he asked away a while ago.

977
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,660
I mean, yeah, no, he definitely did.

978
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:28,260
Still miss him though.

979
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,620
I'm gonna make a website about how much I miss Richard Nixon

980
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,460
but I don't know how to make a website.

981
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,740
Does that make me a coward?

982
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,860
I don't think so.

983
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,700
It just makes me somebody who needs a little help

984
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,620
and that help is gonna come from Squarespace.

985
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,980
Hey Justin, are you doing the Squarespace ad again?

986
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,020
Listen, we just did.

987
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,820
We literally just did it.

988
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,180
Hey J-Man, are you cool?

989
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,380
What about stance.com?

990
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:51,940
Yeah, we did it.

991
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,060
All right, I'll do stance.com.

992
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,740
We did stance too.

993
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,300
Partner.

994
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,180
Macho Man to the top rope.

995
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,420
The flying elbow.

996
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,980
The cover.

997
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,020
We've got a new champion.

998
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,260
We're here with Macho Man Randy Savage

999
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,060
after his big win to become the new world champion.

1000
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,820
What are you gonna do now, Mach?

1001
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,060
I'm gonna go listen to the newest episode

1002
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,980
of the Titans and Fights podcast.

1003
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,780
Oh yeah.

1004
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,540
Tell us more about this podcast.

1005
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,060
It's the podcast of power.

1006
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,420
Too sweet to be sour.

1007
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,020
Funky like a monkey.

1008
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,620
Woke discussions, man.

1009
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,660
And jokes about wrestlers fashion choices.

1010
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,900
Myself excluded, yeah.

1011
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,340
I can't wait to listen.

1012
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,460
Neither can I.

1013
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,580
You can find it Saturdays on Maximum Fun.

1014
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,340
Oh yeah, dig it.

1015
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,740
688 people wanted to use the teeth.

1016
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,800
Wow.

1017
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,720
So we have in Gmail, if you look at the tag we created

1018
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,000
called they will use the teeth.

1019
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,560
It says one out of a hundred of many.

1020
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,680
It won't even tell me exactly how many emails

1021
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,760
fit this thing that they could use the teeth.

1022
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,400
Have we gotten any since we started recording?

1023
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,840
Just so I know like how fast.

1024
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:14,360
Most recent was at 1150 this morning.

1025
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,120
It is 325 as we were recording it.

1026
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,760
It's been four hours.

1027
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Okay, I mean you're just gonna give us the highlight.

1028
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,560
We can't read possibly 600 entries into this.

1029
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,320
Okay, okay, tough guy.

1030
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,280
But think of what you're saying.

1031
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,800
If you want me to give you the highlights,

1032
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,680
that would require me reading 688 entries.

1033
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,560
And we can't do that.

1034
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,720
We've all agreed that that's impossible, right?

1035
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,560
How many of you read, Justin?

1036
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,840
Yeah, so here's one.

1037
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm just gonna start.

1038
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,000
I wanna do kind of like lightning round.

1039
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,560
Okay.

1040
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,840
So if you want to at any point veto,

1041
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,120
I'll just go to the next person.

1042
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:46,600
Okay.

1043
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,160
At any point, I'm giving you guys the ability

1044
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,040
to like bail on it.

1045
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,240
Sounds good.

1046
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,040
From Laura.

1047
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,160
When I heard about the teeth,

1048
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,000
I came up with a fun and creepy design

1049
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,200
for a tooth fairy costume.

1050
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,200
I would cast the teeth

1051
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,040
so I'd be able to make duplicates if needed.

1052
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,840
For the real teeth,

1053
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,240
I would make a halo crown style headband

1054
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,600
and attach them at the end of spikes.

1055
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,000
I'm out.

1056
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,600
That's pretty fucked up.

1057
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,320
I mean, it's very fucked up.

1058
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,480
But I have a feeling all of these will be.

1059
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,120
Um, so I'll use the teeth for a wooden back scratcher

1060
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:18,520
where the teeth.

1061
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm out.

1062
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,840
Next, next, next, next.

1063
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,160
Nope.

1064
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,640
I will use the teeth.

1065
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,280
I love this one.

1066
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,240
I will use the teeth.

1067
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,200
I read this one.

1068
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,760
I have started making my own container candles,

1069
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,160
usually in recycled jars and through store coffee mugs.

1070
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,080
When making candles as gifts,

1071
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,560
I've added costume jewelry during the process

1072
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,640
so my friends and family can have a fun surprise

1073
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,080
when all the wax is melted away.

1074
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,480
Yes.

1075
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,400
I would use the teeth to add to a candle.

1076
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,800
Or maybe I would add each tooth to a different candle.

1077
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,520
It may not be a fun surprise when all the wax melts away,

1078
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,520
but it would definitely be some kind of surprise.

1079
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,760
It'd be fun for me, fun for me to know now

1080
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,600
that somebody is going to be melting a candle

1081
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,280
trying to relax or maybe creating a sexual environment.

1082
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,800
And then, hey, why is there?

1083
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,400
Hey, um, Debra, why is there a fucking tooth just like out?

1084
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,920
On, who did that come from?

1085
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,440
I'm going to say no to this

1086
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,200
because I think the wax would compromise the teeth.

1087
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,320
I think that's right.

1088
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,360
Interesting, interesting.

1089
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:16,840
Tyler works at a company

1090
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,920
that does like larping and stuff in summer camps.

1091
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,560
Uh-huh.

1092
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:25,720
And Tyler makes the swords out of like paper mache swords.

1093
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,600
And he said, I would load nothing more in the paper mache,

1094
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,560
these chompers, perhaps into a snake's head or a skull

1095
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,320
on the hill of a pommel or a sword.

1096
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,000
Okay, hey Tyler, my dude, this is great.

1097
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,360
If I saw a snake's head with some human molars crafted in them,

1098
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,320
I think that might be the goofiest shit in the world.

1099
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,920
It calls apart here.

1100
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,520
Tyler says, once complete,

1101
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,000
I will send this sword to you, Justin McElroy.

1102
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,440
You fucked up, Tyler.

1103
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,920
We made it very clear we don't want the teeth.

1104
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,760
I never want to encounter the teeth.

1105
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,400
But everyone should picture snakes with molars instead of fangs.

1106
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,320
I am reading one here from Zoe who says,

1107
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,400
I'm an art student and would love to use the teeth in a piece.

1108
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,520
I promise I'll make it nice.

1109
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,800
I listen to y'all so much while I paint

1110
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,360
and I would love to add even more of your essence to my practice.

1111
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,560
There's no specifics here, which is my first big red flag.

1112
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,000
The other one is that,

1113
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
and we should have maybe made this clear the first time,

1114
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,600
and I thought it was, we're not giving our own teeth away.

1115
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,320
Like, I'm still wicked using mine a lot.

1116
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,000
I'm wild about it.

1117
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,960
Love these babies.

1118
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,960
And you know, I will also say,

1119
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,080
and this is kind of like a little bit of like job training,

1120
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,440
like a job interview training,

1121
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,440
a word to avoid when you're trying to get something

1122
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,120
from someone you like is essence.

1123
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,560
I will use your essence.

1124
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,720
Makes me think of like in Hocus Pocus

1125
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,040
when the witches are stealing the children's youth.

1126
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,400
Matty said, I would like to put the wisdom teeth in a dice mold

1127
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,760
and make T&D dice out of them for wisdom saving rolls.

1128
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,200
Oh, that's good.

1129
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,240
That's very good.

1130
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,040
It's good, but not everybody's going to enjoy that.

1131
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,320
Well, not everyone likes art.

1132
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:07,080
No, but I mean, but you could go see the art if you want to.

1133
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:08,280
You know what I mean?

1134
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,080
It'll be on display.

1135
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,280
It belongs in a museum.

1136
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,160
I guess is what I'm saying.

1137
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,240
The teeth belong in a museum.

1138
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,720
Jillian wants to make tooth earrings.

1139
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,640
That's okay.

1140
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:23,000
See, I'm also kind of avoiding people.

1141
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,040
We heard from a lot of people who collect teeth

1142
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,400
and have a lot of teeth.

1143
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,920
You have enough teeth already.

1144
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,400
You have enough teeth.

1145
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,360
Don't be greedy.

1146
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,440
I'm seeing a lot of people saying,

1147
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,960
I have a bird house that I have that I've been looking to spice.

1148
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,400
Here's somebody who says they have a lamp

1149
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,640
that they've been looking to spice up for a while.

1150
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,960
I feel like a lot of people are just looking at shit

1151
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,360
and saying, you know what would make this spicy is teeth.

1152
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,120
I want something a little bit more purposeful than that.

1153
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,640
Little more thought through.

1154
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,040
My plan for the teeth would most likely involve

1155
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,680
teeth emerging from the eye socket of a crawling human.

1156
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,360
Next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next, next.

1157
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,240
I don't think so.

1158
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,120
I don't think we can do this.

1159
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,600
Well, hold on.

1160
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,160
What standard are we holding this art to?

1161
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Does it have to be objectively not creepy tooth art?

1162
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,280
Because we may not find that.

1163
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay, I have one here from Felix.

1164
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,720
I am a self-employed jeweler and craftsman

1165
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,280
who specializes in weird and interesting material.

1166
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,640
I've previously made a wooden ring with a wallaby tooth inset

1167
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,640
that I found on a bushwalk.

1168
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,920
And I have a good range of brooches, pendants,

1169
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,920
knife handles, and rings made of bone.

1170
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,800
While I have, as above mentioned,

1171
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,440
practiced some post-mortem wallaby dentistry,

1172
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,000
I would absolutely love to be able to make some jewelry

1173
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
with real human teeth.

1174
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,480
Who can say what I would make?

1175
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,000
Okay, Felix, who can say what I would make?

1176
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,560
You can.

1177
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,800
Yeah, you can right there.

1178
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,320
That was your moment to do that.

1179
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,960
Oh, now Felix does suggest perhaps

1180
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,720
a matching pair of wedding rings.

1181
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,160
You can suggest anything.

1182
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,280
There's one here from Greta who says that

1183
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,040
they made three of their own wisdom teeth into rings,

1184
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,240
but the fourth one cracked in half, so they couldn't do it.

1185
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,240
So it would be, can we just send one Greta's way

1186
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:17,320
so they can like complete the set?

1187
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,440
Oh, that is a good question.

1188
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,040
Are we doing, is this an all or nothing?

1189
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,600
I think it's gotta be an all or nothing.

1190
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah, I'm not arranging, I'm not paying for shipping

1191
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,120
to several different people.

1192
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,000
Marla said, I hope I'm not too late in responding.

1193
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,160
I would like to use the teeth in the Christmas diorama.

1194
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,200
And there's an attached concept photo here.

1195
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
Send that, drop that for me in our Slack, please,

1196
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,040
so I can look at that, please, now.

1197
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,080
All right, let me just pass this along to you guys.

1198
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,040
I would love to see this.

1199
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,800
Gonna pass this along and I'll let, I mean,

1200
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:52,600
either one of you guys can describe what you're seeing here.

1201
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,080
I'll just pass this along real quick.

1202
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:02,040
Oh, huh, well, I like that it's non-secular,

1203
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,560
or secular, it's secular.

1204
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,080
Non-religious.

1205
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,040
Non-religious, thank you.

1206
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,400
That would be the way I'd put it.

1207
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,800
Well, one of the teeth is an angel, though.

1208
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,680
Does that count?

1209
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:16,120
We're trending towards religion with that one.

1210
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,440
Yeah, I mean, it's just a winter wonderland scene

1211
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,120
with a reindeer and Santa Claus,

1212
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,840
and it does look like most of these things

1213
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,680
were maybe store-bought and placed inside of a panorama,

1214
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,720
or a diorama, and then they have little clay teeth

1215
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,560
on everything, I don't know.

1216
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,120
I was imagining that.

1217
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,160
I see the problem I have with this, with, I love it, Marla,

1218
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,040
I love your work.

1219
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,080
The teeth in the model are much bigger

1220
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,120
than the teeth would be.

1221
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,000
And that makes me feel like you don't actually appreciate

1222
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,080
your materials that you're working with.

1223
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,040
That's a good point, Justin.

1224
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,680
Like, that worries me.

1225
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,880
I don't want you to get the teeth and be like,

1226
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,480
these are so fucking small.

1227
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,680
I can't do anything with them.

1228
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,480
Now, here's an interesting one.

1229
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,160
I will use the teeth.

1230
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,840
I am a knitwear designer who spins my own yarn.

1231
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,760
Where could this be going, you're wondering.

1232
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,640
I would make the teeth into some stitch markers

1233
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:10,520
for my knitting work by wire wrapping them

1234
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,840
and attaching them to some bulb safety pins

1235
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,920
so I can use them to mark where I'm knitting.

1236
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,360
How do we feel about someone using them to create art

1237
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,520
but not using them in the art itself?

1238
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,600
It seems like a cheat.

1239
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,960
Hey fam, you sure have sent in some pretty

1240
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,760
accursed JPEGs our way.

1241
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,120
And I do thank you for that.

1242
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,560
I am just sort of scrobbling here through the old tag

1243
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,560
and there's a lot of upsetting imagery.

1244
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,520
A lot of upsetting imagery.

1245
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,000
Again, though, what did we expect?

1246
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,120
Hmm, I would use them to make brass knuckles.

1247
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,600
Okay.

1248
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,720
Right, punch and bite with one swing, hold on.

1249
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,600
Wait a minute.

1250
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:55,720
Frankly, I would never have to use them

1251
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,760
because people would back the fuck up just seeing them.

1252
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,600
Whoa, okay.

1253
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:03,240
Whoa, this is, okay, hold on.

1254
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,880
We're talking at this point about sort of like

1255
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,600
nuclear deterrence of just like,

1256
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,280
this thing looks incredibly violent, the punch biter.

1257
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,360
But it could also add rhinestones

1258
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:17,640
to the sides of the brass knuckles, but that's optional.

1259
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,560
The real stars here are the teeth.

1260
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:20,840
Don't do it.

1261
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,800
I'm saying if you pull out brass knuckles with teeth on them,

1262
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,400
the fight will be stopped

1263
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,800
because nobody will wanna mess with you.

1264
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,520
So this may be an incredible peacekeeping tool.

1265
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,640
That's up there for me.

1266
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,720
Okay, okay.

1267
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,920
I would like to use the teeth for a mouth mug.

1268
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,960
I am planning on sculpting a mug

1269
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,760
to look like a realistic mouth.

1270
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,720
And the teeth would be a great addition

1271
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,160
to make it look realistic.

1272
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,200
Now I'm assuming that what we're picturing here

1273
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,440
is the top of the mug is a mouth,

1274
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,520
not that the mouth is on the side,

1275
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,320
but rather you would be drinking out of the mouth.

1276
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,960
Okay, hold on.

1277
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:02,200
You're talking about a mouth cup.

1278
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,480
How many wisdom, it's all wisdom teeth.

1279
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,560
I'm now trying to imagine a mouth

1280
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,720
made up entirely of wisdom teeth.

1281
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,680
And it's only four.

1282
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,760
Bookmark that one.

1283
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,480
Bookmark that one.

1284
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,360
That one sounds good.

1285
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,320
I really like tooth mug.

1286
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,840
Molly, this is the entirety of Molly's email.

1287
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,520
Okay, so you're familiar with Georgia O'Keeffe, right?

1288
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,320
Huh?

1289
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,200
That's the whole thing.

1290
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,200
I mean, if they had ended that email with,

1291
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,960
let me hit you with this, Georgia O'Keeffe,

1292
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,200
then we could have been somewhere.

1293
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,800
Allison says, I will dissolve the teeth

1294
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,720
in a jar of Coca-Cola on a time-lapse video

1295
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,360
as a commentary on the bourgeoisie.

1296
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,800
Okay, that's bold.

1297
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,920
I like how the teeth art don't exist anymore afterwards.

1298
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Some of these emails, like, whoa, this one's really a lot.

1299
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,080
Hold on a second.

1300
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,800
Hold on.

1301
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,000
Guys, look at this one.

1302
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,160
I think this is what I want to use the teeth for.

1303
00:52:59,160 --> 00:52:59,660
Whoa.

1304
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,840
There's so much great art in the world

1305
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,520
and it makes you kind of weep.

1306
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,640
I feel like, you know in American Beauty

1307
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,640
when Wes Craven sees the plastic bag flitting around?

1308
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,880
I feel like that right now.

1309
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,640
That bag's pretty cool though, huh?

1310
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,960
It fell out of his mother's pie safe.

1311
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,840
Oh boy.

1312
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,400
Whoa, hey.

1313
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:22,760
Oh yeah.

1314
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,760
The problem, Justin, is that this is impossible

1315
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,360
to describe on our podcast.

1316
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,880
But oh yeah, I'm with you.

1317
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,680
This is art.

1318
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,560
That's art right there.

1319
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,480
If I saw that in a building, I would say,

1320
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,760
where did you get this art from?

1321
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,720
It's two sort of pseudo busts

1322
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,680
made out of what looks like reclaimed materials,

1323
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,520
like rocks and wire mesh with like,

1324
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,160
I don't know, man, fishing tackle and wire.

1325
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,200
Yeah, here's what I love.

1326
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:54,440
These sculptures that we're looking at

1327
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,360
are definitely in a museum.

1328
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,560
Yeah, yeah.

1329
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,680
And they're definitely art.

1330
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,480
Now, can we be sure that this is not a person

1331
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,960
who just took a picture of some shit in a museum?

1332
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,800
Because I do not want you to just run up

1333
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,800
to some shit in a museum and slap illegal teeth on them.

1334
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:17,480
Yes, because I'm looking at Taylor Baldwin's website

1335
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,240
and there's a lot of art on here.

1336
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,440
I love that.

1337
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,960
Somebody who makes so much art.

1338
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,800
It's good too.

1339
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,640
I love this art and I'm crazy about it.

1340
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,400
If y'all go to taylorbaldwinstudio.com,

1341
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,720
you can see more of Taylor's work.

1342
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,200
I think this is somebody who's talented,

1343
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,560
deserves our patronage and would use the teeth.

1344
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,600
They will use the teeth.

1345
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,280
They will use the teeth.

1346
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,120
I'm looking at this right now, they've used everything.

1347
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,280
Yeah, they will use the teeth.

1348
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,960
I'm for it, I'm here for it.

1349
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,280
Okay, now I don't know if we have heard back

1350
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,280
from the person who has the teeth.

1351
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,240
That is one thing.

1352
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,360
Oh, so the question is, will we use the teeth?

1353
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,440
Will we get the teeth?

1354
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,880
Will we pass along the teeth?

1355
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,960
Okay, but now we're in danger of other people saying like,

1356
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,480
oh, well, I feel bad for them.

1357
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,760
I'll send them some teeth.

1358
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,400
No, we said one time deal.

1359
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,360
We are black market traders of chompers.

1360
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,160
One time.

1361
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,080
So maybe Taylor should set up a PO box

1362
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,120
where people can just send some teeth if they run into it.

1363
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:23,480
Oh, I don't know.

1364
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,560
I think that that will have to be up to Taylor.

1365
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,680
No pressure, Taylor.

1366
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,600
No pressure, Taylor.

1367
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:31,320
However many teeth you got in there, just-

1368
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,600
Here's what we do, Justin.

1369
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,880
We get a PO box.

1370
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,560
We prepay it for a year

1371
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,240
and then people could send as many teeth to it as they want.

1372
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1373
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,200
No, hear me out.

1374
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1375
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,480
And then we stop paying for it.

1376
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:45,960
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1377
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,400
Nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey, nopey.

1378
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,320
I actually liked the second half of that pretty good.

1379
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,240
We're gonna make this happen.

1380
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:58,440
The ideal outcome to me is that this work ends up in a museum

1381
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,000
and then there's a little plaque there that's like,

1382
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,400
spooky boys, and then it'll say like,

1383
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,440
clay, reclaimed stone, four real teeth from podcast jokes.

1384
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:08,940
Yeah.

1385
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,560
That would be pretty badass to me.

1386
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,720
Yeah.

1387
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,880
I think that would really save 2020.

1388
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,800
We'd have to really ask Taylor to like make the art so good though

1389
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,360
that it ends up in like Louvre or other big art museums.

1390
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,560
Met, Met's one.

1391
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,400
Met, oh, the Met.

1392
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,080
Or the Natural History Museum that's right by,

1393
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,440
you know, the Central Park, that's one.

1394
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,040
Sure.

1395
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,680
And okay.

1396
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,600
Teeth are natural history if you think about it.

1397
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,000
Stratford Cash in St. Paul has gotten back to us.

1398
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,240
I do have the Venmo.

1399
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,680
I'm sending the cash now.

1400
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,040
Okay, so you're buying teeth.

1401
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,400
Taylor, I need to hear from you to get a mailing address

1402
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,680
so we can facilitate this.

1403
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,160
Nice.

1404
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,680
Did I buy them for a hundred dollars?

1405
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,320
Is that what I did?

1406
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,040
Jeez.

1407
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,840
Yeah?

1408
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,640
Sounds right.

1409
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:58,920
Sounds like me.

1410
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,160
Sounds like something I'd do.

1411
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,240
Oh boy.

1412
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,840
All right, I'm paying out right now.

1413
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,080
Stratford Cash.

1414
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,960
I'm gonna make this particular transaction up.

1415
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,240
From the Lord.

1416
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:15,740
Lord.

1417
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,640
Don't need to make this public.

1418
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,400
Can I ask what emoji, what you put in the details field?

1419
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:23,880
Teeth.

1420
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,200
Teeth.

1421
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,320
You just wrote the word teeth.

1422
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,680
You didn't even put a teeth emoji.

1423
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:36,520
For those teeth.

1424
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,020
Nice.

1425
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,280
Oh, and there's a little, they make, they got a little,

1426
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,880
they got a little brushing emoji.

1427
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,360
That's so cute.

1428
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:46,920
That's good.

1429
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,920
Because if anybody does hack your shit and see that,

1430
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,000
they'll think you've just gone to some sort of like

1431
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,120
independent underground dentist for criminals.

1432
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:54,760
Yeah.

1433
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,760
For the teeth, which I hope you still have.

1434
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,080
Address forthcoming.

1435
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:00,280
Lylas.

1436
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:04,060
Justin.

1437
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,520
Okay, this money has been sent.

1438
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:10,520
The gears are turning, Taylor Baldwin.

1439
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,040
It all depends on you for you to use the teeth.

1440
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,200
And nobody else send us submissions.

1441
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,560
Nobody else, please.

1442
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,160
Please.

1443
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,240
We can't help you.

1444
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,440
Hey, thank you all for listening.

1445
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,640
Thank you for the teeth.

1446
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,680
Thank you for the art.

Thank you for the music.

1449
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,880
Thank you for the love, the spirit.

1450
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,280
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these

1451
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,840
sort of theme song.

1452
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,080
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1453
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,480
And also thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1454
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,480

It's crazy stuff, man.

1457
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,640
You'll never believe it.

1458
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,880
This stuff is real top notch.

1459
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,040
We want to tell you, so New York Comic Con is this weekend.

1460
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,240
It's all virtual.

1461
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,520
There's a free adventure.

00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:00,520
Ooh, can you believe it?

1463
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:02,600
Spooky Bits and Bytes.

1464
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:05,400

And the M, the E, and the NYCC are all capitalized.

1472
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,760
Also, we put up some new merch over in our merch store.

1473
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:33,240

the Sylvia Rivera Law Project, which works to guarantee that

1478
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,720

1479
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,680

1480
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,080
We've also got some Candle Nights ornaments by Lynn Doyle

1481
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,800

1482
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,360
We got a new jump scare pin up there that's super cute.

00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:03,720
And you can see all that at McElroyMerch.com. Let's see.

1484
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,200
What else?

1485
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,440
There may be nothing else.

1486
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,640
Oh, we wrote a book.

1487
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,200
That's okay.

1488
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:09,800
We wrote a podcast book.

01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,520
