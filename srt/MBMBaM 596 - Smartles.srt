1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,660
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,180
Better it's better

8
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:17,140
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,140
I'm your middle is brother Travis

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,280
Who gives it? What's the fucking point? Wow gives a shit, okay?

11
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,220
Griffin it macro

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,060
What he Griffin is referring to and this is why we sort of gathered everybody here. Yeah, we have decided

13
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,140
After talking with our various legal experts

14
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
We have decided

15
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,860
And this wasn't easy. This wasn't easy

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,660
but we have decided to

17
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,940
accept the results of

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,340
The I heart radio podcast awards. Yeah, no recount in naming

19
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,980
smartless

20
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,420
as the best comedy podcast over my brother my brother me and

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,900
The winner's the best ad read over my brother my brother

22
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,220
That's one that hurts that one Travis his dog is barking in the background. No, but Travis listen to you Travis

23
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,220
Listen to me. I don't give a shit anymore

24
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,780
Oh, man, it was supposed to be building to this. Yeah, it was like literally like 12 years of work

25
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,260
Yeah, let's let the gum snap in the mouth

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,920
Let the let the farts just come on out on the on the Vox

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,340
Let the farts come out the Vox let the gum smack in the mouth and let the dogs bark where I mean, I told

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,340
This is that I with this was all

29
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,540
What it was building towards this is the arc we were on right if we had to think about this

30
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,340
This is wild to think about but and it's always what it could have shown up

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,460
If we had won the podcast award for best ad read, uh-huh. Yeah, we would have been one Emmy a

32
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,460
Grammy an Oscar and Tony away from EGOT. That's right. That's that's what I'm saying

33
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,660
That P is silent in that for podcast award. That's silent. Yeah. Well, no, it would be the I I heart radio

34
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,620
I

35
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,940
Go and then the EGOT which I'm pretty sure I could figure out an anagram

36
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,420
If you if you haven't checked out

37
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,620
Smartless don't which you should because it's apparently really fucking funny

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,820
They put it right there in their Twitter bio seconds later number one button comedy podcast in the world

39
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,440
Which feels oh boy, it's it's Jason Bateman Sean Hayes and Will Arnett

40
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,200
and it's if I could just

41
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,920
Sydney point this out to me yesterday and it's like, you know guys know the wells for boys. Yeah

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,960
You know power Emma Stone's like this isn't for you. Yeah, everything else is for you

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,920
why can't you guys just be funny and famous and handsome and just like

44
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,080
Leave this to us. This is all we have it kind of feels a little bit and not listen

45
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm just saying this listen

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm just trying to get I'm trying to get it out right so I can get past it

47
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,400
It feels like somebody looked at our show and said like huh three white dudes, huh?

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,020
That's a good concept for a podcast. Nobody seems to be doing that kind of thing

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,800
You know what?

50
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,560
Let's get like the better funnier handsomer versions of Justin Griffin and Travis and make a podcast with them

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,440
So that and they can it's like they kind of and I'm just saying it kind of copied

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
The whole thing we were doing and we did it first. They retweeted you Travis. Do you want to walk anything back?

53
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:37,280
Did they they did? Oh, I said well played my friend and then they gave you a little handshake emoji, which is fucking classic

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,400
Yeah, will Arnett would have said something kind of gravelly and snarky but it would have been from the heart, you know

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
I mean, yeah, Jason Bateman

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,840
He would have seemed like he's checked out and doesn't care but it's just like then a single tear of respect

57
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,360
Or to roll down his eye and you're like, oh he's in it now

58
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,880
Oh, it really feels like they just put our podcast into the Stefan Urkel machine. Yeah

59
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,320
And that's what and they're they're better show is well, you know, they're they're going to Chicago, you know, they're playing

60
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Chicago theater

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Kings theater

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,500
Hey, those are our houses those are our houses that we built smell the chairs bud

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
That's our house next thing, you know

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,480
Smell the chairs bud. Are they performing at the fucking Huntington City Hall auditorium? What the fuck God?

65
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,560
Just so you guys know and I hate for this to get so nasty. Yeah, because it's already like so nasty

66
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,560
so nasty, but I

67
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:47,720
Swear to myself last night when I watched that and sobbed to my wife. I said, that's it. These three guys

68
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,320
Fucking boycott. Yeah, I'm done. Yeah, I'm done and after that

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Absolutely, not the only slip ups. I've had since then is I watched murder villain Netflix was born at

70
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,000
Funny, I mean this morning I did catch catch that that first episode of the fourth season of Ozark cuz love

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,760
Yeah, other than that other than that though, but that's only cuz I like Ruth lame or it has nothing

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Every time Batman came on I closed my eyes

73
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,080
Don't need it. I think the thing that really stung for me that I was watching the podcast was I had my whole family gathered around

74
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,640
I kept the kids up late right because I was like, this is daddy's moment now

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,700
I should say my first clue was when they were clearly they had

76
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,800
The winners they seemed to be aware that they're going to win and ready to do a simulcast

77
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Kind of a word speech. We didn't get that particular email

78
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,160
So that was like a clue that maybe but then I saw that they were announcing some like they couldn't make it and I was

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,160
Like, oh, maybe we were so busy. We couldn't make it for the ad read award, right?

80
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
So I was ready for that right

81
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,440
But then the comedy award went up and we didn't win and my five-year-old BB you guys

82
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,560
I think you know where said I'm just so proud of daddy and I said, thank you, honey

83
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
That means a lot and she said no not you

84
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Daddy and she pointed Jason Bateman

85
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
Oh

86
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,640
She said that's daddy now. That's right. Yeah, I will can I say though? Absolutely. You are the will Arnett

87
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm the Jason baby. Well, yeah

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,320
You're the will Griffith the Chinese easy

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,000
You guys are welcome. By the way, let's do like a crossover. Let's get all six of us on one show

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,100
I don't call it white white white privilege

91
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,600
White guys getting it done for themselves finally white guys

92
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, I'm finally a chance for white guys. I'll take one of them. I'll take two of them

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,760
I'll take all three. Whatever. I'll fight a fight. I just know just to abolish

94
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,840
Or let us come on your show doing a concession speech

95
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,600
I don't know where it really counts

96
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,280
You can come on here and take a victory lap if you want to you can come do our ad reads and show us how

97
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:55,200
It's done. Oh, yeah, come show the pros how it's done. You show it. Can you imagine you want an ad read in my house?

98
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Can you imagine how anger advertisers would be if they're like, excuse me? Why did you let will Arnett?

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,880
J spate, but it shot his radar read our ads. We paid for you

100
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,360
You're the special boys with the lips of gold and we say what you have gold lips. They do good ads. Thank you

101
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Thank you

102
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,560
So best luck to them

103
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Or you can see where they're

104
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,800
Fucking just go in, you know, it's a guy like go check them out or listen to the show or don't your ad reads aren't good

105
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,880
Enough don't do an ad read for their show bring all the rotten tomatoes. You got there it is

106
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:36,600
Had it Adam. I didn't even think about the fact that we have dog shit ad reads now sort of there's empirical evidence

107
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,240
No pressure though. No, that's true pressures off. We can really phone it. Yeah

108
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Yeah

109
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,640
Whatever I'm still gonna do it though cuz it's the love of the game for me

110
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,040
That's why I do the ad reads, you know, I don't need I'm not like will Arnett

111
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,320
I don't need awards to feel like a big man

112
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,280
I can just do it for the love of the game and do the ad reads from my heart and

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,000
It's me and Jesus out there doing a good job. And that's all I really need is my walk with Christ

114
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,040
Yes, and my heart I'm I'm the Kurt Warner of ad reads. I still haven't seen that movie

115
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,480
Gotta check that out, but I'm the current Warner of ad reads. I'm gonna throw the ball so hard. I get two touchdowns

116
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,320
I guess and our dad was a

117
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,120
Beleaguered and let's face it mistreated employee of iHeartRadio for such a long time

118
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,400
It would have been so nice to rub this right in his face. Oh, it was so good. Oh my god. Hey

119
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Hey, dad, we know that you were treated like literal dog shit by this huge company, but guess who wasn't?

120
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Your dad now

121
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,920
But you know anyway couldn't even give us that I just feel like covets taking so much away from all thank you

122
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,920
After the as hard as cove it is hit us the McElroy's yeah, the least they could do is step aside

123
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,580
We don't have piles of money to sleep on like you guys do

124
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,760
We need that award

125
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:11,880
They got they've probably been out whining and dying it didn't even slow their fucking stride with all the celebrity ivermectin they've got

126
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,040
They got the fucking deep hollywood reserves

127
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,440
Yeah, yeah, not this cheap shit that you get at Pesmart like we have to do but they're good

128
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,720
Hollywood ivermectin minus ivermectin with a Y which

129
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,880
Man feels, but it tastes good

130
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,400
All right, all right. Okay. Here's here's the talk about having have-nots. Okay, we did

131
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,600
What I current now referred to as a miniseries. Yeah, yeah for the see so network right kill before its time all can agree

132
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,500
These cats do their shows all three of these cats did TV shows did them all we're like, that's good

133
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,360
We've done enough of it and then later, uh-huh

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Just said we want to do more of our TV show and they said yeah, that's the way it works

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,400
They said we have money left over from the my brother my brother and me TV show that we didn't use here

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You can have it. Yeah

137
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:16,540
Anyway, this is an advice. It's revisionist history to say that our TV show was killed and not that our TV show

138
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,240
Outlasted the company that created the TV. Yeah

139
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,280
It was a minute. No, it was a miniseries. That's this way. Oh, you're right. Yeah miniseries

140
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,520
So we did exactly what we set out to do, which is complete our miniseries

141
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Our miniseries was like a tapeworm that lived inside of see so stomach and then see so died in our table and went

142
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh gotta get out of here

143
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
What's going on over here?

144
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,480
What's this? What's this over here VRV gonna go check you out. This is an advice show. Okay

145
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,320
This is an advice show advice. Don't don't get into the fucking podcast business. Yeah

146
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,160
Don't buy a dumbass book about how to get into the podcast business cuz it's just hard

147
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:01,360
It's just heartbreak from start to finish, you know, it'd be really funny. Oh my god, you guys, you know, it'd be so funny

148
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
if everybody if

149
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,720
Everybody on earth ordered a copy of everybody has a podcast except you

150
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:14,760
I'm fucking and fucking sent it fucking to smartless and said like hurt you guys needed this. Oh

151
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,560
My god, that's my actual I actually did have this fantasy, you know

152
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,760
Only murders in the building that show about Steven

153
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,320
Steve Steven Steven Steven Martin Steve Martin short doing a podcast

154
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,420
I I really want to get our book into the second seat. I want someone to just have it on a guy

155
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,180
Oh, that'd be great. That's my dream. Anyway, okay, so this is an advice show sucks. We didn't win that award though

156
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,220
It really sucks man. Really sucks. I had built a show for it just for it

157
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,620
I remember that it was on before Travis texted me about it last night

158
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,860
I mean that was only cuz Joel texted us and said good luck tonight guys, and you said why?

159
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,980
Now hold on. Wait a minute. That is true fucking great by the way

160
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,380
But from I did I did not catch it live

161
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,820
And I heard that they pulled sort of a strange choice for a clip when representing our show

162
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,380
Which I still I I did not see the clip and I'm wondering if this oh, can I play the clip real quick?

163
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,420
That'd be cool. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. Give me give me a second to find it

164
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:23,980
How old were you guys before you had the realization that the if anybody doesn't want them to get married speak now

165
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,260
Wasn't actually like a normal part of a wedding

166
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:32,260
Now here's what I think Travis forward. I'd say yeah this clip

167
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,180
I I think that what's great about that is maybe the judges heard that and thought oh

168
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:42,220
Is this like an ironic title where it's my brother my brother and me, but it's only one guy like Tame Impala

169
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,040
You know at least get comedy bang bang. Everybody was like

170
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:52,860
Like everybody got yucks on the mix. Not even I got a yuck on that mix that like that was just an observation

171
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
It was a question really I

172
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,180
Will say though real quick

173
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,280
This is the clip that they chose for smartless

174
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,800
Smartless, he's won an Emmy. He's been nominated for three Academy Awards and he doesn't know it

175
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,140
But I watch him every single night on reruns of Cheers. It's Woody Harrelson

176
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
That's literally

177
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,820
Okay, so they just aren't really great at making clips. Well knowing that one you get you get everything you need to know

178
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,580
They are they are so fucking famous

179
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,060
All their friends are fucking famous and they can get them to come on show

180
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,620
Like what we got from ours is that Travis makes observations and that's actually that actually does track but we're on it

181
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,820
We're on it, too

182
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,300
Yeah

183
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,700
They should have made that clip a little bit longer where I observed how sometimes words sound like other words

184
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,260
And then you guys would say like, isn't it funny how words sound like other words sometimes, huh?

185
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,220
That would have been a better slice of life really for the show

186
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,580
Yeah

187
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,780
but then you could have like then they could have accidentally pulled a work of fart and then we would have been publicly shamed by

188
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,660
Every I would have been great or anything that had a joke in it. Yeah, like something you would

189
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
Justin it is hard to pull

190
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:15,260
0.5 seconds of our show that is funny in a way that anyone else would hear and be like I get why that's funny

191
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Yeah, but they didn't

192
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,540
Here we got time yes, we're getting into

193
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,460
War with grandpa territory, and I'm I actually feel pretty comfortable in those waters right now

194
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,440
Let's let's take a few passes at do like recording for the the next award

195
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,540
Nominated for like the clip that they can play that represents us

196
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,740
And here's what here's what we have to get across in it and those clips were what 10 seconds max

197
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,740
So like keep an eye on your on your doll and so we can time this out

198
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,140
Well, yeah, but I would say first criteria. We all have to put some sauce on the mix. Okay?

199
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
This is our award show clip

200
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,180
Yeah, it should be in the least bit entertaining or stimulating

201
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,460
Okay, or not just Travis talking about how you don't actually interrupt weddings

202
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,420
I'll take first pass and you guys just jump in and get a hand on the ball. Okay? Okay

203
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,820
Well, let's cut let's come into it all talking. Okay, great. Do you know what I mean?

204
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:22,260
Satisfy that criteria, so we'll go I'll go three two one and then we pick up after one. Okay

205
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,380
three two one

206
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,020
What happens when a cow loses its razor not a joke we don't actually do

207
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,460
It was a moustache and that's our representative of the show

208
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,860
And also it was shitty and that's not what we do. Okay. Okay, I think I want you Travis

209
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,620
I want you to think about what it is. We do here. Is that what you think it is?

210
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,980
Yeah, yeah, go for it

211
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,260
three two one

212
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,260
Oh

213
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,540
Justin forgot we're gonna take that again. Three two one. Welcome

214
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,260
So the marble statue was sad because he was afraid everyone took it for granted T-shirt for you what

215
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,620
Now Justin, I feel like that's not representative. We don't talk about we don't often talk about big bang theory

216
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm not gonna say we have it. I know we have have before but like the transcript like if you reached into

217
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,420
600 episodes of our show to pull a core sample the chances that you would pull out any

218
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,220
Any big bang theory in there? It's very slight. Let's okay. I know that I know what we need to do

219
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,060
Okay, okay. We need to do an episode in ten seconds. Oh, oh, that's that could be good. Yeah

220
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:55,220
No introductions or outro then there's context. Yeah. Okay, so let's workshop it. Let's it take one one quick

221
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:01,340
We got to do names. Uh-huh. We each have to do a bit sure we have to get out. Okay, that's it. Okay, great

222
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:07,420
Okay, seconds. Okay. Yeah, this is easy. This is actually easy. Okay here. Yeah. Sure. Okay, ready?

223
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,740
Three two one

224
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,500
Justin Griffin. Yeah, these nuts

225
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,820
But burgers riddle me piss. What can I said the name of a you can't say the name of it?

226
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,260
It's got to be sort of gotta be a funny chance. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay funny show. Let's try again

227
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,400
Jerson grab us. There's nuts what cow?

228
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,460
Moustache is actually Travis. That is your perfect

229
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,980
And maybe I should just laugh that's very good. Yeah, if you can sound like you're having no cheese

230
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,700
Don't you're not some straight man on the thing on them on them on the cut

231
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,920
Give us a count. Don't I know Travis? Can you I feel like maybe

232
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,300
With the way you stretch out moustache you're being a little selfish

233
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,660
We're not working with much time so maybe you could even just shorten it to like to one syllable that okay. Yeah

234
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:07,860
Yeah, let's try again. Okay, give me a count. Please Justin. Thank you. Three two one

235
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,860
Just Travis. It's me. Moustache.

236
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Oh, you said no Travis did you cut down the syllables? Yeah, Griffin said one syllable so I got it down to moustache

237
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,860
I was trying not to take too much time

238
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,860
It's got to be self-contained

239
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
But Griffin said I was taking too much time trying to make it shorter

240
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:32,820
There's three of us. There's three of us. Okay. Okay. Here's how we make it so we don't elongate the syllable Travis

241
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,820
You just say the word mustache

242
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:41,620
Okay, but I feel like then that I don't know that that's representative of my particular style of comedy, but I'll say funny

243
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:47,380
Oh, yeah, don't know but let people know that was a joke. Oh, yeah. Okay, great. Okay. Here's here's another way

244
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:53,020
We could do it. I'm gonna set a timer for three seconds on my phone. Well three point three repeating, right?

245
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,220
Well, yeah that you can't get that quite that granular with the Apple

246
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,980
Clock, but I will once I start talking I'll take my three seconds

247
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:07,140
Okay, and then when you guys hear the beep, that means it's time for the next guy. Okay, so are we gonna go Griffin Travis?

248
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:13,380
Justin we should establish that beforehand or that's timeline three two one Travis Justin

249
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:24,500
Moustache Pierce Pierce. I love the great joke Travis Justin

250
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:33,260
I don't know how to turn it off. That was it and that's great too because we don't have to record another like promo for Max

251
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,860
Fun for a while. Well, you just put that clip up. It's the whole show. That's the whole show. That's what you're gonna get

252
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,380
That's what you get. Okay, like it or not

253
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,220
Well, if you don't like it, don't you don't need to it's not required. This isn't summer reading

254
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:55,560
Uh, let's actually help isn't it fucked up now. I'm not done yet. Okay, isn't it fucked up that

255
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,820
This was a podcast awards. Uh-huh, and

256
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:08,100
They're called the I heart radio podcast awards. This is strange. Yes. This would be like if somebody was like I

257
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,940
It's this year on the I love VR

258
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,040
Pornography Tony's it's that's right is the Tony's but the name of the company is a different medium sort of all together

259
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,860
Technically our heart media. Is that what they've changed it to? No, I'm sorry

260
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:31,340
I heart media celebrates the best in podcasting during the fourth annual I heart radio podcast awards

261
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,060
So it's I heart media produce presents the I heart radio. What's not clear? What's not clear about this guys?

262
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,500
Why don't you get it and they're they're they're their podcast network. There is the I heart podcast now

263
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:48,260
Yeah, so so there's a lot you can only listen on jukeboxes and it seems cruel to the radio

264
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,860
because it's like video did kill the radio star, but then about

265
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,540
40 years later the podcast star came in with the fucking alley oop over the the rotted out casket of

266
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,140
radio star

267
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,860
And smashed down into it and got like the bones and goo on on their on their new cool podcast

268
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,180
It is a good point Griffin because it's like podcast said well video killed the radio star

269
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,740
But we can't take it on video, but you know

270
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:22,260
Radio stars is still there. We could yeah, we could act like we got a hand on the ball of killing radio star, huh?

271
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,940
Yeah, right. It seems it seems fucked up to me. At least podcast could try to take on book star. Come on

272
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,180
Okay, that seems like an easy one. They don't even tell you say that kidding me book star isn't strong, but it's wily. Oh

273
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,180
You got fine

274
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,660
Nobody's been able to whip books quite yet. No one's beating books man. They've been around long around

275
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,160
Even then podcast is like I'm gonna get you books and then books said I'm gonna have people record me and you can listen to

276
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Yeah on the thing. Yeah, fuck

277
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,920
Podcast said we're gonna whip your ass books and the book said actually I'm going to whip your ass. I'm podcast now

278
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,600
What I'm podcast now only my podcast is badass stories about wizards and space and sexual

279
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Can't beat that. No one's telling stories on podcast. We should start doing that. Oh my god you guys

280
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,640
Stories on podcast that could be good. Yeah, like use a podcast to like tell a story like you would use a book to do

281
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,560
Yeah, I like this even videos not doing that

282
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,720
What you doing juice, I'm just what just wait the show

283
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,480
Ready to fire it up. Yeah, you ready to go. Where do you think we should start?

284
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,680
I feel self-conscious talking about this because I don't think people I feel like the longer we do inside baseball

285
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,720
It gets to inside baseball and I want I don't want people to think that we actually like we're upset about this

286
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,720
I mean you always want to win

287
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,800
I'm

288
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:53,920
My both my son's trip Justin have been crying since 10 p.m

289
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,440
last night even the baby one whose brain isn't smart enough to even understand things like

290
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
award or podcast or

291
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,240
Like anything, you know what? I mean? I Griffin I'm I can I say I'm actually kind of jealous

292
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,300
That your kids are sad about it because this morning I went to play the you know

293
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,880
Rhythm of the city video that has been my daughter's favorite for three years

294
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,040
And she said no play that great clip on YouTube where they interview Woody Harrelson

295
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,840
And I said we never had Woody on our show and she said no with real daddy with Jason

296
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And it was that was really painful to me I kind of wish my kids were crying

297
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,600
I wish they were sad and said they're laughing their fucking asses off

298
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,120
It's smart loss and what sucks shit guys. Yeah, I would love to have Woody Harrelson on the show

299
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,920
But it's all used up now. Yeah the smartest guys got

300
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,000
Their stuff all over him and I don't even want to play with Woody Harrelson anymore

301
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,240
He's only gone like old cheer stories now that are half remembered and you're like wait

302
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,920
Was that on Cheers or was that on Frasier?

303
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,760
And then you're like, I don't think our audience cares about either of those Woody and he's like

304
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm gonna start telling people they have to choose they have to choose. Yeah. Well, you can't be on both

305
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,120
I'm worried about that Justin because like it's like smartless has the cool house with like the pool out back, right?

306
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,000
And we're kind of living, you know, and we're ours is more of a studio apartment right now

307
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,320
We're choosier than they are. Well, I'm just saying that I'm afraid that I'll get Woody. Yes

308
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,840
If you say you have to choose I don't think they're picking us J-Man. I also don't fucking want that

309
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:42,560
Just scuzzy used up Woody fucking Harrelson. He's gonna show up in our studio and he's gonna be wet and sweaty

310
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,280
And he's gonna be tired and he's not really gonna be in the mood to play around cuz he'll be like, oh, sorry boys

311
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,800
I just played around with the smartless boys and he's gonna be fucking tight

312
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:58,760
He wants to he'll want to take a nap fucking people. Okay, tell okay who have we a little bit like freaked out now

313
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,800
they've had some fucking you know, like

314
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:09,280
My buddy Connor made a whole podcast about trying to catch Tom Hanks in his beautiful net

315
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,640
Yeah, and they just had him they they had two weeks where they had Tom Hanks and then Jerry Sun felt like what's happening?

316
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,080
I mean sure listen at this point. We fucked up bad guys. We gotta walk this anybody

317
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:27,360
Anybody could get that combination anybody could get that common it. Oh, yeah, what's that back to?

318
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:35,480
I yeah, show me a difficult one. Thank god. They had the Canadian Prime Minister fuck really they got Trudy

319
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:45,080
Wait, it's one how many of them are Canadian is I'm pretty sure it's what's fucked up is that they don't they're like

320
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:53,560
KG they're okay. Is that wait, hold on fuck. Okay. Wait, call the I heart media people because I think

321
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,800
Here we got some Canadians on the podcast, right? And that's right. Okay, if I remember the rules correctly

322
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:08,200
Yeah, that should that's a thing right cuz it's or else they don't casting yourself would have been nominated and still would have beaten us

323
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,120
Well, what's that why I he's not the best

324
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Hey juice. Hey juice and trap. Yeah, do you guys really want to play in?

325
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,360
this space

326
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,120
with Sir Paul McCartney or Tom Hanks for that matter

327
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:29,840
Or Tom into our little space our little South Park humor space

328
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
It's not even like a

329
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,680
Pretend podcast, you know, these celebrities do like I've got eight I do eight episodes a year whether I want to or not

330
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Yeah, you know they're like they're like turning out weekly

331
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,600
Huge gets massive. Why are they doing this to us? I don't get it. What did we do?

332
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,160
Doesn't it? Why I know why I guess when they waited into the water what my took a little

333
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:02,880
Took a little everybody's least favorite bug. Everybody's least favorite bug cover the stroller in the room

334
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Feels like a step up

335
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:12,120
Can I ask you a question? I want you to look way way back in your past. Was there a time?

336
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,320
where it's possible you might have offended either Sean or will or Jason or

337
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,480
some combination of those three and they've simmered for years waiting for the opportunity to get back at you and take away from you the

338
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
One thing you love ie only this podcast

339
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
You think that okay now?

340
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,760
You have concocted a world in which our podcast is cancelled because no

341
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Concocted a world where Justin

342
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:49,440
Would be capable of doing anything that would even make the slightest

343
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,960
Impact on the line my butterfly wings for a hundred thousand years

344
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,600
It wouldn't flick a single drop of dew on the on the Sean's face, you know

345
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm just saying I could see a conversation you have with Jason Bateman

346
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,980
Maybe you don't even remember this because it was so minor for you

347
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,800
But you would say something like Jason it seems like you have everything going for you

348
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,320
And he's like, yeah, I really do and you're like, you know

349
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,360
I don't have a lot going for me, but at least I'm the best comedy podcast of the world

350
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
Haha, like a joke and then and then Jason but you just seem like then that's the one thing

351
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,440
I'm gonna take away from Justin that he has dedicated his life to just taking

352
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,640
This one thing that you had that you felt good about away from you. Is that possible? I

353
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:35,320
Think I know. Oh, what is it? It was in our it was it was early

354
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:43,040
My bim-bam days like double-digit episode airs and Justin one time said horrible bosses more like horrible movie. Oh, man

355
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
Okay. Do you remember when you said?

356
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:52,840
It's not even like it's not even all your fault because me and Travis busted up so hard we shit it now

357
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,760
I did though after that. I went out to talk about how much I enjoyed Christmas party office Christmas party. It doesn't it's too late

358
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,280
And so that Jason Bateman had that podcast delivered to him on a silver tray by his butler like he does every morning

359
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,200
With every podcast that mentions anything he's in or related to and then he listened to it

360
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,880
He said I'm so excited my three favorite brothers talking about my

361
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,080
magnum opus

362
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,240
Horrible bosses and then he listened to it and he was like, well now I'm gonna take away everything Justin loves. Oh

363
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,400
man, I'm just saying I

364
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,520
Here's all I'm saying. Yeah, as if they would take the time to record a video

Hi, I'm vice president koala Harris. Yes. I too was a guest on smartless

402
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,280
They gave me the platonic ideal of a cucumber when I got here

403
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,640
This is what every cucumber should strive to be

404
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,960
No, but imperfect is this actually it's actually really great you can it's it helps you reduce your food waste

Just stuff that's like a little different perfectly good

410
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,920

411
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,160

Great universe says if every porch up is perfect who would have hot dogs and they don't I don't know if they have either those

450
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Wrote this song about Squarespace

451
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,280
That was good, I built a website Oh hell on geo cities

452
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,440
Just like every website on geo cities

453
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,200
On a day just like every day

454
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,520
This isn't the ad anymore now, this is just the regular could have used

455
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,760
magazines

456
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
Just like every magazine

457
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,080
Think magazines are the main story editor to website. You'll forget it to make

458
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
They say website visitors

459
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,880
Have no memory what because their lives are much like mine

460
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,960
Feels like you're just taking an eye to Franco website in it and like there's some very dangerous

461
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,760
Copyright issues happening here. Yeah, it's completely different. It has nothing to do with that. I'll eat let me just pop this

462
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,480
I don't even know the one that you're yeah

463
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,800
I just want to step in here and say both to Squarespace and the people listening to this show and the I heart media

464
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,540
I heart podcast radio podcast awards ceremonies that

465
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,480
Justin was actually saying geo shitties and there's actually a parody

466
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:43,560
That was after the ad so I'm allowed to talk about whatever I want their use

467
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,120
Did your neighbor back into your car bring that case to judge Judy

468
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,620
Think the mailman might be the real father give that one to judge matters

469
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:02,540
But does your mom want you to flush her ashes down the toilet at Disney World when she passes away now?

470
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,180
That's my jurisdiction

471
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:10,260
Welcome to the court of Judge John Hodgman where the people are real disputes are real and the stakes are often

472
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:16,100
Unusual if I got arrested for dumping your ashes in the Jungle Cruise, it would be an honor

473
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,780
I don't want to be part of somebody getting a super yacht

474
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,260
I don't know at what point you want to go into this but we've had a worm bin before

475
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,460
Available free right now at maximum fun org judge

476
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,460
John Hodgman the court of last resort when your wife won't stop pretending to be a cat and knocking the clean laundry over

477
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,780
Hey kid

478
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,400
Your dad tell you about the time. He broke Stephen Dorf's nose at the kids choice awards

479
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,620
In dead pilot society scripts that were developed by studios and networks

480
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,500
But were never produced are given the table reads they deserve when I was a kid

481
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,700
I had to spend my Christmas break filming a PSA about angel dust. So yeah being a kid sucks sometimes

482
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,620
Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker dead pilot society twice a month on maximum fun

483
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,620
You know the show you like that hobo with the scarf who lives in a magic dumpster

484
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,540
Doctor who

485
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,540
Oh

486
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:25,860
Wait, oh, sorry. Hold on real quick guys BB just walked in let me what honey

487
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,380
Yeah, no, I'm still recording the podcast. Yeah. No, I'm still doing it. Even though we lost

488
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,820
Yeah, no, I can't drive you to Jason's house

489
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Probably in California probably

490
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:48,200
Well, if you love him so much, why don't you call him and come pick you up? Get out of here. Get out of here Travis

491
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
That's why she wants Jason

492
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,840
Yeah, you can't talk to your podcast joke

493
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Juice were you gonna do a much glad

494
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,040
Much huh? Wait

495
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,040
Done

496
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,640
What can much what it's a podcast within a podcast

497
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,820
Profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating. I love when the big game is coming around the bend

498
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,880
Is that coming?

499
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,440
The big game is on the way.

500
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,100
And I couldn't be more excited about the big game.

501
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,940
Who are you rooting for, Justin?

502
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,780
Me?

503
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,060
Oh, I'm not allowed to say the names of the team

504
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,900
or the sport.

505
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,540
You could just describe their mascots if you wanted to.

506
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,500
The burly tigers.

507
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,420
Oh, you like the burly tigers, huh?

508
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:52,500
So here's the thing.

509
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,800
To celebrate this, Subway, you fresh,

510
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,220
is they got some interesting sandwiches

511
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,940
created by NFL stars.

512
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,120
Now with tiger meat.

513
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,020
Yeah, you can eat tiger meat or ramen,

514
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,740
whatever you want to eat.

515
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,060
And whoever gets the most votes gets $50.

516
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,160
So they got three different autograph signature sandwiches

517
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,100
from three of the biggest names in the NFL.

518
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,900
You shouldn't eat sandwiches with ink on them.

519
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,300
Marshawn Lynch, Russell Wilson, and Trevor Lawrence.

520
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,260
Marshawn Lynch, of course, so funny in the second episode

521
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,380
of Murderville, hosted by Will Arnett.

522
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,540
You know the thing about Marshawn Lynch

523
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,180
is one time he was late to a game

524
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,020
because before every game he would eat

525
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:41,660
basically like an entire family-sized fun bag of Skittles.

526
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,100
And then it made him throw up.

527
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,700
And then he showed up a couple of minutes late in the game

528
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,020
because he was busy throwing up his Skittles.

529
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,820
Our athlete partners are some of our most

530
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,780
passionate Subway fans, says Carrie Walsh.

531
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,820
I don't know how to parse that exactly.

532
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,700
I think what she's saying is football players

533
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
fucking love these subs.

534
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,660
So it's a natural fit to create a collection

535
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,340
of their favorite sandwiches.

536
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,940
And Super Bowl Livvy is the ideal location.

537
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,900
I guess Subway's allowed to say Super Bowl Livvy

538
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,940
because they're like an official partner.

539
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,940
Fans visiting the Subway vault at the Super Bowl experience

540
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,500
will have a chance to meet Marshawn Lynch,

541
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,340
Russell Wilson, and Trevor Lawrence.

542
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,100
And instead of sports memorabilia,

543
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,340
the NFL players will sign their respective signature subs.

544
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,740
It's important to note Marshawn Lynch

545
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,540
refers to Skittles as power pellets.

546
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,660
Okay, Russell Wilson, and I'm not gonna tell you

547
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,940
what's on these sandwiches because it is native funny,

548
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,580
but Russell Wilson's is called the Danger Witch.

549
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,420
Fuck yes.

550
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,340
Trevor Lawrence's is called the Sunshine Sub.

551
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,300
Hell yeah.

552
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:57,100
And Marshawn Lynch, beef mode.

553
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:57,940
Yes!

554
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,940
It's really good, really fucking good.

555
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,300
So I was extremely excited about those NFL players

556
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,100
getting their due, you know what I mean?

557
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:12,940
Yeah.

558
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,780
Getting their thing.

559
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,380
I'm happy for them, beef mode.

560
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,620
Beef mode is really, really good.

561
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,340
Look me on the mic.

562
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,300
Okay.

563
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,140
Hello.

564
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,220
You rarely just kind of butt in like that, I think.

565
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,700
I'd like to take a turn at the podcast.

566
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,540
Okay.

567
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,340
Can't be any worse than what we do.

568
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,820
It sounds like Justin's death was pain,

569
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,980
oh yeah, by the way, Countdown,

570
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,900
did you hear we lost big time, baby?

571
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,020
What are you talking about?

572
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,340
The podcast awards.

573
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,740
The iHeartMedia, iHeartRadio, iHeartPodcast awards.

574
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,500
Smartless one.

575
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,340
Just for that, I will never appear as a guest on their show.

576
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,900
Oh, that means a lot to us.

577
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,860
Justin, of course, would be thrilled.

578
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,860
But I, Countdown, not interested.

579
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,500
We've never encountered this before,

580
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,100
but does that mean that you have some kind of access

581
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,980
to Justin's thoughts and feelings and stuff

582
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:06,900
like when you're in-

583
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,700
He leaves notes for me.

584
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,540
Oh, he does?

585
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,540
That's fun.

586
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,940
If he needs heavy lifting around the house,

587
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,500
he leaves a note asking me to do it

588
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,300
because of my incredible strength.

589
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,500
Oh, you're flexing now.

590
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,260
No, this is how I've always spoken.

591
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,580
Okay.

592
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,820
Did you, are you excited for the big game?

593
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:27,660
Yeah, man.

594
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,660
I hope it, I hope it airs after nightfall.

595
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,500
It probably won't.

596
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,460
Because if it's during the day,

597
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,260
I cannot enjoy it, you see.

598
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,460
Because the sunlight is a poison to me.

599
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,060
Yeah, dude, we know.

600
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:47,100
You owe our secrets.

601
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,540
The secrets of my people have been revealed to you,

602
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,380
it seems.

603
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,020
Listen, Countdown, we're all in a pretty Tinder place

604
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,660
right now, and we've been trying to bring our A game

605
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,780
at least since the B segment started.

606
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,300
So if you have a donut to tell us about-

607
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,820
I do, I have a donut to tell you about, of course.

608
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,740
You think I'd come here without a donut

609
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,780
to tell you about?

610
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,700
In honor of-

611
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,860
You know you could, right?

612
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,420
We like hanging out with you.

613
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,500
You don't have to.

614
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,180
You don't have to just be the donut vampire.

615
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,020
Yeah.

616
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,140
This is, it's expensive to get me here, though.

617
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,020
Yeah, it does cost Justin a year of his life every time,

618
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:23,860
so-

619
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,700
Every time.

620
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,540
Every time.

621
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:28,340
But this one's worth it, you see, think box.

622
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,700
Donuts have launched treats for the big game.

623
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,540
Okay.

624
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,780
Diehard fans and commercial critics are preparing

625
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,740
for the big game.

626
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,220
So you can show some love for the whole squad

627
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,540
with this new lineup of pink box donuts.

628
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,620
Two of them, you see, look like poops.

629
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,460
Yeah.

630
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,300
Okay.

631
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,980
I don't know why, but two of them look like poops

632
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,100
that say rubs and bingles on them.

633
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,340
Wait, intentionally, or?

634
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,980
Okay, I'm gonna need to see this.

635
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,740
I'm going to send, I'm going to use Justin's body

636
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,660
to send you an image of this in case you wish to see.

637
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,380
Yeah, we, you don't have to say-

638
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,940
Ha!

639
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,780
Yes.

640
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,620
Yeah, those are-

641
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,460
So they're poops.

642
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,580
Perhaps the idea is you get the poop,

643
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,540
if you hated the bingles, you get the poop of the bingles

644
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,820
and you say, here, bruv, here, Doug, here, fat Jerry,

645
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:27,900
here, skinny Steve, eat these delicious bingles donuts.

646
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,740
Yeah.

647
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,980
Because we hate them and they look like a poop.

648
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,500
But that's, but also I don't like,

649
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,700
that's a fun prank where you're like, I hate the bingles,

650
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,020
so I'm giving you this bingles poop donut.

651
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,260
I don't know what I'm,

652
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,260
I don't know what my reaction is supposed to,

653
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:43,100
like, I don't want to eat a poop donut.

654
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,740
Because it also doesn't look enough like poop

655
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,020
to seem offensive.

656
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,260
Or like a donut, really.

657
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,100
That's also true.

658
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,500
It doesn't look appetizing, though, it's very shy.

659
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,820
I would eat the fuck out of that.

660
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,340
Also, that one that just says,

661
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,820
I'm just here for the commercials, this-

662
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,420
Can you not spoil my whole thing?

663
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:01,460
Sorry, sorry, you go on, you can do it.

664
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,220
Oh, no, I can see why Smartless hates you so much.

665
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,540
Oh, boy, okay, they didn't hate me specifically.

666
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,340
They said, well, they hate all of you.

667
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,300
Oh, okay, wait, have you been over there?

668
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,660
I lurk outside the window.

669
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,500
You said you wouldn't do that.

670
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,940
Spending my time waiting for the moment

671
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,660
when I am invited in.

672
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:23,580
Okay, hey, hey, this doesn't have to be on the show,

673
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,620
but between you and me, like, you're a vampire, right?

674
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,980
Is Will Arnett a vampire?

675
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:29,820
What?

676
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,860
Is Will Arnett a vampire?

677
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:33,860
He's got, he gives me some of those-

678
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,140
He is a satyr.

679
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,740
A satyr?

680
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,580
A satyr.

681
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,100
See, I would've thought Sean, if any of them was a satyr.

682
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,140
No, Sean's a Kelpie, I think.

683
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,860
Sean is a Kelpie, Bateman is an earth angel.

684
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,340
I mean, you didn't need me, you didn't need to tell me that.

685
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:49,180
Yeah, you see that hair?

686
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,900
Look at the hair.

687
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:54,140
Now, I do wanna say, now that I've broached the subject

688
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,580
of the I'm just here for the commercials doughnut.

689
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,380
This is called Half Time Show.

690
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:01,180
It's the name of this doughnut.

691
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,300
White frosted raised shell topped with red lettering.

692
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,220
I'm just here for the commercials, is what it says.

693
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,860
Now, that's a lot of writing for an employee

694
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,980
of this doughnut place to have to do over and over again.

695
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,700
It is indeed, it is indeed.

696
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,140
And I would love to see how the pinmanship appears

697
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,220
in the real world.

698
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,060
Yes.

699
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,580
There's also Game Ball.

700
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,780
Chocolate frosted raised football shell

701
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,140
filled with Bavarian cream and topped with,

702
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:32,980
it says here, football decor.

703
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

704
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,860
They forgot the word for laces and they just went.

705
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,300
You know, football decor.

706
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,220
Football stuff.

707
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,020
Pink Box continues to flaunt its incredible

708
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,980
football knowledge with 50 yard line.

709
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,740
A green frosted raised bar topped with non-burials.

710
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,100
I like that one.

711
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,780
And 50 yard line the corner.

712
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,500
Now, this doughnut is precious.

713
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,060
What they've done is they've put hundreds and thousands

714
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,900
on the edges to make it look like a little crowd.

715
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,740
That is cute.

716
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,740
And they're all watching the big game.

717
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:07,580
I do like that.

718
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,900
That also seems like the one that's easiest to make

719
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,340
for the employee of this doughnut franchise.

720
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,380
Did you not see all those fucking non-burials?

721
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:15,660
But that's just dip dip.

722
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,660
They're not putting them on there with like tweezers,

723
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,500
like by hand.

724
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,020
Oh, look who's a doughnut professional now.

725
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:22,740
I mean, yeah.

726
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:27,020
They also say that guests will have the option

727
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,420
to kick off their day with a special pinky and poo

728
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,540
to rep their favorite team,

729
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,980
featuring a chocolate or vanilla cake

730
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,540
topped with deliciously themed bottle cream.

731
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,140
But then what's the poo?

732
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,220
What's, is there like a,

733
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,660
is there someone at Pink Box having a little bit

734
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,380
of dirty fun?

735
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,620
Someone at Pink Box who is having,

736
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,500
there's not a better way to put it.

737
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,580
Having a little dirty fun with us.

738
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,940
I don't know.

739
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,180
It's a fine question.

740
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,260
Hey, how often do you think Smartless talks about poop

741
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,660
on their show?

742
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,500
Probably never.

743
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,340
I don't know.

744
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,620
I mean, Woody probably did,

745
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,060
like covered them for a year.

746
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,740
But it was probably tasteful.

747
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Oh, it was probably so well done.

748
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,580
Yeah.

749
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,420
Yeah.

750
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,140
Okay.

751
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,140
I must go.

752
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,540
You may have him back now.

753
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:19,380
Thanks.

754
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,220
Okay.

755
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,300
You're used up, little brother.

756
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,140
Okay.

757
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:23,980
We should probably.

758
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,340
Hey, Juice.

759
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah.

760
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:28,020
Can you do a quick?

761
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
I'm getting used to it, which is actually scarier.

762
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah.

763
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,700
You know what I mean?

764
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,180
Maybe we should do one.

765
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:36,220
Why is there a picture of donuts on my?

766
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,900
Oh, that Count Donut was here.

767
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,500
Yeah, he killed you from inside.

768
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,660
Did he take the trash out?

769
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,500
I asked him to.

770
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,900
He did, and he lifted up something really heavy, I think.

771
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,740
Yeah, the heavy trash.

772
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:46,580
It was heavy trash.

773
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,420
Yeah, he said, I'm getting the heavy trash.

774
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,780
It was the trash can full of all my wood scraps.

775
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,700
Oh, no stakes though, right?

776
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,700
That you use your big boy garbage bags for.

777
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,820
Wouldn't that be embarrassing

778
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,420
if he was carrying a box of wood scraps

779
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,580
and it tipped over and was like, oh, not like this.

780
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,980
Yeah.

781
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:03,260
That's how we found him.

782
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,620
Hey, listen, it's not every podcast audience

783
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,340
that would hang out with their podcasting friends.

784
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,540
Wait, are we really not gonna do one question?

785
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,740
I mean, this is always the problem I have

786
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,300
with a grandpa episode,

787
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,580
is like a war with grandpa episode, excuse me,

788
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:24,580
it's like it starts to feel hollow, doesn't it?

789
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,540
I mean, it gets to the end and you're like,

790
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:31,340
it's sort of like when the worst idea of all time guys

791
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,340
were like 30 episodes in to Sexton City

792
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,180
and they wanted to quit,

793
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,180
but then they realized like you eat 30,

794
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:39,980
you watch 30 times and it's like nothing.

795
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:40,820
You know what I mean?

796
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,340
Like you do 50 minutes of non-advice

797
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,380
and then at the end you're like, oh, no, we did a question.

798
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,540
Yeah.

799
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,020
Well, yeah, I guess.

800
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,860
But I mean, I feel like we could do something else.

801
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,740
Okay, well, what are you thinking?

802
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:59,780
Hey, before we dip, can we do talk to the wizard?

803
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,620
Yeah.

804
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,540
I guess we have to break the news to him, huh?

805
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,020
Yeah, oh, hold on, he knows.

806
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,500
I can tell just by the way he's looking at me.

807
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,340
This one was saying-

808
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,020
It went a little bit of pity, you know, mixed with-

809
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,660
No, it's all disappointment.

810
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,980
He has no skin in the game.

811
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:21,980
He also provides his wisdom to the smart-less guys,

812
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,900
which I think is fucked up, but-

813
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,780
No, really?

814
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,260
He double dibs?

815
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,460
He, I mean, he does it for everyone.

816
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,540
He's a wizard that lives in the sky.

817
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:36,300
So this is how to fight like Goku, which is dope,

818
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,500
because if we do end up in a physical match

819
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,500
with some other podcast host,

820
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,140
this would be a good thing for us to be able to-

821
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:45,980
How to fight like Goku?

822
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,860
Yeah, and Goku is the famous brawler

823
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:55,180
from the Dragon Ball franchise of anime.

824
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:56,420
I've been meaning to get into that.

825
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,860
I don't know where to start.

826
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,900
Yeah, baby, now's the perfect time.

827
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,060
Everyone's got Dragon Ball fever.

828
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,900
So be a good puncher and kicker is the first one.

829
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,740
Huge.

830
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,380
This seems weirdly attainable,

831
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,620
because the next thing it says

832
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,540
is practice 100 punches per day.

833
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,380
That doesn't-

834
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,980
Wait, practice how?

835
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,980
A hundred, do a hundred punches?

836
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,940
But what if I'm practicing them wrong?

837
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,020
Well, the practice will make it better.

838
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:24,180
Do you know what I mean?

839
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:25,460
I mean, sure, but that assumes

840
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,940
that I know what I'm trying to do.

841
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,100
Be like Goku.

842
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:29,940
Oh, right there.

843
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,780
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

844
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,420
I don't know why you're being really obtuse right now,

845
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,580
because I'm trying to get us to be like Goku strong,

846
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,340
and it seems like you don't want to go beef mode.

847
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,140
Okay, so I need to practice punching like Goku.

848
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,060
Got it, got it, got it.

849
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,540
Well, but don't rush into it.

850
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,020
If you can't do 100 punches yet,

851
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,540
do baby steps and eventually work up

852
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:48,300
to 100 punches slash kicks.

853
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,220
Does it say for how long a time period

854
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,820
to do these practices, or is it just like every day?

855
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,580
No, so I guess you could life hack it

856
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:56,860
to just like do 100 punches as fast as you possibly could.

857
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,140
But I'm saying, is it like practice 100 punches every day

858
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:03,780
for two months, or is it like for the rest of my life?

859
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,140
You're saying you're gonna hit a point where like,

860
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,220
oh, okay, I'm Goku now.

861
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,260
I don't have to maintain this incredible-

862
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,460
I mean, not at the same pace.

863
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:14,300
Do you think fucking Goku wakes up every morning

864
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,860
and does 100 punches every day?

865
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:20,260
Yeah, I think he probably does, Trav.

866
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,100
He's good.

867
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:21,920
You know what?

868
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,940
This bit was a mistake.

869
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,700
You guys don't, let's end the show,

870
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:29,500
and we'll try this one again, maybe in a year or two.

871
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,900
Do you feel like we're not appreciating Goku?

872
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,500
I feel like if you guys don't know

873
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,500
how much like Goku puts into his fitness

874
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,140
and his craft-

875
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,620
Fit and nuts in his mouth.

876
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,020
Travis, can you fucking stop it for once?

877
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,820
You know what you're doing to him.

878
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,580
Fitness, these nuts in his mouth?

879
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,060
Come on, Trav.

880
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,580
What sucks, Travis, is that nuts is plural.

881
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,420
A lot of it sucks.

882
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,460
A lot of it sucks, but that nuts is plural,

883
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,380
and so you had to say fitness, these nuts in his mouth.

884
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:08,220
You couldn't say fitness, nut in his mouth,

885
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,500
and put it to one nut,

886
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,460
because we wouldn't see it,

887
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,180
and we wouldn't know which nut you were talking about.

888
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:14,980
The big one, Griffin.

889
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,660
You had to butcher even your own bad thing

890
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,020
by saying fitness, these nuts in your mouth,

891
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,660
and that sucks, man.

892
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,300
Sucks.

893
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,060
Some of us are trying to redeem ourselves

894
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:28,140
in the eyes of the iHeart podcast.

895
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,220
iHeart Media Podcast Radio TV Show Awards on YouTube.

896
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,380
They didn't even have the guts

897
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:39,300
to release the show as a podcast.

898
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,140
Come on, guys.

899
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,140
All right, I'm just gonna go,

900
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,860
I'll just, yeah, just practice it.

901
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,740
No, no, no, tell us how to fight Goku, Griff.

902
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,620
Okay, be sure to use proper form.

903
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,140
It will not tell you what that is.

904
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:51,580
When your punches get good enough,

905
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,900
add wrist weights or dumbbells,

906
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,460
but be careful they can hurt your joints.

907
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,500
Yeah, Goku would crumble under

908
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,500
the slightest amount of joint pain.

909
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,660
Then you can work out hard

910
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,700
till you do 100 push-ups, sit-ups, squats, pull-ups,

911
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:03,540
and when you get strong enough,

912
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,340
work on variations like one-arm push-up

913
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,980
or pistol squat, et cetera.

914
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,020
That's where you do a squat,

915
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,500
but you're holding two pistols

916
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,500
like a cool John Wick guy during it.

917
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:14,340
Oh, yeah.

918
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,180
Then practice handstands

919
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,220
until you're able to walk on your hands

920
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,540
for at least 10 seconds.

921
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:18,460
Whoa.

922
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:20,300
That is a wild escalation.

923
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,900
Increase your jumping power.

924
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,020
Whether it be plyometrics or jumping over a chair,

925
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,140
just strengthen that explosive power.

926
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,460
What do you think I've been trying to do?

927
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,180
I mean, yeah.

928
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,220
The problem is that jumping over a chair

929
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,460
is so fucking scary

930
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:41,540
when you're over the age of 33 years old.

931
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:42,380
That's true.

932
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,500
Because the stakes are so high.

933
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,340
You know what I do?

934
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,180
So high.

935
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,820
Small chair.

936
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,300
I guess that can be fun, yeah.

937
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,180
Spar with a friend,

938
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,580
but remember to use boxing gloves

939
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:54,060
and protective equipment.

940
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:56,740
Go all out, but play it safe.

941
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,140
Sure, I can do both those at the same time.

942
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,660
This is the tricky thing about that though,

943
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:02,180
and I've been trying to do this for years.

944
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,300
You gotta find a friend

945
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,460
who's at the exact same level of effectiveness as you are.

946
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,660
Because if you get in there and they're like,

947
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,740
well, they're almost Goku and you're barely Goku,

948
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,740
they're gonna just destroy your self-confidence.

949
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,780
But if you get in there and you're almost Goku

950
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,180
and they're barely Goku,

951
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:19,540
now you're walking around

952
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,900
with an overinflated sense of Goku.

953
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:22,740
Right.

954
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,220
Yeah, a spoonful of Goku makes.

955
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,580
Learn to block, grapple, dodge, and trap.

956
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:33,100
Practice drills with friends or homemade dummies.

957
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,940
That's cool.

958
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,900
Because it's like, that step is like,

959
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,500
learn to fight like Goku.

960
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,940
Yeah, and ask your friends

961
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,020
who probably already know how to fight like Goku.

962
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,260
Stretch five to seven days a week for 10 minutes

963
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:45,580
till you can do the splits.

964
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,420
Jesus.

965
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:48,700
It seems like a will not actually,

966
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,420
it seems like Goku could not be able to do the splits

967
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:56,020
and still achieve like 99% of his dreams.

968
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,100
Yeah, and he would probably worry

969
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,660
about hurting his Dragon Balls.

970
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,580
Come on, Travis.

971
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,220
Go ahead and say what bullshit merch we have sale.

972
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:08,540
We'll say big ups to Montaigne.

973
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,460
Big major ups to Montaigne.

974
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:11,980
And maximum fun, gotta love it.

975
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,140
Griffin, you have a final Yahoo?

976
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,060
Yeah, here it is.

977
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,220
This Yahoo was sent in by Sean Hayes

978
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,660
and it's asked by Sean Hayes who says,

979
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,420
why's your show stink and suck like shit so fucking bad?

980
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,780
Oh, this is probably really not the energy

981
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:26,620
to tell people what we're doing.

982
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,460
I'm Griffin Akeroy.

983
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,940
I'm Travis Griffin Akeroy.

984
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:30,940
We're gonna do a virtual live show.

985
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,100
No, we don't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

986
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:32,940
ba-da, ba-da, ba-da.

987
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,300
We don't get to promote our shit.

988
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,620
But it's just that like this is-

989
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:37,460
We don't deserve it.

990
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,540
This is our first time to announce

991
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,100
that we are doing a virtual live show

992
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,260
on February 26th at 9 p.m. Eastern time.

993
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:43,260
It's called Fartless.

994
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,420
It's called Fartless.

995
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:46,700
Well, no, cause that implies that we don't have farts.

996
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,540
It's called Fartmore.

997
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,780
Fartmore, there it is.

998
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,660
Tickets are $10.

999
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,420
You can get them at bit.ly slash NBNBA and virtual.

1000
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:54,740
So February 26th.

1001
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:56,380
It's gonna be better than this.

1002
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,380
I already did the fine.

1003
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,220
I already did the fine, y'all.

1004
00:59:58,220 --> 00:59:59,060
We got merch too.

1005
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,980
We have merch at mcordymerch.com.

1006
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,900
I mean, that's it.

1007
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,980
We had a good run and-

1008
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,820
Oh, wait, sorry.

1009
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,740
Hold on, I'm getting a call.

1010
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,260
Sean?

1011
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,100
Oh, hey buddy.

1012
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,500
Haven't talked to him forever.

1013
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:12,460
Nobody saw this, can we?

1014
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:13,300
Oh, what?

1015
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,700
You're sorry?

1016
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,060
You're sorry about everything?

1017
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:20,260
You don't like us taking, you taking all of our shine away?

1018
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:24,300
You're gonna give us the award and a thousand dollars each?

1019
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,140
I think this is another one of our-

1020
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:26,980
You're crying.

1021
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:27,820
That could really get me out.

1022
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,300
That could really get me out of some dance.

1023
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,100
Wait, fuck, you murdered Jason Bateman?

1024
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,900
I shouldn't talk about this on the show?

1025
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,260
No, I don't like this energy either.

1026
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,980
It wasn't really Sean Hayes, Justin.

1027
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,540
It was Will Arnett pretending to be Sean Hayes.

1028
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,380
He's a fucking bastard.

1029
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,220
And he got me.

1030
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:46,040
He got me.

1031
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,880
He's the king.

1032
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,700
He built a Sean Hayes out of Legos

1033
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,820
and then he flew the voice.

1034
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,220
It was a FaceTime call and I could not tell the difference.

1035
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,460
Normally when people say,

1036
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,780
where should I start with my brother?

1037
01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:57,260
My brother and me, I tell them, just hop on wherever.

1038
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:00,700
But I think from now on that should be hop on wherever,

1039
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,660
asterisk, not the one where they complain about smart lists.

1040
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,380
It's weird to have a lost episode-

1041
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,040
While they thinly veil their desire to be acknowledged

1042
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,860
by any of the three hosts as long as they're

1043
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:10,700
in any way, shape, or form.

1044
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,260
It's weird to have a lost episode that appears in your feed

1045
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,660
and is easily findable by the audience.

1046
01:01:16,660 --> 01:01:18,580
This episode will be called smart list.

1047
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,900
Like I know it was just called smart list.

1048
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,460
So maybe at least maybe some SEO, you know what I mean?

1049
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,060
We'll take away one S and just call it smartles.

1050
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:28,300
This show, this episode whipped ass.

1051
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,700
I busted my gut the whole fucking time through and so-

1052
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,540
Yeah, I was loving it.

1053
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:32,380
Bada bada bada.

1054
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:33,740
Man, I'm glad.

1055
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,100
You gotta keep it fresh.

1056
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,620
We say that in our podcasting book,

1057
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,940
which I don't know why we were even alive to write it.

1058
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,500
And you gotta eat fresh, Subway ad read.

1059
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,820
We ended the episode a while ago.

1060
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:44,660
I think so.

1061
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,820
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, this is,

1062
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:51,820
welcome to our my brother, my brother, me post-show fan cast.

1063
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,000
My brother, my brother, and you.

1064
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,700
Oh, that's good, Trav, actually, that's actually good.

1065
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,940
Deuces, that's our new sign off.

1066
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,820
Deuces. Deuces.

1067
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,060
Deuces. Who cares?

1068
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,780
Thief mode, who cares?

1069
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,940
My name's Travis McRoy.

1070
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,020
I'm not doing, I already said it.

1071
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,460
This has been my brother, my brother, me,

1072
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,220
kiss your dad, squirt out the lips.

1073
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,180
Thief mode.

1074
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,180
It's better with you.

1075
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:28,580
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

1076
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,540
My life, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

1077
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:39,540
This is true, oh, it's better, it's better with you.

1078
01:02:39,540 --> 01:03:06,540
My life, oh, it's better with you.
