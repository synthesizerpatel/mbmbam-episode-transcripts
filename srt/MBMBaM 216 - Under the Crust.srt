1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:55,520
Are you ready for some podcast about fantasy football? My name is Justin McElroy,

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,680
and I got Travis and Griffin, and we're ready to get some football.

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,600
Make sure the laces are out like in Ace Ventura, because it's time to talk some fantasy.

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,360
That's your touchstone? That's your athletic touchstone?

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,000
It's amazing that we got Miranda Lambert to write that song for us.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
I know.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,480
Fantasy football time is here again.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,760
The greatest time of the year.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
All your Sunday night buddies are back.

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,800
Randy Moss.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Brad Pennington.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,520
Johnny United.

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:23,920
Perry.

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,080
Sergeant Slaughter.

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,040
The Orc one from Mutant Football League.

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,160
How does everybody like their fantasy chances this year?

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,120
We are again in our dad's league, protective cup of soup.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:44,320
My team, Touchdown to Nabi, is back again with the Archer Countess leading the team to victory.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,200
My team, the Flying Moranite, we got the second place last year, and I feel pretty good.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,440
I feel pretty good about my chances, if everybody doesn't blow it.

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:03,840
I mean, I won last year's league with my team, Gridiron and Wine, a replacement name for the

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,880
Mario Lopez dispenser, because I wanted some football in there.

27
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,440
But how do I feel about my chances? Poor, very poor.

28
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,160
I did a great draft, but I mean, I don't think God's gonna let me win this one twice,

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,720
you know what I mean?

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
He's very malevolent.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
He's a vengeful football god.

32
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,920
I'm in three leagues this year.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,760
It's far too many.

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,120
Did you start a league, Griffin?

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,280
Travis, are you the commish on a league?

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,360
I am the half-assed league, because I started the league and then forgot to get any players.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,000
So I filled a 12-person league in one day.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,640
So tell me this, because you told me the contents, the constituent makeup of this league,

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,880
and it sounded to me like you kind of just wanted to win a fantasy football league,

40
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,560
and so you got a bunch of people together who didn't know what the fuck they were doing.

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,120
It literally could not be a more random assortment of humans,

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,400
and if you just like threw a water balloon into a DMV line,

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,240
and whoever got doused was on your team.

44
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,040
I would say that there's a healthy number.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,640
What I tried to get was a balance of people who knew a lot about football

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,320
and had played fantasy football before.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,840
Like Lin-Manuel Miranda.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,320
Well, and people who didn't, but were excited to try it out,

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,280
and I wanted to give them a safe environment in which to try their first round of fantasy football.

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,960
Did you Buffalo Lin-Manuel Miranda into your fantasy football?

51
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,200
He was the first one to sign up.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,880
He was so excited about it.

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
He's an excitable dude.

54
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,720
I just don't want you to bully him.

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,440
I think what it is is he's got the Emmy.

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,520
He's got the Emmy, he's got the Tony.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,000
Now he needs whatever bullshit trophy I buy at a thrift store.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
He's got a Grammy too, dog.

59
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,560
And a Grammy, yeah.

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,880
He just needs that fantasy football trophy.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,840
That's the one.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,120
That's the one acclaim that has escaped him.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,480
He's trying to get an e-golf.

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,660
Yep.

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
This could be his year.

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
Maybe finally he can accomplish something and make his family proud.

67
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,360
Yeah, finally.

68
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,200
So fantasy football is here.

69
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,880
We're going to be taking your calls throughout the show, asking for our advice on which players

70
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,400
to start, which players to stop.

71
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Which players had a happy week, which players are feeling a little blue, which players are

72
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,560
cat people, which ones are dog people.

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,720
And which ones have flubber.

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,220
Yep.

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,960
They are cracking down on flubber really hard.

76
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Really?

77
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,680
That's why Josh Gordon was out.

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
It's head to head tackles.

80
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,640
They're looking out for concussions.

81
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:46,480
They're looking out for wife beating, of course, and also flubber in that order.

82
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,280
That's the order of importance to the ESPN.

83
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,720
The ESPN, the NFL.

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Sorry, the ESPN?

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Is that the league that is the governing body?

86
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
The Extrasensory Perception Network.

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,240
Let's move on.

88
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,680
They can feel the flubber.

89
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
Let's go ahead and move on.

90
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
My friend, who is now also my boss, swears a lot at work.

91
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
While it's never directed at his employees specifically, it's usually in ways that feel

92
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,360
overreactive and out of the blue for work conversation.

93
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,520
It's generally shocking and uncomfortable for me and I sense my fellow employees as well.

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,360
I strongly compartmentalize work in free time and swearing doesn't usually bother me more

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
in casual situations.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,600
Do I tell him it bothers me since he's my friend or do I suck it up and deal with it

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,560
because he's my boss?

98
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
And do I bring it up on or off the clock?

99
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
God, all these are so good.

100
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
In Chicago, that's a great question.

101
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
Is it good?

102
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,960
Here's my question.

103
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,240
Because I've had this personal debate for a while now.

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,320
I feel like, listen, I'm totally down with cursing.

105
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,280
I do it a lot.

106
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
But there's something about, there's certain environments where it's so grating to me.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,560
Like if I'm out to eat with friends and someone's telling a story and cussing a bunch, that

108
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,600
doesn't bother me.

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,960
Oh, no, that does.

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,200
But if I'm in a bar, it doesn't.

111
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,560
So the environmental nature of it really changes.

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
But if we got it, there's so many layers here.

113
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,240
Because if you're talking about a cuss, this person's doing a cuss in a workplace, a cuss

114
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
in a workplace environment, right?

115
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
There's a lot of different ways that that can be interpreted.

116
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,920
For instance, if he gets back his company's financial report and they had a bad, they

117
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,520
underperformed in the fourth quarter, much like the Green Bay Packers did in their Thursday

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,320
night season opener.

119
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,660
Thank you.

120
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,040
If that happens and my boss goes shit, then that's fine.

121
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,040
But if he is just walking down the hallway and is trying to goof around with Jerry in

122
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,800
accounting and goes, hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog, then that is insufficient.

123
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
Okay, so let me draw a line in the middle of those two.

124
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,480
What if it's like, you know, the 12 o'clock lunch hour, everybody's eating, he microwaves

125
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,800
his thing, and he's like, oh, these leftovers taste like shit.

126
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
Right?

127
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,280
Go fuck a dog, Jerry.

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,920
Come on, man.

130
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,760
You really fucked the dog already, buddy.

131
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
Jerry, you're two months late with this report.

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,400
Really fuck the dog.

133
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
Are we gonna fuck this dog or what, Jerry?

134
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,600
Like, if you're like, hey, Jerry, stop being such a dick, if you're just clowning around,

135
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,880
that's like, that's okay.

136
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,040
But if you're like, hey, Jerry, I'd like to squeeze your dick after a nice dinner and

137
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,440
some cocktails, then that's something that's gonna be out of line.

138
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,120
Maybe we can get a dog in the mix, too.

139
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,800
Just saying.

140
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Ah, Jerry.

141
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,320
All right, see you at the retreat.

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,440
I mean, it's weird now that I have a kid.

143
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,400
It's been, like, stopping cursing has been sort of like how I imagine a lot of people

144
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,960
stop smoking.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,040
They keep moving back the drop dead red line, at which point there can be no more.

146
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,680
I mean, I am at a point right now where I'm still swearing, but I know that the, you know,

147
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
she's too little to know what I'm doing, so that's fine.

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
But I don't know that I'm gonna be able to make the transition to not.

149
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
I think I'm just gonna have to work really hard to see the difference.

150
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
You gotta phase words out, right?

151
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,240
Yeah, exactly.

152
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
Justin, real talk.

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Look at that sweet baby's face.

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,440
At what point are you going to allow her to use curse words in your home?

155
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,040
Oh, she can do that.

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,480
I am completely 100% morally unfazed by cursing.

157
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,120
She can curse on me.

158
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,360
You say that now, but you get that child in a preschool or school environment.

159
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
See, now this is what you're talking about, Griffin.

160
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't care if she curses at home.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,600
I do care if she curses at work when she goes to work.

162
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,720
I need her.

163
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
Hey, Jerry, go fuck a dog.

164
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,960
You old dog fucker, you, Jerry.

165
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,480
I can't have her making me look like a bad parent in front of the other moms and dads.

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
To answer the question, I-

167
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,240
That's what we've been doing for five minutes now.

168
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
But I want to say to say something.

169
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay.

170
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,960
But I know that I in real life wouldn't.

171
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,640
Mm-mm.

172
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
Like I'd feel that need, it would be a little grating.

173
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
But I also feel like maybe it's the kind of thing that over time, give it a couple months

174
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,160
and that just because it just fades into the background.

175
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,360
This is another weird quirk of the old office.

176
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,760
Unless you work at like a hospital or something.

177
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,160
Well, then the problem is going to take care of itself.

178
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,400
Go fuck a dog.

179
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:30,880
I am-

180
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,000
Is that a prescription?

181
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,040
Yes.

182
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
What if you were to start off-

183
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,800
Okay, what if you eased into it with like jokes?

184
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,680
Like you start-

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,320
Like this is a pretty classic McElroy technique.

186
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,320
You're seriously concerned about it, but you'll joke about it.

187
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520
Kidding on the square.

188
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,480
Are you talking about-

189
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,520
You know, we didn't invent passive aggressive behavior.

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,520
No, we didn't invent passive aggressive joking though.

191
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,120
I think passive aggressive, like it's not passive aggressive.

192
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,760
It's passive.

193
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,600
It's like comical aggressive.

194
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
Like you're easing it, like listen to you Mr. Sailor

195
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,640
with that salty tongue.

196
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,480
You start there and then you say that every time

197
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,320
and eventually you're going to get in his head.

198
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,440
Like, are you serious?

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,960
Are you being serious with these right now?

200
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,560
And then it's like, well, do you care?

201
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
Are you opening the door to the serious conversation?

202
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,400
That I've joked my way into?

203
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Let me throw out another manipulation.

204
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,120
You do passive aggressive roundabout complaints

205
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,320
when you guys are out for drinks like,

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,560
man, have you noticed how much people curse around the office?

207
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,360
Yeah, don't make it about him.

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,560
You just say like in general, people use a lot of foul language there.

209
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
It's kind of upsetting, right?

210
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
In a workplace, I just don't think that's appropriate.

211
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
Yeah, convince him to make a new rule about cursing.

212
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,960
Or you get him to institute an actual swear jar.

213
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,440
His idea, you didn't have to do shit.

214
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,480
And let's go down another strata

215
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
in the passive aggressive dungeon that we're burying ourselves in.

216
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
Just write down on a piece of paper,

217
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,880
boy, people at this office sure do swear a lot.

218
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
And then you put that in an envelope

219
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,760
and you bury it in the yard.

220
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
I think that's more passive than aggressive.

221
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,280
I think that that's just passive.

222
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,040
Sure, but if anyone finds that, oh boy, critical hit.

223
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Well, that's why you can't bury it in your own yard.

224
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,840
No, no, no, no, no.

225
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,800
You bury it in the office yard.

226
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,040
Please.

228
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,640
This Yahoo was sent in by Charles Greenman, or perhaps Greenman.

229
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
Nah, Greenman.

230
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,200
Thanks, Charles.

231
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jocelyn, who asks,

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,800
can I quicken the braces process?

233
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,680
I heard somebody tell me that her daughter had braces,

234
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,320
but she did the extreme tightening method.

235
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,920
I've never heard of that before,

236
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,280
but is it possible to get your braces extremely tightens

237
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,040
so that you can quicken the process?

238
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
Well, let me start off by saying,

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,320
I love when the name of any process

240
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,920
tells you everything you need to know about the process.

241
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,640
What do you think is involved in the extreme tightening process?

242
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,600
That's pretty clear.

243
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
I know that bringing up this question was kind of a risk

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,160
because it's sort of a sticking point between the three of us.

245
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,520
Why is that?

246
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Oh, because our smiles are perfect?

247
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,760
Well, no, your immeasurable jealousy

248
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
that I got corrective teeth framing.

249
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,640
Griffin, you went with the normal average kind of wuss tightening system.

250
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,680
It felt like it was a little bit of a stretch.

251
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,360
It felt pretty motherfucking extreme to me.

252
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,360
The scale of one to 10, in which one is like butterfly kisses

253
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,200
and 10 is like getting stabbed in the eyeballs with a blunt hot knife.

254
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,960
Using the doctor face scale of pain,

255
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,280
I was full blown Dawson's Creek season two finale.

256
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,160
Gotcha.

257
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,760
I was like that.

258
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,160
You were Frankenstein's monster in pain.

259
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,280
I was Intervention Dad Psycho Cry.

260
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,920
It was very, very bad.

261
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,600
But I mean, like, can we Emerald Kick this up a notch though?

262
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,640
It took me two years to get through braces.

263
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:21,200
And I guess if they had just like fucking tore the lever off,

264
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,840
you know what I mean?

265
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
Then they could have really juiced that process up

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
and gotten it done in, I don't know, three months.

267
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,200
I feel like the orthodontist would always have to lead off with,

268
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
there's like a 90% chance this just like powders your jaw.

269
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,240
Yeah.

270
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
But there's a 10% chance you're done in a week.

271
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,520
I want my teeth to move so fast I can hear them,

272
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,960
is what I hear the sound that they make when they move through my head.

273
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,520
And it's screaming.

274
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
That's the worry, right?

275
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,320
That you'll do the tightening so well that you'll take them off

276
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,320
and the momentum will still be pulling them together.

277
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,960
All of a sudden you wake up, you got one giant fat tooth.

278
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,360
Or they line up front to back.

279
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,600
You just have two straight vertical rows of teeth.

280
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,200
What do you want for dinner tonight, Justin?

281
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
Well, corn.

282
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,880
Corn only, I guess.

283
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,040
Only corn, only corn ever.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,080
I don't know why our parents got like less tolerant of imperfection

285
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,200
because I clearly like, I have like a full like Michael Strahan gap.

286
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,640
Well, Letterman was real popular.

287
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,840
There were no concessions made to correct that.

288
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,720
I think that they could see you in like a late night comedy.

289
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,960
I think that was their hope.

290
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,320
I've got like a bit of an underbite and I think they're just like,

291
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,560
well, that's the least weird thing about his face.

292
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,440
So we're cool.

293
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,400
We're good.

294
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,880
Is that it?

295
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,400
They knew I was going to be overweight.

296
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,080
Let's get our priorities in order.

297
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,520
But do you take your medicine super fast and have it hurt?

298
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,640
Or do you make it more tolerable and stretch it?

299
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Because you guys don't understand.

300
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,600
For two years, I was an unfuckable claptrap.

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,120
How old were you?

302
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:07,360
Yeah.

303
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,040
Well, okay.

304
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,160
For more reasons than one.

305
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
But that was it.

306
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,640
It was a major contributor.

307
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,160
If you were to take a survey, if we were to do a family feud style survey of the women.

308
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
Why aren't you fucking Griffin?

309
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,640
Come back middle school because his braces survey says being 55 braces.

310
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,600
But here's the question.

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,080
The question is, what's the trade off?

312
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,960
Is it like, it's going to hurt 50% more and you get them off one week sooner?

313
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,040
Or is it like, it's going to hurt 20% more and you only have to wear them for six months?

314
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm saying we can- There's a certain balance.

315
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,840
There's no limit to how fucking crazy you can get with the jacking.

316
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,360
Just jacking.

317
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,640
Limitless tightening.

318
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,480
You just put a chain around it and a stick and you just have someone stand in front of you

319
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
and twist that chain.

320
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
That's basically what braces are, Travis.

321
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,480
Ow.

322
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:56,720
Yeah.

323
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,360
Count your blessings, brother.

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,520
I just recently decided to head back to school in the hopes of improving my job outlook.

325
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,880
A problem that most students have had to deal with has come back to haunt me.

326
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,120
There's a student in the class who insists on making comments constantly.

327
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,160
He has some experience with the coursework, probably from related classes,

328
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
and constantly makes comments to show how much he knows and get ahead of the professor.

329
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,200
Most people probably just deal with this and I had in almost every class I've taken,

330
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,720
but I really hate this guy and all guys or gals like him.

331
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,840
How do I get him to shut the fuck up so I could just enjoy my class?

332
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,720
That's for most annoyed in the Mountain West.

333
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,800
It sounds to me like you got a minkus on your hands.

334
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
A real minkus.

335
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,640
A real grade A minkus.

336
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,720
Have we talked about dealing with a minkus before?

337
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:47,840
No.

338
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,920
We've talked about minkus a lot, but not how to deal with a minkus.

339
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,040
Not preventative minkus measures.

340
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,720
How to attract and catch a minkus.

341
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,240
Proper minkus care and raising.

342
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,520
How to raise one from egg to hatchling.

343
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,840
About his second level and third level evolution.

344
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,800
Guys, my minkus has been in heat lately and there is like nothing I can do.

345
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,720
It's just like fucking humping the window.

346
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,800
You get that minkus, wait till he gets on a good tear, okay?

347
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,760
Wait till he's like really, you know, all right, here are some things to know about details.

348
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,200
You wait till he's like really going.

349
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
Then what you do is you take the meaty part of your hand,

350
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,040
you're gonna put it on the side of your mouth just like this.

351
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,320
And then you're gonna press the palm in front of your mouth and then you're gonna blow.

352
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,880
If that, that would be probably the best thing that has ever happened in this class.

353
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,000
The teacher's gonna be like A+, and he's gonna give you a sticker or something.

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,160
That minkus is gonna get the picture.

355
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Um, I mean that you gotta, you, collusion with the teacher is necessary for this situation.

356
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
If you're gonna put this fucking minkus in his place,

357
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,800
then you're gonna need to talk to the teacher and get the teacher to

358
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,040
to ask minkus something that he could not possibly know about.

359
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,320
Like a logical fallacy?

360
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I'm not saying, no, I'm not, no.

361
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,040
I'm not saying like ask him if God could make a rock so big that he couldn't move it.

362
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,800
Cause maybe he's a robot.

363
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
More important, I think he's just a nerd.

364
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,760
But no, you know what?

365
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm turning the corner on this whole question.

366
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:19,920
So what?

367
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,440
So what?

368
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,520
Maybe that's what this person needs to, to excel educationally.

369
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,120
I'm gonna, I'm gonna counterpoint because when I went back to school

370
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
and took some psychology classes in one of my classes,

371
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
there was just, it was the abnormal psychology.

372
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
So every time we talked about any kind of different condition or disease,

373
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
there was someone in the class and it varied.

374
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,320
It was always different.

375
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,240
Who felt the need to throw out some kind of germane or non-germane fact.

376
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,080
Like my aunt had postpartum depression.

377
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,280
Germane Dupree, Germane Dupree had postpartum depression.

378
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,480
They did and like we were all adults, we were all 18 or older.

379
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
And it was the most frustrating thing because if you're there to learn,

380
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,920
if you're going back to school to better yourself,

381
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,960
and this is not like I'm an 18 year old who's in school

382
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,320
because I feel like I have to,

383
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,800
but rather a 25 year old who now appreciated how important school is.

384
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,040
It's so frustrating when suddenly you want to learn

385
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,760
and everyone in class is stopping you from doing it.

386
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
It's like, I'm actually paying to be here and I care about this.

387
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,520
And you guys want to talk about how this relates to you specifically.

388
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
And that's like the worst.

389
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,480
Alternative method.

390
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,000
If you just wait until like season four, he'll just disappear.

391
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,960
That is correct.

392
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,400
But you'll also lose Mr. Turner.

393
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,920
You'll lose Mr. Turner and that's rough

394
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,320
because I think he brought a certain something to the show.

395
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,000
I mean, your class, your life.

396
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,840
He was a sensitive bad boy.

397
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,480
He was, he rode a motorcycle and he took care of Sean Hunter.

398
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,600
How about a Yahoo?

399
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,160
Anything.

400
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,720
This is Yahoo sent by John Severs or Severs.

401
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,520
Is a Johnson too much to ask for?

402
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
For one of these last names.

403
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,880
A Thompson.

404
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,320
Thank you, John.

405
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,200
Severs, Severs.

406
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

407
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,920
Meow.

408
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,240
Meow.

409
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Fucking shit.

410
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:08,960
Meow.

411
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,800
It's Tia.

412
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,920
Who asks, good answer to the question.

413
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Why do you want to work for Chipotle?

414
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,640
I am beyond stuck.

415
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
I have been searching for a job for a year now

416
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,720
and I really want to stand out to Chipotle.

417
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
What would be a good answer to this question?

418
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,560
Okay, you're gonna ask me the question.

419
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,520
Why do you want to work for Chipotle?

420
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,120
So I can afford to buy weed.

421
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,280
Yeah, I mean, and also have a pretty good place

422
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,560
to know people who will sell me weed probably.

423
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,760
I don't want to throw stones.

424
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,040
And then I've got stuff to eat when I'm doing weed

425
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,800
because Chipotle's okay.

426
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
Arguably the best stuff to eat.

427
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,360
God, I could.

428
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,000
I could crush some Chipotle right now.

429
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,600
What time is it there?

430
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,520
Chipotle time.

431
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,480
No, what time is it actually on the Gregorian clock?

432
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,680
It's 10, 24 a.m.

433
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,920
But Jocelyn's been up for eight hours.

434
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,680
So he's at dinner time.

435
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,600
He's like, these prescriptive definitions of what time means.

436
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,160
They don't mean anything to me or my baby,

437
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
but specifically my baby.

438
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,520
Or I can eat, it's the one good thing about being a dad

439
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,840
is that I can eat Chipotle whenever I want.

440
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,120
That's the one good thing about being a dad.

441
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,440
Chipotle around the clock.

442
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,080
What is a good answer to the question,

443
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
why do you want to work for Chipotle?

444
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,840
I mean, that's, I feel like we can extend this to-

445
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,600
All the clothes I own smell too good.

446
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,400
We can extend this to anything, right?

447
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,680
Because I remember doing a job interview

448
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,240
at the country's best yogurt.

449
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,200
And they were asking me like,

450
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,440
what is it about the country's best yogurt brand

451
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,320
that really attracted you to try and fill this position?

452
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,520
And I was like, guys, you really want to answer to that?

453
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,480
Oh boy, I love it.

454
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
Because it's only a block and a half away.

455
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,640
It's super close to my house and like,

456
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,840
fuck ice cream, right?

457
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
Too hard for me.

458
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,040
I just love the smell of rotten milk.

459
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,400
I had to deal with that when I interviewed at Jimmy John's.

460
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,680
It was a very like, what's your passion?

461
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,840
Why are you so serious about sandwiches?

462
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,400
What does it mean?

463
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
What does Jimmy John's mean to you?

464
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,360
I had to do three interviews

465
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
and take a test on the goddamn sandwiches.

466
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,240
What can you tell me about the sandwich test?

467
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,200
How fucking hard can it-

468
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,840
They would give me a blank piece of paper

469
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
and without looking, I had to write down

470
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,480
the name of each sandwich, what came on each sandwich,

471
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,640
what came on the skinny versions of the sandwich

472
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,960
and what came on like the Big Buford sandwich.

473
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,280
Or whatever their like huge sandwich is.

474
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,120
Travis, how much of this knowledge

475
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,880
would you say you still retain?

476
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,040
I would say, Justin, that about 10 minutes

477
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,440
after I filled out the paper, I forgot all of it.

478
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah.

479
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,400
Okay.

480
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I never made a single sandwich in my two months at Jimmy John's.

481
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
Well, okay, Mr. Big Shot.

482
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,120
Let's see if that's true.

483
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,400
Justin, you are so good at gamifying this podcast.

484
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,960
I'm gonna name some Jimmy John's sandwiches.

485
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
Travis, you are gonna tell me,

486
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,200
not joking now, I don't want any fucking jokes.

487
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
I will try to be serious.

488
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I want you to tell me what comes on them.

489
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,520
Are you ready?

490
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:19,760
Yes.

491
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,640
Okay.

492
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,200
Turkey Tom.

493
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,480
I know that that was a turkey.

494
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,160
Okay, good.

495
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,320
And I think there's like tomatoes and lettuce.

496
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,200
Mayonnaise?

497
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,160
That's all I got.

498
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,000
That's exactly what's on the Turkey Tom, Travis.

499
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,560
Travis, see?

500
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,680
There's nothing else fucking-

501
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,520
I'm sorry, there's no cheese?

502
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,320
No, cheese is like fucking two and a half dollars extra,

503
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,920
if you want any cheese on a sandwich.

504
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,360
That's the Turkey Tom, Travis.

505
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
It's time to get a little more challenging.

506
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay.

507
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,960
Why don't you tell me what's on the Vito?

508
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
I know that the Vito has,

509
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,360
I want to say capicola, provolone, Italian dressing.

510
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,640
That's all I can remember.

511
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,200
I think-

512
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,160
That's pretty good.

513
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,640
It's got lettuce on it, doesn't it?

514
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,240
Salami, provolone, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato, and Italian vinaigrette.

515
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,200
You left a lot of stuff off that James Johnson sandwich.

516
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,920
If you delivered that to my door, Travis,

517
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,400
I would tell you, shove this up your ass.

518
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Go fuck a dog.

519
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,560
That was my primary job at the Jimmy John's, the delivery driver.

520
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,040
And the people you deliver Jimmy John's to on a Wednesday afternoon

521
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,800
are some of the best people.

522
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
Yeah, it's real salt of the earth, real America.

523
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,400
Real top notch.

524
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
Travis, this bit's pretty funny,

525
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,440
so I want to keep it going with one last question.

526
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:31,940
Okay.

527
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
The JJ Gargantuan.

528
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,240
Oh, fuck.

529
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,000
That's everything in the store, plus a cookie and maybe a lemonade.

530
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,120
You put a cookie on it?

531
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,640
And then you dunk it in a lemonade,

532
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,280
and then you deliver it to them in the lemonade cup.

533
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,720
And you just kind of throw it at them,

534
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,560
and they catch as much as they can in their mouth.

535
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,240
Drink this detritus slurry, you fuck up.

536
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,760
Enjoy, you filthy animal.

537
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
And then you thank them for coming to Jimmy Johnson

538
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,400
and give them some free spells.

539
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,480
I'm more curious to hear what you said to convince them

540
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
that you fostered a true and intimate love

541
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
of the James Johnson brand that made him give you employ.

542
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,800
I cannot remember, but what I can tell you

543
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,840
is after two months, never making a single sandwich,

544
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
because every time it came time to make a sandwich,

545
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,440
they'd say like, maybe the Huntsman or whatever it's called.

546
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
And I would go to make it and say,

547
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,520
I don't know how to make this.

548
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
And they'd be like, just get on register.

549
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,520
We'll teach you later.

550
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,240
And they never did.

551
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,160
After two months, the day before I was going to quit,

552
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,280
they offered me an assistant manager position.

553
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,240
How long would you have to keep up this fucking ruse

554
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
that like, you would at some point

555
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
have to train people how to make sandwiches?

556
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,240
Oh, that's good.

557
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,600
Where's the peanut butter, Steve?

558
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,600
We don't do peanut butter sandwiches?

559
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,080
Just layer it on, just give it a good slather.

560
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,840
I don't know, cucumbers?

561
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,160
Fuck, fuck it.

562
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,400
No, I mean, that's why they wanted to elevate you, Travis,

563
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,080
is because they realized that you weren't,

564
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,960
you were meant for something more than the grunt work.

565
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,360
Yeah.

566
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,840
Look at him.

567
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,720
He's a guy.

568
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,600
He's an officer.

569
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,960
He's no enlisted man.

570
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,720
Make that sandwich.

571
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,960
Are you fucking kidding me?

572
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
I should be running this place.

573
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,800
I'm not.

574
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,560
I'm wearing the vest now.

575
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
It's about the sandwiches he doesn't make.

576
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,320
He knows the forbidden sandwiches, the dark veto.

577
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
I will say this, they were very impressed

578
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,160
that when I was doing the register,

579
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,000
I could do math in my head.

580
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Yeah.

581
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,520
That was very impressive to everyone I worked with,

582
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
that I could tell someone how much change they got

583
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
without looking at the screen.

584
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,960
It's because you had so much unoccupied RAM up there

585
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
from not memorizing how to do anything else for the job.

586
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,520
That is correct.

587
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,480
I also didn't know where anything else was in the city.

588
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,400
So when I tried to, because it was in Norman,

589
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,320
so when I tried to deliver sandwiches,

590
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
it would usually take me 20 minutes longer than anyone else.

591
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
He's just not fit for that base level stuff.

592
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
We have to raise him up.

593
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,240
It is very much like when you see in movies and TV shows

594
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,160
those kids where it's like, well,

595
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,400
maybe he's underperforming because he's not

596
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,600
challenged enough.

597
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,640
He's been managing this store for two months now,

598
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,480
and he's done a fucking terrible job.

599
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,280
We got to keep bumping him up the ladder

600
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,800
until we find something that energizes him.

601
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,440
They offered me the role of Jimmy John, and I turned it down.

602
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,560
You're the new Jimmy John.

603
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,920
You are doing terrible at that, Mr. President.

604
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,080
Have you guys seen The Giver?

605
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,440
It's kind of like that.

606
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,280
That's how one becomes Jimmy John.

607
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,520
He has to pass off all of his free smells to you.

608
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,440
Let's get the money.

609
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,240
I'm tired of my shitty underwear.

610
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,080
You need to wash it.

611
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,920
You shouldn't be wearing those.

612
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,920
Crappy.

613
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,080
No.

614
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Poopy diapers.

615
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,600
Shit filled.

616
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,480
I think that one of the transitions

617
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,400
from childhood to adulthood is when you buy yourself

618
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,280
some really good underpants.

619
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,280
There's something about like, you know,

620
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,280
everybody's got their favorite pairs of underpants,

621
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,200
and then they've got their off-court buddies.

622
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,680
It is a defining moment when the number one factor

623
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,600
for which underwear you're going to buy

624
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
is how many come in the pack.

625
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,400
And if you're ready to move on up,

626
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
we would like to suggest MeUndies.

627
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,760
We've talked about glasses.

628
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,040
We've talked about razors.

629
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
You can buy Justin McElroy's underwear.

630
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,040
Lightly, lightly used.

631
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,000
And signed.

632
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,640
Thoroughly cleansed.

633
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,920
Dustin Gaffard's.

634
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,640
Oh, Jesus.

635
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,320
MeUndies.

636
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,360
Yeah, they're all new.

637
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,080
MeUndies guarantees the underwear not pre-worn.

638
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,280
They're going to be the most comfortable underwear

639
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,240
you've ever tried on.

640
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
That's what we are told.

641
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,240
And they fit.

642
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,120
They don't ride up.

643
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,040
And they pull, listen to this.

644
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,320
They pull moisture away from your skin

645
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,800
and keep you cool all day long.

646
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,280
Now don't get scared,

647
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,040
because it's not going to pull all the moisture

648
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,440
out of your penis or vagina like the mummy.

649
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,640
It's not going to be dusty.

650
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
Like that scene in the movie The Mummy.

651
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,080
When Brendan Fraser pulls all that moisture

652
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,200
away from someone's dick.

653
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,800
Don't be scared of that happening to you in real life.

654
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,840
It's not going to happen.

655
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,920
Dwayne The Rock Johnson is not going to remove

656
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,680
all of your dick water or vagina water.

657
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,480
Here's the awesome thing.

658
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,000
Not only are they comfy,

659
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,160
not only are they going to keep you cool all day long,

660
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,680
but they also look great.

661
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
You can go to meundies.com

662
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,040
and check out all the different styles and everything.

663
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
And it's really pretty cool.

664
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,640
You know what I like about the styles, Travis?

665
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,400
They have matching styles for ladies and dudes.

666
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,120
So if you and your SO want to get a matching pair,

667
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,880
I don't, that's-

668
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,040
If that's a concern for you, go to town.

669
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,400
I really only have to worry about that

670
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,880
when I like fucking bend over to pick something up

671
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,720
and the top of my stuff pops out.

672
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,360
And dad got me a pair of Xbox boxers for Christmas

673
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,600
when I was like in high school that I still have.

674
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,080
And sometimes I'll wear those

675
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
and I'm like, you know, mowing the lawn

676
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,240
and I'm like, I just need something to get juicy,

677
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,400
you know, and I don't want to ruin my good stuff.

678
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,480
And so I'll wear those and I'll forget about it

679
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,880
and someone will come over and I'll bend over

680
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,480
and they'll say, what the fuck are you wearing?

681
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,920
Are those Xboxers?

682
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,640
And I'll say, yes, I'm an Xbox for life.

683
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
I love, I hate Crash Bandicoot

684
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,480
and I love Blinks the Time Sweeper.

685
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:34,960
That's what I tell them.

686
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,520
If you love Blinks the Time Sweeper too, you can go

687
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,200
to meundies.com slash my brother, that's meundies,

688
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,840

691
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,640
Are you guys ready?

692
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,280
I'm going to blow your mind.

693
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,240
Don't mind if I do.

694
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,120
I'm going to blow your mind

695
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
because I'm looking at meundies.com right now.

696
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,000
They offer, okay, so they have like, you know,

697
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,840
a 10 pack of briefs, like a, you know,

698
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,120
three pack of t-shirts.

699
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,400
They offer a 365 pack of underwear.

700
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,440
Holy shit.

701
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,960
That will do me for half a year.

702
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,920
Now it is $4,000.

703
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,680
Is it really?

704
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,960
Yes, but.

705
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,920
But, I mean, that's-

706
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,200
That's, you are good for life.

707
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
Well, for a year or half a year.

708
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
Well, if you wear a pair of underwear a day

709
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,880
and then throw them away at the end of the day,

710
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,320
then yes, you are good for-

711
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,920
MeUnderwear is the most expensive,

712
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,680
disposable underwear on the market.

713
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,320
Listen, sometimes there's some people

714
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,400
that have to do that.

715
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,160
Can we not fucking judge?

716
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
I thought this was a safe fucking space.

717
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,880
Go to meundies.com slash my brother and get 20% off.

718
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
Highly recommend.

719
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,480
All right, you're in your underwear.

720
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,200
You're comfortable.

721
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,600
What are you gonna watch?

722
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,160
Time Pass?

723
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,560
No, you're gonna watch Hulu Plus.

724
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,520
I can't believe anybody doesn't know about HuluPlus.com.

725
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,120
It is where you can watch current season episodes

726
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,640
of your favorite shows like Modern Family,

727
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,960
Daily Show with Don Stewart,

728
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,920
and every episode-

729
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,720
Did you say Don?

730
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm sorry, with who?

731
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,920
Sorry, with Jon Stewart.

732
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,640
I believe you said Don Stewart.

733
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,280
I'm almost 100% sure you said Don Stewart.

734
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,520
Hi, everybody, I'm Don Stewart,

735
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,640
and welcome to The Daily Show starring me, Don Stewart.

736
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,800
I hope you enjoy it.

737
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,720
We're gonna take a look at all the big news stories from today,

738
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,720
and then we're gonna put a comedy twist on them.

739
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,000
Enjoy, I'm Don Stewart.

740
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,640
Why does Don Stewart sound like Diane Rehm?

741
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,800
You're gonna watch every episode of shows like South Park,

742
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,720
which you're gonna only get on Hulu Plus.

743
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,840
That'd be a good binge.

744
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,000
That binge would go down really smooth,

745
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,280
but you don't just have to watch it on your computer.

746
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,960
It's on smart TVs.

747
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,920
It's on your Roku.

748
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,960
It's on your Apple TV.

749
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,200
It's on your any streaming device.

750
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,000
It's on my what?

751
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,800
It's on your Xbox.

752
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,520
Oh, boy.

753
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,320
I hope those PlayStation jerks never get it.

754
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,760
There are assumptions that you can only get on Hulu.

755
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
Like, it's just Hulu stuff.

756
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,040
There's a new season of East Los High,

757
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,600
which was last summer's, and I'm quoting,

758
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,440
summer breakout, Summer Sizzler.

759
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,680
So that's got sex and love and betrayal.

760
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,040
And you like those things.

761
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,000
I love those things.

762
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,920
They got Hot Wives of Orlando,

763
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,400
which is a parody of The Real Housewives.

764
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,960
It's a very funny Casey Wilson, Christian Schaal, and others.

765
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,280
There's also The Awesomes, which is Seth Meyers show.

766
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,360
It's about a group of superheroes.

767
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,360
Oh, and Quick Draw.

768
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,480
And there's one called Quick Draw,

769
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,600
which is an improvised comedy set in the Wild West.

770
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,680
Highly recommended.

771
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,400
Highly recommended.

772
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,760
There's five out of five.

773
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,400
And they still have The Prophet, which is like the best.

774
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,840
And Bob's Burgers, which is like Teresa's favorite thing ever.

775
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,880
It's a pretty good show.

776
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,960
We've watched Bob's Burgers straight through like seven times.

777
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,400
So you can get infinite television programming for $7.99 a month.

778
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,720
But if you go to huluplus.com slash my brother, all one word,

779
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,040
you can get a two week free trial into the Hulu Plus experience.

780
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,640
That's an extra week on top of the standard trial they offer.

781
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,520
And we'll give it to you.

782
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,320
Half a month.

783
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:22,960
Go to Hulu Plus.

784
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,600
Look at it this way.

785
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,840
You're going to sign up for it.

786
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,040
It is inevitable.

787
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,400
You're going to do it eventually because everyone's doing it

788
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,560
and you don't want to be the last one at the station.

789
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
So why not just do it now and get a week free?

790
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,000
And just get it over with.

791
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,800
Just get it over with.

792
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,200
Do it.

793
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,440
I'm sure that's what the nice people at Hulu want to hear us say about their product.

794
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,240
Just get it over.

795
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,440
Just rip that fucking Band-Aid off.

796
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,000
Thank you, Hulu.

797
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,280
Huluplus.com slash my brother.

798
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,680
Try it out.

799
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,600
Got a message for Liz real quick from Aaron who says,

800
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,480
to my beautiful wife on her big 3-0.

801
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,600
Does that mean she's 30 or that she's won three games and lost zero?

802
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,080
That's it.

803
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,360
Happy birthday.

804
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,720
Great fantasy performance.

805
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,800
Happy birthday to my favorite human and the greatest development director

806
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
or occupational therapist or small business owner

807
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,240
or whatever new career ideas you've come up with.

808
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,840
Animal trainer?

809
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,680
Anyway, you're the best.

810
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,160
Here's to-

811
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,360
Aaron, can you chill with the passive aggressiveness for like one birthday message, please?

812
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,400
Here's to many more years of having fun and making frighteningly detailed life plans.

813
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,000
Great.

814
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
I think this is Aaron's way of saying happy birthday

815
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,000
and also if you could help out with the ring.

816
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,560
And also pick something.

817
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,520
Oh, happy birthday.

818
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,480
Happy birthday, Liz.

819
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,040
You have a great one.

820
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,080
Aaron loves you very much.

821
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,640
You know what?

822
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,760
He didn't ask for this, but I think small business owner sounds just about right for Liz.

823
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,840
You could be a small business owner slash animal trainer.

824
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,360
But not, I'm talking about the building size.

825
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,800
Oh, okay.

826
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,080
I want it to be little.

827
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,800
I mean, too big and you got to pay for like-

828
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,120
This is my food truck where I train animals.

829
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,920
It's little.

830
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,280
It's a little truck too.

831
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,800
The littlest food truck.

832
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,360
Oh my God.

833
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,920
If you could open the littlest food truck, you're going to make bank.

834
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,800
It's just a Ford F-150 with a fucking pop-up tent.

835
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
I got a message for Kevin Schmidt from Alex and Sarah.

836
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,880
And this is a really good message.

837
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
So get comfortable.

838
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,560
Hey, Schmitty.

839
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,480
Want to play Diablo later?

840
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,320
It's awesome.

841
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,040
It's amazing.

842
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,000
Is it better?

843
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,560
This was another one that said whenever, but there was no specified date.

844
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,080
So they are open to playing Diablo later any day of the week.

845
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,600
I imagine they probably wanted this to go up a little bit closer to when Diablo

846
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,440
launched on consoles last month, but whatever.

847
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,360
He's been asking them about playing for like weeks.

848
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:55,680
Yeah.

849
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
Are you guys sure?

850
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,760
Can we please play?

851
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,200
Not yet, Schmitty.

852
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
We'll tell you when you're ready.

853
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,800
We'll tell you when we're ready to play.

854
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,800
I feel like the Jumbotron, which by the way, if you want to get a message on the show,

855
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,880
go to maximumfun.org slash Jumbotron and you can get that set up.

856
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,600
But I feel like people used to treat Jumbotron as a canvas upon which they would paint.

857
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:24,560
And then some like intrepid individuals have begun using the Jumbotron itself as the medium.

858
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,200
You know what I mean?

859
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:33,360
Like they are shaping the vehicle known as the Jumbotron into its own form of art.

860
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,240
It's becoming like a social networking platform in and of itself.

861
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Right.

862
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,880
And we get hundreds of dollars from it.

863
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,880
So it benefits everyone.

864
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,040
Keep on trying.

865
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,800
Keep on vibing and keeping it tight.

866
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,000
Keep it so, so tight.

867
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,960
I'm Jesse Thorne.

868
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,680
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do nothing less

869
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,360
than change your life.

870
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,960
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

871
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,920
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's like biggest asset is that you

872
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,800
can hear new sounds.

873
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,160
I'll probably never see a new color.

874
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,600
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

875
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,640
Culture picks, comedy and in-depth interviews.

876
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,400
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture every week on Bullseye.

878
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,520
Hi, brothers.

879
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,760
There's a cute sign shaker girl on the corner a few miles from my house and I want to ask

880
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,080
her out.

881
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:34,640
What the fuck?

882
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,160
My question is how to approach her.

883
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,880
I'm assuming pulling up in my car is out of the question.

884
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,080
Good instinct.

885
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,880
And she's surrounded by empty plots of land.

886
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,120
So there's no other reason for me to be there.

887
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,760
Wait, hold on.

888
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,200
What's the sign for?

889
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,240
Here's one good tip.

890
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,080
Don't admit to be the sort of person that notices empty plots of land.

891
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,920
I don't want to survey before asking someone out on a date.

892
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
I have some clean routes of exit.

893
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,160
Is her sign for the empty plots of land?

894
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,760
Look at all these plots.

895
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,800
Please buy one.

896
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
Absolutely.

897
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,640
This town is collapsing.

898
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,920
Maybe she's starting a new town.

899
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,880
Help me buy one into Sunville.

900
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,720
Help me buy these plots.

901
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm starting Huntington Jr.

902
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,320
Can you help me approach her and strike up a conversation in the least awkward way possible?

903
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,680
This is from Seeking Signs in San Jose and the answer is no.

904
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
Well, I think you just got to make your own sign that says

905
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,200
want a date and then stand across the street from her and spin it.

906
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,440
No.

907
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:41,920
No?

908
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,560
I won't do it.

909
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,240
None of this is gonna do it for me, guys.

910
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
What if you can deeply impress her with your sign spinning skills and she's like,

911
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,960
oh, you're the one.

912
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,120
I have a rule and I think we've talked about people treating like bank teller windows

913
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,680
like a lady zoo where they just pick the lady that they want to ask out because-

914
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,200
Which is fucking horrible.

915
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,480
It's horrible.

916
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,040
Sign marriage.

917
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,000
Here's my new rule, okay?

918
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,120
Don't ask anyone out if they are not in a position where they cannot turn on heel

919
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
and break into a full sprint.

920
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,520
If they're not permitted to turn around and run away from you,

921
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,680
then I don't think that you are able to ask a person out.

922
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,280
But I mean, this is my opinion.

923
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,920
There's so many fucking layers to this that are like crazy for you to even have the impulse

924
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,400
to I want to ask this person out.

925
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,240
They could be married.

926
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,000
You don't know their sexual orientation.

927
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:40,640
They could be terrible.

928
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
They could be horrible.

929
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,280
Okay, but that's not specific to people with signs.

930
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,560
That could be anyone.

931
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,720
I guarantee you, and sorry question asker, you haven't spoken with this sign person.

932
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,560
No, because they don't know how to.

933
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,520
Yeah, you have driven past thought, man, she's cute.

934
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,200
And now you've built up this whole narrative in your head about why you should ask her out.

935
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,120
But you know nothing about her.

936
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,240
It's not like everybody.

937
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,840
No, no, Justin, because everybody because maybe you meet someone at a party

938
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,400
and you have a conversation with them and then you want to ask them out.

939
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,120
You have that so profoundly different.

940
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,000
All three of us.

941
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,800
It's not everybody.

942
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
All three of us didn't meet our wives when they were sign dancing.

943
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,600
Yes, I'm saying that like there's such a huge difference between talking to someone for

944
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:32,080
even only 10 minutes and just driving by and noticing that they're cute.

945
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,960
Check this out.

946
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,640
Check this out.

947
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,080
She's at Little Caesars, right?

948
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,320
Obviously, she's working a Little Caesars.

949
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,480
You go into Little Caesars, you get a hot, you don't know when she's getting off work,

950
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,360
but you'll have to come back in to leave the sign inside.

951
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,400
You go into Little Caesars, you buy a hot and ready za, sit there at a table with the hot

952
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,640
and ready za, wait for her to come in with a plan when she comes in.

953
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,720
Be like, oh, this za is too big.

954
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,280
I can't, I'll never finish on my own.

955
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,520
I hope someone will help me finish this za.

956
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,480
Well, no, then you look like a za coward.

957
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

958
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,920
A za coward.

959
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,800
I can't do it.

960
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,560
What was I thinking?

961
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,680
Couldn't do it, huh, pussy?

962
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm never dating you, she'll say.

963
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,760
Here's the thing, though.

964
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,400
If she bites into that za and it's not hot and or ready, she's going to know your game.

965
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,080
So I need you to temp check the pizza every few minutes.

966
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,680
If it stops being hot, you have to throw it in the garbage and buy another one.

967
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,800
What if it stops being ready?

968
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,240
If it stops being ready, then time has come unstuck, and that is equally bad.

969
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,800
You open it, it's just dough and tomatoes.

970
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,760
And then you're a baby.

971
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,360
Hi, my name's Benjamin Button, and I'd really like to date you.

972
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,320
You just wrote a blockbuster sci-fi erotic thriller, and you didn't even realize it.

973
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,760
Under the Crust, starring Scarlett Johansson.

974
00:42:51,760 --> 00:43:00,720
And the Oscars go to- wait, Oscars?

975
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,920
Yeah, all the Oscars.

976
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,440
They're going to Under the Crust this year.

977
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,280
Come on up, Justin.

978
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,640
Is Mystic Pizza taken?

979
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,960
It is taken, unfortunately.

980
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,800
Mystic Pizza 2 is not.

981
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,440
There you go.

982
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,960
Don't ask people out at work.

983
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,880
You could stare at that pizza for an hour and never know it's Daniel Day-Lewis.

984
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,480
Not in a million years, would you guess?

985
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,600
So transformative.

986
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:27,200
But he was difficult to work with because he insisted that people eat him while he was on set.

987
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,240
Don't ask people out at work, especially when their job is sign dancing.

988
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,440
She's got enough on her plate to deal with, you know what I mean?

989
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,360
She's trying to get out of this one horse town, away from all these empty plots of land.

990
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,040
Leave her alone.

991
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,720
And I'm sure you're great.

992
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,040
Maybe you guys really would connect, but not in this circumstance.

993
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,800
All right, guys, I have a question.

994
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,040
Okay.

995
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:58,960
If Daniel Day-Lewis was in character as a pizza in the movie Under the Crust,

996
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:08,560
and he's off set and a PA comes up, sees a pizza, and takes a slice out of Daniel Day-Lewis,

997
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,440
would he be so committed to being in character that he would not disabuse

998
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,280
this person of the notion that he's a pizza, or would he just let someone eat a slice of him?

999
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,000
It depends on what slice they're getting, right?

1000
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,760
You know what the most delicious part would be, right?

1001
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:27,760
What part?

1002
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,720
His left foot.

1003
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,920
Come on, come on.

1004
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,840
That was fucking, that was easy.

1005
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,360
That was the easiest.

1006
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,800
Guess I'll remember that movie, right?

1007
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,520
My left foot.

1008
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,440
Oh, God.

1009
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,000
It's better than the Pizza the Hut joke I was going to make.

1010
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,160
Yeah, Travis, because I don't believe he was in that film.

1011
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
No, but it's about a human pizza.

1012
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,480
Spaceballs is about Pizza the Hut.

1013
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,520
I'm doing Yahoo now, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.

1014
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,960
Jaws isn't about a shark, and Spaceballs is about Pizza the Hut.

1015
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,480
This Yahoo was sent in by a friend of the show,

1016
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,240
Emerald member Shaman Drew Davenport.

1017
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,040
Thank you, Drew.

1018
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user Angela, who asks,

1019
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,040
how to moan loud without being heard?

1020
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,880
Is there a way I can moan as loud as I can

1021
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,960
without being heard by my parents?

1022
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,640
What can I do to achieve this?

1023
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,360
Any tips?

1024
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:17,760
Thanks.

1025
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,680
No, you don't remember what it's like out there.

1026
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,840
No, but here's the thing.

1027
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,960
All of this makes me icky.

1028
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,520
It's just, it's, okay, here's what bothers me the most

1029
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,760
about the phrasing of the question is,

1030
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,880
if you are consciously going into it and say,

1031
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,160
I'm gonna, I want to be as loud as I can,

1032
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,760
it seems disingenuous to me.

1033
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,920
My problem with it is, I don't like premeditated moaning.

1034
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,640
That's what I'm saying.

1035
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,320
That skeezes me out.

1036
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,960
But if you don't pre, if she doesn't pre-plan it,

1037
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,440
then when the moment comes, she's just gonna do it,

1038
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,960
and she's gonna get caught, of course.

1039
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,440
I hate the idea that at any point during my day,

1040
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,560
if I meet a man or woman that somewhere in the back

1041
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,200
of their head, they're thinking, I'm gonna moan tonight.

1042
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,240
I'm gonna do some, I'm gonna do some, like,

1043
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:08,720
I'm just trying to go about my day-to-day life.

1044
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,120
I need to get an acoustical engineer in here

1045
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,960
and figure out how loud I can be.

1046
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,560
I gotta moan tonight.

1047
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,880
It's gonna be a time to moan.

1048
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,480
Like, I'm just trying to live my life,

1049
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,280
and if I could, like, keep that question out of strangers' heads

1050
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,760
as I'm trying to just, like, go about my business

1051
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,480
and hit up the Jiffy Lube and ask for donations

1052
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,720
for my church group, like, while you're thinking

1053
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,720
about how hard you're gonna moan, I really appreciate it.

1054
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,400
I actually thought of the best answer, though.

1055
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,240
I thought of a good answer, and now I'm gonna feel guilty

1056
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
saying it, because you guys are trying to moan shame me.

1057
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,200
No, you go ahead, because I've got an answer, too,

1058
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,040
and I think we might be thinking the same thing.

1059
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,400
My answer is, when you moan, you have to moan,

1060
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,000
as loud as you can, the melody to the song Tarzan Boy

1061
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,880
by Baltimore.

1062
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,200
We are not saying the same thing at all.

1063
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,080
Oh, shit, okay.

1064
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,960
But I'm saying, if you get your moan on with a partner

1065
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,000
and you, like, oh, oh, boy, oh.

1066
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,720
Then your parents are just gonna be like,

1067
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,560
here she goes again with Baltimore.

1068
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,240
Man, she fucking loves that song.

1069
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,160
Can you update it?

1070
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,920
Can I tell you something?

1071
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,400
Every time I hear that song, I think it's gonna be Tarzan Boy.

1072
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,080
I get excited for, like, a second.

1073
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,440
I get fucking excited for a second.

1074
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,280
I'm like, fucking Baltimore is back?

1075
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,880
Why are they playing this in the Chipotle?

1076
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,000
Ah, fucking, it's that.

1077
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:36,960
That one.

1078
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,600
It's that one.

1079
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:40,960
Travis, what was yours?

1080
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,840
I was gonna say, and it's gonna take a little work,

1081
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,240
but maybe just make, like, cue cards.

1082
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,760
Cue cards?

1083
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,320
Like, in the fucking Love Actually film?

1084
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,720
You just, like, hold up a sign that just says, like,

1085
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,640
whoa, right?

1086
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:56,480
But you don't say it, but you, like, put it

1087
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,160
in the face of your partner.

1088
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,040
Pleasure.

1089
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,320
I just want you to know, and, like,

1090
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,080
point to it really emphatically.

1091
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,760
It's like, this now.

1092
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,200
This now is what I'm feeling.

1093
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,160
And maybe, like, do it, like, in the, like, glitter and glue.

1094
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:08,400
Yeah.

1095
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,080
Like, it really shows that you put some time in,

1096
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,320
not just, like, a Sharpie on poster board,

1097
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,920
but maybe, like, make it a thing.

1098
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,520
Like, a diorama of pleasure.

1099
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,800
Have one that says, like, too much teeth.

1100
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,680
Little to the left.

1101
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,200
Night to night.

1102
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,920
Give me the other.

1103
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,960
Give me the other.

1104
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,600
You can have that on one.

1105
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,600
We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher.

1106
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,880
And then you can use it for multiple occasions.

1107
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,120
Why do you have a sign that says John 316?

1108
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,400
What am I supposed to get out of that?

1109
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,760
Just don't mix those up.

1110
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,640
Do not take that to WrestleMania 48.

1111
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,400
And then just, like, hold up a big sign

1112
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,160
when the rock is suplexed.

1113
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,960
And it says, like, I'm coming real good on it.

1114
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,240
I love the way you're using your wieners.

1115
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:53,040
And be super careful, be super double careful

1116
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,120
if you're a member of the Westboro Baptist Church.

1117
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,480
Because you are headed towards some really sticky territory.

1118
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,840
I'm getting mixed signals.

1119
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Are you protesting or are you a big fan?

1120
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,320
If you hold up a sign that says I'm in sticky territory,

1121
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,400
it's going to be bad news bears.

1122
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,600
Well, it's going to be good news bears

1123
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,320
because you're terrible.

1124
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:12,960
We done with the show?

1125
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,360
I think that's the end of the show.

1126
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,960
We got to wrap up because you got to get Travis to Huntington.

1127
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,600
I got to travel.

1128
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,280
Travis, are you guys bringing lasagna or what?

1129
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,400
We're bringing lasagna and a sweet treat.

1130
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,200
Oh, thank God.

1131
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,320
Did you have a baby just so your brothers

1132
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,360
would keep bringing you food?

1133
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:30,560
Yes.

1134
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:31,840
Nice.

1135
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,480
I'm still waiting on another one of those pies, by the way, here.

1136
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,520
Well, I got you one.

1137
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,720
Travis has gotten you no pies.

1138
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,200
I baked you a sweet treat.

1139
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,080
I baked you a sweet treat with my own hands.

1140
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,920
So this has been our show.

1141
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,000
Fantasy Football Bros.

1142
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,200
Fantasy Football Bros.

1143
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,920
I wish everybody the biggest touchdowns and great performances from your running back.

1144
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,560
I hope it's better than soft-headed Eddie Lacey with his stupid concussion.

1145
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,080
I hope you don't have him because he's got a soft head.

1146
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,600
If you can get a professional football player to tweet about our show this week,

1147
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:11,120
make sure you give them the bit.ly forward slash mbmbam2013

1148
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,920
mbmbam2013 or it's mbmbam that bit.ly forward slash it's mbmbam that works too.

1149
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,680
Those will lead you to samplers.

1150
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,440
I think that's the best way to get pro football players to tweet about our show

1151
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,560
and try to get them into it.

1152
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,120
If we get one pro football player into it, that would be all I need.

1153
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,320
I don't even need a starter.

1154
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:32,320
I'm perfectly happy with a second string.

1155
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,280
Yeah, no problem at all.

1156
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,760
If I could get a Fozzie Whitaker retweet, fuck me, it's over.

1157
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,520
It's over. Everybody just tell Matthew Barry and then I think he can connect us to some other people.

1158
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,200
Thank you to people tweeting about the show like Devon Brews, Joshua Doolan, Monochron,

1159
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:57,840
EKS, Spencer, Jen, Bradley Smith, Michael Silva, Sean McNally, Michael Taylor, Wes, Ovens, Honeyboy,

1160
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,000
Doyle, Swinimer, many other.

1161
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,440
A lot of people, somebody made a Glass Shark video, which I guess we probably-

1162
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,240
That was me.

1163
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,160
Oh, you did it. Good job, Trav.

1164
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:08,960
Thank you.

1165
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,080
You can watch that if you want.

1166
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,920
It's on our YouTube, MBMBAM is the channel.

1167
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,440
Yeah, I just pulled that audio out, pulled that clip out.

1168
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,640
Here's a nice comment on the Glass Shark video from the Arthur Dent.

1169
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,680
God, Justin can really keep a bit going.

1170
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:26,640
Yeah, sure.

1171
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,840
Sounds a little judgy.

1172
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,800
Sounds a little judgy here.

1173
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,320
He can really keep that ball up in the air.

1174
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,960
But yeah, go check out our YouTube channel.

1175
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,960
I try to, if there's a bit that everybody really likes, pull the audio out of it so

1176
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,240
that you can share it with your friends.

1177
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,080
Just a little bit more digestible and listenable for people who haven't listened before.

1178
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,840
It's where the samplers are.

1179
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,040
We've got a couple animated videos on there that were made by a couple different friends

1180
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,920
of the show.

1181
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,720
Highly recommend it.

1182
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,280
Really check them out.

1183
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,880
We're trying to do more and more stuff on there.

1184
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,160
So yeah, go subscribe and share the videos with your friends.

1185
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,360
Also, the Facebook group is just really, really hopping right now.

1186
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,280
It's amazing to me, the number of people that...

1187
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,560
Yeah, it's really catching on.

1188
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,600
Like, I think we've approved over 500 people in the last week to join the group.

1189
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,400
We have?

1190
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,800
Well, I did 114.

1191
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,360
Okay.

1192
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,360
There's so many, and I love it.

1193
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:22,400
I love that the group is blowing up, but we're talking about like, I approved like almost

1194
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,600
500 people in one day, and it was like an afternoon.

1195
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,360
It's called My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1196
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,040
My Brother, My Brother, Me Appreciation Group, if you're having trouble finding it.

1197
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:32,400
Please.

1198
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,960
On there, Elijah Granite posted like a little survey of what's your favorite segments on

1199
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,360
the show.

1200
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,920
Leading it right now, just so everyone knows, and everybody needs to go weigh in on it.

1201
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,480
Yahoo!

1202
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,120
Slash Yadruz is leading it.

1203
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,960
That's not a segment as much as it is like...

1204
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,240
A thing that we do.

1205
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,400
Yeah.

1206
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,720
Second, normal questions.

1207
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,360
Third, D&D special apps.

1208
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,600
Fourth, Sad Libs.

1209
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,600
Out of four?

1210
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,320
That's ironic.

1211
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:00,640
Yeah.

1212
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:06,640
Sad Libs over opening goofs, cold opens, extreme restraints, money zone, and final question.

1213
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,240
Sad Libs in fourth place.

1214
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,320
How many shell accounts did you create?

1215
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,840
Twelve.

1216
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,080
Okay.

1217
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,280
Okay, time out.

1218
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:21,200
Griffin, we've been having fucking bandwidth issues this entire episode, and Griffin has

1219
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,240
decided to make his- turn his Skype icon into a screen share of him watching Baltimore's

1220
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,880
Tarzan.

1221
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,040
Really, Griffin?

1222
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,240
Really?

1223
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,120
It is a good song, though.

1224
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,640
It's a fucking great song.

1225
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,960
I've never seen the music video before, and I feel like I'm on heroin right now.

1226
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,880
Thank you to everybody who listened.

1227
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,920
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song into Departure

1228
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,200
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1229
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,920
I don't know if you guys got this, but I got a LinkedIn invitation from John Roderick

1230
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:00,800
on the LinkedIn platform, and I very much look forward to doing great business with him.

1231
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,560
And thanks again to MeUndies for supporting the show.

1232
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,560
Go check out MeUndies.

1233
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:11,200

1235
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:17,440
I also want to thank MeUndies for giving me the chance to say the phrase MeUndies like

1236
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,400
34 times.

1237
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,600
Yeah, that is the main service they provide.

1238
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,680
They just let you say that.

1239
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,960
Do you guys want to find out Yahoo?

1240
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,640
Go listen to the other Max Fun Shows, by the way, if you haven't.

1241
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,000
There's some really, really, really good ones.

1242
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,920
I've been catching up on my Throw in Shade lately.

1243
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,800
It's Jordan Jesse Goh, Josh John Hodgman, Stop Podcasting Yourself, The Goose Down,

1244
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,200
Lady to Lady, Saw Bones.

1245
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,000
Oh no, Ross and Carrie?

1246
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,040
One Bad Mother?

1247
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,880
If you didn't listen to last week's Saw Bones, it was a very special episode.

1248
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,080
I was very, very proud of Justin Sidney for putting that one up.

1249
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,000
There are probably better places to start if you've never listened before, but a lot

1250
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,240
of people responded favorably to that.

1251
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:01,840
Yeah, including me.

1252
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,720
I'm going to weigh in right now.

1253
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,920
I favored it.

1254
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,680
Speaking of, thanks again to everybody.

1255
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,560
We got such a great response to the Adventure Zone episode, and everybody's been really

1256
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,240
complimentary of it.

1257
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,280
So I just want to say thank you.

1258
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,880
I'm glad everybody enjoyed it so much.

1259
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,520
I hope there's more of those.

1260
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,640
Yeah, I do too, geez.

1261
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,120
Maybe we should ask for help with the name.

1262
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,600
Maybe we can do that in the appreciation group.

1263
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,120
We can make a poll or something.

1264
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,520
I really like the Adventure Zone.

1265
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,880
I think we could really capitalize on that, but I think we've gotten a few others.

1266
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,200
Somebody said, my dungeons, my dragons, and me.

1267
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,440
It's great, but I don't really want to tie it.

1268
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,800
I hit Griffin with this this week.

1269
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,520
What do you think about Gerblin's A Family Adventure?

1270
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,280
I kind of like that.

1271
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,840
I don't know that.

1272
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,600
Gerblin's has an exclamation point.

1273
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:54,320
It sounds a little bit like Joseph Gerbils, which worries me a little bit.

1274
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,720
Okay, we'll have to think about it.

1275
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,440
I mean, we don't have to think about it.

1276
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,160
It sounds a lot like Joseph Gerbils, so maybe we shouldn't do that.

1277
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,640
Anyway, how about we close it out with the final Yahoo?

1278
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,920
Yes.

1279
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,840
This Yahoo Drew was sent in by Drew Davenport.

1280
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,320
Thank you, Drew.

1281
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:15,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user Thurston Gordon, who asks,

1282
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,320
why is Blade Runner called Blade Runner?

1283
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,040
There are no blades, and most people drive in the movie.

1284
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,800
I'm Justin McElroy.

1285
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

1286
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,880
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1287
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,560
This has been My Brother, My Brother Made Kiss Your Dad.

1288
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:43,600
The score there on the lips.

1289
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,400
Tower marker, brawling Brandy Posey, and Barbara May Day Gray.

1290
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,680
Listen as they throw down with comedy heavyweights like Aisha Tyler,

1291
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,440
Retta, Kate Flannery, and more.

1292
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,600
These ladies will make you laugh so hard you will literally explode.

1293
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,160
So go to MaximumFun.org or iTunes and download Lady Da Lady before it's too late.

1294
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,240
Wait, where's the, where's the music?

1295
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:22,960
What happened?

1296
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,840
My throat hurts.

1297
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,000
I don't know what to do.

1298
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,040
Should we just get coffee?

1299
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,200
Okay.
