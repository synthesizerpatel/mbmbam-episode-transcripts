1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,640
Miners. Nope, nope. See, you said you got it. You didn't have it, did you? I do have it because

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,760
it's it's it's the two year anniversary. Is it the day of? It is close. You're doing like when

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,480
you do Disneyland's birthday where it's like the entire year. This year, all year, we're

8
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,000
celebrating the second year anniversary of the Chilean mining. I don't think you can do that.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,120
I think I feel like our listeners can can chart like when there's no big news stories or big

10
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,720
movies coming out like, ah, here come the here come the miners. I wish I wish it was that simple

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,400
because then we would have gotten them out with the release of Captain America and they would

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,280
have only been in there for like 45 days rather than 69. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, October 13th,

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,080
right? It's just around the seas, just around the court. That was the day. Hey, do you guys have

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:48,720
your Halloween costumes picked out yet? I'm a fifth of Christmas. Christmas just around the

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,920
corner now. Yeah. Well, the fifth of August is when they get it got in. Oh, I see. So we're

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,680
celebrating. We're celebrating the two year anniversary of them getting trapped. Yeah,

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,000
we're celebrating entry day, not Emergence Day. Oh, no, forget that. Right now we're celebrating

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,640
the the two year anniversary of when they went in in two weeks. We'll celebrate the two year

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,760
anniversary of when America kind of lost interest. Yeah. And then in like in 70 days, we'll celebrate

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
America getting back into it again in a big, big way. You know, day one, they probably didn't know

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,680
that they're that their shit was so, so fucked, right? They probably thought that they were going

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,520
on another fun spelunking adventure. Right. But I think around day three, the shine sort of came

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,120
off the apple. It's just like camping, isn't it? You know, they're so nice to be back in nature or

24
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,560
in this case, a lightless oxygen. But there's even less threat of bears, right? Well, except

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:57,200
for underground bears. Exactly. Fossil bears, bone bears. Yeah. So so this is our advice to

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,880
to the slay miners really savor savor this time. It's your time. You earned it because this is an

27
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:07,600
advice show. After all, it's an invite to call my brother, my brother and me. And I am the oldest

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:15,280
mining brother, Justin McElroy. I'm the middle. I don't mind things. Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,520
McElroy. I'm playing Minecraft right now while we record the show. So if I don't if I'm not paying

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,960
attention, it's because of the Minecraft little known fact. Griffin is the canary of my brother,

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,280
my brother and me. If he if he dies, then we know that the air has become toxic and we have to stop

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,960
doing the podcast. Oh, I think we all know I'm not going to be the brother that dies first.

33
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:44,480
Which brother is the brother that died? One, one, two, three. Travis, Justin. Yeah. See, I was going

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,840
to say Griffin and now we're all split. OK, I know that you have a weak constitution. Yeah. What

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,520
if we do a murder murder suicide pact? Yeah. Well, who's the suicide? We're all going to live up to

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,520
that. I mean, if you guys need me to kill you, I would kill you. Unfortunately, we're booked on

37
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,360
sponsors for the next couple of months, so we can't off ourselves yet. But maybe. OK, great. Maybe

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
after that we can kill ourselves. Maybe. Oh, for sweeps. For podcast sweeps. For podcast sweeps.

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,240
Hey, have you guys listened to me? Super good. They're going through some radical changes,

40
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,920
both personally and professionally. It's a big departure, literally. Here on my brother,

41
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,920
my brother and me, we take your queries, we turn them alchemy like into wisdom and let's get to it.

42
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Our first question on and off for a year now. I have been sexty texting. That's a gray zone

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,160
between sexting and flirty texting a fella. The other day he told me that he has been engaged

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,840
for about four months. Am I good? Should I stop or can I continue and leave the moral ambiguity

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:00,880
in his court? That's from Gmail. There there is no middle ground between regular texting and sexting.

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,880
There's no there's no four plex thing. There's no there's no next thing. You're just you're either

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,760
doing it or you're not doing it. It sounds like you're doing it. I'm also going to throw out here

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,120
not to pass judgment. There's not a lot of moral ambiguity here. Yeah, I would say it's pretty

49
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,160
pretty morally black and white here. We're desperate for slivers of light to help you

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,480
shimmy out of, but first of all, sweet, sweet life giving water down. I do agree that it's I mean,

51
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,880
it's on him, you know? Well, I mean, no, but I'm saying the previous bad is on him.

52
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,560
Future bad is on both of you. Yeah, yeah. Fool me once, then that one's on that one's on me. Fool

53
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,160
me twice for four months after you've been engaged. That's no good, dog. Yeah, that's not. Oh, man,

54
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,200
this is a tough putt. I can I know you're I understand you're invested in this. It is so much

55
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,720
as you can be invested in a relationship with your thumbs, but which is a lot. It's a lot more than

56
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,680
you would think. Yeah. I mean, look at Billy Mitchell. But I think that this is a good time

57
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,800
for you to make your egress from this situation. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great word for it.

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,560
Situation. That's the thing is like there is no end to this. That's not messy. It has. You have

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:35,920
been you have been foisted against your will into a situation. Yeah. I'm an messy, messy, messy

60
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,320
situation. And I would say even outside the moral ambiguity, like, get out of it because you're

61
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:46,080
better than that. Like, this is an engaged dude that, you know, he's taking out all of his, you

62
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,760
know, whatever fear of the future with his fiance with you. He's using you. If you're in for like

63
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:01,760
the excitement of a good sext, like maybe start sexting your bank, you know. Now that that sex

64
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,600
the sex, the time and temperature line at your bank so that you don't have to, you know, you

65
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,120
don't have to deal with that, that moral shadiness. You can still get your still get your, you know,

66
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,440
your rocks off. Do you think that just like they're like phone sex lines, that there are

67
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,560
phone sex lines that people are working on where you can like sex something and they sex you back

68
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,400
and but it's just a little bit. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's all all computer generated.

69
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,480
You know, it's true. Oh, you are fine. You're completely texting with a robot that is learning

70
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,560
and adapting and you're texting their uncanny valley. Right. Execute yourself from this

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:51,200
situation. Also, just to clarify something, if you find out that someone is engaged, the gray zone,

72
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,960
if it ever existed between flirty texting and sexting completely disappears. If you would not

73
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,880
show it's like, you know, it's a sin if you wouldn't do it in front of Jesus. Like if you

74
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:10,400
if the fiance would look at what you guys are doing and say and get infuriated, then that's

75
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,680
that's cheating. That's sexting. And this guy, I think, knows exactly what he's done. If it's

76
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,080
taking him four months to tell you that he's engaged. Yeah. And he you're too great. That's

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,600
what I'm saying. He's begging for you to help. Guys are stupid. He's begging for you to help him

78
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,120
get out of this because he he sees no solution. He's like he's like a rat in a maze. He's he's

79
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,400
begging for you to lead him, lead him to daylight, which you can do and save face and be totally

80
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:45,040
cool. And more importantly, like feel good about it in after the short term sort of bummer. You

81
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
will look back on the situation, think, gosh, Darlene, you were really responsible there. And

82
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,400
and that's pretty great of you. And I think this is just like any situation when somebody is like,

83
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,760
I really like this girl, but she's dating this guy. They're really unhappy. They're probably

84
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,880
going to break up. You don't want to be the catalyst that makes anything happen here.

85
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,960
It puts way too much pressure on you. And you don't want you don't want Joey Greco kicking

86
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,680
down your door, taking your phone and throwing it into the street because he'll do it. That's

87
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
his new thing. Is that his thing? I haven't seen that thing yet. It's called e-cheaters.

88
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,240
And actually, you'll get a text from a number you don't recognize saying, gotcha, bitch.

89
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
And then he takes your phone, he throws it in the street and yells cheaters.

90
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,480
Then he zooms in on it real close. I mean, this all, all of our advice right now sort of precludes

91
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:41,200
the like, we can't account for the possibility that the fiance is like the worst person on earth

92
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,960
and he really needs to leave her. But it goes back to what Travis said. If that is the situation,

93
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:54,800
he needs to leave her and then get back in contact with you. Like you don't he should have done that

94
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:02,080
from in the first place. And and you need to let him sort of get his situation sorted out. It may

95
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,960
be that you're his special one and he's your special one, but he needs to be a grown up in

96
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,280
that other relationship first. And then and then you guys can can go back to whatever weird thing

97
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,720
you're doing that didn't exist when I was your age. Hey, you want to Yahoo to wash the palette of

98
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,640
weirdness out of our mouth? Yeah. This Yahoo is not that our not that our dear listener is weird.

99
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,000
The guy's weird. Yeah, everything. Everything. Everything is weird. This one was sent in by

100
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:37,120
Emily Smith Dicks. Thank you, Emily. Don't lie. That's a woman's name. Okay. Sorry. Try again.

101
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:45,200
Emily Smith Dicks asks Justin, I won't not this time. Not this third time that you say it. I won't

102
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,920
I will not giggle. Thank you, Emily. It's by Yahoo answers user like IDK who asks,

103
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,640
starting a Jedi braid. So I am planning on growing a Jedi braid. And I know it is behind

104
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,800
the right ear. But IDK exactly where is it right on the bone? But should I let the let it grow on

105
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,920
its own or put extensions on it till it is long enough to be braided? And then he's included a

106
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,920
picture of you and McGregor with the braid. And you're assuming this is a guy asking this question?

107
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,440
I'm assuming I'm assuming as much if it's I think if a lady Jedi has a braid, it's it's

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,360
it's just a braid. Here's the number one thing and I and I tell this to people so often and they

109
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,680
never listen. But it is key and it's gonna feel uncomfortable. You can't wash it for the first

110
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,000
Mm hmm. Three to four months. Just let your natural hair oils. It's really not about growing

111
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,760
a piece of hair so much as it's about just letting your spirit sort of become unchained

112
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,400
from corporatism. It's a it's a it's a commitment to the Jedi lifestyle. Right. And your own

113
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,400
spiritual oneness like just don't wash it. Your hair naturally wants to grow you a Jedi braid.

114
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,360
You've got to let that happen. What a lot of people don't know is they think that that is hair,

115
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,840
but actually it's an extension of the brain growing externally through the skull. No,

116
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,480
it's not that it's now that I'm almost certain it is. I know a lot about both Jedi's and science,

117
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,440
you guys. But a lot of people really don't know is that you also got to just let that

118
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,200
just let that Bush go crazy. Jedi Bush. That is a Jedi style that a lot of people a lot of people

119
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,560
don't know about. Old Obi Wan Kenobi. It was like the it's like the forests of Dantooine down there.

120
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,440
You want it to be so whack down there that when you drop your pants,

121
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,920
everyone in the room says, that is not what I'm looking for.

122
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,600
That is not the Bush I'm looking for. Thank you. I that situation is not in any way what I'm

123
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,000
looking for. So you've got to have a braid down there. And you said that jokingly, but you know

124
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,200
it's braid. Mm hmm. Which you know what that means. Jedi can't wear shorts. What's that coming out?

125
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,880
What is that thing at your knee, dad? Oh, no. Do you want to go to the desert planet? Fuck. Again.

126
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:24,000
Fuck. Just put on some cargos. You'll be fine. I can't. Stupid braided Bush. It's not only that

127
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,280
it's not only the worst look, right? It's the worst explanation of a look that you can. I think

128
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,360
if I had this thing, I would rather say, oh, it's a rat tail. I just honestly was just thinking of a

129
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,080
rat tail. I have a rat tail because I'm a dirty boy, which I think is better than, oh, it's my

130
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,600
Jedi braid. I'm at the academy. It's an unrated. It's an unrated Jedi braid. Can we start calling

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,720
rat tails, lazy Jedis? That's basically what it is. If you braided that up, you would have you

132
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,800
would be one with the force. But instead, you're just going to watch. Here's the thing about the

133
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,800
rat tail, though, and the difference between the Jedi braid and the rat tail is it's like you said,

134
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,680
you know, it's a really unattractive look. The rat tail, you know, really help if I just took it

135
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,000
90 degrees to the left. Yeah. You know, like, why is putting something on the side off like,

136
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,320
hey, man, fear leads to hate, man. Hate leads to anger, buddy. Do you know?

137
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,280
Don't do this thing. You're thinking I'm doing. Are you a Jedi? Because I will assure you that

138
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,440
in the in the wide pantheon of the Jedi lifestyle, that's dumb hair thing is pretty low on the list.

139
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,640
Yeah. Like all the OB wasn't even rocking it. There are several other steps that are more

140
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,680
important to the Jedi life. Yes. Windu didn't have a dumb braid. Mr. It didn't have any hair

141
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,360
except for the bush. Is that is the policy that you only have it when you're Patty one?

142
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,640
I think that's I think that's what it is. Is that the thing by like 900 years old that that Yoda

143
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,400
just had like the most rock and bush? I imagine Yoda was half bush under there.

144
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,280
60% of his body mass was bush. Well, just put it this way. If he fell forward,

145
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,960
he would bounce like a gummy bear. It's complete. It's complete. But spring really well groomed.

146
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:27,680
It's like a fucking topiary. It's beautiful. I can't wait for Star Wars 3D. We're finally

147
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,880
going to get the kind of depth that we need to finally peep that bush. It's going to look like

148
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,440
you're buried in an avalanche. It's going to be amazing. Oh, guys. Chewbacca. He's like all bush.

149
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,800
We didn't even think about that. I guess he's not a Jedi, though.

150
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Hmm. Tricky. Let's how can we make this joke work for us? He is a dog. Do they let dogs be Jedi's?

151
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,600
I don't see why not. They seem like a pretty inclusive organization.

152
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Hey, my issue. This person. I like this person. They get right to it.

153
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,000
My issue is whether or not I'm dating this girl. So full stop. Full stop.

154
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,440
So it's for two months now, this girl now and I have been seeing each other once a week.

155
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,680
But when we hang out, it's usually outside somewhere, really just chilling. My problem is,

156
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,120
I can't figure out whether we're dating or not. Some of my friends say no, this isn't. Some say

157
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,040
we are. I really like this girl a lot. If this is considered dating, then I think I'll make a move

158
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,320
to further our relationship. Thanks, brothers. I look forward to hearing your guys' advice on this.

159
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,080
That's from Gmail. If you don't know, you probably aren't at this moment.

160
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,480
Once a week is a lot, though, isn't it?

161
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
I mean, it's a lot.

162
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,840
Yeah, but here's the thing. No offense, question asker from Gmail. You don't give us any context

163
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,520
to what this once a week hanging out is. It could be like a study session.

164
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,440
No, it is outside.

165
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,040
So they play Ultimate together. They're on an Ultimate team.

166
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,080
They could be sitting in the quad playing guitars for money.

167
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
That's right, Travis. They could be buskers.

168
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,120
They could be troubadours.

169
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:25,280
They could be gardeners at a mansion. They could be farmers outside together.

170
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,680
These are all out. They could hang glide together, tandem.

171
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,240
Maybe one of them is a hang glider. Maybe one of them is a statue.

172
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,320
The other one sits under the statue. This email comes to us from a hang glider.

173
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,640
You dummy.

174
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,640
Hey, this is weird. A hang glider is that thing you use to hang glide?

175
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
What do you call a person who does it?

176
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,000
Hang glidest.

177
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Hang gliderino. This is why you just got to ask.

178
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,560
You just got to escalate. If you don't escalate, how are we supposed to?

179
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,800
You're not going to know unless you try to escalate.

180
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,160
Halfway between escalate and just ask, you'll find a little thing called escalate.

181
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
That's what you got to do. You got to escalate this.

182
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Let's break this down mathematically.

183
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,320
Two months, once a week, you've been on eight dates, hypothetically, right?

184
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,400
If by eight dates, you have not done some kind of physical contact, hand holding, a kiss, something,

185
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,120
you're not dating, but you're not dating, right?

186
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,600
I'm saying there's been no indication to you. There's been no physical contact,

187
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,720
no flirting, making plans for the future. What are we going to do in two weeks?

188
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
Maybe there is physical contact.

189
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,080
I mean, maybe there is physical contact.

190
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,360
He just didn't say whether or not there was physical contact.

191
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,520
They might be doing like mad butt stuff. They might have jumped right to butt stuff.

192
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,080
If you're doing just all kinds of butt stuff, you're dating.

193
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
You're dating, right?

194
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,160
You're either dating or you're a real tramp.

195
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,760
Should we specify the stuff?

196
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,000
Like butt stamping.

197
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,640
Moon landing.

198
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,680
Diapers.

199
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,360
Lassoing it.

200
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,240
Lasso butts.

201
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,000
Booty chews.

202
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Booty chews.

203
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,640
Did you say booty chews?

204
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
Beetle juice.

205
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
Beetle juice, booty chews.

206
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,720
Moon chews.

207
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,760
Spankerinos.

208
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,320
All of that.

209
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
Upside down noogies.

210
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,360
The Chilean miner.

211
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,480
Like whatever.

212
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
All that stuff.

213
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,520
I've been dating you for 60 days.

214
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
Okay.

215
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
Who got eliminated on Idol?

216
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,280
If you guys have not had any physical contact, I'm going to pass judgment and say that you're not dating.

217
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,480
If you have, then you're really bad at missing cues and you are dating and it's time to escalate.

218
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,760
Either way, you got to escalate it because one of two things will happen.

219
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,600
Either they'll say, no, we're not dating.

220
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:03,920
Okay.

221
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,480
That's good.

222
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,920
That wraps that situation up.

223
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,280
Would you like to go on a date?

224
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,560
We could do that together.

225
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,840
We seem to enjoy each other's company.

226
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,160
That is a thing that could happen physically.

227
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:19,360
And then, you know, if it turns out you are dating, you might look a little foolish, but she's already into you.

228
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,080
Yeah.

229
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,560
It is a no-loss scenario.

230
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,360
And if you're together forever, then any one thing that you do doesn't matter in the fullness of time.

231
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,160
Right.

232
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,720
Exactly.

233
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,280
Maybe it's possible she's wondering the same thing.

234
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,080
I know it's scary.

235
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,440
Or maybe she's not.

236
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,560
She might not be.

237
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,480
Or maybe she's not. She might not be wondering that because she's a scarecrow.

238
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,800
It turns out she is a scarecrow.

239
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,680
She is.

240
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,960
I was looking for a geocache.

241
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,320
I found it inside of her and we struck up a conversation.

242
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,480
We've been talking ever since.

243
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,360
Ever since.

244
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,640
But geocaching.

245
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,280
That's another one.

246
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,800
Butt-caching is what you're looking for.

247
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,240
Guys, speaking of butt.

248
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,640
And doing the dirty scarecrow.

249
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
This yahoo is sent in by Brynn. Thank you Brynn.

250
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,560
It's by yahoo answers user Kayla who asks, help me with my butt problem.

251
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,160
Oh no.

252
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,720
Well, this may sound quite awkward in some ways.

253
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,520
But I tried to squeeze my butt cheeks as hard as I could.

254
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,080
God.

255
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,000
And now my butt is really sore.

256
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,640
Oh.

257
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,360
Is this some kind of exercise or did I hurt myself?

258
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
Butt kegels.

259
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,520
I really like that our sort of world is at a point right now that someone could A,

260
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
accidentally do exercise.

261
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,480
B, be terrified at the consequences of said exercise.

262
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:51,040
C, not be able to identify whether or not exercise had in front of her.

263
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,800
Oh, is this exercise?

264
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,160
What a possible world.

265
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,120
Explain to me why one would squeeze their butt cheeks together as hard as they could

266
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,040
that wasn't exercise.

267
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,800
Maybe they were trying to figure out what exercise.

268
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,200
It's like backing into exercise.

269
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,320
I don't know any exercise.

270
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,120
Literally.

271
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,080
I'm going to do things.

272
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,160
Yeah, I want to do things until they hurt.

273
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
And then I'm assuming that will have exercised me.

274
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,160
I will say this, though.

275
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,880
From the first half of the question, I squeezed my butt cheeks together as hard as I could.

276
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,320
I was expecting so many worse things that now they're sore.

277
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,520
Like I think that the question askers to be happy that they're just sore.

278
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,840
Yeah.

279
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,480
Yeah.

280
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,440
Not like I pulled something and now I'll never be able to poop again.

281
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
I mean, from help me with my butt problem.

282
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,080
There are so, so many other butt problems you could have that would be worse than this.

283
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,040
I think we can agree.

284
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,960
You got off pretty easy here.

285
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,360
Yeah.

286
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,680
Pretty light as far as butt problems go.

287
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,080
You could have like fused them together permanently.

288
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,160
That is not a thing.

289
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,800
That's true.

290
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,400
Justin, that's true.

291
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
Yeah, they call it sphere butt.

292
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,920
When Amelia Westves made that nerd have sphere butt.

293
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,920
Did you guys hear about that when Mitt Romney in school taped that kid's butt cheeks together?

294
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
When he got detention.

295
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,600
But the other guys on the wrestling team cheered him on the whole time.

296
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
He's under just so much pressure from his dad, I guess.

297
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,400
But also Mitt Romney can put on lipstick with his boobs.

298
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
Mitt Romney eats sandwiches with cereal on them.

299
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,400
What's up with that?

300
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
It's craziness.

301
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
That story about Mitt Romney doing that thing, I think was terrible.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,360
Pretty much the worst.

303
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,160
Pretty much the worst.

304
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:37,600
I would say that we're probably none of us are proud of everything we did in high school.

305
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,200
Are you apologizing for Mitt Romney right now?

306
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
No, I wanted to make a broader point.

307
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,320
And that's what that when you guys heard the story was anybody else sort of disappointed

308
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,680
that the end of it wasn't and then he turned out to be the Joker.

309
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,560
Like it reads very origin story.

310
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,800
Oh, like the kid that he punished.

311
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,600
Exactly.

312
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,640
He teased.

313
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,160
The kid that he teased turned.

314
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,080
And then as it turns out, he was some butt.

315
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,360
Oh, you're saying like Paul Harvey, like the rest of the story.

316
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:07,920
Exactly.

317
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,320
And it turned out that was Obama.

318
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,200
And as it turns out, it was Obama, right?

319
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,520
And now you know the rest of the made up story.

320
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,720
It was Muammar Gaddafi.

321
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,500
Who knew?

322
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
I was just disappointed.

323
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,760
I like narrative arcs.

324
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,920
I was disappointed it didn't pan out that way.

325
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,280
It turned out he was just just hazing some poor kid.

326
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,680
But I thought it would be cool with the poor kid.

327
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,920
And this seems like a pretty good open window.

328
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,640
Now the poor kid like got psychic powers and burned down his high school during the prom.

329
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,440
Something like that would be great, which I think you were referencing.

330
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,840
I don't know, Carrie, but I really wanted you to be referencing zapped or zapped again.

331
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,200
I was referencing zapped again.

332
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,260
You were?

333
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,120
And they all perished in the fire.

334
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Is that how zapped again is?

335
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Yeah, it's not a very good movie.

336
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah, it sounds like a really good movie.

337
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,520
You know, I'll let you be the judge.

338
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:03,760
What?

339
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,200
OK, so imagine this scene.

340
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,360
You're this child's mother.

341
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,400
You walk in on your child, squeezing their butt cheeks together.

342
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
Are they are they?

343
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,840
He was trying to fly.

344
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,760
You ever see that movie, Boy Who Could Fly?

345
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,280
This is about that's what it is.

346
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,240
If you push hard enough, the force just lifts you off the ground.

347
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,560
Do you think that they were just sitting there and they were struck by a fancy like,

348
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,440
Oh, I know what I'll do or that's a time to kill.

349
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,840
Do you think they really prep for this?

350
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,320
You think they put on some sweat bands maybe and got ready to really and maybe left school

351
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,080
a little early to give themselves plenty of time to squeeze their butt cheeks

352
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,360
before their parents got home?

353
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,280
Excuse me, teach.

354
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,920
Can I spend today's class standing?

355
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,360
I am I'm going for a world record this afternoon.

356
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,480
I'm in training.

357
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm in training.

358
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
I need zero butt pressure until it counts.

359
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:58,880
I need it.

360
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,320
I need it to feel like like a popped bubble wrap underneath there.

361
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,640
Just like soft and pliant.

362
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
Please don't mind the doughnut.

363
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,360
This is training.

364
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
This is my training doughnut.

365
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
That's right, Sydney.

366
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,600
I don't have hemorrhoids.

367
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,920
This is training doughnut from my butt squeezing.

368
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
This is really unfortunate because this probably is a little kid.

369
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,560
Can we get 16 or older for the Internet, please?

370
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,320
Can we can we get a license?

371
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,680
When I have kids, they're going to do dumb shit because I did dumb shit and like I don't

372
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,800
want them going and telling the Internet about the dumb shit that they did.

373
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,440
Better question.

374
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
I mean, honest to God, if I had a kid right now, if I had like a 14 year old son and I

375
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
was like, what are you going to do today, son?

376
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,960
He was like, well, I'm going to go in my bedroom and squeeze my butt cheeks together.

377
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,280
So I was like, OK, have a great day.

378
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,640
Like I wouldn't stop.

379
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,080
But don't never tell anybody.

380
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,080
Yeah, but go to town.

381
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,880
I mean, it's your life.

382
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,080
I'm not going to tell you what to do.

383
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
I'm not the boss of you.

384
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,080
You're never going to know how your body works until you do these kinds of brave experiments.

385
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,600
Just trying to break your butt.

386
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
Just don't let your kids on the Internet.

387
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,800
People are just throwing trebuchets of dicks at them.

388
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,680
And like they're just tweeting all of the horrible dumb kids stuff that they do.

389
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,840
Don't let it happen to your kids.

390
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,600
What exactly was the advice that this person was asking for, by the way?

391
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,840
They just wanted to know if this was some sort of exercise.

392
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm going to go ahead and say, yeah, you can probably increase the best kind of exercise.

393
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,880
Your butt resistance.

394
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,920
If you can get to a point where you can pick up a pencil with your butt cheeks,

395
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
you're a god among men.

396
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,680
I'm at the landing strip.

397
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,440
That doesn't sound extremely difficult.

398
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,400
One step away from being able to pick up singles with your butt.

399
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,520
OK, well, then let's say pick up the pencil and sign your name with it.

400
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,160
Oh, that's incursive?

401
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
Well, of course, or else it doesn't count.

402
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,800
We have a lot of sponsors lined up this week for the Money Zone.

403
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,080
I'm excited to get there.

404
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,920
But as long as we're talking about Yahoo Answers, I wanted to draw to your attention.

405
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,920
It's rare that we follow up on questions here at My Brother, My Brother and Me.

406
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:16,640
But you'll remember last week we heard from a young man named Geof

407
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:24,160
who had some trouble with his step-dad Ron and used a dog to send messages to him.

408
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,600
And I wanted to just thank Drew M.G. on the Maximum Fun forums.

409
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,200
He went and unearthed another question from Geof that I don't think we need to address.

410
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,920
Yes, but it does help to color in the story a little bit more.

411
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,960
Can we? No, let's.

412
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,560
I haven't read it.

413
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,760
Let's get into it.

414
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,480
You haven't read it?

415
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
Well, Griffin, can you read it?

416
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,640
Because I don't think it's legal for me to read a Yahoo Answer.

417
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,360
I don't think it is you.

418
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,860
Let me see.

419
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,360
Oh, shit.

420
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,480
Oh, thank you, Drew M.G. so much.

421
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,320
Geof asks, can my step-dad legally ground me?

422
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,160
I got in trouble and my step-dad Ron grounded me.

423
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,120
Can he legally ground me if he is only my step-dad?

424
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,520
And also, does lying make you stupid?

425
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,440
My step-dad Ron caught me lying and called me disingenuous.

426
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,160
I don't think that lying make you stupid.

427
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,960
I see celebrities who lie all the time and they are famous.

428
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,000
I know it's wrong.

429
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,640
I was just wondering if anyone else thinks it makes you stupid.

430
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,720
I would watch a series of movies about just the relationship between Geof and Ron.

431
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,040
I was just thinking, how is it that Shit My Dad Says is a TV show

432
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,720
and I don't have step-dad Ron and his stupid steps?

433
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,240
Step-dad Ron knows best.

434
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,720
It's like we can watch their relationship develop, right?

435
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,120
It's like, I have this new step-dad.

436
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,240
I stepped out of line.

437
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,640
Can he legally ground me?

438
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,280
Because I don't know.

439
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,120
This is a new scary situation for me.

440
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
I'm growing up so fast.

441
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,880
Please help me.

442
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm Geof.

443
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,760
And then a couple of days later, he lies to him and he says,

444
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,040
I'm having a hard time making this relationship work.

445
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,480
Does lying make you stupid?

446
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,200
I don't know.

447
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,760
Please help me.

448
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,360
Am I going to become stupid?

449
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,000
And then a few days after that, he asked if he can write messages to his dad on his dog

450
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,360
without making him sick.

451
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,760
In fact, becoming actually pretty stupid.

452
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,240
It's like a whole narrative.

453
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,400
Through Yahoo Answers.

454
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,080
Yahoo Answers, it's the first Yahoo Answers exclusive sitcom.

455
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,160
Oh, Christ.

456
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:36,720
Well, I don't know what to tell Geof and Ron, but I hope they keep on trucking

457
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,040
because they've certainly filled my life with a lot of joy.

458
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
But you know what they haven't filled my life with?

459
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:55,120
What's that?

460
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,520
Money.

461
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,480
Griffin, who's the first person taking us to the Money Zone this week?

462
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,600
Today, we have WednesdayWolf, whose art you can see at WednesdayWolf.com.

463
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,600
It is, they sell fucked up watercolor paintings.

464
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
I have seen these paintings.

465
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,320
I can indeed confirm.

466
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
They are pretty fucked up.

467
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,120
But man, there's some awesome ones just right at the top of the page there with Chewbacca

468
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,600
and Yoda and like, they're awesome.

469
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,360
There's a Mario looking more like a human pubis than he ever has before.

470
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,800
But the paintings are really neat and they would look good on a wall of an apartment

471
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,360
or a bathroom or a nursery of a child that you want to just ruin.

472
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,280
Yeah, just for life.

473
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,200
Yeah, but go check it out.

474
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,800
It's WednesdayWolf.com.

475
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,600
I think you're going to like what you see unless you're prone to nightmares.

476
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,400
Day nightmares.

477
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,760
Daymares.

478
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,000
If you're prone to daymares, stay away.

479
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
But otherwise, you should get to WednesdayWolf.com.

480
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,200
There's some Pokemon too.

481
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,960
Some really scary Pokemon.

482
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,920
Holy shit.

483
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,720
They've even got my favorite Pokemon, Ghastly.

484
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,440
He looks horrifying.

485
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,560
He looks horrifying.

486
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,640
He looks ghastly, quite literally.

487
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,000
But it's awesome.

488
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,280
You guys got to go take a look.

489
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,160
WednesdayWolf.com.

490
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,200
Just type it in your browser.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't think about it.

492
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,920
Justin, tell us about our next sponsor.

493
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,360
The M Submargin Fletch.

494
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,080
If you haven't heard of them, you can go to them.org.

495
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,320
And they're a creative group that spends their time making absurd, this is a quote,

496
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,200
absurd situational photographs to entertain their audience.

497
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,080
They've made some pretty fantastic stuff in the past.

498
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,200
I appreciate, especially Intellectual Dogfight, that features two dogs playing Scrabble,

499
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,760
which makes me really happy.

500
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,880
But they're doing a new series, a sci-fi influenced series called Intergalactic Expansion,

501
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,240
for a show they're going to do in Vienna.

502
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,600
But, and they need your help to make it happen.

503
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,720
You can find the link to this Kickstarter at themps.org.

504
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,440
And if you look at the one photo that they have already put up, if it doesn't make you happy,

505
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
I don't know what will.

506
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,960
Your heart has been replaced with a hard lump of hatred.

507
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
But you can go and kickstart them.

508
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,800
I'm most excited about a limited edition signed IMPs calendar, good for the year 2022.

509
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,880
Now hold on, they're giving away a limited magician?

510
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,960
Griffin, as you should know by all of our associations with magicians,

511
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,400
they are by definition unlimited.

512
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,880
Okay.

513
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,680
But yeah, you can go to the mps.org and you'll find a link to their kickstart Intergalactic Expansion.

514
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,280
They're going to put the show on in Vienna,

515
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:49,360
but they will send you cool stuff for helping them to get it mounted.

516
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,200
And it looks fantastic.

517
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
And I support more cool things going into the world.

518
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,120
So go check it out.

519
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,920
Speaking of looks fantastic.

520
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,280
Once again, this week, we're sponsored by Mob Rules Games,

521
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,200
the makers of Haunts of the Manson Macabre.

522
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,040
They're working on the Kickstarter.

523
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,760
It's going great.

524
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,000
They've raised about, I would say almost about $11,000 so far.

525
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,600
So they're almost, you know, close to halfway there.

526
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,760
And we're seeing a lot of people go and donate and leave a comment saying that MBMBAM sent them.

527
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,320
So great.

528
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,120
Thank you, guys.

529
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,600
For those of you, maybe you missed a couple of weeks or anything.

530
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,360
Let me read you the description real quick so that you know what you're missing out on.

531
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,440
Manson Macabre is a turn-based horror game that allows you to play either side of the haunting.

532
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,040
So you can either be the explorers or the denizens haunting the house.

533
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
We they spent so far $42,000 on development,

534
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,120
and they just need another $20,000 to see it through to completion.

535
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,520
Mob Rules Games believes that transparent business practices are vital to earning your trust

536
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,240
and will make your budget, expenses and sales and schedule publicly available.

537
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,360
So every single thing they do, you can go and see.

538
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,360
There's no, you know, hidden agenda.

539
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,960
There's it's completely transparent.

540
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,560
Every $5 that you pledge earns you a copy of the game.

541
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,800
So if you give $5, then you get a free copy of the game whenever it comes out.

542
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,280
If you donate $25, then you get five copies of the game to give to your friends or,

543
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,760
as they encourage you to do, sell it.

544
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,120
You can sell it and make some extra cash off of your $5.

545
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,960
I think it's one of the best marketing tools ever to say, hey, pirate our stuff.

546
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,720
Don't pirate.

547
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,280
Don't pirate.

548
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,840
No, no, no, no, no.

549
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,160
Pay for it.

550
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,120
Profiteer.

551
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:29,680
Profiteer.

552
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,080
Thank you.

553
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,760
And their goal is-

554
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,880
Highway robbery with our stuff.

555
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,080
Highway robbery their stuff.

556
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,720
Their goal is to get it out in time for Halloween this year.

557
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:44,000
So there's, I believe, about another 30 days or another 45 days left in their Kickstarter.

558
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
So make sure you go check it out.

559
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,280
It's mobrulesgames.com.

560
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,360
They have links there to the Kickstarter.

561
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,880
So make sure to go check out their stuff.

562
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
It looks amazing.

563
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,640
It's kind of Edgar Allan Poe-inspired Edward Gorey stuff.

564
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,920
It looks awesome.

565
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,960
So make sure you check it out.

566
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
mobrulesgames.com.

567
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,560
Last up in the money zone this week is Travis.

568
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:10,960
Hit me.

569
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,680
Well, it's a little TV show pilot called Don't Take This the Wrong Way.

570
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
People are still watching TV?

571
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,320
I know.

572
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
It's amazing, right?

573
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,720
It's just Everybody Loves Raymond Again.

574
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:23,920
That's the only TV show I know of.

575
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,880
It's basically like Everybody Loves Raymond Again, only better if you can believe it.

576
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,960
And it's a pilot developed by Craig Lewis and Matthew Chandler.

577
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,600
They're friends from college.

578
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,320
They've worked together since 2002.

579
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
And so basically they're working on this show.

580
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,000
They describe it as a combination of The League, which is a show on FX,

581
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,080
and a younger half hour version of Men of a Certain Age.

582
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,600
Men of a Younger Age.

583
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,560
Men of a Certain Age.

584
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
That's not the age that the men are on the show.

585
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,400
Maybe Men of a Funnier Age?

586
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,800
Men of a Younger More Accessible Age.

587
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,160
Men of an Age where there are fewer jokes about prostate cancer.

588
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,520
All their boners still work.

589
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,280
More jokes about iPods.

590
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,080
I had to go to my doctor.

591
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,160
He put his finger on my butt and found an iPod.

592
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,600
Cool.

593
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,000
Men of a Younger Age.

594
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,600
Kickstart it.

595
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,920
They've been working on the script for a couple years now, and they've reached a point where

596
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,960
they're ready to film it.

597
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,200
And they want to just grab that bull by the horns and wrestle it to the ground and film

598
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,160
that whole process.

599
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,800
Fuck that bull.

600
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,800
Fuck that bull.

601
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,880
So basically, you know, they just need $18,000 for development, shooting, post-production.

602
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,600
Indiegogo.com forward slash wrong way is where you can see a clip with the guys.

603
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,760
You can hear a little bit about more about the show.

604
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,240
And this is very exciting.

605
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,840
If you mentioned my brother, my brother and me, okay, and not, and I can't stress this

606
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,120
enough, not Jordan, Jesse Goh, my brother, my brother and me.

607
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,880
If we bring more people into their, into their donor pile, then they're going to-

608
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,520
Their writhing pile of donors.

609
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
Their writhing, nightmarish pile.

610
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,560
Their daymarish pile of watercolor donors.

611
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,080
Watercolor donors is an awesome band name.

612
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:27,680
Yeah, by the way, it is, then we will get into an episode, a mention of us, some oblique

613
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,520
reference that only people who enjoy our program will appreciate.

614
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,600
Right now, across the internet globe, Jordan and Jesse are talking about this show.

615
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:36,560
Right.

616
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,600
And they're great and all, but we're, we're killing it.

617
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,640
They're phoning it in.

618
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,600
We're killing it.

619
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,400
So we need you guys to go and prove that by mentioning us more than them so that we can

620
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
get in the episode and not them.

621
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,560
Again, it's Indiegogo.com forward slash wrong way.

622
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,640
Go support those guys, but most importantly, help get us into something, but even more

623
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,320
importantly, keep Jordan and Jesse from getting into something.

624
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,040
Just help us crush our friends, Jordan and Jesse.

625
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,600
Help us crush our foes in opposition.

626
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,200
Uh, so anyway, that is all.

627
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,440
Those are all our sponsors this week.

628
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,120
Unless I'm mistaken, Griffin, um, that is a song you are going to weave together to craft

629
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,120
together.

630
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
I'm so fucking angry right now.

631
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,600
So let's see.

632
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:29,680
You got to get, uh, wednesdaywolf.com, theimps.org, mobrulesgames.com, and indiegogo.com wrong

633
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:29,680
way.

634
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,920
Actually, Mob Rules Games will, will, will-

635
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,280
I already busted one out for them.

636
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,080
I'll, I will give them a final draft of that come, come the end of this promotion.

637
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,760
So it's don't take this the wrong way.

638
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
The Imps and Wednesday Wolf.

639
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,960
I like the idea of Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

640
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,920
I like that part.

641
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,280
So far so good.

642
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay.

643
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Um, what does that cover?

644
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
That covers Wednesday Wolf and the Imp.

645
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,640
It covers all three.

646
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,520
They all want money.

647
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,280
That's the connector.

648
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,240
Everybody wants money.

649
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:06,960
Here we go.

650
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Build a Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

651
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,720
All these businesses need funds to operate.

652
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
You can help Wednesday Wolf.

653
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,680
The Imps don't take the wrong way.

654
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,600
That's almost what it's called.

655
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,000
But I ran out of words in the verse.

656
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:34,320
Go give them some cash to chase all of their dreams around.

657
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,760
Whoa.

658
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,000
I like how it ended on some of that unresolved.

659
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,120
Dreams of dreams.

660
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,560
I don't know guys.

661
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,120
Build a Daymare Pile of watercolor donors.

662
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,400
You need to give these people lots of cash.

663
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,480
That's how the market works.

664
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,760
They take your money and turn it into goods and services.

665
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,040
And you can take those services to the bank.

666
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
While they take your literal money to the bank.

667
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,480
Visit WednesdayWolf.com.

668
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,280
TheImps.org.

669
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,960
And don't take this the wrong way's website,

670
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,680
which you can probably find on Google.

671
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,320
Oh man.

672
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,400
I think the real contest is to find which way of spending your money

673
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,680
your grandparents who lived in the depression would approve of the list.

674
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,880
And it's to buy messages on our show.

675
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Yes.

676
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,800
Surprise.

677
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,840
Big twist.

678
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,800
It's giving us money that they would really approve of the lease.

679
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,680
Hey, I recently met a girl that's wonderful.

680
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,800
We have a lot in common.

681
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,760
She has expressed interest in dating me and it's mutual.

682
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,600
I worry though that in a year when I'm finished college,

683
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:07,120
I will likely have to move a pretty large distance to start my career.

684
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,440
I also worry that she wants to start a family sooner than I do.

685
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,120
Is this a deal breaker?

686
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,920
Should I just stay single yet another year?

687
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,760
That's from concerning Canada.

688
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,040
Oh man.

689
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,320
Of course not.

690
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,360
Of course not.

691
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,600
Anytime you start a sentence with I'm worried that in a year just stop right there

692
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,600
and finish the question with should I just stay single yet another year?

693
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,640
Yeah, like no, of course not.

694
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,000
Quetzalcoatl is coming for you and me and everyone you love.

695
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,720
And it's December 21st this year.

696
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,240
So no, I wouldn't.

697
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,120
Hey Quetzalcoatl, can I get just like a short extension?

698
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,280
Is it cool if let's just I'll tell you what,

699
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,480
let me pencil you in for like March 014.

700
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,560
Oh no, you're a giant Thunderbird.

701
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,280
We're all dead.

702
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
So thanks for the slow pitch.

703
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,800
Ask this girl out immediately.

704
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,240
Yeah, you have no time.

705
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,960
You have to, everybody needs to live like Quetzalcoatl's coming back.

706
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
Yeah, don't even bother with birth control anymore

707
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,320
because we are less than nine months out.

708
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,720
Don't even go to the dentist.

709
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,080
Don't even get your teeth checked.

710
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,040
That's bullshit.

711
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,920
You don't want to get eradicated when you're six months pregnant though.

712
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,240
That's that your back's going to be hurt.

713
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,440
Life begins at inception.

714
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,080
That's true.

715
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,040
Weird cravings.

716
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,120
What if you get a weird craving to talk back to Quetzalcoatl?

717
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,840
Then you're going to die, you know, die a lot earlier.

718
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,440
I mean, yeah, I mean, it's six and one.

719
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,640
You're going to live in his service.

720
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,280
Oh, yeah.

721
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:31,760
Oh, yeah.

722
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,720
Honey, listen, I know this is going to sound weird.

723
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,440
I have a craving for a stew made from the feathers of Quetzalcoatl.

724
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,280
I need you to fetch them from here.

725
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,720
And then just a picture of like the dude driving in a minivan grumbling.

726
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:52,400
I was just in the middle of the game and now I got to go get some feathers of Quetzalcoatl.

727
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,920
His nest of bones into the Tower of Death Corpses.

728
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,200
That he's formed over where the White House used to be.

729
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,000
The watercolor pile of day rare corpses he's made and now he lives atop.

730
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,080
Listen, in a year, what you want, if this is the person, the one, the person, the special person

731
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:21,360
that's going to change your whole path in a year, here's what you will want to be with them.

732
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,840
And the other stuff you can figure out.

733
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:30,080
Like it, you don't know what you want because you are only living half of your life right now.

734
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:34,000
If this is the special person that you're going to beautiful justice.

735
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,640
Yeah, that's fucking gorgeous.

736
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,240
That's pretty unless you're like a fucking Hallmark card, right?

737
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,080
You don't honestly everything changes when you enter into a committed

738
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,160
permanent relationship with somebody.

739
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,920
Here's the thing, though.

740
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,840
Like I agree with you, Justin.

741
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,840
And the other aspect is anything could happen in a year.

742
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,600
Like maybe you guys get together.

743
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,280
It's great for three months.

744
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,240
It doesn't work out.

745
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,200
It ends.

746
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:03,920
Okay, great.

747
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,440
But to say because of something happening a year away, I'm not even going to give it the chance.

748
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,040
Like a year.

749
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,320
Now, if you were saying that you were moving away in like a week.

750
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,560
Yeah, that's different.

751
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,160
That's a different kettle of fish.

752
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,600
There's a lot of hurt feelings and stuff that are going to be associated with that.

753
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,800
Yeah, but yeah, she could die.

754
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,560
She could die.

755
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,360
You could die.

756
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,880
You could die.

757
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,000
You could kill each other.

758
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,480
You could kill each other in a gunfight.

759
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,200
Gunfight in like a like one of you tackles the other one off the top of a building and

760
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,960
you're falling together but still fighting.

761
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,040
It's like you're still punching each other as you fall.

762
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,280
And you think like if I can put her body below mine and we fall and hit the ground, then

763
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,680
she'll die.

764
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,960
But I'll be okay liking crank.

765
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,000
But guess what?

766
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,520
Life don't work like crank.

767
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,840
And then she pulls a parachute and you're like bullshit.

768
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,280
I don't have one of those guys married you and I had the chance.

769
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,400
You're very smart.

770
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,040
Cranked again.

771
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,080
Hey, have you guys seen cranked again?

772
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,000
It starts Scott Baio and at the end the school burns down.

773
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,440
It's a pretty weird movie.

774
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,800
What would you be fighting?

775
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,880
I mean, it is we're joking.

776
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,480
It is very realistic that they could be in a gunfight when Quetzalcoatl comes.

777
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,840
Maybe their mom, both their moms have an infection and they both need penicillin.

778
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,320
Of course, Quetzalcoatl drinks penicillin for energy.

779
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:26,640
Yeah.

780
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,480
So there's not a lot to go around.

781
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,440
Oh, Hunger Games.

782
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
There's also a lot we still don't know about Quetzalcoatl.

783
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:32,480
Yeah, sure.

784
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,560
There's a lot you don't know about Quetzalcoatl.

785
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,960
I know I'm spilling all kinds of facts right now.

786
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,720
It's bird.

787
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,520
It is avian in nature, right?

788
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,560
Am I imagining it?

789
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,680
Isn't it bird snake?

790
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,800
Chicken snake.

791
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,360
Cockatrice.

792
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,480
I can't be bothered to Wikipedia.

793
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,240
I don't know what we're talking about anymore.

794
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,440
I don't know either.

795
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,120
So yeah, go love this girl.

796
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,600
The only thing I know is go love this girl.

797
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,680
That's everybody by the way.

798
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,240
Just pair up.

799
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,960
Yeah, just go ahead and partner off now.

800
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,600
Just partner off.

801
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,440
It'll make it easier to consume.

802
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:01,680
Stop.

803
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,760
His mouth is only two people wide.

804
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,080
So actually it would be great for him if everybody could pair up before he gets back.

805
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,800
And then maybe if you like, if you each hold hands,

806
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,280
you can like loop around one of his giant fangs and try to hold on as long as you can.

807
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,000
If you are mega fat, hook up with another mega fat, pair up.

808
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,560
He goes to...

809
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,800
Dead.

810
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,360
Choked to death.

811
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,400
Sacrifice yourself.

812
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,960
Thank you for your sacrifice, John Goodman.

813
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,960
If it turns out that the fate of the human race turned on the moment

814
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,480
that Tom Arnold and Roseanne Arnold split up.

815
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,880
That's exactly what I was just thinking of.

816
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,600
Sam, Dr. Sam Beckett goes back and re-inhabits the body of Roseanne Barr.

817
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,680
So Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr all stay together.

818
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,560
Now Tom.

819
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,320
Oh God damn it.

820
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:50,800
Oh boy.

821
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,640
I don't know.

822
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,360
I don't know, Sam.

823
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,200
I think you gotta, I think you gotta be eaten by Quetzalcoatl and choked to death.

824
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,280
You gotta first seduce Tom Arnold and then be eaten by Quetzalcoatl.

825
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,560
I don't know which one is worse.

826
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,920
Oh Ziggy, no thanks.

827
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,280
Quantum Leap was a good show.

828
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:07,760
It was.

829
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,160
There's a lot of possibilities they didn't explore though.

830
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,080
I just, so my girlfriend and I just moved in together and we were going through a CD.

831
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,480
She has the soundtrack to Quantum Leap.

832
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,120
What?

833
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,040
She has the soundtrack to Quantum Leap.

834
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,520
The Quantum Leap soundtrack.

835
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,320
What's it sound like?

836
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:21,760
Can you give me, can you break me off a beat?

837
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
Yeah sure, tracks one through 19 are like.

838
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,080
And there's like a jazz cover.

839
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,240
You guys wanna Yahoo?

840
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,800
And then there's a, there's a spoken word one.

841
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,920
Can I tell you guys something true about Quantum Leap?

842
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,160
Yes.

843
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,840
I read when I was in middle school, I was so way into Quantum Leap

844
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,040
that I read a novelization.

845
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,080
Holy shit.

846
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,080
based on like an unfilmed episode of Quantum Leap.

847
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,080
And in this novelization,

848
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,320
Dr. Sam Beckett leapt into the body

849
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:07,320
of a carnival worker with Down syndrome.

850
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,880
Oh, yeah.

851
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,720
Yeah.

852
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,260
And it was never produced, you say.

853
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,280
Yeah, I mean, there are like side stories basically

854
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,320
is the best way I can explain it to you.

855
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,480
But yes, yes.

856
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,320
That is what happened.

857
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,560
And did you buy this at a Scholastic school book fair?

858
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,780
If you're at a Scholastic school book fair,

859
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:33,260
then you will have no problem tracking this one down.

860
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,920
It's pretty fantastic.

861
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,800
He has to pretend to have Down syndrome.

862
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:40,920
Oh my God.

863
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,640
I know, it deals with a lot of questions

864
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,460
that the episodes never had the courage.

865
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,760
Like what would it be like to be just super offended?

866
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,560
Yeah, like what would it be like

867
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,960
to read the most offensive novel ever written?

868
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,720
Griffin.

869
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,680
This yahoo was sent in by Krista Whelan.

870
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,120
Thank you, Krista.

871
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,840
It's the douchiest, just get ready.

872
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,640
It's by yahoo answers user fifth Earl of Davishire

873
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,940
or perhaps Dave Shire, who asks,

874
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,600
I'm not, I'm not, okay.

875
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:15,660
May it, I have to do like a voice.

876
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,400
May a gentleman kick a door off its hinges

877
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,200
in an emergency.

878
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,720
I'm not usually the sort of fellow

879
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,700
to go around kicking doors off hinges,

880
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,640
but for reasons too wearisome to detail,

881
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,520
there is presently a locked door

882
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,000
between myself and a crate of gin.

883
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,280
Obviously myself and the gin need to become

884
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,800
better acquainted.

885
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,960
Is there an etiquette to kicking doors to matchwood?

886
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,480
The door in question is the house

887
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,080
of a particularly tiresome aunt of mine.

888
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,800
This is the happiest I've ever been.

889
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,680
Oh my God.

890
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,200
I am not kidding you guys.

891
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,120
There is probably 20 responses,

892
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,640
each of which are done in the style

893
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,800
of like a Downton Abbey role play.

894
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,960
Who taught anthropomorphized owls how to use the internet?

895
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,360
That's what I want to know.

896
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,800
Can we not?

897
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:12,760
Kick indoors?

898
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,640
I don't think the bobbies would approve

899
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,840
and I know your aunt wouldn't.

900
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,320
Fuck you, stop it.

901
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,240
Breaking and entering plus theft

902
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,620
is good for about five years in the gaol.

903
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:26,680
If auntie were to suffer a stroke during the misdeed,

904
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,920
then they'd probably permanently confine you

905
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,720
in the Tower of London.

906
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:35,440
Like, listen to these London things I know.

907
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:36,960
Certainly not.

908
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,280
One has people to carry out such tasks

909
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,360
as the hero song goes.

910
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,280
Lord Derby tried to mend the electric light.

911
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,800
The current shock struck him dead and serve him right.

912
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,560
It is the duty of the wealthy man

913
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,760
to grant employment to the artisan.

914
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,360
Now listen, are we going to deal with the issue

915
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,640
of this being the douchiest thing I've ever heard

916
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,680
or are we going to talk about kicking indoors?

917
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,080
Listen, we will get to kicking indoors.

918
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,260
I want to know what sort of splinter

919
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,320
Yahoo Answers these people are using.

920
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,860
Steampunk Yahoo.

921
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,560
That everyone else who uses Yahoo Answers

922
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,440
hasn't stumbled in and just been baffled

923
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,400
by what's going on.

924
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,280
Hey yo, are we gonna kick down doors or what?

925
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,720
Fuck.

926
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,780
Yahoo Answers.

927
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,080
Listen, can we get back to talking about

928
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,000
my fucking stepdad or what?

929
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:28,840
Shit.

930
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,200
Listen, I broke my butt cheeks.

931
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,400
Let's focus up, people.

932
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,360
Jesus, what is this bullshit?

933
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,200
Listen, I was trying to leave poop in some bitch.

934
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,040
Yahoo.

935
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,720
What are you even saying?

936
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,000
I'm trying to figure out how to superman a hoe.

937
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,840
Can we please focus?

938
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,340
Hey, I cut myself for a mermaid spell.

939
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,180
Yahoo.

940
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,940
It would usually be considered a poor show

941
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,820
to kick a door in yourself, old boy,

942
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:59,120
but drastic times call for drastic measures.

943
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,040
That gin won't drink itself after all.

944
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,160
The very next guy, I fucked a tree to summon aliens.

945
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,160
Oh.

946
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,840
Oh, old chap, that sounds like quite a splintery situation

947
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,880
for your tallywacker.

948
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,840
Like, what the fuck are you talking about?

949
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,680
Oh God.

950
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,940
Tip top, someone said.

951
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,820
Just that?

952
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:27,340
What's the opposite of that?

953
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:28,300
Cause that's what this is.

954
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,400
Bottom, bottom.

955
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,640
Bottom, bottom.

956
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,480
Yeah.

957
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,520
Can we, on the subject of crazy Yahoo Answers,

958
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,000
can we, I mean, this is the closer, right?

959
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,720
Are we in the closer?

960
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,440
Yes, this is the, we're living in the closer.

961
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,780
All right, we're gonna do all our thank yous,

962
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,440
but I feel like Travis and I,

963
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,080
I feel like every, I don't know, 50 episodes or so,

964
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,680
we need to give a plea to our listeners

965
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,580
and question submitters,

966
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,920
because seriously, we love you guys so much,

967
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:54,160
and like, we couldn't do this without your help,

968
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,200
but some of the questions and some of the Yahoos

969
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:02,080
have gotten a little rankerous, I think is good.

970
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
Let's just run down a list of the things

971
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,840
that we won't, for lack of a better word, touch.

972
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,960
Okay, if you talk about having sex with sleeping people,

973
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,600
like fucking stop it.

974
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,420
Like don't, if you submit something,

975
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,620
either Yahoo or a question,

976
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,560
and you look at it and go,

977
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,240
oh, this is pretty fucking gross,

978
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
we're probably not going to read it.

979
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,720
Like that includes poop.

980
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,720
It includes masturbating your amputee son.

981
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,440
Yeah, that's a real thing someone sent in.

982
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,320
That's awful, like don't send in gross, awful things anymore.

983
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,880
Like, thank you for the funny stuff,

984
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,120
and like, we appreciate it so much,

985
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,720
but just like, we're not going to read it,

986
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,120
and it's psychically upsetting

987
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,200
when you send us something that is-

988
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,120
And it's a completely different vein,

989
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,080
but please stop asking me questions about Diablo 3.

990
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,920
Yeah.

991
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,200
It's not the same as masturbating your poop,

992
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:57,080
but Diablo 3 questions, we're covered.

993
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:02,080
I'll drop my battle tag up in here if you guys,

994
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,760
if you want to meet up.

995
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,280
You know, so just focus up,

996
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,080
and get your question game right.

997
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,700
Yeah, just get it together maybe, just a little bit.

998
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,240
Like think about it before you submit,

999
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,000
think before you submit, and get it right.

1000
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,840
Thank you so much.

1001
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,040
And if you got a query,

1002
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,000
it doesn't have to be anything big.

1003
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,040
Sometimes you just need an argument settled,

1004
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:23,880
we're there for you.

1005
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Also- You need something every day.

1006
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,920
If you could email,

1007
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,480
we've probably haven't given out an email in a while.

1008
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,320
It's mbnbam at gmail.com.

1009
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,040
Send your questions, and your Yahoo's there.

1010
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,880
I really appreciate all the ones people send to Twitter,

1011
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,120
but it's so hard to like look through that.

1012
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,200
We have like a catch-all for Yahoo answers

1013
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,260
that come in the email.

1014
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:44,200
So if you email them, that's stupendous.

1015
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,020
Thank you so much.

1016
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,320
mbnbam at maximumfun.org works the same,

1017
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,160
goes to the same place.

1018
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,160
Yeah.

1019
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,960
Maybe feels a little more official.

1020
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,700
So that's- If you like it, a fish.

1021
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,540
That's my plea.

1022
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,360
Thank you guys.

1023
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,200
Everybody, thank you.

1024
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,440
I'm honored every day.

1025
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,480
Every day is a winding road.

1026
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,720
Your bodies are wonderlands.

1027
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,520
Thank you, for all your bodies.

1028
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
Thank you.

1029
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,880
Thank you for your bodies.

1030
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,520
Hey, I appreciate all the bodies.

1031
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,920
I just wanted to get on that bandwagon,

1032
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,760
and everybody else was talking about bodies,

1033
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,260
and I didn't. Come on.

1034
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,100
Come on.

1035
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,520
Let me hop on that body bandwagon.

1036
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,400
Thanks to everybody who tweeted about the show this week.

1037
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,320
I'm not gonna do what I normally do to start at the top.

1038
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:25,720
I'm gonna go backwards.

1039
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,760
Okay.

1040
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:31,280
Thanks to Tyler Woodburn, plainzombie,

1041
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,280
mecan'ttweet.

1042
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,520
That's a pretty good one.

1043
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,960
Alicia dances, spaceman spiff, iggy k,

1044
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,720
IDF-inners, ID-finners?

1045
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,760
It's hard to say.

1046
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,240
Spell it right, loser names, Emma Heike.

1047
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,980
I almost certainly fucked that up.

1048
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Brian from WI, presumably Wisconsin.

1049
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,300
Or from WII.

1050
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,660
Or from WII, little froggies.

1051
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:00,020
Admiral Christy, Jamie is a twit, thingsbydan.

1052
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:04,180
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

1053
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,620
It means a lot to us,

1054
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,820
and so thanks.

1055
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,620
Just so you guys know, we've got coming up Max Fun Con.

1056
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,820
Coming up in just a couple weeks.

1057
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,100
We're gonna be doing a live show there,

1058
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,620
so if you're going to be at Max Fun Con,

1059
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,860
and you would like us to answer a question

1060
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,380
at our live show there,

1061
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,340
then make sure that you email us that question,

1062
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,940
and make sure that you put in the subject line

1063
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:27,060
that it is a question for Max Fun Con,

1064
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,500
so that we can answer it for you live.

1065
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,580
Please make it good.

1066
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,180
There's gonna be so many people there

1067
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,020
that are gonna be intimidated.

1068
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,500
People that have never heard the show before, possibly.

1069
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:37,900
Oh, I can't think about it.

1070
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:41,060
Like, I'm pants-shittingly terrified of this show.

1071
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,100
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1072
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,140
for the use of our theme song,

1073
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:46,540
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1074
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,660
It's a fantastic, fantastic album,

1075
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:52,420
which everyone should own.

1076
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:55,180
Don't Spotify it, okay?

1077
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,660
Because then, if your internet goes out,

1078
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:58,940
you can't listen to it, you creep.

1079
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,340
Purchase it, physically.

1080
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,660
And make sure you go check out TheEmps.org,

1081
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:08,620
WednesdayWolf.com, MobRulesGames.com,

1082
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,300
and IndieGoGo.com slash Wrong Way.

1083
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:13,820
And go give a listen to all the other

1084
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,980
great Max Fun Fun shows, Throwing Shade,

1085
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,580
Jordan Jesse Goh, JaJuan Hodgman, stop podcasting yourself.

1086
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,820
They're all just delightful.

1087
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,660
The end.

1088
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,500
The end of the show.

1089
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,540
The end, the end of our show.

1090
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,940
This final Yahoo was sent in by Lisa Holofield.

1091
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,780
Thank you, Lisa.

1092
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,940
It's by Yahoo Answers user Annoying, who asks,

1093
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,740
who was your favorite Beatle from the band The Beatles?

1094
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:49,540
I'm Justin McElroy, I'm Travis McElroy, I'm Griffin McElroy, this has been my brother, my brother and me, kiss your dads flair on the lips.
