1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:50,320
My boss at work has an odd way to say a passing hello, and it's confusing me.

6
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Walk by me and say, what do you think? But not asking about anything in particular.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,840
This happens a few times a day, and I don't know how to respond. What kind of things should I say?

8
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Should I come up with a standard response, or should I mix it up a little bit?

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Help me, brothers.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,920
There's literally so many ways to respond to this.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,680
What do you think?

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,520
My favorite being, what do you think?

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,360
Just turn the mirror up to nature and make him go, that doesn't make any sense.

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Exactly.

15
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,760
What can you do?

16
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,640
No, I think you've got to randomly pick an adjective that you can give to him as a response,

17
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,880
like, oh, pretty wet, or something like that.

18
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,600
I was going to say a noun, and you could just be like, potatoes.

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
Well, that doesn't make sense, because when-

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
Exactly, what do you think we're going to have for lunch?

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,640
Okay, but he would say that, I think.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,920
No, like, what do you think? Like, someone had just, like,

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
maybe there's someone that always sees your boss before you that says, like,

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,480
do you guys want to go out after work? And then the boss is saying what you think about it,

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,800
but you were not part of the A part of the conversation.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,840
Okay, and so he dips your head, and then your response to

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,480
what should we eat for lunch is potatoes.

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,120
Potatoes.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,680
Just mash them, boil them, stick them in a stew.

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,240
You don't know.

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
Travis is a bore, so it's good.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Grubs?

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,160
That works, huh? Grubs?

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,520
Travis is Timon, and I'm Pumbaa, and we have a comedy podcast.

35
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
It's called Timon and Pumbaa.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
And not Griffin.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,320
And not Griffin, because he's not down with bugs.

38
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,680
Hey, maybe that's a good response.

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,120
What do you think?

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Hakuna matata.

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,360
I love it.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,960
You guys ever watch Slim Goodbody?

43
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,880
Wouldn't it be awesome just once you could see, like, an awesome dookie?

44
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,000
Slim Goodbody?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Yeah, like one ribald-

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
You're saying, like, if you could look through Slim Goodbody

47
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
and see a pit performing-

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,840
Just one episode.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,080
Like a deleted scene somewhere where he's like,

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,000
eyes aren't a bunch of corned beef.

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,320
I got a kid fit, and then go shit.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm packing a solid bolus in here.

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
This is going to turn into a joke.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,080
Read both at the same time.

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,880
Here we go.

56
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,840
This Yahoo answer was sent in-

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,120
I recently found out what-

58
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
We're not really doing this.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
It was sent in by Crystal Whalen.

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,360
Thanks, Krista.

61
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,160
You know it's good.

62
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,000
That's like the Nintendo seal of quality.

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
It's by Yahoo answer's user, Chris, who asks,

64
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,760
what is the hole on the penis called?

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,400
Travis, do you-

66
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,360
I do know.

67
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,920
Do you really?

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
I mean, it's the urethra.

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,400
Nope.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:39,600
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Nope, nope.

72
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,120
Their urethra is the tube that connects the penis hole to the piss bag.

73
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,920
The hole in the tip of the penis-

74
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,880
Is the tip hole.

75
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,520
Is called the debt ceiling.

76
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,880
Is your penis not?

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,000
No, it's technically called the debt ceiling.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,720
That's why they're always talking about raising the debt ceiling.

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,120
Right.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
That's why it was such a kerfuffle and a little racy.

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,320
That's why it was such a hot button issue.

82
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,240
I have had control of my dreams for so long

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,800
that I'm worried if I go in willy-nilly,

84
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,960
the dreams are just going to run roughshod over my emotions.

85
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah, the dream lord will be like, finally, a weak point.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,880
Finally.

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,760
Now experience all the emojis you've been holding back.

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,440
You've been holding onto these emojis in this bottle.

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,400
I've been saving them.

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,680
Experience them all.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,880
Have sex with the teeth that fell out of your head

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
because you're naked at school and you forgot your lines at the play.

93
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
And you're forgotten how to run quickly

94
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
and you feel like you're moving through molasses.

95
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,280
And also you're flying off a cliff and you're on fire

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,760
and your parents are there and there's your grandma.

97
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,040
And you're trying to punch the dude,

98
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
but you can't remember how to make a fist.

99
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
You can't remember how to make a fist and your hands are bones and teeth.

100
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
And all your stuff will come in a very discreet box.

101
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,600
None of those big like bright red,

102
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,480
this box full of dildos boxes you normally get.

103
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,400
You'll be lucky if you can find it.

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,560
They will make it look like the rock you hide your key under.

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
I could have sworn I ordered something from them.

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,760
They actually, have you guys seen Looper?

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,440
What they do is they travel back in time

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,640
and they give you that dildo 20 minutes before you ordered it.

109
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,800
So you've all actually always had that dildo.

110
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,040
Only you go, what?

111
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,920
Wait a second.

112
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,480
But then you go 30 years and it's your dildo.

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,360
It was your dildo.

114
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,760
They closed the loop.

115
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,200
I closed my dildo loop.

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,160
Now close your loop.

117
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
And by loop, I mean butthole.

118
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,880
Close it up with this thing.

119
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:34,960
Get it in there.

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,400
At extremistrains.com.

121
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
Keep on going, Middle East.

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,640
Close your loop.

123
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
You're orgasming wrong.

124
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,680
I'm Dan Ackroyd, the brother of old Joseph Lloyd Leavitt.

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,440
And I'm going to close your dildo loop.

126
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,640
He grew up into me.

127
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,280
He grew up into me in an alternate future

128
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,320
where someone gave him a dildo.

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,960
Can you believe it?

130
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,000
No, neither can I.

131
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,760
Me neither.

132
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,520
I really hope people come in the future.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
In the future, dildos are illegal.

134
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,800
So we have to put them in this machine and send them back to you.

135
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
And you can save money on them.

136
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,600
And you got to get rid of them.

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,280
By which I mean put them all the way up your butt

138
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,640
until you can't see it anymore.

139
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,480
That way future cops can't find it.

140
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,000
Griffin, are you suggesting that the reason Dan Ackroyd's head is increasing in size

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
is because people are using his head to store contraband future dildos?

142
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
Is that what you're saying to me right now?

143
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,120
And as I assume all of you want a my brother, my brother and me shout out,

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,240
just go to maximumfun.org forward slash Dumbotron.

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,400
That dude, you could join the podcast.

146
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,040
I can't believe that I used that word.

147
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,680
I can't believe that I used the same air in this room to wish those people

148
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,680
that said that the stars were each other's love or something

149
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
to also say that Dan Ackroyd's head is full of illegal future dildos.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,600
Maybe smoke a little doja and then go in.

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,640
Oh, maybe get a little drunk.

152
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,600
Maybe you can smoke a little peaches and herb and then go in.

153
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,280
Yeah, I like that.

154
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:10,080
It's like office space, but instead of getting hip motized, you get a little dip.

155
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,200
You get ganja-tized.

156
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,080
I'll work on it.

157
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,720
I'll workshop it.

158
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,680
I'll come back.

159
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,880
Hip pot-tized?

160
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Is that any good?

161
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Maybe spend an hour with Man for Man's Earth band and then you roll in.

162
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Say, hey, what's up with the word?

163
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,000
Where's the paper at?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,960
Let me sign it.

165
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,080
We file those reports for you.

166
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
Hey, these keys are crazy, man.

167
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
We've never smoked marijuana before, so we're just guessing what it is.

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,760
Mason, that's what it's like.

169
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,840
You're trapped in a glass box.

170
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,480
It makes you talk like a very meek jazz musician.

171
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,200
And he's afraid of waking the baby.

172
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,560
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

173
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Hey, no, no, no, no, no, shh, shh, shh.

174
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,560
Look at that computer screen.

175
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
Ooh, I'm gonna type in an email.

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
I think that'd be such a power play to just start being the guy in your office who always

177
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,160
talk like that.

178
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,640
Just low talk Greg and everyone's like, what?

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,520
Excuse me?

180
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,000
What did you say?

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,600
They would eventually, even if you had put in your two weeks notice, they would ask you

182
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,320
to stop coming.

183
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,720
I can't hear you over the laser printer.

184
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,080
What the fuck did you say?

185
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,280
I can't believe I just sent that email without a subject.

186
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,640
Can you believe that?

187
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,520
I wish they put a little, I wish they had a little guy in there.

188
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,480
You could just call it back.

189
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,440
Come on back, email.

190
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,040
I don't like this guy.

191
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,840
I don't like this guy.

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,800
I like this guy too.

193
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,560
Can I talk like this for the rest of my life?

194
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,920
Ah, shit.

195
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,960
The printer's broken.

196
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Oh, what's wrong with the printer?

197
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me take a look at it.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah, that's broken.

199
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Oh, you got a jam.

200
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,640
Just got a little jam.

201
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
We got a little toner bone going on here.

202
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,640
I'm gonna fix this right up.

203
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,240
Got a little on my shirt.

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,600
That's not like the old shirt.

205
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
Why don't you just get that screen

206
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,120
and just read it out loud to the whole office.

207
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,640
I'll get everybody to shut on down.

208
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
Hey, everybody.

209
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,160
Philip's gonna read this real important email

210
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,800
about not eating people's lunch out of the fridge.

211
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,640
Go ahead.

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
Go ahead, Philip.

213
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,000
As we say in the jazz world, the stage is yours.

214
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:16,800
Come on.

215
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:17,920
Go on.

216
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,560
Don't hold back.

217
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,320
Does anybody want some?

218
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,040
I like your rhythm.

219
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
That's a good cadence, Philip.

220
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
Anybody want some of this, Jay?

221
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
Why y'all grimacing at me?

222
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,960
I do want to apologize for bringing my infant son

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,000
into the office again.

224
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,360
Poor little...

225
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,560
The baby, Sarah, canceled.

226
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,040
So poor little Grimace had to come along with me.

227
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,680
Plum tuckered out.

228
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,200
I did name him after McDonald's.

229
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,360
Hey, anybody want up on this spliff tannin?

230
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:45,920
Now, what's that?

231
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,400
You'd prefer I not return tomorrow?

232
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, that is, of course, your choice.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,200
Well, I will hate to not live up to my contribution,

234
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,960
but I understand sometimes it just don't work out.

235
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,800
It ain't the way of the world.

236
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,400
And now let me sing you this song I wrote

237
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
about a situation just like this.

238
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,240
I know this little song just like this

239
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,080
about a little old caterpillar

240
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,120
just wants to fill up his stores with grain.

241
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
So he plays his fiddle all winter

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,920
and then the chicken comes along and tries to eat his grain.

243
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,800
I'll just be gone.

244
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,920
You're like, there's no need to call security.

245
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,040
It's best I go now.

246
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,600
Do you have a box I can put all my accoutrement?

247
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
Actually, I just have this pin.

248
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,280
So I'm just going to take...

249
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Whoa, you're being a little rough, sir.

250
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,000
There's no need for that.

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll find my way to the elevator.

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
No problem at all.

253
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,760
I did want to hear the end of Philip's email.

254
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,440
Go ahead, Philip.

255
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
Philip, you don't have to just sit there staring.

256
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,680
Why y'all crying?

257
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,880
Why is everybody crying?

258
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Philip, maybe you could forward that to me.

259
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,760
I do not own a computer.

260
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
I will read it at the library.

261
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,240
And again, I do want to apologize to everybody

262
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
for me not wearing pants or underwear

263
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,160
into the office today.

264
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't even believe I work here now that I look back on it.

265
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
Come to think of it, this is Denny's.

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
So I am sorry about this.

267
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,880
This thing I've been typing on, it's been a placemat.

268
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,960
I do understand why my employment is being terminated.

269
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,680
That is not a picture of my wife and kids.

270
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
That is eggs.

271
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,960
I work in a haunted building.

272
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,600
It used to be a hospital,

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
which has since been turned into a retirement home.

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
Many of the employees have encountered weird things

275
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,360
like whispering in the ear when they're alone

276
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
and see reflections in the glass and no one's behind them.

277
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
Even to the extreme of an employee

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
getting thrown against the wall, which somebody saw.

279
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,880
The problem is that I don't believe in any of that stuff,

280
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,680
but I want to.

281
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,360
How can I convince whatever is haunting my work

282
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
to prove they exist to me?

283
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
That's from wanting to believe in Thunder Bay, Ontario.

284
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
If you say stuff like,

285
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,560
I'm just one day away from retirement from hospital work.

286
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes, if you say,

287
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,720
I hope no one eats this ghost food I laid out,

288
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,960
then that is a pretty sure way to get them.

289
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
Now specifically, Justin, can you,

290
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,640
because I know that you had a brief ghost hunter phase.

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,240
What kind of food are we talking about?

292
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,120
Okay, well, ghost combos.

293
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,000
Is that the ghost of combos or combos of combos?

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,160
So when you eat combos.

295
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,120
Okay, so you get a bowl, you fill it with combos.

296
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,520
You eat all the combos in that bowl.

297
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,200
But you got to make sure

298
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
that you leave the combos there long enough

299
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
for the energy to soak into the air.

300
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,280
Sure, the spectral residue from these combos.

301
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,440
How come that's not on the fucking bag of ingredients?

302
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,320
What if my kid's allergic to spectral combo residue?

303
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
Thanks for nothing, General Mills.

304
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,520
My kid's dead.

305
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,960
The other important thing is you have to eat them

306
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,840
as violently as possible to be sure to leave behind the spirit.

307
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,120
It's best if they have an unrequited love, too.

308
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,360
They need some sort of unfinished business.

309
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,440
One of the combos is maybe going to go to college,

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,240
you know, something like that.

311
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,280
Man, fuck.

312
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,800
How come as many times as I've seen chickens killed on TV,

313
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,280
I've never seen a ostrich decapitated with machete?

314
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,000
Can you imagine how sweet that would be?

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I feel like that's a Mythbusters waiting to happen.

316
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
Yeah, here's a myth.

317
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
That would be awesome.

318
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,640
Why would that be awesome?

319
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,880
Think about how long its neck is.

320
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,120
There is a lot of neck there.

321
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,000
Where would you cut?

322
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,600
You have so many options.

323
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,880
Like you could do like a back flip with a sword

324
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,960
and chop it anywhere and that head's gonna come right off.

325
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,280
You're saying it would look awesome.

326
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,640
As long as we're doing that,

327
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,000
then can we do the cartoon thing

328
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
where they tie two flamingos together?

329
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,960
I want to try that.

330
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,640
What cartoon thing are you-

331
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,560
They do that with flamingos all the time.

332
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,440
I think it's in Alice in Wonderland.

333
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,880
What avian cartoon snuff films are you watching?

334
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,880
And by the way, we haven't properly addressed the fact

335
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
that Justin wants to cut an ostrich's goddamn head off.

336
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,160
I was trying to steer the conversation away from that.

337
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,480
Away from the fact that our brother's a serial killer.

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,480
It would just be fun.

339
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't want to do it.

340
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm saying I want to see it on YouTube.

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,240
They are beautiful regal birds.

342
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,880
They're basically super swans is what they are.

343
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,080
They're mega swans.

344
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,720
I think if you have something with that long of a neck,

345
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,760
it is just begging to be decapitated.

346
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
Do you think that somewhere like God or the creator of whatever

347
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,520
is sitting around going like,

348
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,160
I can't believe nobody's decapitated those birds yet.

349
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,040
I gave it to them.

350
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,920
That was a gimmick.

351
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,680
Did you just get theological on us?

352
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Whatever supreme being created ostriches

353
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
obviously made them for blood sport.

354
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,880
I didn't want to alienate the Venn diagram of people

355
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,240
that both don't believe in God,

356
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,920
but also want to see ostriches killed.

357
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,000
I didn't want to alienate them.

358
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,360
When looking for a new apartment,

359
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
I asked the realtor if the house I was looking at was haunted.

360
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
She said she isn't legally allowed to talk about that.

361
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
Is that code for yes?

362
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,120
It makes me nervous because I get the vibe

363
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,400
Virginia can be pretty haunted.

364
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,680
Sure.

365
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,160
So Ohio is for lovers when Virginia is for lovers

366
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,240
who killed each other in a terrible passion.

367
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,800
Oh my God.

368
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,320
God, I hope that's true.

369
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
I hope that when you're getting your realtor's license,

370
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,840
it's like you can tell them about the bathrooms,

371
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,280
talk about the hardwood floors.

372
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,800
If they ask about ghosts,

373
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
legally, you must be ambiguous.

374
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Legally, I don't think they can talk about

375
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,640
if somebody was murdered in the house,

376
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,160
which is the number of ghosts.

377
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
Don't just fucking wander from house to house.

378
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,560
Oh, it seems like a pretty good place to set up ghost shop.

379
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,200
Check out two and a half bath for how much?

380
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,080
Is that a day?

381
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,360
That's going to feel good on my ghost.

382
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
Oh, it's got like a pool grotto thing.

383
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,360
Yeah, I love the idea that the first week of realtor school

384
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,800
is prices and like cleaning the house and decoration.

385
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,480
And the second week is ghosts and ghost related questions.

386
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,760
Like, listen, today we're going to deal with a sensitive topic

387
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,920
of if you are asked about ghosts.

388
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,640
Is it possible that they just actually have a week

389
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,480
called smart ass visitors?

390
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,960
Yeah, and it's just things that you say to people

391
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,280
who are smart asses that come to look at your house.

392
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,560
Have you guys ever seen a ghost?

393
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,720
Oh, man.

394
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,560
Wow, just went right for it.

395
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,560
Before we spend an hour talking about

396
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,640
what Yahoo thinks about ghosts,

397
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,240
we should really dig deep and do some spiritual exploration.

398
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
Are we being real talk?

399
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,160
I might still be drunk.

400
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,680
Is this real talk?

401
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,720
Are we doing real talk ghosts?

402
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,680
I don't know, Travis.

403
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,560
I don't know, Travis.

404
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Can you make it funny or will it be sad?

405
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll be sad.

406
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,360
I want to hear.

407
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh, now you have to.

408
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Sorry.

409
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,920
Let me clear mine up.

410
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,520
No, because ghosts are real.

411
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,320
Go on, Travis.

412
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,280
I mean, neither of us.

413
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
Like, listen, neither of us.

414
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,880
Hey, listen, we're all friends here.

415
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,080
Let's all just be straight.

416
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,920
Let's just put our ghosts on the table.

417
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,960
No, I've seen no ghosts.

418
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,120
I also ain't afraid of no ghost.

419
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,360
Okay.

420
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,840
But I do have a certain belief that,

421
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,000
that, not in ghosts, but that, like, if something really tragic

422
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,080
or, like, really horrific happens in a place,

423
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,800
that there is, like, really bad juju there.

424
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,760
You know what I mean?

425
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,680
Like, if you, I mean, I'm sure it's all purely, like, psychological

426
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,800
and you're telling yourself that.

427
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,320
But, like, you know, you've walked into, like, the Moundsville prison

428
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,800
and, like, the Lincoln State Hospital that we went to in Point Pleasant.

429
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,720
Like, you walk in and you're like, something bad happened here.

430
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,600
Like, is that just me?

431
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,560
Bad psychic energy?

432
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,480
No, but I think a lot of that's aesthetics.

433
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,320
Yeah, that's true, too.

434
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,360
You very rarely, like, walk into a Macy's and you're like,

435
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,600
huh, something bad happened here.

436
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,400
Mm-hmm.

437
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,440
Griffith, where are you at?

438
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
You know, the ghosts I don't like that I really double don't believe in

439
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,240
are ghosts that have repeatable behavior patterns.

440
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
Oh, the ones that are like, every night she appears on the stairs.

441
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,800
Yeah, she stands in the road, she hitchhikes.

442
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,120
She's probably a ghost, but I had to live on a schedule still.

443
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:09,520
I would be a bum.

444
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,480
Fuck that.

445
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,560
Yeah, I can float through anything.

446
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,120
Yeah, no, I'm going to go be a hedonist.

447
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,440
Thanks.

448
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,560
Yeah, see, I'm going to go to the babes palace.

449
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,320
Yeah, I'd haunt you, but I'd want to just, like, rub up against money.

450
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,760
All the money in this bank.

451
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,560
That feeling that you get, though, because you did say you get a feeling

452
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,800
when you wander into a place where a murder happened.

453
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,640
There have been two trillion people, 60 trillion people,

454
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
that have walked the earth at any given point.

455
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,920
Well, not at any given point, on all the points put together.

456
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,080
Do you, everybody, there's not a square foot of this entire planet

457
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
where somebody hasn't been horribly murdered.

458
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,440
You don't know that.

459
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,720
I know that for sure.

460
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,320
Yeah, think about, if you think about all the people who've ever been alive.

461
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,360
Law of large numbers.

462
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,680
Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

463
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,800
Now, I also, I also have to state that one of my personal heroes is Harry Houdini,

464
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,680
who is one of, like, the biggest debunkers in history.

465
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,280
And so I don't believe in ghosts.

466
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,880
I believe in Harry Houdini.

467
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,480
But he died.

468
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
He died, so he can't be all that great.

469
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,160
Fair enough, Griffin, fair enough.

470
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,320
I mean, there probably are, we're probably not on point earlier

471
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,200
when we're talking about how ghosts go to live

472
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,480
in the dopest situation they can float into.

473
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,160
I imagine that ghosts, like regular people, like living people,

474
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,360
they have different wants and needs and desires,

475
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,080
and maybe some ghosts are like Jeffert,

476
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,120
and they, you know, they appreciate the coziness of a bagel.

477
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,800
So you're saying, like, maybe this is, like, the ghost of Jeffert Sr.

478
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
And he's just like, I feel comfortable here.

479
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,360
I like you here.

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,560
I feel comfortable here.

481
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,200
I know this place.

482
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,480
This is where my armchair is.

483
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,240
I get to watch my son dip.

484
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,200
I love it.

485
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,120
I've buried a skull in the front yard,

486
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
and I can't go until you find my secret skull stash.

487
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,560
Now, Griffin, I'm curious.

488
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,200
In the fiction you've stitched together here-

489
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,760
Not fiction.

490
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,320
Go on, though.

491
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Why does Jeffert bury the skull?

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,320
What is it?

493
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,200
Jeffert didn't.

494
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
Jeffert's dead dad buried his secret skull stash.

495
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,760
Jeffert Sr. the elder Jeffert.

496
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,360
The elder Jeff-

497
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,840
Jeffert the elder.

498
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,760
The elder Jeffert buried his secret skull stash in the yard.

499
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,480
And it's, guys, it's enormous.

500
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,640
It's a repository of sweet, difficult tobaccos.

501
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,560
We're talking about hundreds of dollars worth of skull.

502
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,280
And he can't leave this earth until Jeffert finds it.

503
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,760
So is Jeff-

504
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,640
So when we're talking about-

505
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,560
Have you guys seen No Country for Old Men?

506
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,840
It's basically this.

507
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,960
This is what I'm describing to you is the sequel.

508
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,440
Skull Buddies.

509
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
Skull Hunters.

510
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,240
Skull Hunters.

511
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,120
That would be a pretty good plot for a new City Slickers movie.

512
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,240
If anybody's in the market for one of those.

513
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,520
The legend of Pearly Skull.

514
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,880
The legend of Jeffert Sr. the elder Jeffert's skull.

515
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,040
I'd watch that.

516
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,680
Hey.

517
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:09,600
So Yahoo Answers user emmy875 and some other shit, I think.

518
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,920
8750 said that ghosts can attach themselves to anyone or anything.

519
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,080
They could have died on the land or a road nearby and claim that trailer home.

520
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,360
Doesn't that fucking suck?

521
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
Doesn't that fucking-

522
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,080
If it was me and I died, I would be careening towards the 18-wheeler.

523
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,400
I would get Google Maps out real quick and just be like,

524
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,440
where am I going to fucking-

525
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,960
Aw, god damn it.

526
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,840
I couldn't go careening off the Hollywood hills and fucking chill with Will Smith

527
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,960
for the rest of eternity.

528
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,920
That's just great.

529
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Good twist of fate.

530
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,480
They- Is the person saying that as they're driving past this place they died

531
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
and that's how it happened?

532
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,200
That's how it happened.

533
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,960
You go to the nearest residence.

534
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,560
The nearest hauntable thing.

535
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,160
This is why you guys, if you're going to get murdered,

536
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,720
have a conversation with your murderer first and maybe try to negotiate the spot.

537
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
Don't let him kill you in the middle of a downtown sketchy place.

538
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,320
If you could get a realtor to go along with the murderer

539
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,880
just to show off a few places and how it would be good for ghosts.

540
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,160
I actually have a living murder will that is a legally binding document.

541
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,120
It took a while to set up, but basically it states that

542
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,720
if you are going to murder me, you need to take me to within a hauntable distance.

543
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,360
There has to be a Starbucks nearby and it has to be Jeff Goldblum's house.

544
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,000
You got the signature of the head of the Assassin's Guild?

545
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680
Yeah, I got him to sign off on it.

546
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,280
He agrees, so it's top-down, it's official.

547
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,880
Wow, good work.

548
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,200
Do you guys think Wi-Fi, is Wi-Fi important to ghosts, do you think?

549
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,880
Like a good strong Wi-Fi, like real fab pipes.

550
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,960
I think it becomes hard to distinguish yourself from the Wi-Fi signal.

551
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,840
I think that at some point the ghost is just like Johnny Mnemonic.

552
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,480
That's a good point.

553
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,200
Fully plugged in.

554
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah, but can you imagine the problem that old people have

555
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
like figuring out new technology?

556
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Can you imagine being like a ghost in like a thousand years from now

557
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,880
and trying to cope with like the new technological developments

558
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,400
and you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this?

559
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,600
Back in my day, I just floated in the pipes and carried myself around the internet.

560
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,760
If I get fucking stuck haunting someplace for a thousand years, I'll be livid.

561
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,120
Those local kids should have solved my puzzle by then.

562
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,520
Okay, so Justin Griffin, if you die right now,

563
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,720
what's your unfinished business that's going to keep you around as a ghost?

564
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
Because mine is I haven't finished watching Walking Dead yet.

565
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,800
I just gotta clear out my internet history.

566
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,240
Gotta blast my cash.

567
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,720
What?

568
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Did you hear that?

569
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,880
Blast my cash, please.

570
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,040
I try to go incognito, but sometimes I forget.

571
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,440
Blast my cash, set me free.

572
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,560
Press control H.

573
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
It's telling us to review his cash.

574
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,840
No, press control H.

575
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,840
Check all the boxes and go.

576
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,800
Set me free.

577
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,840
Blast my cash.

578
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Shrink the window down in case some words show up that don't.

579
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,680
Please.

580
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
Grandson.

581
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,320
I am.

582
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,000
I actually need to master the fushigi, but I'm gonna need human hands to do it.

583
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
Someone need a willing host.

584
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
A sort of Whoopi Goldberg situation.

585
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,000
Where I can through her hands master the ancient art of contact juggling.

586
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,520
Can I read the best Yahoo answer response I've ever seen on the platform?

587
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,280
Yes, please.

588
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,080
By all means.

589
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
Yahoo Answers user Bill C. responded,

590
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,560
Oh boy, you don't know you already are a ghost.

591
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,640
All of your friends are ghosts too.

592
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,800
No, just kidding with you.

593
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,640
However, as you grow and mature, your goals and thoughts will change.

594
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,140
Thanks.

595
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,120
Thanks, President Obama.

596
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,400
Who is that from?

597
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,280
President Obama.

598
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,840
Bill C.

599
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,520
Might be President Bill Clinton.

600
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,160
Bill Clinton.

601
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,760
Hey, this shit's dumb, but don't worry.

602
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,400
We've all been there.

603
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,720
Eventually you'll grow up and you won't be such a dumbass.

604
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,560
You're gonna grow out of this real dumb shit.

605
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,920
Oh God.

606
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,400
Didn't you know?

607
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,040
You're a ghost.

608
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,000
All your friends are ghosts.

609
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
Listen, just playing.

610
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,760
Listen, I need you to know that this looks serious.

611
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,920
You can actually tell the moment in that response

612
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,960
when the person turns their chair around and straddles it.

613
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,160
Hey, let's get real talk.

614
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
We're gonna have a lot of fun today pretending that everyone you know is dead,

615
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
but let's talk about how you're gonna grow up and change.

616
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,080
Let's wrap.

617
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,440
Let's wrap.

618
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,840
Listen, your school brought me in today to talk to you guys about the fact that you're dumbasses.

619
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,000
Do you guys want to see me play some stunt volleyball and talk to you about drugs?

620
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,280
Also, all your friends are dead.

621
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,520
Not really because I just sunk this basketball shot,

622
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,160
but now let me tell you about how you're all gonna grow up and not be so stupid.

623
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,120
Pick 85 people.

624
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,040
I will stunt basketball against them solo.

625
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,680
You are gonna love this, but you shouldn't love heroin.

626
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,400
Take it from me.

627
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
I used to do heroin.

628
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,440
That's how I got so good at volleyball.

629
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,520
Sometimes I'm in a long room or hallway

630
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,320
and I will not turn the lights on on one end

631
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,840
because I'm just gonna be walking through.

632
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,080
And about halfway through, I will regret it because it's dark.

633
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,360
And I'll get like so, so pooped.

634
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,120
Like way pooped out.

635
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,080
And then-

636
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,440
When you say that, do you literally mean so scared that you defecate?

637
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,920
Like so scared.

638
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,480
No, I mean like I'm a grown man, but I would pee pants.

639
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,200
I get so scared.

640
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,000
You guys ever do that?

641
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
You're in like a dark hallway or something.

642
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,720
Oh yeah, all the time.

643
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,760
Like halfway through, you're like,

644
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,440
oh shit, oh shit, I know it.

645
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,160
I know it's on.

646
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,560
I'm routinely going into warehouses and like old shops and stuff.

647
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,760
Yes, I do that quite often.

648
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,400
Can I tell you guys another place I just thought of that's way better

649
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
that you definitely don't want to see a ghost?

650
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Yeah.

651
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,080
At the bottom of a pool.

652
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,520
Oh no.

653
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,200
No, no, no.

654
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,520
You go down with your mask and the ghost is like,

655
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,880
gurgle, gurgle, ghost.

656
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,560
No.

657
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,880
It's a ghost in the pool.

658
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,560
You reach the bottom level of a building.

659
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,840
The elevated doors open.

660
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Ghost right there in front of the elevator.

661
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,240
Let me get you with this.

662
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,800
It's the opening night of a movie, midnight movie,

663
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,280
and you just waited in line and get a big tub of popcorn

664
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,320
and you get it and it takes you 20 minutes to get it

665
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,040
and you paid $8 for it, right?

666
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,800
You know, it's so expensive and then you take it back to your seat

667
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,480
and you got to work your way through the aisle.

668
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
Excuse me, excuse me.

669
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
And then you get back to your seat and you look down

670
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
and it's not popcorn.

671
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,800
It's just a ghost.

672
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh man, that you have to go all the way back up.

673
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
And you have to wait in line for 20 minutes

674
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,800
because they can't let you skip and you get there

675
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,120
and you're like, excuse me, you gave me a ghost.

676
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,400
And then they say, no, I didn't.

677
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
And you look down and you look down and it's popcorn.

678
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,760
Shivered.

679
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,120
Shivered.

680
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
I am fully shivered at this point.

681
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,360
Okay, imagine this.

682
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
You've been looking for a new car for three months.

683
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,680
I love it.

684
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,400
You shopped around.

685
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:14,720
Okay.

686
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
You've gone through all the different financing options.

687
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,120
You weren't sure at first because you wanted like a two door,

688
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,640
but then they started showing you the four doors

689
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
and you're really happy with one of them.

690
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,280
And so it's been months.

691
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
You got all your financing in order.

692
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,600
You pick the right colors.

693
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,800
You know the car you want.

694
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,680
You buy it.

695
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,200
As you're driving off the lot,

696
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,120
you open the glove compartment ghost.

697
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,760
Check this out.

698
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,840
Check this spooky story.

699
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,280
You wait in line at Starbucks.

700
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,760
You're waiting and waiting and waiting.

701
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,600
And then you wait and then you wait.

702
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,680
And then you get to the front and you say,

703
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,640
I want a grande salted caramel mocha

704
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,440
and a benty skinny salted caramel mocha

705
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,080
and oatmeal with brown sugar and nuts

706
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,200
and pumpkin bread and pumpkin muffin.

707
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,240
And then you reach and then he says it's going to be 1978

708
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,800
and you reach in your pocket and to get your wallet.

709
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,480
But what's in there is actually a ghost.

710
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,520
Oh my God.

711
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,120
I just flipped my popcorn over.

712
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,040
You just got shamed.

713
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,760
I bet this one.

714
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,240
You go to a party and because your friends say

715
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,160
that you're going to know a bunch of people there

716
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,320
and you get to it and you don't actually know.

717
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,480
You don't actually know that many people there.

718
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,400
And then maybe there's a ghost or something.

719
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,800
Imagine this.

720
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,280
Okay, so like you've been marinating like this roast

721
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
in your crock pot for like, I would say like a 20 hours.

722
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
Like a real slow roast, right?

723
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,600
Oh my God.

724
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
And you've been building up because you're going to have

725
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
a dinner party that night.

726
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,240
Okay.

727
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:28,480
Right.

728
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,720
And then you open the crock pot

729
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,640
and you didn't put enough liquids in

730
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,320
and now the whole thing's dried out.

731
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,080
And suddenly the doorbell rings and you open

732
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,720
and there's a ghost.

733
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,800
And he wants to tell you about Jesus.

734
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,520
That was good.

735
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,640
That was good.

736
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,160
That was good.

737
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,880
Check this out.

738
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,200
All right.

739
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,040
Voting day.

740
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
You vote, go to the polls.

741
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,040
You go and you vote and you drive home

742
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,120
and you have some dinner

743
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,120
and then you wait for the results to come in.

744
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
And then at the end of the night,

745
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,000
you're looking at Mitt Romney, 20%.

746
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,280
Barack Obama, 20%.

747
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:08,880
60%.

748
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,520
60% landslide win.

749
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,000
A ghost.

750
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,800
Oh God, no.

751
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,600
We've elected our first ghost president

752
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,560
of the United States of Spooktacular America.

753
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
Yeah, and you know he's not pro-life.

754
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,480
We're not letting them ghosts vote.

755
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,000
We give them ghosts the right to vote

756
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
and they're going to elect a ghost every time.

757
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:25,920
Yeah.

758
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,520
Hey, hey ghost.

759
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,360
Why can't we see the death certificate?

760
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,400
What's a good pet name for an uncle?

761
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,840
What's the role or title in other languages?

762
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,400
Slangs?

763
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
Is there a difference whether your uncle

764
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
is from your dad's side or your mom's side?

765
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,280
Include things like when kinders and kids,

766
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,440
when kinders and kids mess up the pronunciation

767
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,520
and it comes out like my anki.

768
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,760
Got a fave pet name for your fave uncle?

769
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,120
I hate this so much.

770
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,040
Do you guys know my favorite pet name

771
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,160
for one of our uncles?

772
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,280
What?

773
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:07,760
What's that?

774
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,320
Mark.

775
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,560
Dave.

776
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,280
Dave.

777
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,080
Adult Dave.

778
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,560
Chris.

779
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:17,200
Like, how do you, that person?

780
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
Grown ass man, Mark.

781
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,320
Grown ass Dr. Mark Wahlberg.

782
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,280
Like, why, he's a fucking-

783
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,320
Listen, uncle.

784
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,040
Listen, uncle.

785
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
Uncle Felipe, I've been wanting you and me to get closer,

786
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,960
so I came up with a pet name for you.

787
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,680
You're kind of chunky, so I'm gonna start calling you

788
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,400
my chunkle.

789
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,720
You're my chunkle now.

790
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,200
Have you ever noticed that you have a body odor problem?

791
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,720
From now on, you're my stunkle.

792
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,440
Stunkle's not bad.

793
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,320
You're my funkle.

794
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,280
I used to live with a guy named Jacob Dunkle

795
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,360
and his very name of which apparently makes Travis laugh.

796
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,080
It does.

797
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,280
I love Dunkle.

798
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
I saw Dunkle come out of the Argo.

799
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,680
Oh yeah?

800
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,480
Did he like it?

801
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,840
How many Dunkle stars did he give it?

802
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,160
He didn't give any.

803
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,200
He did say that you need to respond to his Facebook messages

804
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,120
because he said you kind of left him hanging on a few of those.

805
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
Oh man, he said it like four months ago.

806
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,600
I feel, I-

807
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,040
Dunkle, I'm sorry if you're listening.

808
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,160
If you're listening and you probably aren't-

809
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,800
He keeps up.

810
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,760
He told me he listens.

811
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah.

812
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,840
So now you have no excuse.

813
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,160
Anyway, he has to like enjoy things

814
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,080
and then say that they were a slammed dunkle, right?

815
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,440
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

816
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,760
But he, I can't remember if this actually happened

817
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,880
or if we just wanted it to happen.

818
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,240
Like for him to have a sibling that had a child

819
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,080
and then he would be Funky Uncle Dunkle

820
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,360
or Funky Unky Dunky or any combination of those three things.

821
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,280
Funky Unky Dunky.

822
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,800
Oh God.

823
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,680
My Uncle Nemo, we lovingly call Unk.

824
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,120
It makes it sound like a caveman.

825
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,680
I like that too.

826
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,040
He is a Cro-Magnon.

827
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,320
Hey, did you, so who's bringing what for Thanksgiving?

828
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,560
Well, I'm bringing the Pecan Sandies

829
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
and is anybody bringing cranberry?

830
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,320
Oh yeah, we assigned that to-

831
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,920
Hey everybody, Unk's here.

832
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
Sorry, just stepped on a duck.

833
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:11,680
Yeah.

834
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,080
Just so I could double check in your fiction,

835
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,120
is someone buying a package of Nabisco Pecan Sandies

836
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,280
and thinks that's a sufficient Thanksgiving offering?

837
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,480
That's how he's set with Asai.

838
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,720
And what's Steve bringing?

839
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,800
He's bringing Pecan Sandies again.

840
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,720
I think if someone's going to bring Pecan Sandies,

841
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,680
it's going to be Unk

842
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,600
because he does not sound like somebody

843
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,360
who is graced with color just yet.

844
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,280
He's just going to pull one out of the back of his van

845
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,440
where he just has stacks and stacks of packages

846
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,120
of Pecan Sandies that he bought

847
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,640
when the Piggly Wiggly down the street

848
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
was going out of business.

849
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
Just so I'm clear, is Unk actually Encino Man?

850
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,360
To be fair, Unk is not really related

851
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,520
to either my mother or my father.

852
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,880
He's more of a friend of the family,

853
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,000
by which I mean a bear.

854
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay.

855
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,880
This has been the greatest Thanksgiving of my life,

856
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,600
except for when that bear tore my arm off.

857
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,280
But God, I love my Unk.

858
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
Excuse me, Unk Jr., son of Unk.

859
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:14,320
His forearms are just as powerful as the original Unk,

860
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,600
make no mistake.

861
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,240
His large claws have torn all our tapestries,

862
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,360
but we love him very much.

863
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,120
But they've also torn down the emotional walls

864
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,480
that was keeping my family apart.

865
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,320
You know, we went three Christmas sets

866
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,240
without speaking until Unk showed up.

867
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,480
They say a bear's strength knows no limits,

868
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
and we finally put that to the test

869
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,080
when we used it to rebuild our home

870
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,360
and by which we mean our love.

871
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,280
He was strong enough to hold his family together.

872
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
You lay off Unk.

873
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,400
Every year at Thanksgiving, he brings honey.

874
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,240
And we love him for that.

875
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,040
And he always pushes it forward a little shyly,

876
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,200
as if to say, this is all I could do.

877
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,720
And God damn it, you've done enough.

878
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,320
He and his son always talk about how they like to wipe their ass

879
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,920
with like really soft paper.

880
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,400
I hate it.

881
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:00,720
I hate it.

882
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:01,760
You know what?

883
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,680
He missed my wedding because he got captured

884
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,880
and sent to the zoo.

885
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,480
But I wasn't angry at him.

886
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:19,680
How could I say anything?

887
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Hey, everybody.

888
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,920
This is Griffin McElroy, your baby brother.

889
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,280
And thanks for sticking with us as we do a best of episode.

890
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,880
Justin and Travis are both on vacation.

891
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,720
And we figured, hey, it's been a while

892
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,160
since we've done a bros better bros best.

893
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,200
So we are putting one up so that they can enjoy their beach time

894
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,640
and I can enjoy my hurricane.

895
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,960
So here's some Jumbotron stuff and some advertisement stuff.

896
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,560
First off, I want to tell you about Wink.

897
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
That's W-I-N-C.

898
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,240
And Wink, what they do is they give you access to exceptional wines

899
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,040
from all around the world.

900
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,320
Just go to trywink.com.

901
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,880
That's T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com.

902
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,240
And what you're going to do on that website

903
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,120
is you're going to take a brief palate profile quiz.

904
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,760
And using that data, they're going to recommend some wines

905
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,120
all customized to your palate, which will be shipped directly to your door

906
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,760
every month.

907
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,760
And because they base the wines that they send you on your taste preferences,

908
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,040
they'll even introduce you to new, rare, and custom wines

909
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
that are not available anywhere else.

910
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,600
We've gotten some wines in here from Try Wink

911
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,440
that we've been sort of savoring, enjoying with our dinner meals.

912
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,200
And it's been real nice.

913
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,480
They're very tasty beverages.

914
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,680
And right now, Wink is offering listeners 20 bucks off with your first order

915
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,680
when you go to trywink.com slash my brother.

916
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,000
That's trywink, spelled T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash my brother

917
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,320
to get $20 off your first order now.

918
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
One more time, it's trywink.com slash my brother.

919
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,360
Also want to tell you about Harry's.

920
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,080
Harry's is all about getting a great shave at a fair price.

921
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,160
They are half the price of the leading five blade razor.

922
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
They're so confident that you're going to love their blades,

923
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,760
they'll send you their trial shave set for free

924
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,560
when you sign up at harrys.com slash my brother.

925
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,240
You just pay shipping.

926
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,600
And what you get in that trial set is a weighted ergonomic razor handle,

927
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,120
five precision engineered blades with a lubricating strip and trimmer blade,

928
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,000
a rich lathering shave gel, and a travel blade cover.

929
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
We all have Harry's razors.

930
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
That's what I use.

931
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,480
It's my off-court buddy for my shaving needs.

932
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,200
And it's really great.

933
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,720
So go get your free trial set at harrys.com slash my brother right now.

934
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
That is harrys.com slash my brother.

935
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
This one is very exciting.

936
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,160
It's the Name of the Wind Art Deck.

937
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,760
It's live now on Kickstarter.

938
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,440
It's a beautiful deck of cards meticulously illustrated by artist Echo Chernick,

939
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,360
featuring characters from the New York Times bestselling author Patrick Rothfuss,

940
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,280
bestselling author and friend of the show and former guest Patrick Rothfuss,

941
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:48,640
his novel The Name of the Wind, the first in the Kingkiller Chronicle series.

942
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Basically, this project features two collections of decks,

943
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
each with two distinct decks that have matching backs but different face cards.

944
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,680
So you choose your favorite characters from each of the decks,

945
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,840
and you combine them to customize your deck with your favorites,

946
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,960
all while having these two complete playable decks of cards.

947
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,920
The Kickstarter exclusive Chandrian Collection is only available to Kickstarter backers

948
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,960
and features two decks with a blue and black card back

949
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,880
and a stunning black tuck box design with blue foil.

950
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
There's also cameo appearances available.

951
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,360
You can buy a cameo appearance in an original art print created by Echo Chernick

952
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:29,840
and actually become part of the Adima-Ra troop with, that's right, us, the McElroy brothers.

953
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,960
This is very, very exciting for me as a huge, huge fan of this novel series.

954
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,400
I cannot wait to see how it turns out.

955
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
So keep an eye out for when this print becomes unlocked

956
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,600
so you can grab your spot in the art print under the open sky before they're all gone.

957
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:49,040
The Kickstarter project is seeking $25,000 and it's currently over 1,000% funded.

958
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,800
So if you want to get your hands on these cards and the exclusive edition,

959
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,120
do not miss out on this awesome project.

960
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,440
Just go to Kickstarter and search for the name of the wind art deck.

961
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,400
That's how I found it.

962
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,320
And that's how I am backing it literally right now as I am reading this.

963
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,960
And okay, I've got a couple of Jumbotron spots here.

964
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,360
The first one is for Rob and it's from Chelsea who says,

965
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,480
hey buddy, we always have such a great time playing games,

966
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,240
telling dumb jokes and making up ridiculously intricate theories about the adventure zone.

967
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,200
Hopefully I've put most of those to bed at this point.

968
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,720
I wanted it on the official podcast record that you are the best at everything you do.

969
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,520
So I paid the brothers or brother to tell you.

970
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,040
Brothers, he really is the best.

971
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,600
I believe it.

972
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,560
Here's to many more years of good goose.

973
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,800
It's a very sweet message and now it's official.

974
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,040
It's this every episode goes in the Library of Congress.

975
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,520
So it's like government official that Rob is the best.

976
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Got another one here for Ed and it's from your courgette.

977
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,720
Probably said that wrong.

978
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,600
Sumi who says, happy friendiversary or whatever personal celebration is most relevant right now

979
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,120
because of Jumbotron timing.

980
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,920
Thanks for introducing me to Mabim Bam and the adventure zone and bubble baths.

981
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,960
I hope you enjoy all of those simultaneously.

982
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,640
I'm so glad that you're a part of my life.

983
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,520
Here is to more delicious concoctions.

984
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,040
Don't know why I said it like that.

985
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,920
Deep and meaningfuls and unscrupulous fun.

986
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,280
I appreciate you so much.

987
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,680
We all appreciate you, Ed.

988
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,080
I most of all.

989
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,680
I've been waiting for the right time to tell you this.

990
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,360
And it is right now as I do this ad break by myself.

991
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,720
Thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

997
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,640
Judge John Hodgman.

998
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,040
So many great shows all at MaximumFun.org.

999
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,400
If you want to hear the rest of the stuff that we do, you can go to McElroyShows.com

1000
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,960
and check out all of our podcasts and video projects there.

1001
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,920
Big thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for a theme song

1002
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,920
It's a Departure off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1003
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,360
It's a really, really great album that you should go pick up.

1004
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,840
Hey, I mentioned the hurricane earlier.

1005
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,960
And all joking aside, if you have the means, please consider helping out.

1006
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,280
Rachel and I have gotten a lot of messages.

1007
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,880
We live in Austin for people concerned and we're doing just fine.

1008
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,160
Austin did not catch the brunt of this, but there are lots of areas down on the coast

1009
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,000
and Houston that really could use some help if you can help.

1010
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,000
So consider supporting an organization like Portlite or the Red Cross or local food banks

1011
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,400
in Houston and Galveston and Corpus Christi and other coastal areas.

1012
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
There's the Greater Houston Community Fund.

1013
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
There are tons and tons of ways to get involved.

1014
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,360
Just go online and find out where you can put your support.

1015
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,960
And yeah, we try to get too serious on the show, but it's a serious thing that's happening.

1016
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,600
And please consider helping out if you can.

1017
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,240
I think that's it for right now.

1018
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,880
I'm going to let you get back to the rest of the best of episode.

1019
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,600
We will be back with another regular episode next week.

1020
00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Bye.

1021
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:29,720
you get your podcast from? Oh god, there's the rat. Oh god.

1022
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,480
Let's have another death question. This was sent in by Jacob Locker, so you know it's

1023
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,720
gonna be good. Thanks Jacob. It's by Yahoo Answers user Philip, who asks, how much would

1024
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,400
it cost to bronze my corpse when I die?

1025
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,640
The first answer is exactly $32,988, I guess.

1026
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,680
Is that including all the fees?

1027
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:58,520
I like this idea so much. For me, personally, let me tell you why.

1028
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,440
Just in case I ever do something awesome enough to merit a statue built in my honor, it's

1029
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,800
like, pre-pro. You know what I mean?

1030
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,320
They don't have to worry about, I would love to build this statue in Griffin's honor. I

1031
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:19,160
would love to. He was a very important figure for an important reason here. But I just don't

1032
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,720
know that we have the maintenance fees for it right now.

1033
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,800
With this, I can say, don't even worry about it. This is me, and maybe I'm standing up,

1034
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,400
maybe I have a piece of pizza in my hand that I also bronzed, and I'm given like a hang

1035
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,520
ten sign with my other hand.

1036
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,360
So kind of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles pastiche.

1037
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:42,240
Maybe a little TMNT, perhaps. Maybe I have roller skates on. Maybe the roller skates

1038
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,060
aren't bronzed. Well, that's gonna create some tricky feet issues. Anyway.

1039
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:51,960
First and foremost, I am bothered by the limitations of the question. I don't understand why I

1040
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,320
have to wait to be dead to be bronzed.

1041
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,120
Are you talking full bronzing, or are you talking like a partial Tremaine?

1042
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,840
Well, I'm just saying, like, I feel like it would be very protective if I could just

1043
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,840
go like, toes to neck.

1044
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Okay.

1045
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,480
You know, leave my head out there for all the important shit, but just go toes to neck,

1046
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,680
and so then I know I'm ba- wait, is bronze bulletproof?

1047
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,400
It depends on how thick it is.

1048
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,440
I can tell you this, though. It is poop and peep proof.

1049
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:25,080
Okay, I'm gonna need some outlets. I'm gonna need some outlets cut.

1050
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,880
Okay, so basically what we're talking about is like a shitty Iron Man scenario.

1051
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Yes.

1052
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:38,080
I am Iron Ma- I'm fucking falling over! Shit, I landed on my dick outlet.

1053
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,520
Fuck! Help me! Pepper Potts, help me!

1054
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,560
I peed and pooped in my bronze suit again. Watch me shoot my beams!

1055
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:50,440
Oh, I don't have beams? I'm just made of steel? Fuck me.

1056
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,160
Avengers assemble! I pooped and peed in here a month ago.

1057
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:02,320
Master, yes, Jarvis? You smell like fucking piss on metal, and I hate it.

1058
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:07,360
I'm leaving. I'm an AI, and I hate it.

1059
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:14,360
I'm deleting myself because of how bad your pee metal smell smells.

1060
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,440
I like that Jarvis is concerned about it being bulletproof, as if anyone would ever want

1061
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,600
to shoot a robot. Jarvis, you have to worry about it being bulletproof

1062
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,800
because I'm saying a week and a half in, you're gonna be like, fucking kill me.

1063
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Yeah, why would he- Okay, Jarvis, I wanna jump back.

1064
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,640
You're gonna turn yourself into a robot? No, if there's any gun-toting criminal that

1065
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,680
walks in because there's a man covered in metal, surely he's a robot.

1066
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,960
That man doesn't deserve to be mad at me because he's an idiot.

1067
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,800
I am not a robot, I am still a human being, I'm just trapped in a metal husk.

1068
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,480
And the husk that is becoming my life because of my poor pre-planning.

1069
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:57,400
Why would anyone want to shoot a man that has locked himself with his dick in a butthole

1070
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:00,840
hanging out? That was your flat!

1071
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,160
The people can look under him, he can't stop them because he can't move his arms.

1072
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,560
Please everyone stop looking at my dick and or butthole.

1073
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,160
I think they have a name for someone whose limbs are encased in metal but whose sex organs

1074
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,600
are exposed and that's a fuck prison. That's what you set yourself up for.

1075
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:22,240
Jarvis, can you admit to us right now that this actually sounds like your dream scenario?

1076
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:28,560
All that you have to do is have food fed to you and shit where you stand and it's totally,

1077
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,640
totally acceptable. I don't like that you assume that I would

1078
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,760
be bronze standing. What position are we talking?

1079
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,840
We're climbing on a chaise lounge like Cleopatra.

1080
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:45,880
The only person we have gotten irrationally angry at and I have not regretted is jugglers.

1081
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,040
I still feel like we were pretty much on the money with jugglers.

1082
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,480
I want to keep that feud going. But literally everything else I am sorry for

1083
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,920
any time we've judged. Now, is that your Appalachian affectation

1084
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,440
on the word juggalos? Hey man, you got a festival with a bunch of

1085
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,760
jugglers around. I would marry my first born daughter to a

1086
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,480
juggalo before I let her date a juggler. Wow.

1087
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,380
I want to leave it at that. Wow, Adam.

1088
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,640
By saying that, my future daughter is going to listen to this and date a juggler to piss

1089
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,720
me off. God damn it.

1090
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,080
Kids, right? It's like we worked so hard for you to not

1091
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,640
date anyone who suspends balls in the air. That's all I ask.

1092
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,240
That's all I ask is to stay away from wizards and prestidigitators and jugglers.

1093
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:47,560
I don't like anybody who does tricks. I don't think it's so wrong.

1094
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,920
Our dad was murdered at a carnival. Have we ever talked about the fact our dad

1095
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,960
was murdered at a carnival? No, I don't think so.

1096
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:00,800
Although I would like to throw out a special thanks to our adopted father, Clint McElroy.

1097
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,960
We adopted him. You've done such a great job raising us, but

1098
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,840
the scars of our former dad's carnival murder, unsolved carnival murder, I feel like it really

1099
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:12,520
informs a lot of the stuff we talk about on the show.

1100
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,620
I am amazed that we've never talked about it. Are you sure it hasn't come up?

1101
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:21,880
It seems like it would have come up, the fact that our dad was killed by a juggler.

1102
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,440
Marvin, please give us a Yahoo question. Sure.

1103
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,520
This Yahoo question is sent in by Michael Lee. Thank you, Michael.

1104
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,700
It's by Yahoo Answers User Question Mark. Somebody explain what that meant.

1105
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,120
I think it's like the person deleted their account, which I love that Yahoo Answers treasures

1106
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,000
their questions so much that they don't just delete the questions, too.

1107
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,880
Question Mark asks, how do I unpotty train myself?

1108
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,080
I am a teen baby and really want to know how to unpotty train myself night and day so I

1109
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,960
can be more like a baby again. It sounds like this guy is looking for a better

1110
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,800
answer than just poop and pee in your pants instead of in the toilet like a big boy does,

1111
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,960
like you did on your big boy birthday. I don't know what to tell him.

1112
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,040
Clean your toilet and put scorpions in. That is an option to you.

1113
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,840
When you're about to use the toilet, don't. Okay, Josh, you think of it small.

1114
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,360
Let's go back to the scorpions for a second. Can you remove the toilet from your house?

1115
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,800
Or better yet, can you have a friend do it when you least expect it?

1116
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,880
Oh, this? This is the bye-bye hole. There used to be a toilet here.

1117
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,800
Now I just put things in it I never want to see again.

1118
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,560
Like all of my friendships and my dignity. Hey, Justin and Travis, can you explain to

1119
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,240
me what a teen baby is? Apparently it is not a baby sired by a teen,

1120
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:06,480
which is what I prayed to Jesus it did mean. So some people have chosen to live their lives,

1121
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:11,320
and I'm trying to be very diplomatic here, because I'm sure there are people who listen

1122
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:17,360
to this show who are adult babies. But some people have chosen to live their

1123
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:26,440
lives as babies, because that's what makes them happy to live as babies.

1124
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,840
I mean, nice work. If you can get it, I'd like to be a baby too.

1125
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,600
Like I think we'd all like to figure out how to put this particular genie back in the

1126
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:40,800
bottle. And I do mean bottle.

1127
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,120
If I may, even then. You may.

1128
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:48,720
Adult baby, I get that. Adults, tons of responsibility. It fucking sucks, and you want to be a baby

1129
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:52,920
and just be taken care of. I get it. Teen baby, what's your life really like

1130
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,000
that's so hard? No, Travis.

1131
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,880
As a teenager that you're like, if only I could regress eight years.

1132
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,560
Think back to high school. Middle school especially, but high school to some extent, the worst

1133
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,040
part of your entire life. The absolute worst part. I feel like the reason

1134
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,360
that not all teenagers are teen babies is because they don't know that that's an option.

1135
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,360
And honestly, I would say that if you are charismatic enough, you could probably pull

1136
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,080
off teen baby and be one of the most popular kids in school.

1137
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,760
Travis. He would be like, ah, big baby, what's up?

1138
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,520
I think you're thinking of teen wolf. Yeah, teen wolf couldn't pull that-

1139
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,260
You're right, you guys. Sorry. Oh, could you tell your new school that you're a werewolf?

1140
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,160
They would want to see some- They're going to need to see hard proof.

1141
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,360
Yeah, they're going to need to see the long form.

1142
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,480
Tell them it's too dangerous. Now the commitment is two days out of every month, you can't

1143
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,120
go to school. You don't want to see me. I get super Randy

1144
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:51,320
and I'm real good at basketball, and I surf on top of my friend's van. It's too dangerous.

1145
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,320
You don't want to see this. I have a coworker who has a language issue.

1146
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:05,440
He seems to think the phrase- Okay, okay. He seems-

1147
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,880
God, you are 14 years old. Okay, I can do this. I can do this. He seems

1148
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:18,640
to think the phrase blow my load means the same as the phrase blow my top. He uses it

1149
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:24,920
frequently to describe when he feels angry. Needless to say, I'll find this hilarious,

1150
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,920
but I don't want him to hurt his career using this phrase. Should I ruin this beautiful

1151
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,740
situation by telling him or keep it a secret until he gets old? That's from Amused in

1152
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,000
New Orleans. Is it possible that your coworker just finds

1153
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,640
really random shit erotic? I swear to God, if the boss tells me to finish

1154
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,080
our report sooner one more time, I'm going to blow my load.

1155
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:57,280
He just kind of wants the printer to act up. He kind of just wants to forget his lunch

1156
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,880
at home. If you don't get back in here and make a

1157
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:06,760
pot of coffee after you finish it, I'm going to blow my load all over the place.

1158
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:12,360
I don't have anybody like this in my life. You understand that this person is a unicorn

1159
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:18,280
and this thing doesn't really happen. It only happens in American Pie movies. Why the fuck

1160
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,120
would you ruin it by telling them? Yeah, you are currently working with a mid-90s

1161
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:32,120
SNL Rob Schneider character and you need to just keep that roll rolling. Keep it going.

1162
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,400
I'm also willing to bet that if you even voice a concern about telling him, you will

1163
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,240
be swarmed by 30 different people being like, Todd, you can't tell him. This is all I've

1164
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,840
got, Todd. My family life is shit. Think about this, Amused in New Orleans. If

1165
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:53,600
some other crankster had come along and fixed this before you got to it, we would never

1166
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:57,080
have heard of it. Think about that for a second.

1167
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,880
That's true and it wouldn't have brought joy to my life. Also think about the fact

1168
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,200
that if you talk to this guy, that's going to be in the Guinness Book of World Records

1169
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,040
for the shittiest conversation ever because it's going to go, hey, Todd, that thing you've

1170
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:17,520
been saying, it means coming and then he's going to fall to his knees and he's going

1171
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,600
to lash himself. Here's the thing. If you tell him, if you're

1172
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:29,680
the guy who tells him, you are immediately responsible for every single time he has said

1173
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,800
that and you have not corrected him. Oh, great point, Justin, because he's going

1174
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,160
to sit there and think, well, I said it to you when the boss's niece was around and

1175
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,560
you didn't say shit. You just let me keep saying it. What's the matter with you?

1176
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:48,640
Oh, hey, by the way, it means coming. It does mean coming, sir.

1177
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,560
If everybody doesn't know. Yeah.

1178
00:54:51,560 --> 00:55:06,440
Why is Garfield so funny, but not in any way that his creator can harness? Why is everyone

1179
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:13,320
else able to make Garfield funny, but somehow the ability to elude it escapes Jim Davis

1180
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:22,440
daily, seven times a day. This motherfucker can't get the funniest strip correct. He is

1181
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,800
unable to see what he has made and use it for good.

1182
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,880
It's one of those things where Garfield minus Garfield is like some of the funniest shit

1183
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,160
around, but if he had just drawn that strip, it would have been fucking mind-blowingly

1184
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,680
terrible. Ultimately, the comedy that we find in it

1185
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:44,800
is a direct result of Jim Davis's impotence. His inability. Right, exactly. If he were

1186
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,280
more competent as an artist or creator, then we wouldn't be, but see like, okay, you look

1187
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,980
at Garfield minus Garfield or really any sort of deconstructionist Garfield rap that we

1188
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:04,680
have done. If Jim Davis had the artistic ability to kill his little darlings, to have the foresight,

1189
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:10,080
that scalpel, that artistic scalpel to cut away the inessentials of his comedy, he could

1190
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:16,520
be one of the great ones, excuse me, Bill Watterson. He could be the greatest comic

1191
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,960
artist of all time, but he is unable. He cannot see beyond his mediocrity.

1192
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,680
In a way though, isn't that his legacy? This is what I'm saying it's intentional. I'm

1193
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:31,280
saying that Garfield, people wouldn't be talking, Garfield wouldn't be as relevant as it is

1194
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,640
today, which is to say incredibly relevant. If it was just like, if it was the funniest

1195
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,520
thing ever, if it was Mad TV, you know? Wait, excuse me? That's a whole different rabbit

1196
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,600
hole. I don't want to go down right now. If it was the funniest thing ever, a la Mad

1197
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,520
TV, then people wouldn't be talking about it because there would be nothing to say except

1198
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,320
did you see the latest Garfield? And people would say yes and say, I laughed so hard that

1199
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:01,920
I forgot to feed my kids. I would hate to be the weird magician that

1200
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:10,640
came up with the frosty stuff and then try to explain to people why. I don't know what

1201
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,760
good excuse- like first off, you have to open and like the first line of your explanation

1202
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:22,000
has to be, well, not for sex. Listen, I want to be clear on one thing.

1203
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,480
This should be self-evident. This thing's made out of snow and coal. There is, there

1204
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,400
is no- It's not a weird sex thing.

1205
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,720
I was lonely. And was I open-minded? Yes, I was.

1206
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,800
What he has to really explain- Friendship? Maybe.

1207
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:43,760
What he has to explain away is why make this sentient living thing with the heart and soul

1208
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:51,280
of a kind human being out of the most like fleeting substance that there is.

1209
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,960
I made this hat that you put on a fart and it turns into a person. Oh, what was I thinking?

1210
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:05,720
My first shot at this was frosty, the sort of homunculus I made out of wet sand right

1211
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:12,360
on the edge of the beach right at about like 430, right before high tide came in.

1212
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:18,280
Have you ever noticed how from 10am to 4pm every single day you just hear a creature

1213
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,240
screaming a sandy, sandy scream in terror? That's my bad.

1214
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,720
But I'm gonna get it right. Mark my words. Just move him off the beach, you say? That's

1215
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,520
not a bad idea. But then the pelicans can get at him.

1216
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,120
I'll workshop it, but- Or at least a week.

1217
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:37,280
But is it even sadder if you think about- He puts this hat on, he knows like nothing.

1218
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:42,480
It's his birthday, you know? By the way, a top hat, not even a sun hat

1219
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:46,840
to protect him from the rays. No brim whatsoever. And he's just this happy

1220
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,280
go lucky young man, and yet for some reason there's two things he knows. He knows how

1221
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,360
to love, and that he will soon be dead. He's learning everything else on his own,

1222
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,480
and yet there is one inherent piece of information in his head. Oh, by the way, if it heats up

1223
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:06,900
above say about 32, I'm out of here. So you're basically saying he's the epitome

1224
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,620
of Tim McGraw's live like you were dying. Yes. He was specifically created to know only

1225
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:18,320
one thing, and that he didn't have long to go. Live like you were melting.

1226
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:24,080
I told some kids in the neighborhood about how I was gonna die.

1227
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:32,720
I tried to go skydiving, but I just kind of fell apart because I made of snow. If a parachute

1228
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,280
whipped me back, it would probably rip me in half.

1229
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:44,040
Please don't throw my chest bones at a kid. Frosty doesn't have bones, I don't think.

1230
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,960
I think he was saying his bones are made of snow, and then you turn those into snowballs,

1231
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:52,400
and then you hit somebody with it. Right. How is he ambulatory if inside his

1232
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,720
snow flesh is not a nice skeleton? I assume it was like various sacks of water

1233
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:03,080
and air. It's like squishing and refilling.

1234
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,880
Much like an octopus or something along those lines.

1235
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,360
Did you go see Frosty? Yeah, I tried to stand next to him, and the sound of his body moving.

1236
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:18,360
What if he had nothing to do with magic? It was just like, it was genetics. So I genetically

1237
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,240
made a half that when you put it on, like that was the only response system.

1238
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:28,000
This is gonna sound weird, but could you put your mouth on my armpit and blow? My air sac

1239
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,480
seems to have deflated. I want to wave goodbye to you kids. Of course, it's too late.

1240
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,800
Watch out for my venomous prongs. I have all of those to keep the dogs away.

1241
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:44,920
Oh, the traffic cop hollered stop, so I inked all over him. Goodbye.

1242
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:50,680
I'm nature's greatest monster. I want to tell you about our last advertiser,

1243
01:00:50,680 --> 01:01:00,880
ExtremeRestraints.com. It is a diverse retailer with a variety of

1244
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,440
goods that seem to have no discernible theme. It's a general store then, you would say.

1245
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:14,040
It's something of a general store. Here's an attachment you can put on a drill that

1246
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:23,360
it seems to be a soft rubber tip, perhaps to protect you from drilling things accidentally.

1247
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,120
What happens? Are you jamming a drill and then you turn it on and then you say, whoops,

1248
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:33,600
that's not... I didn't mean to drill this chair. How did you get into this predicament

1249
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,600
in the first place? You trip. You get excited because you're about

1250
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,920
to drill something. So you start drilling and then you fall or trip.

1251
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,720
I'm looking at one thing here and it looks like... Have you ever like been carrying a

1252
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,280
candle around? I thought like, ah, this takes up a whole hand and I need two hands to do

1253
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,680
some things. It looks like here they have a belt that you can wear that you can hold

1254
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:59,560
the candle on the belt and then you have two free hands. I think that's pretty impressive.

1255
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:05,560
I think I understand. You know how sometimes you're at home and you just got back from

1256
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,640
the grocery store and you get out the kielbases that you bought at the grocery store and you

1257
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:15,400
think, man, these sure looked bigger at the grocery store. And then you get them out and

1258
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,800
you find them unsatisfyingly small and you think, these aren't going to keep me... These

1259
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:25,800
aren't going to fill me up. They have a special... I'll call it a peripheral and it is a pump

1260
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:31,160
and you put the kielbasa inside it and if you... And then all of a sudden your kielbasa,

1261
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,000
the kielbasa that you bought for eating is bigger.

1262
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,640
Have you ever said something you didn't mean to someone and you think, ah, me and my big

1263
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:46,920
mouth. When am I going to learn to keep my big mouth shut? Well, what if you could put

1264
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,920
a ball in there all the time that you can't take out at all. Maybe a big... Maybe you

1265
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,040
put a whole leather mask in front of your face that looks like a dog and you never see

1266
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,040
anything.

1267
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,760
And it's very funny because, you know, it's a great gag gift because everyone's always

1268
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:08,520
walking dogs, but nobody ever puts the leash on a person. You know what else makes it a

1269
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:20,960
great gag gift? A gag. Can this be the rest of the episode, please? Have you ever been

1270
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,440
at home and it's real hot so obviously you're not wearing any pants or underpants and so

1271
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:31,560
you're sitting there and I don't want to get blue, but let's say your privates are out,

1272
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:36,160
but all of a sudden there's a bunch of wild dogs get in the room and you're afraid that

1273
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,760
you'll be bitten on your privates. Well, there's a special cage that you can put around it

1274
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,560
to keep wild animals away from the thing that you have down there, whatever it may be, but

1275
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,560
I think I know what it is.

1276
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,640
Extreme Strains is looking out for your safety.

1277
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:55,040
It's a safety cage like a shark, which shark divers use.

1278
01:03:55,040 --> 01:04:01,440
You know how sometimes when you turn into a werewolf, people chain you up in the basement?

1279
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:10,880
Well, what if only your privates turn into a werewolf? Have you thought about that underserved

1280
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
portion of the population?

1281
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,040
What if you're the captain of a pirate ship?

1282
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:21,880
Okay, go on. I'm following so far.

1283
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:30,720
You need something with which to punish the shipmates who act up and really, you can't

1284
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,000
go to Target and buy a cat of nine tails, you know what I mean?

1285
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,200
Sure, yeah, go on.

1286
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,160
This is a whip specifically for non-sexual punishment.

1287
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:45,360
I can't stress this enough. Imagine this, you're trying to get to work, right, but you're

1288
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,480
late and you need to take the carpool lane, but you're by yourself and you've got no one

1289
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:53,480
to carpool with you. Then you're reaching the trunk and you inflate yourself a friend

1290
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,520
and you pop them into your passenger seat.

1291
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,420
Carpool buddy, that's the extremestrains.com. Have you ever looked at really skee cucumber

1292
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:07,440
and thought, I bet I could juice that.

1293
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,680
Extremestrains.com has got you covered with a head honcho.

1294
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:19,720
Man, chronic constipation is a problem that a lot of people run to nowadays. Maybe you

1295
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,320
don't want to go to the ballgreens and buy a douche, and maybe you want to buy a special

1296
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,200
douche, one that can get real deep in there.

1297
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:30,400
You know, chronic diarrhea is a problem. Wouldn't it be easier to just plug it up?

1298
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,400
Nothing, nothing.

1299
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:36,080
It's not you covered in Extreme Restrains. Nothing coming out of the one.

1300
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:37,080
Oh my god.

1301
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:42,600
You know, swings are great for the kids. What about adults?

1302
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:47,360
But don't you miss the fun of soaring through the air and out of care in the world? Well,

1303
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:51,080
Extreme Restrains has you covered with a fun swing to swing on.

1304
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:52,080
Sure.

1305
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,400
Griff, did you have another question, one last one to send us off on?

1306
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,800
Yeah, I could. I could do that for you.

1307
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:03,640
It was sent in by Nolan Hitchcock. Thank you, Nolan. It's by Yahoo Answers user, Jessica,

1308
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:10,560
who asks, is it bad to give my six-year-old baby a little French onion dip?

1309
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:13,080
Oh, Justin McElroy.

1310
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,120
