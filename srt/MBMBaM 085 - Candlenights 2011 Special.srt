1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:54,400
Hello, everybody, and welcome to our Yuletide sort of now flowed into Boxing Day.

6
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,080
Don't miss it, our Yuletide Observation of Candle Nights.

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy, and I'm already embarrassed by that joke I just made.

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm a baby. I am a baby. I'm a man-sized baby.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,520
And my name is Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,400
Baby G, Big T, Daddy J, here with you again.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
My brother and my brother made an advice show for the modern era.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,600
This is a time for you to gather with your family and say, hey, I got this show.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
It's for you sometimes.

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
It's for you sometimes. Once in a great while, it's for you.

16
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,800
There's 51 episodes in a year that you should not listen to because it gets

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,080
coarse, I would say, the subject matter and language that we use.

18
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:42,960
It gets quite blue.

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,400
It gets blue and coarse, but not this time. This time, this weekend, it's...

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,280
Red and smooth.

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,400
It's nice and smooth.

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,160
It's like a rough... Most of the time, it's like a rough blueberry bramble patch,

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,640
and you don't want to go through that bramble patch because it's sharp.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,480
There are sharp edges and it's blue.

25
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,000
This is like a raspberry pillow.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
This is a raspberry pillow for you to sleep on. Come with us.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
No curse words. Here we go.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,880
No curse words in this episode. Merry candle nights to all, and to all a good episode.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah, well, we'll see if we can do that without cursing.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
I don't have that, a lot of hope.

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,040
Hey, guys, my girlfriend and I were debating about giving children gifts early.

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,360
I believe giving kids grifts...

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:30,560
I believe grifting my kids is wrong because the long con rarely works on four-year-olds.

34
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,240
It doesn't do anything detrimental harm to them, and it's perfectly fine as long as it's

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,400
approximately by the holiday they are going to get the presents for anyway.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,160
She thinks it would make the kids impatient and possibly demean the holiday.

37
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
We would appreciate your help in deciding who is right.

38
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
Feuding face-off in Florida.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,240
How are you supposed to get all excited for Christmas Eve and for Ho-Ho to come

40
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,400
if Ho-Ho already came on, like, December the 20th?

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,280
Well, here's the solution.

42
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,960
What if they got to open their presents, but then you're like, okay, that's what you get,

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,160
and then you rewrap it, and then they open them again on Christmas?

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
Travis, I don't think outside of some, like, wacky memento or,

45
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
if you will, clean slate scenario that that goof is going to work.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,360
What if you offered them, like, an envelope full of money,

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
or they can take what's in box number two?

48
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,720
Hold on.

49
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,920
I need a paper towel.

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,880
Did you spill coffee?

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
Justin!

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,920
This was supposed to be an edit-free episode.

53
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,960
It will be.

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Justin has spilled coffee all over his charger.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,960
We have moments left before the computer shuts down.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,720
Before the house burns all the way down to the ground with all of our gifts down inside of it.

57
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Hey, did you guys listen to that candlelight episode?

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah, it was real good, till they all died in the fire.

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,520
I think we're not the right people to talk to about this,

60
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,000
because we decided, we elected, to save our candlelight episode

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
for the day after candlelight happened.

62
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,560
No, candlelight is a long celebration.

63
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
It goes two months.

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,040
It goes to, like, mid-February.

65
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh my god.

66
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,260
I know.

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,680
But when it starts is always a question.

68
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,480
Yeah, that's the question.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
The question, well, it doesn't start until we do this episode, so.

70
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,760
Oh, okay.

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,260
Right.

72
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:16,900
So, I think it's bad, because kids, in this world, in my life, as a 31-year-old man,

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,460
I don't have to wait for anything anymore.

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,660
I don't get excited about anything.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,580
I don't get excited about anything, because I can just get it.

76
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,660
If I want a new Rachel Ray 12-inch skillet with non-stick coating,

77
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,860
I just buy it on Amazon.

78
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,220
I get it the next day.

79
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:29,620
Yeah.

80
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,740
For $2.99.

81
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,820
I mean, I miss looking forward to something that much,

82
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,860
and, like, your kids are going to be older, and then next year, after December 12th,

83
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,740
we're all going to be dead.

84
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,140
So, why not let them look forward to Christmas one more time?

85
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,620
I think it's December 20th.

86
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,820
So, don't rob us of those precious eight days that we're going to.

87
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,380
Also, as a parent, I am not a parent yet.

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,820
Big announcement, everybody.

89
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:02,420
I imagine, as a parent, you get drunk on that power of your kids are powerless.

90
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,020
They can't buy anything.

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,660
Oh, yeah.

92
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,300
Your kids are poor, and they can't buy anything.

93
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,540
But you can buy everything, because you're rich.

94
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,580
So, why not lord that power over them?

95
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,580
Like, I know what you got, and you don't, because you're a kid,

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,060
and you've never bought anything for yourself in your life.

97
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,420
Unless I give you, like, an allowance, and you go to KB Toys

98
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,020
and buy yourself a Super Soaker or something.

99
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,620
I'm saying, drink in that power.

100
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,820
Just enjoy it.

101
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,740
Ride that wave, as long as it'll take you.

102
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,780
What if you convince your kids that, like, yeah, you can open the present,

103
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,540
but then you don't get any other presents?

104
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,340
Yeah, you can-

105
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,060
And then you kind of, like, laugh when you say, like, you went over that,

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,860
but you won't get any other.

107
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,220
And they're like, oh, we want to open it.

108
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,180
And you're like, OK.

109
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,060
And then they open it, and then Christmas morning, nothing.

110
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,820
Everything's gone, and you're like, see what you did?

111
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,540
Because your greed and avarice, you get nothing.

112
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,380
And you teach them the hardest lesson.

113
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,420
You can have these presents, but let's see you dance first.

114
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,180
You know what?

115
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,380
Now that it's the day after Christmas, what you should do is really mess with them.

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,740
Get back that power trip, and just put something else under the tree.

117
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,660
Say, oops, just 364 more days, and you'll be turning into this bad boy.

118
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,460
Leave it there all year.

119
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
Let them know who's boss.

120
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm ready for it.

121
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Why are you, like, pushing against me?

122
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Because you're pushing me out of the house.

123
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,100
I own the couch, though.

124
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,900
This is bad.

125
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,820
Hey, Griffin.

126
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,540
You want a Yahoo?

127
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:17,940
Yeah.

128
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,060
Yeah, that's what we need.

129
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,980
This Yahoo was sent in by Christa Whalen.

130
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,940
Thank you, Christa Whalen.

131
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,860
It is by Yahoo Answers user Angie, who asks, what is the best Christmas song to strip to?

132
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,620
Can we talk about this at our family show?

133
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,580
Yeah.

134
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,460
Yeah, I think so.

135
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,100
As long as we keep the answers clean.

136
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,660
Okay.

137
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,220
Yeah.

138
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm doing a striptease as part of my boyfriend's Christmas present.

139
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,020
I have the naughty Santa costume.

140
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,540
I just don't know what song to use.

141
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,500
Any suggestions?

142
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,940
I suggest not getting that present.

143
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,780
What's wrong with that?

144
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,580
What's wrong with a holiday striptease and a naughty Santa costume?

145
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,420
Why did she spend so much on the hottest naughty Santa costume

146
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,580
if she wasn't gonna do the striptease for her BF?

147
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,260
She really backed into this idea.

148
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,580
I think she should have probably picked the song first

149
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,460
and then gone out and spent 72 bucks at Magic Makers to pick up the...

150
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,940
Well, it depends on the song that you're stripping to.

151
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,580
If you're gonna strip to like Santa baby, for instance,

152
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,660
you want to put on a diaper and a Santa hat.

153
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,220
That's true.

154
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,940
Because that'll really ram home the theme.

155
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,860
That'll really take it to sexy time.

156
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,100
Yeah.

157
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,660
If you're gonna do Little Drummer Boy, you need some bongos.

158
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,180
Well-placed bongos.

159
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,660
If you're gonna strip to the Christmas classic,

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,660
someone chopped off my arms, you're gonna need commitment.

161
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,900
You're gonna need to really buy into the bit.

162
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,020
Actually, it's funny that you mentioned Santa baby.

163
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,780
That is, according to the best answer as chosen by Asker,

164
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,300
number one is Santa baby.

165
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,780
It screams striptease, she says.

166
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
No, it's the steviest Christmas song.

167
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,180
In that list is also Blue Christmas, which I could see.

168
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,700
I mean, it's a slow Christmas song.

169
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,420
Also on that list is Have a Holly Jolly Christmas.

170
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,340
Unless her name is Holly.

171
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,500
Or Jolly.

172
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,300
Still, I think it would be a little too fast-paced.

173
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,700
There would be too much, yeah.

174
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,220
She just passes out at the end.

175
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,100
Do the Charleston.

176
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
Get those flapper knees going.

177
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,260
Is that what those are called?

178
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,900
Flapper knees?

179
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,700
Yeah, flapper knees.

180
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,540
I feel that you contradicted when I said

181
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,980
Santa baby was the steviest song.

182
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,340
What's the steviest Christmas song?

183
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
The steviest Christmas song is Griffin Dino.

184
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,140
Baby, it's cold outside.

185
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,180
That's the steviest.

186
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,340
Especially when you get like, creeps are like,

187
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,380
you get like, Willie Nelson and Nora Jones singing it together.

188
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,100
Isn't there a line in there that's talking about

189
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,980
my mother will worry, or my family will worry?

190
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,020
And then there's the line where he's like,

191
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,140
no, just drink this.

192
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,780
Drink this.

193
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
You have to drink this, it's so tasty.

194
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,620
Yeah, I have to get away.

195
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,980
No one knows that you're here.

196
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,420
I'll call you a liar.

197
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,900
It never happened.

198
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,860
The holidays are inherently unsexy, right?

199
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,140
I don't think Christmas is sexy.

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
I don't think there's much sexy about Christmas,

201
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,780
about fat dude who comes into your house's exhaust pipe

202
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,780
and leaves you gifts, none of which are sexy,

203
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,900
because your grandpa is there.

204
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:03,860
And he's like, what's that?

205
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,340
You can't have a sexy thing in that box, can you?

206
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,180
I would like to see the follow up to this question.

207
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,180
It's like, well, the strip tease went well,

208
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,460
but I probably should have waited until

209
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,940
after the family Christmas to do it.

210
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,460
My boyfriend kept saying, what'd you get me?

211
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,020
What'd you get me?

212
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,660
What'd you get me?

213
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,020
And I was on the spot.

214
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,460
Yeah, it is uncomfortable when you have to open

215
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,980
your gifts in front of your family.

216
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,620
And I'm sorry, a strip tease just isn't a very good present,

217
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,420
because you can internet that, you know what I'm saying?

218
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,980
And then it's over in how long is Santa baby?

219
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Three minutes?

220
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,660
Over in three minutes.

221
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,340
And then it's like, oh, your present's gone.

222
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,260
Vanished into thin air, into the ether.

223
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,740
Unless it's like the ability to call for a strip tease

224
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,460
at any moment.

225
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,540
A book of 100 strip tease coupons.

226
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,180
Good for one wholly inappropriate thing.

227
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,300
You can use it in July.

228
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,700
That's a gift that keeps on giving.

229
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,660
Hey, Christmas tradition for us to adjudicate on.

230
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,340
My two sisters and I have one incredibly important tradition,

231
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,580
disaster-themed gingerbread houses.

232
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,700
We've done tornadoes, gingerbread house foreclosures,

233
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,260
Godzilla rampaging through gingerbread Tokyo,

234
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,540
and last year is a combo, oil spill and WikiLeaks.

235
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,300
That's from Ellen.

236
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,740
I don't know what a WikiLeaks looks

237
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,020
like in a gingerbread house.

238
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,460
I don't know what WikiLeaks is.

239
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,740
Oh, good.

240
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,980
Is that when Wikipedia stopped working for a week?

241
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,860
It's when Wikipedia got of an aerial disease.

242
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,140
Oh, gross.

243
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,020
Yeah.

244
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:20,740
Christmas.

245
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,240
Christmas.

246
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,340
There's the problem with this year,

247
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:30,420
is that there were a lot of truly really rough disasters.

248
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,660
I mean, you could go tsunami, not funny.

249
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,020
Not funny at all, actually.

250
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,980
That's pretty horrible.

251
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,780
You could make a tsunami gingerbread house,

252
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,380
but then you would lose your job at Geico.

253
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,980
Could you do an Occupy Wall Street gingerbread house?

254
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,100
It's an Aflac, wasn't it?

255
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,140
When Geico's Aflac.

256
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,180
Here, we'll try it again.

257
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,580
And I'll just say.

258
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,820
You could lose your job at Aflac as a duck voice.

259
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,260
Quack, quack.

260
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,740
Can you do it?

261
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,540
That's what I do instead of laughing now.

262
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:53,860
Thanks.

263
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,020
Can you do Occupy Wall Street gingerbread house?

264
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,540
I think you have to do Occupy Wall Street.

265
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,180
Gotta do Occupy Wall Street.

266
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,180
Just a bunch of gingerbread tents and hippies.

267
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:00,980
Yeah.

268
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,940
Do that, and Twilight.

269
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,340
You spray it with some sort of orange glaze.

270
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,620
Orange demigloss.

271
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,740
What if you combine Twilight and Occupy Wall Street,

272
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,380
and everything was going well, the Occupy Wall Street movie,

273
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,580
and then the vampire set in.

274
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,140
What if the vampire, oh my god.

275
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,620
What if Occupy Wall Street people are vampires?

276
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:22,820
Think about it.

277
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,100
So wait.

278
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,020
Here's what I'm saying.

279
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,340
What better place to hide in plain sight?

280
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,900
We already know that 99% of people you know in your day to day life are vampires.

281
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,940
The other 1% are robots.

282
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,900
Yeah, the 1% are robots.

283
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,980
50% of those vampires and robots are wizards.

284
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,980
And another 33% are robot wizard vampires.

285
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,540
Okay.

286
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,940
That's a horrifying Venn diagram you've just created.

287
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,980
Yeah, and 0.001% the mythological Jewish Golem.

288
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,780
So just to keep it holiday themed.

289
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,380
The Golem comes in Holonka, right?

290
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:58,980
I'm not for that.

291
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

292
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,540
I would suggest, I think that this is a good Christmas tradition.

293
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,780
There's a lot of creativity, which I like.

294
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,540
There's working together, creating something edible, which is always good.

295
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,100
Next year, you're going to be able to turn it out.

296
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,900
Oh my God.

297
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,820
Just pictures of Quetzalcoatl and Ragnarok battling for supremacy.

298
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,180
So it's going to happen.

299
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,740
A bunch of ancient gods are going to come.

300
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,340
Yeah, they're going to walk the earth.

301
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:29,620
It's going to be Quetzalcoatl, Ragnarok, and Kevin Sorbo battling for supremacy.

302
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,620
Both of his fists are chupacabras.

303
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,620
John Cusack caught in the middle of it all.

304
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,140
John Cusack, run with your family.

305
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,540
You're not saying John Cusack's a god, right?

306
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,500
No, I'm saying he is our window into the situation.

307
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,780
We can see it through John Cusack's eyes, and that's how we know how it affects us.

308
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,580
John Cusack is the universal humanities representative.

309
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,080
He is.

310
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,580
But not a god.

311
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,940
You've never seen him play putt-putt golf, obviously.

312
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,340
Not a traditional god, but he's a god among men.

313
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,300
Sure.

314
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,500
You guys want a yahoo, or do you want to keep talking about Cusack?

315
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,300
No, no, no.

316
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm going to keep thinking about Cusack.

317
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,020
When are you not?

318
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,520
Yep.

319
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,340
Oh, this is fun.

320
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,860
Crystal Whalen sent this one in, too.

321
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,740
Thank you, Crystal Whalen.

322
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,300
It's by a yahoo answers user, Supafreak, who asks, I think I know who tried to kill me.

323
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,900
Okay, sorry for the fake title.

324
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,380
Just wanted to make it more interesting and something to get your attention.

325
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,180
Don't report it.

326
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:22,180
Anyways, have a merry Christmas, everybody.

327
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,780
And yeah, that's all I wanted to say.

328
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,460
Wow.

329
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,960
That's...

330
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,780
Isn't that sweet?

331
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,280
Wow.

332
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,620
That's not a question, really.

333
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:33,940
It's not.

334
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,460
I just wanted to pass along yahoo's Christmas wishes to everybody.

335
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,020
That's what passes for holiday greetings over there.

336
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,900
Okay, wait.

337
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,420
So this is my issue with this.

338
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:50,740
This girl, this person, wanted to wish everyone happy holidays, merry Christmas,

339
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,580
and she thought the best way to get everyone's attention to do that

340
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,060
is to let them know that there had been an attempt on her life,

341
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,660
and she thinks she knows who did it.

342
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,900
Do you know how many people have wished me happy holidays this year?

343
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,380
How many?

344
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,340
I can't even count.

345
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,700
A billion, though, if I were to guess roughly one-sixth of the world's population.

346
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,500
Right.

347
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,420
So it doesn't matter anymore.

348
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,620
But if someone ran up to me and bit me on the face and said,

349
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,740
I'm a dog person.

350
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,220
I'm a dog.

351
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,340
I'm half dog, half man.

352
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,100
I said, what are you talking about?

353
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,140
And they said, just kidding.

354
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,260
Happy holidays.

355
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,540
Also enjoy the rabies.

356
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,980
That one's gonna mean something to me.

357
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,780
You're gonna remember that.

358
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm gonna remember that.

359
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,380
Well, yes.

360
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,380
Let's have another yahoo.

361
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,860
What do you think?

362
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,060
One that actually makes sense.

363
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,140
This one was sent in by HorseLoverFat.

364
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,420
Thanks, HorseLoverFat.

365
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,780
It's by yahooanswersuser.

366
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,300
Touch my pigtails and die.

367
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,020
Who asked?

368
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,740
Oh, no.

369
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,060
If you were a legitimate vampire, as 99% of the world is,

370
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,460
who would you surprise with the gift of eternal life this Christmas?

371
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,540
For me, it would be Bob from Accounting.

372
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,780
He has nice hair, and it deserves to look that way forever.

373
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,540
Wow.

374
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,060
A legitimate vampire.

375
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,140
Not one of these fakie, not one of these fly-by-night Johnny-come-lately vampires.

376
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,860
Not one of these kids that go to the mall on a hot topic,

377
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,700
and they buy the fangs, and they put them on their teeth,

378
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,900
and they bite each other.

379
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,140
Yeah.

380
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,140
And then they get sick from the bites.

381
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,020
From the bites and the Chinese-made fake fangs.

382
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,500
They're made of lead, and you get sick from putting them in your mouth,

383
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,180
and then from putting them in the neck.

384
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,860
I don't know if I can say this or not,

385
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,420
but I think I would give that eternal life to the Pope.

386
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,100
Make him forever Pope.

387
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,140
Oh, no.

388
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,460
Really?

389
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:32,660
You're enjoying John Ratzenberg that much that you're going to keep him as eternal Pope?

390
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,740
I just kind of like the idea of forever Pope.

391
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,820
I feel like he could really get a lot done.

392
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,700
That's impossible.

393
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,220
Think about it.

394
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,260
If he, if he-

395
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,260
None of us are Catholic, by the way.

396
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,660
Go on.

397
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,420
If you're a vampire, you can't-

398
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,420
How is your day going to be?

399
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,180
He wears a cross on his hat.

400
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,380
It's going to be unpleasant.

401
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,300
It's going to be unpleasant.

402
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,420
It's a labor of love.

403
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm going to live forever, and I'm going to have migraines the whole time.

404
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,580
Because there's a cross on my hat.

405
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,940
Like, what are you talking about?

406
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,900
The Pope is the worst.

407
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,860
I don't know anybody-

408
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,540
His whole style is going to have to change.

409
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,140
I mean, that's obvious.

410
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:08,100
I don't know anybody with more day-to-day cross exposure than the Pope.

411
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,740
Okay, then I'm going to switch to David Boreanaz.

412
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,700
Well, that's a little on the nose.

413
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,300
Yeah, he's the Pope of my heart.

414
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,260
I know he can do it.

415
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,540
I've seen him succeed as a vampire previously.

416
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,860
You are the only one I know that can handle this power.

417
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,020
Enjoy doing bones forever.

418
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,100
I can't trust James Smoshner with it.

419
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:34,740
He'll probably just go to a comic book convention and try to make $75 buying meat.

420
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,780
I'm going to say Ellen.

421
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,660
Why Ellen?

422
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,220
Here's my reasoning.

423
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,380
Can you imagine a world after Ellen, post Ellen, P.E.?

424
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,420
Can you imagine the year one P.E.?

425
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I cannot, and I don't think the world could either.

426
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,380
I don't want to imagine.

427
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,660
I just want to see her dance, and she'll dance the whole show and never get tired,

428
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,860
because she's a vampire, and then she'll get angry at her guests who get tired.

429
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,340
Because when you're a vampire, you can pretty much dance forever.

430
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,740
Can I do Robert Pattinson just as like payback?

431
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,460
Surprise.

432
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,860
Surprise.

433
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,740
Now you live forever.

434
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,900
Oh, what if you gave him eternal life and then immediately staked him to the heart?

435
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,100
Just like right away.

436
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,820
One, two, punch.

437
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,900
Well, that would just be murder.

438
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,500
Or could you get around the murder charge?

439
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,980
You'd be like, hey man, he was a vamp.

440
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,340
Yeah, you cannot be tried for killing a vamp.

441
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,060
Okay.

442
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,700
That's true.

443
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,900
Or a tramp.

444
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,220
Can you get one from a rail car?

445
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,020
Or a scamp.

446
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,740
Or a scamp.

447
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,300
Get out of here.

448
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,220
Oh, now I've got it.

449
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:37,540
I'm going to turn all of the rail riders, all of the lovable hobos into vampires.

450
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,340
Oh my God.

451
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,260
Hey, ABC, I will sell you the series that I just created.

452
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,740
Boxcar Vampires.

453
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,300
Beautiful boxcar vampires that ride the rails in 40K.

454
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,580
Boxcar Trampires.

455
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,980
Boxcar Trampires.

456
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,660
Boxcar Trampires.

457
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,260
What they'll do is they'll go around and have premarital sex.

458
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:59,380
And then some of them go to college.

459
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,900
And some of them learn a little bit about love, but a lot about themselves.

460
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,300
Yeah.

461
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,460
And one of them is Neve Campbell.

462
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,420
More like matronly, I think.

463
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:14,020
I would have gone with Misha Barton because she looks vampiric in the face region.

464
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:14,740
She does, right?

465
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,860
She looks hollow.

466
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,060
Her and Tilda Swinton, I think, would be good.

467
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,420
Tilda Swinton could be her mom.

468
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,700
Can we sign Tilda on that?

469
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,460
I'm not ready for TV.

470
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,620
You get to play a boxcar vampire.

471
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,580
Where do I sign?

472
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,660
How many times do I have to sign to be a boxcar vampire?

473
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,260
That is an undeniable role.

474
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,500
I want you to know that sounds like Russell Brand doing an impression of Tilda Swinton.

475
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,980
How about Russell Brand the vampire?

476
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,620
What's he doing?

477
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,500
He already looks like he lives in a boxcar.

478
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,140
Whatever the opposite of eternal life is, I would like to give to Russell Brand, I think.

479
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,380
I would like to give him like 30 second life remaining.

480
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:51,940
Have life.

481
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,100
Just to see what he does.

482
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,980
Only now do I know what it means to truly live.

483
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,620
And then he's dead.

484
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:00,980
Let's move on.

485
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,180
Let's keep the flow going.

486
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,820
Yeah, sounds good.

487
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,460
Maintain the flow.

488
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,700
My mom tells me the story of how, once as a child, I noticed that the presents were

489
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,940
wrapped in the same wrapping paper as previous year.

490
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,620
And shortly thereafter, the whole parents bring the presents deal had to be revealed.

491
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,220
At what age and how did you all discover this parental Christmas conspiracy?

492
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,340
Brian in Barranquilla.

493
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,060
It's Columbia.

494
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,340
First of all...

495
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,020
Wait, what?

496
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,740
Wait, I'm going to read this again.

497
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,300
Okay.

498
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,460
My mom sometimes tells me the story of how, once as a child, I noticed the presents were

499
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,780
wrapped in the same wrapping paper as previous year.

500
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:45,300
And shortly thereafter, the whole parents bring the presents deal had to be revealed.

501
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:46,900
Like...

502
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,420
Wait a minute.

503
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,540
The parent...

504
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:49,780
What?

505
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,940
The parents bring the presents to Santa Claus and Santa Claus delivers them?

506
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,300
That seems like an awfully secretive...

507
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,100
No, I think Santa Claus brings the presents to the parents and the parents distribute

508
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,900
them appropriately.

509
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,620
I don't think Santa...

510
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't think Ho-Ho, Sinterklus, would operate with a middleman like that.

511
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,380
I think he would.

512
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,780
Why are his prices are so high?

513
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,300
What if he cut out the middleman?

514
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:11,780
Yeah.

515
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,300
There's a lot of overhead in the holiday delivery operation.

516
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,380
To my knowledge, if there is this conspiracy of parents bringing the gifts from Santa Claus

517
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,100
to Underneath the Tree, I have not been made aware of it.

518
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,860
You know what else is a conspiracy?

519
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,340
That 9-11 was caused by aliens.

520
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,020
It was the Illuminati's work.

521
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,900
And that's total fakie Hollywood BS.

522
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,420
Santa Claus is Illuminati?

523
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,420
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

524
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,780
I jumped in in the end there.

525
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,540
No, Santa Claus is Paul Giamatti in the film Fred Kloss.

526
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,900
I can understand how you'd be confused.

527
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,540
I'm not sure I understand what...

528
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,380
I think this is one of those tinfoil hat nut jobs.

529
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,500
Yeah, yeah.

530
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,420
Loose change, right?

531
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,060
Loose slay.

532
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,620
I get it.

533
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,780
I just want to throw out that going with the concept that parents bring the presents or

534
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,940
whatever, if your parents...

535
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,500
If you called them on that the wrapping paper was the same as last year and your parents

536
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,260
couldn't talk their way out of that, man, they're not good at lying or they just gave

537
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,540
up or you were like 14.

538
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,580
Yeah, that's not a good way to get out of that situation.

539
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,140
Oh yeah, the wrapping paper's the same.

540
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,580
Yeah, it was us, whatever.

541
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,180
Why would Santa need to bind your...

542
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,100
Okay, this is what I feel personally in my heart and you people at home may have a different

543
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,820
opinion on this, but I feel like Santa Claus doesn't wrap anything.

544
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,380
Yeah.

545
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,660
No, he's all foam.

546
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,340
Santa Claus brings the...

547
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,860
Is he just the delivery man?

548
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,980
Is that his only duty?

549
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,100
All he does is brings them, eats some cookies and jams out.

550
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,300
Santa Claus is like Amazon, the parents put in the call for presents, he brings them.

551
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm not comfortable with that either.

552
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:47,860
No, I don't like that either.

553
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,940
I like that there's a man somewhere in the world who I've never met nor will I ever see

554
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,100
who knows the darkest recesses of my heart, knows what material objects I want.

555
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,860
That's the scariest thing to me because he knows that when I watch TV and the forever

556
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,900
lazy comes on, there's something that clicks in my head and goes, well, it looks like Travis

557
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,340
is going to go forever lazy this year and I don't want anyone to know that I want the

558
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,540
forever lazy, right?

559
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,460
Here's the other thing is that Santa Claus was the only person that knew that this year

560
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,740
for Christmas, I wanted Drive Angry shot in 3D on Blu-ray.

561
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,860
Did he get it for you, Griffin?

562
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,460
Santa Claus did get that for me.

563
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,060
But he told...

564
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,540
He used Travis as his envoy.

565
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
It came to me in a dream.

566
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,220
Santa Claus appeared and said, hello, Griffin needs Drive Angry.

567
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,220
Travis was, for a moment, made Santa flesh on Earth.

568
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,420
That's what you're saying.

569
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,780
Santa made corporeal.

570
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,700
What's your best Christmas present ever?

571
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,820
We asked you guys to tell us and our friend Cole said, I've gotten tons of video games

572
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,780
and stuff for Christmas, but nothing beats my blanket.

573
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,020
By the way, I'm doing that to people now.

574
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,020
I'm putting in weird inflections.

575
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,420
I'm a tall-ish dude and no blankets were long enough.

576
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,060
So my mom made me a very long fleece blanket by hand.

577
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,900
I'm still using it seven years later.

578
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,620
You said that so precociously.

579
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,900
That's my blanket.

580
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,860
Take that, world.

581
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,460
Nothing beats my blanket.

582
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,820
Don't touch my blanket.

583
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,260
I mean, blankets are great.

584
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm surprised that yours...

585
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm a rough sleeper.

586
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,900
I sleep rough on my blankets, so they don't last longer than two or three years.

587
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,380
I got me a Scotty blanket, a Scottish Terrier themed blanket about a decade ago.

588
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,940
Went to college with me, moved back to West Virginia, then to Cincinnati.

589
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,660
Still have it.

590
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,300
Use it every day.

591
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,060
It's made out of real Scotty skin.

592
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,700
Yeah, and that's how you know it's good quality.

593
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:42,580
I think every time you get a present, you should look at it and give it a shake and say,

594
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,140
I don't know, it's no blanket, and throw it aside.

595
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,500
I'm too tall for this book.

596
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,300
Make a taller book for me.

597
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,180
My mommy made a bigger book.

598
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,860
I'm still using that book.

599
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm still...

600
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,660
That's my tall book I've used for seven years.

601
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,140
This is an extra long slanket.

602
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,380
Now, what's a...

603
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:05,780
Hold on.

604
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,900
I need to take a timeout.

605
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,260
What's a forever lazy?

606
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,460
Forever lazy is like the next form of snuggie, but it's like a full...

607
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,580
Like it wraps around your leg.

608
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,940
It's like a onesie with a hood that's a blanket and zips down.

609
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,220
It's got compartments.

610
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,100
So if you're a dude, you get the zipper to use for the bathroom and it's got back zippers

611
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,340
so you can keep it on while you use the restroom.

612
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,020
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

613
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,820
It's more or less like somebody looked at the sweatsuit and said,

614
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,020
this could be lazier.

615
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:37,700
And you said that you, in secret heart of yours, that you want one of these.

616
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,780
You want an article of clothing that, let me get this straight, you can poop through.

617
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,060
You want an article of clothing that you can make bathrooms.

618
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,620
The only reason I want it is because in the commercial, it seems to indicate that you

619
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,700
could wear this to a tailgate party at a football stadium and no one would say anything to you

620
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,420
about it.

621
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,660
Everyone would be like, hey, sweep forever, Lacey Steve.

622
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:04,100
That's funny, Travis, because it sounds like this article of clothing has a tailgate.

623
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,820
It does.

624
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,900
It has a little portal.

625
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,460
I have to take exception with the whole premise of your question.

626
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:17,860
As everyone knows, the next evolution of the Snuggie is a closed garage door three hours

627
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,860
and a car engine running.

628
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,980
And the courage to do what's right.

629
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,500
And the courage to do what's right, exactly.

630
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,340
You know, I wish they made a Snuggie that was like separate for your legs and your chest.

631
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,420
And instead of being made out of like a sweatsuit, it was like nice formal wear.

632
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,060
You mean like a tuxy?

633
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,620
Like, yeah, or just a nice shirt.

634
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,220
A tuxy.

635
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,100
A nice blouse and a casual skirt.

636
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,060
So you're saying like clothes, like you wish they made clothes.

637
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,980
A class Snuggie.

638
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,340
I guess that's what I'm saying.

639
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,260
Okay, I don't know what situation you would be.

640
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,020
Is that business casual, did you say?

641
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,300
Casual, casual?

642
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,100
Formal casual?

643
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,180
I forgot one thing.

644
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,540
The slacks also have a tiny zipper in the back that you can unzip and just go wild in

645
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,020
the bathroom.

646
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,060
Just go crazy in there.

647
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,340
Don't even...

648
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,140
Somebody walks...

649
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,220
My biggest fear in this life is that I'm going to be at a gas station in Louisiana somewhere

650
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,540
using like a gas station bathroom and someone walks in on me and sees my treasure.

651
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,020
So now he walks in and just sees you in a tuxedo and he's going, oh don't mind me.

652
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,780
I mean, I wouldn't wear a suit jacket to the bathroom, Travis, but I'd be wearing formal

653
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,220
slacks and they couldn't see anything.

654
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,940
That actually, I'm going to get this real for Candle Nights.

655
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,660
When I was a kid, I was eight years old.

656
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,980
I know this story.

657
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,020
We were traveling.

658
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,620
It's not funny, it's horrifying.

659
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,580
It is not funny, but you can get, come on, get up in here.

660
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,660
There was this, I was at Cracker Barrel.

661
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,340
We were on a road trip, it was a Cracker Barrel and I was at the bathroom reading a newspaper

662
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,780
and I was making Tuesday and a guy comes up to the crack in the door and he's wearing

663
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:02,100
a tank top and he looks like some sort of vagrant, but he starts looking in and then

664
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,780
he pulls inside his tank top to show me his nipples pierced and goes, and then it runs

665
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,100
out.

666
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,500
And I said, okay, like out loud, like really loud to try to scare away or something.

667
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,660
And that happened to me.

668
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,380
So, I guess.

669
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,900
Merry Christmas!

670
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,300
I guess what I'm saying is Merry Christmas.

671
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,940
Cracker Barrel, where pedophiles eat, where pedophiles cook.

672
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,700
Your down home pedophile kitchen.

673
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,380
Come on, eat, look at some kids on the John and play some checkers.

674
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,180
Everything's okay.

675
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,020
You all right, Justin?

676
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,660
Yeah, I just went to, took me to sort of a weird place.

677
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,140
Yeah.

678
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,100
Maybe a Yahoo?

679
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,980
Maybe a Yahoo.

680
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,420
Oh, God.

681
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,220
That'll bring it out.

682
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,820
It already is out.

683
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,660
I need something to stuff it back down.

684
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,020
This one was sent in by Krista Whalen.

685
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:44,500
Thank you, Krista.

686
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:44,980
It's by Yahoo.

687
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:45,380
God!

688
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,820
I know, she sent in like 30.

689
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,620
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mycroft, who asks, what are some awkward places to hang mistletoe?

690
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,340
Belt buckle.

691
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,060
Gallows.

692
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,420
Funny, awkward, uncomfortable, or bizarre places to hang mistletoe?

693
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:56,900
Shanks.

694
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,100
On the top of the coffin.

695
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,780
Oh, man.

696
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,420
What?

697
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,380
It's Christmas.

698
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,180
Yeah.

699
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,140
Oh, gosh.

700
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,180
The top of the speculum?

701
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,100
I don't know what that means.

702
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,340
Okay.

703
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,580
What is that, like a tongue?

704
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:13,460
What's a funny, awkward place to hang, you know what I really like?

705
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,780
On your belt buckle.

706
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,340
That's good, though.

707
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,020
That's hysterical.

708
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,980
No, I already said that one.

709
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,380
We know, we're commenting on the comedy of it.

710
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,980
Belt buckle was good.

711
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,220
Yeah.

712
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,460
What about on the back, what about on the back belt loop of your pants so it looks like you're

713
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,740
saying, kiss my fanny?

714
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,980
That's what we're used to for candle lights, you have to say fanny?

715
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,660
Now, just so you know, Griffin, in many countries that aren't America,

716
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,980
fanny means something completely different.

717
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,700
Is that true?

718
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,180
Yeah.

719
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,820
I didn't know that.

720
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,540
What does it mean?

721
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,740
That's darty.

722
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,860
I don't want to know about it because it's candle lights.

723
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,500
No, you don't.

724
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:44,820
All right.

725
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,140
What about anywhere?

726
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,260
Anywhere in the world?

727
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,060
Anywhere that you hang mistletoe is always awkward and terrible.

728
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,540
Guys, have you ever been, we've all been on this planet for between like 28 and 31 years,

729
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,300
or no, like 25 years, right?

730
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,100
24.

731
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,900
But that's okay.

732
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,140
Yeah.

733
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,820
It's Christmas, you don't know my age.

734
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,460
That's all I want.

735
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,180
I asked you for Christmas for a card.

736
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,180
A birth certificate.

737
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,740
Proof.

738
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,460
Some kind of proof.

739
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,180
I wanted you and Obama to give me a birth certificate for Christmas.

740
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,540
Like, have you guys ever been to a Christmas party or gathering or somebody's house where

741
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,740
there was actually mistletoe on display?

742
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,900
Yes, but not until recently.

743
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,140
I went to a party and I walked into the kitchen.

744
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:27,620
Hold on, wait.

745
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,140
This story sounds like it's going to be long.

746
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,260
Will it also be funny?

747
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,900
Yes.

748
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,860
It's very short.

749
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,020
Is it linked to human history?

750
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,780
Let me assuage your fears.

751
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,300
It's very short, but not funny.

752
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,980
Okay, break on through then.

753
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,420
I walked into the kitchen and looked up and there was a mistletoe hanging in the middle

754
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,700
of the room and around the perimeter of the room were eight guys looking really uncomfortable

755
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,300
waiting for a girl to walk into the room.

756
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,580
What are you doing?

757
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Look up.

758
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,060
You got me.

759
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,660
Get some chapstick.

760
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,900
Get your birch bees, it's smooching time.

761
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:11,620
I can't, maybe this was a fever dream, but I feel like I went to a boy-girl party in

762
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:17,220
middle school where mistletoe was hung aloft from the rafters like something that you hang

763
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:17,940
from rafters.

764
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,780
I think it's the most awkward thing in the world and I wish we would stop doing it.

765
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,900
I've never been smooched.

766
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,220
No, thanks to mistletoe.

767
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,460
Okay.

768
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,220
Yeah, I don't think that that's a real thing people are doing.

769
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,620
Are there any good answers on that one?

770
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:37,620
The fifth street overpass, the end of my dog's tail, and that's awful.

771
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,540
And last but certainly not least, all on your mom.

772
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,940
Okay, it was funny for a minute.

773
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:45,380
I don't actually, above the toilet.

774
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,700
I like that actually.

775
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,500
Kiss the toilet.

776
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,340
Kiss that toilet before you use it.

777
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,220
In the oven.

778
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,780
Well, I guess, isn't that how Virginia Woolf died?

779
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,300
What?

780
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,340
Looking for mistletoe in the oven?

781
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,620
Yes, Virginia Woolf.

782
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,220
There is mistletoe in the oven.

783
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,100
Just keep looking.

784
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,660
Keep looking.

785
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,260
Darn it.

786
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,620
We lost her.

787
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,140
On the cat's litter box.

788
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,740
What's up with people wanting to kiss cat butts and food?

789
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,300
Hey, everybody in mistletoe, you know that you don't just have to kiss whatever inanimate

790
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,180
object home.

791
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,740
It's not like a binding contract.

792
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,420
On your dad's wardrobe.

793
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,380
The litter box.

794
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,420
On a table lamp.

795
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,140
Light switch.

796
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,740
Come here, light switch.

797
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:30,020
Well, I guess that there's mistletoe there so I have no choice, I suppose.

798
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:35,220
These, every time that I've ever been confronted with mistletoe and someone's like, hey, mistletoe,

799
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,020
I always just go, no, and walk away.

800
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,700
There's no penalty.

801
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,180
Cassandra says, put it in the guy's locker room, smiley face.

802
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,060
I don't think that's going to play out how you think it's going to play out.

803
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,460
No.

804
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,420
Good game, Brock.

805
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,140
Hey, Brick, come here.

806
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,180
Did you just name them Brick and Brock?

807
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,460
Hello, Brock.

808
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,180
Hello, Brick.

809
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,860
I guess we should have seen this coming.

810
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,380
Christmas law abides us, Brick.

811
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,100
I know, Brock.

812
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
Why are we so adherent to it?

813
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,060
Hey, good hockey.

814
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,540
Come here.

815
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,380
That's hockey sweater.

816
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,540
Let me take it off of you while I kiss you under the mistletoe.

817
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,340
Hey, what's going on in here?

818
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,300
Get out of here, Brack.

819
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,260
Get out of here, Brack.

820
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,380
Brick and Brock are kissing.

821
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,220
Come over here, Brick.

822
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,620
You're cool.

823
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,260
Brick, time to kiss party.

824
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,180
It's pronounced Bruce for the last time.

825
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:20,820
It's Bruce.

826
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,700
Now it's Bruce.

827
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:30,580
I'm a 24-year-old dude, and I really just enjoy giving presents to my friends.

828
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,580
I don't give expensive or ostentatious gifts.

829
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,780
I generally just enjoy being able to find and give a thoughtful gift.

830
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:39,620
My problem is, I always wind up feeling slighted or annoyed if my friends can't even bother

831
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,580
to return the favor.

832
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,660
That's how it looks to me when you say, oh, you are.

833
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,940
Am I giving gifts for the wrong reason?

834
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,980
Or should I expect a bit of courtesy from my close friends?

835
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,100
That's from Jarsh.

836
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,940
Hey, Jarsh, you are taking a turn right in the middle of that question.

837
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,100
We were like, I just like giving my friends presents.

838
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,620
Turn.

839
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,940
I'm mad my friends don't give me presents back.

840
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,740
Yeah, I don't know.

841
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,100
I just like giving presents.

842
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,260
And I guess I also like getting them very much.

843
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,540
I wish that second part was happening.

844
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,500
I mean, it does make it.

845
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:16,340
It has less to do with the fact that you're not getting back possessions that you can

846
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,980
then have and add to your vault.

847
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:22,580
But it makes it awkward when you get someone a present and they don't get you a present

848
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:22,740
back.

849
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,260
It makes it awkward for both parties.

850
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,260
I think that you have to, I think we might have talked about this before, but I think

851
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,860
the best thing to do is keep in your car non-perishable, like $10 to $20 presents.

852
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:39,060
But don't, if you know, you can look around at the people in your life and know like,

853
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,660
they're not going to give me a present.

854
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:40,900
Yeah.

855
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,660
If you see something for them that you're just like so moved, like, oh man, he loves,

856
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,420
you know, these tiny figurines and you see those tiny figurines and it's like a buck,

857
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,140
grab it for him.

858
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,580
But it's not a contract.

859
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,380
You're not making an unsoaken deal with him like, hey, I got you this.

860
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,380
So where's my thing?

861
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:04,100
I have a dumpster's worth of Ferrero Rocher cartons in the trunk of my Toyota Matrix that

862
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,620
I just keep like, oh, thanks.

863
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,180
One sec.

864
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,860
I left yours in the car.

865
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,980
I forgot yours in the car.

866
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,580
It's not wrapped.

867
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,980
It's Ferrero Rocher's.

868
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,780
It's half eaten.

869
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,940
I hope you like hazelnut.

870
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,700
It's spelled just like it sounds.

871
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,900
I thought your gift to me was that you're going to stop mispronouncing hazelnut.

872
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,620
It's hazelnut.

873
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,900
Actually, you're the one mispronouncing it if you read the original German translation

874
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,820
of the word hotzelnut.

875
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,540
I actually genuinely like getting people gifts.

876
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,740
If you have a friendship with somebody, then you have to ask yourself, look back at the

877
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,620
past year.

878
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,580
Didn't they do something?

879
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,980
I know that every friend that I have has done something for me or been considerate in some

880
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,260
way for me over the past year that is worth more to me than whatever gift they would otherwise

881
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:58,500
get.

882
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,660
That's a good way of looking at it.

883
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Phone call when I'm feeling sick or helping me out with a project or whatever it is.

884
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,300
They picked up a movie tab or bought you dinner or something.

885
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,660
If you think back over the past year, I'm sure that person has done something.

886
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,780
If they haven't done something that merits a $10 present, then maybe you need to re-evaluate

887
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,420
your friendship.

888
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,020
I bet if you think about it, there's probably something that's happened that just makes

889
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,420
you want to get them a present because you care about them.

890
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,700
Now, does that mean that you should be hurt if they don't get you something?

891
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:31,940
No.

892
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,660
Absolutely.

893
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,700
Absolutely, it should.

894
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:34,980
No, no.

895
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,180
No, it shouldn't.

896
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,100
For all you young guys out there, I'm going to clue you into something that I think is

897
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,180
the best thing for the holiday season for this very reason, and it's Christmas cards.

898
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,220
It's something that says, hey, you're my friend and I was thinking about you on Christmas

899
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,180
and Merry Christmas.

900
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,380
Sorry there's no toys in this.

901
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,260
I forgot to put the check in.

902
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,220
I forgot any toys.

903
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,060
Yeah, I mean, you are giving gifts for the wrong reason.

904
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,500
If you really like giving people gifts, do it for yourself because it makes you feel

905
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:02,660
good.

906
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,100
But I mean, honestly, at this point in my life, the best gift someone could give me

907
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,300
is to tell me that I don't have to find a place to put a thing.

908
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,420
You don't have to find a place to put this, so Merry Christmas, I guess.

909
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:24,260
I evaluate my whole year by the number of boxes under my candle light's candle holder.

910
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,620
Right, have you been a very good boy?

911
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,020
There's only one way of finding out.

912
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,540
There's only one way of finding out my year's successes and failures.

913
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:31,780
Yeah.

914
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,340
Today, this year, I ended up with 22.

915
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,300
22 boxes or 22 successes and failures?

916
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,740
22 boxes, which I guess translates over to 22 successes.

917
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,780
I was shooting for 30, though, so I guess I wasn't as good a boy as I thought I was.

918
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:46,740
CJ?

919
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,420
My cat's trying to interrupt the show by attacking Griffin.

920
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,100
Hey, here's a Christmas tradition.

921
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Minnie Wombat and I have decided all our Christmases will be spent watching Nicolas Cage movies

922
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,900
and ignoring family phone calls.

923
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,500
Okay, that last one is just mine.

924
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,180
That's from Julie AKA WheezeGirl.

925
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,980
I think that that's fantastic.

926
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,700
I think it becomes unsustainable unless you're going to watch the same ones every year.

927
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,140
I think you could get a day's worth of solid Nicolas Cage entertainment.

928
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,420
And I'm going to take it one step further.

929
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,020
Instead of just ignoring the phone calls, board up the windows,

930
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,460
hunker down, and pretend like you are the last people on earth and you're watching Nicolas Cage.

931
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,580
Post-apocalyptic Cage.

932
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,020
Yeah, turn it around like this.

933
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,460
Post-apocalyptic Christmas.

934
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,420
Now, Travis, when you bought me, when you sent through via Santa Claus's magic network,

935
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,860
Drive Angry Shot in 3D on Blu-ray,

936
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,620
was it because you had read this question and thought maybe this is a tradition I could get into?

937
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,260
That you could hunker down and ignore your family for the rest of our lives?

938
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:42,740
Yeah.

939
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,460
Yeah, I guess.

940
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:43,700
Okay.

941
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,900
I'm just looking for some logic in the darkness.

942
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,300
Well, this is a place, a good point in the show to discuss the

943
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,060
a little bit of Christmas knowledge that I've picked up, a little bit of Candle Night's knowledge.

944
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,020
And that is when it comes to the idea of buying someone a quote-unquote funny gift,

945
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,820
it's important to remember that it's real funny for like three minutes.

946
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,060
Yeah.

947
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,460
And then they have it for the rest of their lives.

948
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,940
Now, Drive Angry in 3D is an awesome movie.

949
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,700
It is. It's a real good film.

950
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,100
I thought about it long and hard of if it was a funny present or something, Griffin.

951
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,620
Now, Griffin, I want you to look me square in the eye and tell me you won't watch that movie.

952
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,180
Am I going to get drunk in like two weeks and just pound through it?

953
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,660
Yes.

954
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,340
Yeah, I'm going to tear that movie apart.

955
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,220
Exactly.

956
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,420
Have you seen it once already?

957
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,900
I have, yeah.

958
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,300
I saw it in 3D as God intended.

959
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,780
What worries me is that the box doesn't have the full title.

960
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,100
It just says Drive Angry, not Drive Angry shot in 3D.

961
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,140
So I'm wondering if-

962
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,180
Like it's store brand?

963
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,300
Removed from its 3D environment, from its natural habitat, if the film has changed in some way.

964
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:52,980
It actually becomes a slow, respectful meditation on the briefness of human existence.

965
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,700
Or brevity, or briefness.

966
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,140
Both work.

967
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,020
Briefness was my favorite 1980s rapper.

968
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,580
I like Kumo D, I like the briefness, and I like Slick Mouth.

969
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,860
Thank you for the gift, Travis.

970
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,340
It was very nice.

971
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,140
You're welcome, Griffin.

972
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,140
Justin, I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

973
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,420
Maybe next year.

974
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,060
Griffin, you got any more Yahoos?

975
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,180
Are we done yet?

976
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,100
Holiday- I feel like we've only been going like 20 minutes.

977
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,540
Holiday comedy.

978
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,340
40 minutes.

979
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,060
40 minutes.

980
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,780
How do you-

981
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,740
Here, this is good.

982
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,780
Uh, Yahoo Answers, uh, or I'm sorry, Krista Whalen sent this one in too.

983
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,020
Thank you.

984
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,060
Jesus Christ!

985
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,180
It's by Yahoo Answers user-

986
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,140
Happy birthday!

987
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monty who asks,

988
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,820
How to react to a bad Christmas present.

989
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,540
My mom asked me if I was going to see Twilight, and I told her, no way, I hate Twilight.

990
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,220
So the other day I ran out of socks and I opened my mom and dad's closet to borrow some of my dad's

991
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,460
socks. Welcome back to that.

992
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,580
And I found the Twilight book.

993
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,580
The other day, I look at the tree and there's a present for me shaped exactly like the book.

994
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,860
How should I react to the present?

995
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,900
Okay, there's a lot of twists and turns in this question.

996
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,500
First, I want to say kudos to your mom.

997
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,180
That when you're like, hey, do you like Twilight?

998
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,060
And you're like, nope.

999
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,420
Absolutely not.

1000
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,580
And she's like, oh, got it.

1001
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,620
Light bulb.

1002
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,140
There's no way your mom, your mom might buy that book for you before that you have that

1003
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:17,540
conversation.

1004
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,100
There's no way your mom's like, well, now I'm pot committed, so I guess.

1005
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,180
The $12.99 damage is done.

1006
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,540
I've got to get this gift for him.

1007
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,140
Crabby book it is.

1008
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,100
Oh man.

1009
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,060
Why are you in your daddy's closet looking for socks?

1010
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,420
Were you in his sock closet?

1011
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,500
Why does your dad have so many closets?

1012
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,540
Two questions.

1013
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,860
Why does your daddy have a sock closet?

1014
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,980
And B, why are you hunting for dad socks?

1015
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,220
They're going to be way too big for your kid feet.

1016
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,980
They're going to fall down around your ankles.

1017
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:53,860
You're going to look ridiculous, like some sort of stupid elf.

1018
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,820
Hey, here's the correct answer to this question.

1019
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,780
This is how you react.

1020
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,340
Hey, mom and dad, thank you for giving me life and paying for everything.

1021
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,380
And also this book.

1022
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,420
I really appreciate everything you do for me, and I'll totally read it.

1023
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,260
The end.

1024
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:08,660
Yahoo!

1025
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,100
Who is this user random number responded, yell, what the beep?

1026
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,780
And go shoot up an airport.

1027
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,700
Source, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2.

1028
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,260
I'm not sure I understand.

1029
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,220
That's how the Call of Duty game starts.

1030
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,860
He gets a Twilight book, and then he just loses it.

1031
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,740
Yeah, that's post.

1032
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,020
That's a plot of Postal 4.

1033
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,820
Dude, just be thankful for what you got, whether you like it or not.

1034
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,940
That's how Christmas do.

1035
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,980
That's how Christmas do.

1036
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,900
You really want your mumsy to be like, why you spoiled ungrateful brat?

1037
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,740
You might have more presents than that.

1038
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:48,500
Okay, Christmas is not about presents, even though that's pretty cool.

1039
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,260
To include that in the tradition.

1040
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:58,500
I love that Justin didn't preface that by saying there's another Yahoo!

1041
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,260
Answers user, so it just sounded like Justin just flowed straight off the dome.

1042
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,020
I want to jump back to the middle of that answer, though, where the dude says,

1043
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,100
maybe you have more presents than that.

1044
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,780
God, I hope so.

1045
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,700
I'm getting you one thing, it's the thing you say you don't like.

1046
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,380
Hey, Jimmy, how was your Christmas?

1047
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,660
It was pretty cool, I guess.

1048
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,940
I got a book.

1049
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,500
Oh yeah, was it like getting complete encyclopedia?

1050
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,020
No, it was Twilight.

1051
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,220
I just got a Twilight.

1052
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,540
I definitely, definitely do not like it.

1053
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,140
I was real sad, told my mom beforehand I didn't like it.

1054
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,580
I would have rather just had the $13, but it's cool.

1055
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,460
Fonzie112 said, she is your mom, and you have to act like you like it, but don't overact.

1056
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,980
Every once in a while, look at it like you're reading it.

1057
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,740
I don't like Twilight as well, but give it a chance.

1058
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,660
For the rest of his life, or like that day?

1059
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,340
I mean, how?

1060
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:52,180
Your mom asked you if you want Twilight, and you said, nope!

1061
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,340
And when you open Twilight, you can't be like, yeah!

1062
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:56,340
I got it!

1063
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,460
Thank God, because I totally flipped my position on this in the past couple days.

1064
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,340
I think you open, you look at it and go, ah, okay.

1065
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,740
Yeah, you launch it right at your mom.

1066
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,540
Oh, cool, cool!

1067
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,580
Just thwug your mom right over the head with it.

1068
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,420
She's asking for it.

1069
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,780
You can say, this is that Kindle that I asked for, and then you throw it in the fire.

1070
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,420
Look, now it's in the cloud!

1071
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,660
Let's see here.

1072
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,580
Let's see what else I got here in my candlelight sack.

1073
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,380
In your candle sack.

1074
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,420
In my candle sack.

1075
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,340
Uh, my boyfriend and I will not be around family this year for Christmas.

1076
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:34,820
What's a good way to make a memorable Xmas for two?

1077
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,580
Stumped Santa in San Diego.

1078
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,700
Laser tag battle.

1079
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,580
Laser tag.

1080
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,220
It's not open.

1081
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,900
Buy your own laser tag.

1082
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,460
That's what I'm saying.

1083
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,860
You set up your own laser tag, you flip over the couches, you barricade.

1084
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,540
Lake romantic holiday laser tag!

1085
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,500
Strip laser tag!

1086
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,620
Strip holiday.

1087
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:56,100
Everybody starts with Santa suits, everybody ends.

1088
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,140
With birthday suits.

1089
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,300
Jesus birthday suits.

1090
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,500
And also the laser tag best, so that you can track your score.

1091
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,820
I don't need to track it to remember this score.

1092
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,500
This is the sweetest Christmas score.

1093
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,260
I mean the doing it.

1094
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,660
All right.

1095
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,980
One of you just roam through the streets of your neighborhood, looking for people that

1096
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:19,620
have gone to visit family, and you just do some Christmas cat burgling.

1097
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:20,740
Wait a minute.

1098
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:22,820
Wait a second, Travis.

1099
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,780
Are you saying you go to the houses of people you know are out of town and you

1100
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,500
rob them?

1101
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:26,900
Yeah.

1102
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,300
And they say, hey, look what I just got you for Christmas.

1103
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,660
This DVD player.

1104
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,340
I got you a secret we could never share.

1105
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,940
Now we're bound together forever, because if you ever leave me, I'll tell everyone

1106
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,220
you're a cat burglar.

1107
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,620
How good at burgling do you have to be to be declared a cat burglar?

1108
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,340
I don't think you can just declare yourself that right away.

1109
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,340
I'm going to go rob that house, because I'm a cat burglar.

1110
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,380
I think you have to start off as like a rooster burglar, because they're real loud

1111
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:49,940
and annoying.

1112
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,220
If you wear cat ears while you rob a house and then prowl around it on all

1113
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,700
fours and you paint little whiskers on your face.

1114
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,940
And then if you get caught by the cops, you can just say, I'm a crazy person.

1115
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,900
I'm going to use the insanity defense.

1116
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,820
If you get that, that's the important thing.

1117
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,460
Dress like a cat, because if you a lot of first timers make the mistake of not

1118
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,420
dressing like a cat.

1119
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,860
If you dress like a cat and you get caught the first time, you can you can use

1120
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,340
the insanity defense.

1121
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:17,860
You can fur and rub up against the police officer's leg and say, you can't arrest me.

1122
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,300
I'm a poor little cowcoat.

1123
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:26,020
Meow, I'm just a big kitty cat.

1124
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,860
Meow, you got any nip?

1125
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,660
Meow.

1126
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,580
Think of what they'll do to me in prison.

1127
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,580
I can't go there.

1128
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,860
I'm a big kitty cat.

1129
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,420
Meow, where's your Christmas spirit?

1130
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:41,780
And then he'll let you go.

1131
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,420
And then it's back to stealing immediately.

1132
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,900
Walk back into the house.

1133
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,220
You just got let out of.

1134
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,780
It's really going to drive home the insanity defense.

1135
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,300
Where's the cat going?

1136
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,300
That big cat is going back into the house.

1137
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,740
We just caught him.

1138
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:05,620
How did you catch him?

1139
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,300
Well, sir, it seems the cat came back the very next day.

1140
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,660
That's how Catwoman started.

1141
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,100
This is a very CSI Miami Candle.

1142
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,140
What do you guys do for New Year's Eve?

1143
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,900
My friends and I agreed that it might actually be the worst holiday.

1144
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:32,260
It's even worse if you're single because when the countdown does happen,

1145
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,900
all the couples kiss and then you have to stand there alone, a lonely doofus.

1146
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:42,100
How do you do New Year's Eve and insights for the singles?

1147
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,860
That's from Ed in San Francisco.

1148
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:49,940
So if you can't get a smooch at midnight on New Year's Eve, you are unsmoochable.

1149
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,940
That's an excuse when that clock turns over and the promise of a new year

1150
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,420
fills us with a sort of drunken hope.

1151
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,860
And you get to necking.

1152
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,420
Neck with literally anybody you see.

1153
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,180
And they'll be like, yup, 2012.

1154
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,420
Yeah, you got to get your sexy right.

1155
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,740
And go to a party where there's a lot of people.

1156
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,260
And then just pair off.

1157
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,820
Get there, be like, ladies.

1158
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,780
You don't even have to pair off.

1159
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,020
Just make sure you're standing near a group of other single people

1160
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,380
because you're not thinking about it.

1161
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,820
Coupled people will only be able to kiss one person.

1162
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,140
You can bounce between people like a pinball pinball.

1163
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:31,620
Yeah, as soon as the balls drop, you just look at the person next to you

1164
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:35,060
who's also single and give them that nod like, is it us?

1165
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:35,620
What do you think?

1166
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,300
What's going down?

1167
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,660
And I think that, man, if you think New Year's is a boring holiday,

1168
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,020
I'm sorry, but you're doing it wrong.

1169
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,380
Yeah, it's the best holiday.

1170
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:46,100
It is the time to be like, hey, remember all that stuff

1171
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,700
that we had to deal with all year?

1172
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,740
That's dead now.

1173
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,940
This year is dead.

1174
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,580
The next year is a bright, shining, clean slate.

1175
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:53,780
Until December 20th.

1176
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,620
Until December 20th, when we all die.

1177
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:57,540
And the whole universe is a clean slate.

1178
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,980
Then everything is a clean slate.

1179
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,700
And God shakes the Etch-A-Sketch when we start over.

1180
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:01,940
Right.

1181
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,140
And Dana Carvey forgets what happened the day before.

1182
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,940
I am not crazy about New Year's.

1183
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,420
Really?

1184
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,580
Yeah, I'm not, I've never enjoyed it.

1185
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,700
I don't know why that is.

1186
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,020
I think it's because it's so far from Christmas.

1187
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,900
Yeah, I guess.

1188
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,220
I like Christmas a lot because of all the gifts and stuff.

1189
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:22,980
New Year's Eve gifts.

1190
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,100
Well, I think when it comes to New Year's,

1191
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,820
I think you have two options as far as the parties go.

1192
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,340
And you have the quiet reflection with a small group of friends

1193
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,300
where you all sit around like drinking wine and beer and champagne

1194
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,900
and talking about what's happened over the last year

1195
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,420
and things you look forward to in the next year.

1196
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,100
Which can be nice.

1197
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:40,500
Yeah.

1198
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,700
And then you just have the wild crazy party till two.

1199
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:48,180
I think the problem comes from when you kind of end up at a party

1200
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,460
that's in the middle of those.

1201
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,740
Where it's like a bunch of people sitting around

1202
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,740
talking about how crappy the year was before.

1203
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,700
You've really got to make sure that you go to a Skrillex concert.

1204
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,100
At midnight, pop some X, listen to him chop and screw,

1205
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,580
Auld Lang Syne, and just go for it.

1206
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah.

1207
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:07,700
I've never lived in a bigger city.

1208
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:09,460
Cincinnati is the biggest city I've ever lived in.

1209
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:12,020
But like the idea of going to a bar or club

1210
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,820
as like my final destination New Year's party.

1211
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:17,220
I don't know.

1212
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,220
That seems like you're setting yourself up to pay a bunch of money for drinks.

1213
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,460
You're never going to really get, you know, just pleasantly drunk.

1214
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,260
And also you're just surrounded by people you don't know who are going to be, you know.

1215
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,380
That's the biggest problem.

1216
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:34,580
It's the worry of lonely hearts that are going to be bumming you out.

1217
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:38,100
At a bar, there's going to be people who are just desperate for human connection.

1218
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,100
You know, one time I was working.

1219
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,620
I had to work New Year's Eve.

1220
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:48,180
The Blockbuster was open inexplicably until midnight, as it always was on the weekends.

1221
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:52,900
So I sat and watched the ball drop on a crummy little black and white TV.

1222
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,380
And there were, I kid you not, two people in there picking out videos.

1223
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,500
At midnight, New Year's Eve.

1224
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:07,060
Well, maybe they wanted to start out their year with six days and seven nights, you know.

1225
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:08,420
Well, that gives the twist.

1226
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,700
What did they end up getting?

1227
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:13,860
Did you guess Hush and Nutty Professor 2, The Clumps?

1228
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:14,420
Oh.

1229
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,300
Because that is what they, that's how they're kicking off.

1230
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,980
That's the first movie they want to watch that year.

1231
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,100
Don't paint this into a bad picture, because as soon as that ball dropped, midnight,

1232
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,220
they were magnetically drawn together and just started some mooching.

1233
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,740
You also like The Clumps?

1234
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,340
I love The Clumps.

1235
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:31,540
They're married now.

1236
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,580
Yeah, they're married now.

1237
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,940
Their last name is The Clumps.

1238
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,260
How did they do it?

1239
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,740
I don't know.

1240
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,980
I think it's pretty, pretty fantastic though.

1241
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,500
Do you guys have New Year's plans this year?

1242
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:48,580
I think we'll probably have a sort of a dinner party type thing with friends.

1243
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,260
Griffin, what are you doing?

1244
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:50,740
Skrillex.

1245
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:51,620
Skrillex concert.

1246
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,300
I'm going to do it in the mail and be really bored.

1247
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,660
I'm going to do a Skrillex dinner with friends.

1248
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:58,340
New Year.

1249
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,060
Can we all agree that 2011 was the year of the Skrillex?

1250
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:03,700
That's what it says on the Chinese calendar.

1251
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,060
Skrillex is my astrological sign.

1252
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,420
Yeah, I was born under the Skrillex.

1253
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,820
My outlook for next year is

1254
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,620
That's all it said.

1255
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,180
Sorry again.

1256
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,820
Onomatopoetically written out.

1257
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,540
Why don't people do more on a monopoetic dubstep?

1258
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:21,940
I don't know.

1259
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,020
Like written word dubstep?

1260
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,180
Did you read that new dubstep book?

1261
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,460
What are you talking about?

1262
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:31,460
It said,

1263
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,740
Wub wub wub wub drr drr drr.

1264
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,020
Slap on the bass now.

1265
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,460
What?

1266
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,260
Get on the bass.

1267
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,180
As written by will.i.am.

1268
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,100
It starts really slow, but once you reach about page 120 and you hit the drop.

1269
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:48,660
Oh man, it's so heavy.

1270
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:53,460
When it says call 911 now and then it really kicks into high gear.

1271
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,700
I like the part in the third chapter.

1272
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,740
It really got to me when it said,

1273
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:59,140
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

1274
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,740
I like that because it's kind of a high counterpoint to the wub wub wub wub wub

1275
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:04,820
that's also printed on the page over top of it.

1276
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,700
I don't know if the layering is working.

1277
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,260
I really liked in the about the author section when it was like

1278
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:17,460
I found the flashback chapter really confusing because it's reggae.

1279
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,740
Paul Skrillex lives in New England with his cat

1280
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,700
and his wife Dorothy.

1281
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:32,740
There are two kids who go to school in Connecticut.

1282
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,420
Oh Skrillex, he wrote the book on dubstep.

1283
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,940
Most important thing to him is his family and his walk with Christ.

1284
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,820
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but first thank you guys as always for hanging

1285
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:57,780
out this year with us and spending so much of your time in our presence.

1286
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,020
Thanks to Maximumfun.org.

1287
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,340
This is basically completing our first year with them.

1288
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:03,700
It's been awesome.

1289
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,420
Thank you guys.

1290
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,700
If you have not listened to any other Maximum Fun shows, get out there.

1291
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:11,140
Maximumfun.org you can find.

1292
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,980
Stop podcasting yourself.

1293
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:18,900
Judge John Hodgman, Jordan Jesse Goh.

1294
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:28,580
We got a segment coming up on Jesse Thorn's relaunch of his show Sound of Young America.

1295
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,460
He's relaunching it.

1296
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,660
It's called Bullseye now and it's going to be on NPR.

1297
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,340
We're going to do at least one segment and it'll also be on the web.

1298
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,980
There'll be segments from there you can listen to and we'll be sure to tell you how to get those

1299
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:46,020
and make sure you tell them how much you like us on it so they'll continue to want to have us.

1300
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:48,340
Just tell everyone you see how much you like us.

1301
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:49,540
Yeah, tell them.

1302
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Also, Maximum Fun is looking for an intern.

1303
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,180
If you're interested, I mean, it's a pretty sweet deal.

1304
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:56,820
Go check it out.

1305
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,460
I think it's Maximumfun.org slash intern.

1306
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:00,580
Is that where it is?

1307
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,380
Yes, I believe so.

1308
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,980
Is that the actual web address?

1309
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,860
I'm almost certain.

1310
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,420
Or just yell at your computer, intern.

1311
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,460
Maximumfun.org forward slash internships.

1312
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:17,380
They need a good intern and you'll probably end up meeting some really interesting people.

1313
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,100
Maybe us.

1314
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:18,580
Maybe us.

1315
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:19,060
Who knows?

1316
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:19,860
Probably not us.

1317
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:20,580
Probably not us.

1318
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,380
Maybe us.

1319
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,740
We're creations of the internet.

1320
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,340
I want to thank John Roderick and the Longwinners for letting us use the song,

1321
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,780
It's a Departure, as our theme song.

1322
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,300
It's on the album Putting the Days to Bed, which hopefully everybody got for Christmas.

1323
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,860
Hey, John.

1324
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,500
Merry Christmas.

1325
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,660
Merry Christmas, John Roderick and the Longwinters.

1326
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,740
Anything else?

1327
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:42,900
Thank you to everybody who bought t-shirts for your friends and family for the Yuletide.

1328
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,180
We saw a lot of great pictures.

1329
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:47,380
I know Golly ALA got a shirt and anybody else.

1330
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,180
You can always get more stuff like that at maxfunstore.com.

1331
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:53,380
Or dot org.

1332
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,020
Try them both.

1333
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,500
Try them both.

1334
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,460
One of them will work.

1335
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,780
And thanks to everybody who came out to the live shows.

1336
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,780
We posted them for our last two episodes and we hope everybody had a good time there.

1337
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,660
We certainly did.

1338
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,540
And we're going to do more soon, so stay tuned.

1339
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,820
So we'll see you in the new year.

1340
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,580
See you in 2012.

1341
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,780
Yeah, one last year, guys.

1342
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,580
Let's do it.

1343
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,260
Let's close out human existence with a bang.

1344
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,780
JC Fletcher sent in this final Yahoo question.

1345
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,220
Thank you, JC Fletcher.

1346
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,460
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ryan, who asks,

1347
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:24,020
what is the exact angle for getting gold properly with a sluice box?

1348
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:28,580
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1349
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:29,620
I'm Travis McElroy.

1350
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,980
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1351
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,660
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1352
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,380
Kiss your dad.

1353
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:34,900
Wear on the lips.

1354
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,660
Keep your heart three stacks.

1355
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,700
Keep your heart.

1356
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,860
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1357
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,900
Keep your heart.

1358
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,180
Man, these girls are smart.

1359
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:50,020
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

1360
00:55:50,020 --> 00:56:14,020
Play your part.
