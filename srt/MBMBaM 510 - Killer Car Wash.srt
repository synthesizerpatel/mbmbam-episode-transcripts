1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. Let's do it. Just do it.

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,600
Just do it. Nike. We said last week, no more introductions. There's nothing to talk about,

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
so no more introductions. Well, there's something to talk about,

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,800
but let's not talk about that. There's something big worth discussing,

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,400
but let's not discuss that one. I would like to pitch a new way to start the show.

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,960
We're going to take it way back to our start, really. Community theater. Let's do an energy

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,040
circle. Oh, that's good. Yeah, and then a prayer circle. That's less good. Let's start off,

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:38,320
everybody, no matter what you're doing, just put your hands up in the air and just shake them all

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,160
around. Oh, we're going to feel that energy go into you. And now me and Travis are going to do

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,040
a private prayer circle over here, and Justin, if you don't want to be a part of that, you can

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
go do something the fuck else while me and Travis pray to Jesus to make our show, Annie Get Your Gun,

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:03,040
go so good. I was not going to pray to Jesus. Oh, no. Oh, no. You're going to pray to the theater

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:12,640
mask God. Yeah. Let's cover our bases. I'll do Jesus. Travis does the comedy tragedy mascot.

20
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,600
Justin, pick one. Dionysus. Okay. Dionysus. Oh, that's a fun one, huh? Yeah. All right,

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,080
I'll start. Hey, Jesus, it's me. Apologies for my bros. They don't know what's up. I know that you

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,800
love musical theater. I know you love comedies. Barefoot in the Park is your favorite. Today-

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
Wait, really? Wait, Griffin, Jesus Christ Superstar isn't his favorite?

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,080
No, he thinks he's played and he doesn't like rock. As we all know, he doesn't like rock music.

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
Anyway, we're about to do Annie Get Your Gun, and it's really important. There may be scouts in the

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,280
audience. Just let me shine, let me sparkle, and let me dazzle them. Please forgive my brothers.

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
They're going to pray to people who aren't you, and I know you don't like that stuff.

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Hey, Thespo, it's me just reaching out to you. Let me hit them high notes. I hear there's going

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,880
to be scouts in the crowds trying to take this all the way. I know I'm just backup dancer number six,

30
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,720
but I think I've got potential. Anyways, I love you, and I'll see you at home.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Amen. I didn't say amen on mine.

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:22,160
Dionysus, it's me again, Justin McElroy. Yes, I come to you once more, the god of

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,160
winemaking and grape cultivation and fertility and ritual madness and religious ecstasy and theater.

34
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:35,280
I can call you Dionysus, I can call you Bacchus, but right now I'm just calling you my last chance.

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
I really got to do good in my role as Frank Marshall in this production of Annie Get Your Gun

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,760
that we are apparently about to mount on this podcast. I'm having that nightmare god,

37
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,360
Dionysus, that I sometimes have where I don't know what the show is, but I have to perform anyway,

38
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,960
except it's not a nightmare. It's real, and nobody knows what the show is, and we're all in it together.

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:05,040
So, God, amen. Please, if you're not the real one, if you could just please send this to Jesus,

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,480
if he's better for this. Please forward, I guess, to whatever, to whom it may concern.

41
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah, I think we're gonna crush it. Guys, this has a wafting aroma of an introduction.

42
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,960
No, it's not an introduction. It's just a prayer circle.

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,680
This is just a prayer circle, and now energy circle. Everybody hold hands wherever you are.

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:36,320
Okay, and I'm holding on to the two cybernetically linked robot hands that you all gave me as a

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,440
present that mimic your hand. Oh, you're doing the jerk off just you're both doing the jerk off

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,240
gesture. That is how I do. That's how I do energy circles. Should we start over again?

47
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,560
Let's just do the first question. Yeah, first question. You know, we said no more introductions,

48
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,600
and then we accidentally did one, and we can be better than that. We can be better than this

49
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
together. Tonight, while preparing dinner, my husband said we had too many veggies,

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,440
so he wasn't going to cook carrots. I said, fine by me. I don't really like carrots. This shocked

51
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,560
him far more than I was expecting. He said he felt betrayed, and I should have mentioned this

52
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,200
at some point in our six-year relationship before now. Thing is, I don't hate carrots,

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,200
and usually I eat them without complaint because they're healthy. They're just not my favorite

54
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,000
vegetable. Should I have mentioned this beforehand? Should I now sit down and come up with a list of

55
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,960
things I'm just not a huge fan of or impartial to just in case? Or is he overreacting that's from

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,400
just not that enthused in Australia? What a fucking great question. I only want to talk about this.

57
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,240
Okay. All right. Why?

58
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,480
I just think it's got everything that I like to talk about now.

59
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,960
Carrots.

60
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,080
Relationships, maintaining a long-term relationship, and vegetables, and where they

61
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,880
are sort of at where I'm at. Can I talk about my journey with carrots? It's just that kind of an

62
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:07,440
inverse of cheese. If you cook carrots, I'm so out. If you have them raw, I'll eat those crunchy

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,720
little bastards all day long. You cook it, I'm completely out on carrots. I don't want to eat

64
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,320
it either. Is it the hotness? Is it the heat? You don't like a hot carrot? Is it the mushy,

65
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,440
the softness? It's the mushy and the sweetness. The mushy sweetness that I really don't enjoy.

66
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Interesting. I like it. That's what I like about a cooked carrot is it's like a vegetable that's

67
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,560
kind of pretending a little bit to be a fruit. There is almost no vegetable. I'm sitting here

68
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,200
trying to think of it. There's almost no vegetable that I fuck with equally in a hot versus a cold.

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:45,680
I mean, right. Raw carrots, down. Raw celery, better than cooked celery, basically.

70
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,640
Flip that, though, for broccoli. What the fuck? I hate raw broccoli.

71
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,160
No one. No one.

72
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
Raw cauliflower? Fucking debate.

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Get that shit off my veggie tray.

74
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,040
Listen, the cherry tomatoes are gone. Boom. Everybody loves those little guys.

75
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,880
Cherry tomatoes, they're gone. Cleaned out.

76
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
I don't fuck with raw tomatoes.

77
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,480
Okay, Justin, we can't talk about... It's not even broclivity. It's your anti-clivities.

78
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
Some of the things you don't like.

79
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,680
There should be a better word for that.

80
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:25,920
Yes. But cherry tomatoes, I'm going to say your cherry tomatoes, your raw carrots, your raw celery,

81
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,760
these things, they are flying off the shelves of the veggie tray.

82
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,280
Those can stay. Those can stay.

83
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, and maybe I'm going to speak up for a sugar snap pea.

84
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,920
Oh, someone's got to speak at Travis's, the fucking Lorax.

85
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,320
Some stringy garbage in between their incisors.

86
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
It doesn't have the crunch of it. It's just got, I mean, it's right there in the name, a snap.

87
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
It's got a snap. I like that.

88
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
And this is good. It's really good that we get this taxonomy going on this show,

89
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,920
because chefs don't know what the fuck to do with these things.

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,040
Yes, thank you.

91
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,440
If they're crunchy, let me munchie. If they're-

92
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,280
If they're-

93
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
Soggy, give to doggy.

94
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,160
You're saying if the vegetable gets wet, feed it to a dog?

95
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,120
Well, I mean, not all vegetables. You have to do what I do, which is ask Echo.

96
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
I'm not going to say her real name because she's listening.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
Okay. Got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.

98
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,680
If they're crunchy, let me munchie. If they're soft, cook them off.

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,920
But what about broccoli and carrots?

100
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,880
Those are soft. Oh, wait. No, carrots are crunchy. Let me munchie.

101
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,080
If they're soft like broccoli, cook them off.

102
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,120
Cauliflower?

103
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Is soft. Cook them off.

104
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,440
Asparagus?

105
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,040
You roast those. Roast those bastards.

106
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,000
Gotta roast them.

107
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,040
You gotta roast them.

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,360
I have come to-

109
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,320
I like- There's a few things that I-

110
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,120
Even in my adult years, I'm like, nope, absolutely not.

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,400
And I kind of enjoy that because I've come to eat so many different vegetables

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,800
and be okay with so many different weird things

113
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
that I kind of treasure the things that I'm still like, absolutely not.

114
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
And my wife knows those things.

115
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,840
Like, she knows like, don't put a water chestnut near me.

116
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
Oh, fuck.

117
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,080
Disgusting. They're so gross.

118
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,720
What is it? You're not a nut.

119
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,400
Why are you pretending?

120
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,120
And you're not water.

121
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,160
You're a- This- Okay.

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,000
Fuck the first person that was like, I just found this.

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
This tastes like a- Well, I'm trying to come up with a name for it.

124
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,280
It kind of tastes like a wet nut.

125
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Is that anything?

126
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,880
Oh, I got it.

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,920
I'm going to put it in salad and vegetable bags and many Asian dishes.

128
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
The fact that- Fuck water chestnuts.

129
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,960
The fact of the matter is there's like nothing, no food stuff

130
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,520
that I just like will absolutely not eat.

131
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,120
Like if other people eat it somewhere, chances are I'll eat it.

132
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
But there are plenty of things that if you like give me the option

133
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,720
that I'd be like, oh, I'd rather have that than that.

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
Like, you know what I mean?

135
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,120
I just, I'm saying, let me get the thing that-

136
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,000
Why I married to the woman I married to and why we are still together

137
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,480
is that almost without fail, except for olives, which we both despise,

138
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,840
the foods that I can't deal with Sydney adores.

139
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,280
So it's like, slide those water chestnuts over here.

140
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm way in.

141
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,280
I'm deep into it.

142
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,600
Oh, you got a pickle that you don't want.

143
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,760
Slide that pickle over my way.

144
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,280
And I think that that maybe is what your husband is like.

145
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, if you are not into carrots, that's a lot of carrots.

146
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,000
I could have been scarfing this whole time.

147
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,960
I could be enjoying them.

148
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,480
If you're not enjoying these, these, the vitamin pack.

149
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,840
These sweet little orange honey cigars.

150
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,280
Or potentially your husband also doesn't enjoy carrots

151
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,960
and was making them thinking you enjoyed them.

152
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,400
Yeah, I never have to buy these fucking things again.

153
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,960
Think of all the money we could have saved on carrots.

154
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,760
If you are a person who has never eaten a vegetable in your life

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,800
and you come to me and you're like,

156
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,720
man, I've never eaten a vegetable in my life.

157
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,480
I would probably look around the grocery store.

158
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,440
I'd be like, well, here, try this.

159
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
This is called a carrot.

160
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,160
This is the veg- carrot is the vegetable, right?

161
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
And if you eat carrot and you're like, ugh, gross.

162
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
I'll be like, well, then there's nothing.

163
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
There's leave the produce section.

164
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,920
It's all downhill from here, man.

165
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm not even saying carrots the best vegetable,

166
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,720
but like nobody eats a carrot and is like, fuck that.

167
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,200
No way.

168
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,000
Now what about, I might say corn is maybe like a better like entry.

169
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,600
Yeah.

170
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Vegetable.

171
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,640
But there's nothing that compares to corn.

172
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
Like you can't be like corn and now here's some lettuce.

173
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,400
Now here's like, if you go carrot,

174
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,720
you can go carrot to celery easy.

175
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040
I love that Shanae O'Connor song.

176
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,080
Nothing compares, nothing compares to corn.

177
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
Can I do a Yahoo?

178
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,320
I'm saying-

179
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,840
Hold on, I got to call Weird Al.

180
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,720
Okay, that was good.

181
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,760
I'm saying, I think your husband overreacted.

182
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:02,880
Okay.

183
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,280
This Yahoo is sent by Graham Roebuck.

184
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you, Graham Roebuck.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,560
It's Yahoo Answers user, Ray, who asks,

186
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,840
this may be a short one, but I think it's worth talking about.

187
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Would I die if I walk through a carwash?

188
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,600
Huh.

189
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,520
Huh, okay, hold on.

190
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,400
And we're talking about an automatic carwash.

191
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,840
I don't think if you walk through a,

192
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,160
if you walk through a self-service carwash and die,

193
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,640
there has been foul play.

194
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,800
Well, there's a logic puzzle in there, right?

195
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
That's a murder.

196
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,040
Yeah.

197
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
There's a puddle of water on the ground and a man is dead.

198
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,800
What happened?

199
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Yeah, but if you, I'm talking about you're behind the Sunoco

200
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,960
and you've gotten the, and let's say just to again,

201
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,960
make the rules as firm as possible,

202
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,440
the most premium wash they have available.

203
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,960
The most possible things.

204
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,760
The most possible.

205
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not talking about the $3 splash and soap bullshit

206
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
where your car is dirtier.

207
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,520
Don't fucking talk to me about the $3 splash and soap.

208
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,240
My car is dirtier on the other side of that.

209
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,200
I want the wax.

210
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,480
I want the rainbow foam.

211
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,720
I want all that shit, but I want it on my body

212
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
and I want to live through it.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,360
Huh.

214
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
I want to drive through a super powerful dryer

215
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,080
that never works and has never worked

216
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,520
and does not dry cars

217
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,880
and I don't know why they're always there.

218
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,920
It just pushes the water kind of around

219
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,320
and it looks cool, but it's functionally useless,

220
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,840
but I want that on my body.

221
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,000
Would it kill you?

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
Okay, let's go through the process.

223
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,680
Okay.

224
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
So you're walking through,

225
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,880
you're going to get sprayed with water.

226
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
We have to assume,

227
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,720
you have to assume if you're a manufacturer of the car wash,

228
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,120
you have to factor in a first step

229
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
that is non-lethal to account for people

230
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
that did have their window rolled down.

231
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,800
They're just like, what the fuck?

232
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,400
This is how it works, okay?

233
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
So the first step, the initial rinse,

234
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
I got to say that's almost certainly non-lethal.

235
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,520
Not lethal, yeah.

236
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,360
Well, not lethal isn't the same as,

237
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,440
because I think what you're also assuming there is,

238
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
a lot of damage will be done,

239
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,320
but now you've figured out you need to roll your window up

240
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,800
because then there are other steps down.

241
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,200
And I feel like maybe if you get blasted

242
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
in every step of the way, it compounds the damage.

243
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,520
Interesting.

244
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,680
You're weakened, your hit points are low.

245
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
Yeah, you're definitely, you're bloodied.

246
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,760
You know what I mean?

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,560
Like, oh no, why didn't you roll your window up

248
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,080
after you were sprayed by the high-powered foamy water?

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,280
We're not going to be able to sort of arithmetic out the PSI

250
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,040
of these nozzles, yes?

251
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,920
But we can say, I can say pretty confidently,

252
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,280
you blast yourself with a power washer,

253
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,640
big rips, big rips up to GZO, you're done.

254
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,160
But it's not power washer pressure in the car washer

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,840
so it would rip the paint off the car, right?

256
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
And if it's not ripping the paint off the car,

257
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
it ain't gonna rip the flesh off my bones.

258
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,760
So I do not think the spray pressure

259
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,000
is gonna get me there.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,040
So next step, foam rollers, will those crush my petite body?

261
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
I mean, you can push on a car harder

262
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
than you can push on a person, Justin.

263
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,920
They're not engineered, though, to squish a person.

264
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,440
I don't know that they would get,

265
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,000
no one goes through those things on their motorcycle, right?

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,640
Like, they're not supposed to come in so far

267
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,920
that they could crush a man.

268
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,280
No, I agree with you, J-Man,

269
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,080
that they did not design them to squish a person.

270
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,080
But I'm saying- So they designed them

271
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,520
to not squish a person. Yeah.

272
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah, that's a toughie.

273
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know.

274
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,920
Well, you have to make a ruling on it

275
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,640
so you can't just sit back on your fucking ivory throne

276
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,600
and say, it's a toughie.

277
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,640
Okay, I don't think the foam rollers are gonna kill you.

278
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,040
I think that they're gonna be unpleasant.

279
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,040
Hugely unpleasant.

280
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,840
Because I'll tell you-

281
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
What about the turny ones?

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,440
Yes.

283
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,600
Because that's the ones that are like vertical.

284
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,000
And it's like a cat of a billion tails.

285
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,080
That is going to just rip the flesh from-

286
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,200
That would suck, actually.

287
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,040
That would suck shit, man. That might actually mess you up.

288
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,520
And we haven't even gotten to the undercarriage wash.

289
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,720
Oh, boy.

290
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Like, oh, my beepus, no.

291
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,240
That's gonna spray up through you.

292
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,000
That's the terrible thing,

293
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,480
because first you'll have the most profound

294
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,880
and prolonged orgasm of your life

295
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,400
as you discover your kink moments before you are killed.

296
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,000
Yep. That is a tough one.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,200
Then there's also the wax.

298
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,360
The wax is where I am.

299
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,480
I'm fucked up now.

300
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,720
Before we get to wax, before we get to wax,

301
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,080
we need to establish another rule,

302
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,960
which is, do I have to stand still?

303
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,280
Okay.

304
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,680
The rollers come at me.

305
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,280
You mentioned the vertical roller, okay?

306
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,920
Or the horizontal roller that comes in,

307
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,120
I can duck under that?

308
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,600
The vertical rollers, like, would it even be possible

309
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
for me to stand still while these two rollers

310
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
crush me from either side?

311
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,520
Or would it sort of squirt me out one end?

312
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
I think you have to keep feet planted,

313
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,800
because otherwise you could go hide in the corner

314
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,120
and this experiment is null and void.

315
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,640
I think there is a way that you could say,

316
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,720
this is a training session for American Ninja Warrior

317
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,200
where I'm going to avoid these things that will kill me.

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,680
But I think in the spirit of the question,

319
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,880
will it kill you?

320
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,600
You are committing to the experience.

321
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,160
Yeah, you want to go on this ride.

322
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,560
Okay, now we can return to hot wax.

323
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,120
Yowza.

324
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,600
Don't really have much else to add.

325
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,520
I think the wax is quite hot, right?

326
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,360
I don't know.

327
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,560
I mean, I really don't,

328
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,560
because again, like, I kind of feel like any spraying,

329
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
they have to take a chance that somebody

330
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,960
has accidentally rolled their window.

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,680
Like, I think that you have to be able to withstand

332
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
some of the spraying.

333
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I don't know if the wax is hot.

334
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
Like, sometimes this has hot wax,

335
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,760
and that I get, absolutely.

336
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm just not sure it's like murder hot.

337
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,840
Huh.

338
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,120
Yeah, but once again, Justin,

339
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm talking about a compounding,

340
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
like you've just been slapped all over

341
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,840
by a thousand, like, I don't even know what that's made out of,

342
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,840
but it makes a thunk when it hits my car.

343
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,320
Like, you are, I think, a thousand tiny cuts,

344
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,480
a thousand tiny welts,

345
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
and then you're getting sprayed by wax.

346
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,400
Even if that wax is not like flesh melting,

347
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,640
even if it's not boiling, it's warm.

348
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
It's warm.

349
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,560
It's not going to be a pleasant experience.

350
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
Nobody's saying it's going to be a pleasant experience.

351
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
No, but I'm saying it's horrible.

352
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,560
Car wash, well, their car's going through it,

353
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,080
and it's like, that's a pleasant,

354
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,240
mama mia, that's a pleasant experience.

355
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm saying that by this point,

356
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
you have been so tenderized

357
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,320
that when you get to the dryer,

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,160
even that pressure of air

359
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,320
is just going to force all the skin off your body.

360
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh, wait, are you going through nude?

361
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,560
Oh.

362
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,680
That's too many variables,

363
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,560
because then I can wear like,

364
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
like, you know, I find out I'm going to be

365
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
on this really fucked up high stakes episode of Fear Factor,

366
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
and I can dress for the occasion.

367
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,400
Yeah, I think you have to be nude.

368
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,480
I think you have to be nude.

369
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,920
I think you need to be nude.

370
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,960
I think you want to be nude.

371
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah, listen, you're not doing this

372
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,240
if not to be nude.

373
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,120
There's no news about a person

374
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,320
being killed in a car wash that I can find.

375
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
Oh, so there's not like an update on this?

376
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,220
What?

377
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,580
Oh, wait.

378
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,660
No, never mind.

379
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,860
That's a different thing.

380
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,460
I don't like Googling deaths.

381
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay, I'm going to quit Googling deaths.

382
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm out.

383
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,100
How about another question?

384
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,380
A real palate cleanser.

385
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,940
I hope this email finds you well.

386
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,420
Thank you.

387
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,300
So many people forget the pleasantries.

388
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,460
It doesn't, but if you could turn it around,

389
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,260
that would be neat.

390
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,020
I've recently resolved to dye my hair a dark red

391
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,420
after seeing a fellow coworker rock a bright red.

392
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,900
I work as an EMT and colored hair

393
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,500
isn't super common in the field.

394
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,260
So it's going to be super clear

395
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
that I'm copying her style.

396
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,660
Ah, my question is,

397
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,140
how do I dress the crimson elephant in the room?

398
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,860
Do I just rock up one day like nothing's different?

399
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,700
Or do I have to profess my envy of those ruby locks?

400
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,100
As from hair color conundrum in California,

401
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,260
this is actually a very challenging question.

402
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,100
Yes, I'm having a difficult time with it.

403
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,860
Because there is no like,

404
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,740
oh, is yours red?

405
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,980
There is no actor on earth that could deliver that

406
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,540
in such a way.

407
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,580
Your flave has been copped.

408
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,460
You've copped the flave.

409
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,660
Yeah, but I also think you couldn't in lead up to yours

410
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
be like, I love that color.

411
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,620
That's so good.

412
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,300
Because then when you do it,

413
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,900
it's just so like talented Mr. Ripley obvious.

414
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,740
It's so creepy.

415
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,260
It's so creepy.

416
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,700
You have to address it.

417
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,620
I think not addressing it is not possible.

418
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,820
So the question has become even more challenging.

419
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,540
How do you say,

420
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,740
is it okay that I have chomped this flave so completely?

421
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,260
Do you address it?

422
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,580
Okay, let's answer this first.

423
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,820
Do you address it before or after?

424
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,700
Because I can't imagine the before would be like,

425
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,900
I mean, hi, I just wanted to say

426
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,340
that your hair is so beautiful

427
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,300
and I just want to take it for my own

428
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,940
and allow my ascension to the complete me

429
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,300
of this crimson dragon that I and God are supposed to,

430
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,940
I'll just take your hair and glue it to mine.

431
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,300
Is that okay?

432
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm getting scared now and I don't like feeling scared.

433
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Why do you make me feel this way?

434
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,700
I don't think that's gonna go.

435
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,820
That's a worst case scenario.

436
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,060
No, but the post, the after credits asking Justin is like,

437
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:50,260
hey, I did this, what do I do now if you say no?

438
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,300
Like, hey, was this okay that I did this?

439
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,580
No, shit.

440
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,620
I got it, I got it, I got it.

441
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,900
You go to them, you say,

442
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,820
oh man, your hair looks so cool.

443
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,300
I've actually been thinking about dying my hair red for a while.

444
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,380
Can you tell me, like, you got any tips?

445
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,980
Long before you ever thought of it.

446
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,860
Well, no, you don't have to frame it like that.

447
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,740
You don't have to be the world's biggest jagoff,

448
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,380
but you can make it feel like they are doing,

449
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,260
like they're letting you in on the cool red hair club.

450
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,820
Ooh, can you help me, like, pick a shade?

451
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,380
Ooh, yeah, yeah.

452
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,580
Will you help me pick a shade?

453
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,260
I really think your hair looks cool

454
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,180
and I have always wanted to do a look like that.

455
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,420
And what better time to do it than now?

456
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,700
Will you feel the sense of pride and satisfaction

457
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,540
like Mama Bear and the Cub in teaching me

458
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,260
how to make my hair like a cool punk rock EMT?

459
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,740
And then we can form some kind of band of adventurers together,

460
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,300
saving people every time.

461
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,580
Every time you won't go in, like,

462
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,780
a fantastical Mr. Fox bullshit direction.

463
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,700
Well, oh, sorry, I forgot that you guys don't have dyed hair,

464
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,340
so you'd, oh, yeah, you don't, yeah, it's fine, don't worry.

465
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,420
Yeah, that definitely doesn't happen when you dye your hair.

466
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,460
The important thing is that you keep dying it

467
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,980
and as soon as new people come and get hired by the EMT company,

468
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,260
you, you, you, hello, welcome to EMT code.

469
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,940
We don't know what it stands for either.

470
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,020
Remember, it's $5 for medicine, $10 for bandages.

471
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,780
When they ask if they need to be intubated, that's $15.

472
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,580
Don't forget to give them the menu.

473
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,460
And if you sell 10 bandages, you get a bonus.

474
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,700
Don't forget to wear your hairnet while doing EMT.

475
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,700
And always smile.

476
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,940
Smile, no matter what's happening.

477
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm giving you a promotion.

478
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,420
Now you're Captain EMT.

479
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,380
You get to drive the big van.

480
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,420
And could you drop off my dry cleaning while you're out?

481
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm gonna tell you guys my smart thing I was gonna say.

482
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,140
Oh, the EMT van's driving by.

483
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,100
Does anybody need a bandage or medicine?

484
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,700
Do you have any inhalers?

485
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,940
Sorry, kid, just sold my last one.

486
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,180
We are plumb out of inhalers.

487
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,780
They go fast, man.

488
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,860
It'd be better than our current medical system.

489
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,740
Am I right, fellas?

490
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,120
Wow.

491
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:19,960
Wow.

492
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,780
Wow, Dennis Miller.

493
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,280
Wow.

494
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,100
Anyway, should I do a Yahoo?

495
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,020
Yeah, just make it, I think Travis actually, ugh.

496
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,220
I don't like the way this feels in my mouth,

497
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,700
but I think Travis had the best solution.

498
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,300
Just enlist him in the process.

499
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,180
That's very good.

500
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,300
I don't think that was my solution.

501
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,980
I think that was mine, but that's fine.

502
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,900
I guess here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

503
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,300
It is a Yahoo Answers username, DJ Donnelly, who does ask.

504
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,740
And I don't know if it's DJ short for like, you know, Danny Jean,

505
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,660
or if they grind it out on the ones and twos,

506
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,180
but DJ Donnelly does say,

507
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,500
how to live to 75 by eating nothing but cakes and milk.

508
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:24,660
This one is cool because I like that they are targeting 75.

509
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,860
Yeah, 75 feels like, listen, I only want to eat cakes and milk,

510
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
and I want to stretch this.

511
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,220
I want to ride that train as long as it will take me.

512
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,300
I do not think it will get me past 75.

513
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,220
Yeah, they're not shooting the moon.

514
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,900
75 is best case scenario.

515
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,940
There are no 80 year olds eating just cakes and milk out there.

516
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,020
Now, I like too that they are not asking if it is possible.

517
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,980
They are saying, how do I do it, right?

518
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,220
It's not like, has anyone done this?

519
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:53,780
No.

520
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,060
Someone's done it.

521
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,180
Someone has to have done it.

522
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,100
Now, this has introduced via a train of thought,

523
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,260
has pulled into a station to tie this back to an earlier question.

524
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,940
How do y'all feel about carrot cake?

525
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,220
It kicks ass.

526
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,300
Because it's got the carrots in there.

527
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,220
So that's like a vegetable cake.

528
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,180
Justin, what are you doing?

529
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,620
Nothing.

530
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,020
Thinking.

531
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,380
Just thinking about it.

532
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,180
Think out loud.

533
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,140
Okay.

534
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,860
Well, it kind of depends on the kind of ca-

535
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,900
I just wanted to say something good and useful here,

536
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,940
but it does-

537
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,580
Cake is a very open-ended word.

538
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:26,980
Yeah?

539
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,620
Yeah.

540
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,860
So there's like healthy cakes.

541
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,500
But is that healthy or healthier?

542
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,300
Everything's healthy in moderation, Travis.

543
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,260
It's what I keep telling you.

544
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,820
That's why I have all these dealer meal cards spread out everywhere.

545
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,700
It's called Dealer Cake.

546
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,060
It's this new program.

547
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,300
You have like a breakfast cake, probably coffee cake, right?

548
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:53,700
And then you have a sumptuous evening cake, like a crab cake.

549
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,060
And for lunch, there's urinal cakes.

550
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,940
Oh, nope.

551
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,420
No, no, no.

552
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,620
What does that do?

553
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,980
What's that do for your health, Justin?

554
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,860
Tell me now.

555
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,700
That- I was just a different kind-

556
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,540
I was trying to come up with different kinds of cake.

557
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,700
You two have made me hate this question.

558
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,140
And now I'll do a different one.

559
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,180
Healthy milks too.

560
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,060
Hemp milk.

561
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,340
Milk that gets you high.

562
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,980
Nice.

563
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,860
Now I'm back in.

564
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,540
Oh, we talking about hemp milk.

565
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,100
I'm back in.

566
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,140
You know me, I'm a major weed head these days.

567
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,460
And I won't touch nothing if it hasn't been wrung out of some hemp.

568
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,260
Should I do a Yahoo?

569
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,940
Do you think we've earned the right to go give some money from this episode?

570
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,740
I think I want to get some money from this episode.

571
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,540
All right, guys.

572
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:47,060
All right, guys, we promise we'll do it real quick.

573
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,180
You know what you should eat?

574
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,100
What's that, Trav?

575
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,100
You should eat Blue Apron.

576
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,620
It's like the cakes of boxed prepackaged pre-proportioned Beals.

577
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Did you say Beals?

578
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,380
Beals of Jessica Beals.

579
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,340
It's a full crate of beetles delivered right to your home.

580
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,100
Blue Beetle Apron.

581
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,340
That's good.

582
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,060
That's dope because I'm Timon and Pumbaa.

583
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,980
Love them Juicy Bugs.

584
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,820
They love eating Juicy Bugs.

585
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,420
But no, they're not going to send you Juicy Bugs.

586
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,540
They probably don't want us saying that.

587
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,460
They're going to send you fresh quality non-bug ingredients delivered straight to your door.

588
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,580
And you can cook delicious, easy meals in the comfort of your home.

589
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,740
The premium recipes take it a step further and give you a truly unique experience.

590
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,660
It's like bringing the restaurant home.

591
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,860
Which restaurant?

592
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,060
You decide.

593
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,020
Even if there's-

594
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,580
What?

595
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,180
I have- I made one of these and it had a thing in it that I've never-

596
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,900
Like I was making food that I've never even heard of before.

597
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,780
It was amazing.

598
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,020
What?

599
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:44,980
Yes.

600
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,580
I'm going to embarrass myself if I say what it was because it-

601
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,900
People will probably be like, you never had that?

602
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,100
I have that all the time.

603
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
But it was like a potato thing.

604
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,860
I can't remember what it was called because it's like so great.

605
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,300
French fries?

606
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,620
What?

607
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,180
French fries?

608
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,540
No, it was-

609
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,780
Was it a sweet potato?

610
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,020
No, it was a potato rosti.

611
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,660
Or rosti, perhaps.

612
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,700
That sounds like you're talking about like a roasted potato,

613
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,580
but you're also like a really fucking cool surfer.

614
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,380
No, it's like a rosti.

615
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:21,940
Rosti.

616
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,500
Shut up.

617
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,900
You're coming with me to the potato rosti.

618
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,540
Shut up, bro.

619
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,020
This is taking too long.

620
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,740
I'm just saying that it's a rosti.

621
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,100
It's like a potato pancake.

622
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,980
It's good.

623
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,700
It's swish.

624
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,980
Swiss.

625
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,860
Fuck!

626
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,900
Blue Apron is the first-

627
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,780
Swish, Scott!

628
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,820
We going to the potato rosti swish, bro!

629
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,580
Anyway, find comfort in the kitchen with Blue Apron

630
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,340
and enjoy delicious home-cooked meals.

631
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,580
Visit blueapron.com to check out this week's menu.

632
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,700
That's blueapron.com.

633
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,020
Blue Apron, feed your soul.

634
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,460
Oh no, I don't understand you.

635
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,540
Well, you would.

636
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,180
If you had learned that language I just made up on babble.

637
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,460
See, I was babbling.

638
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,860
So I was hoping that that was-

639
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,820
No, I got that.

640
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,500
No, I've been doing babble,

641
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,140
which is a great way to learn a language

642
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,260
or even relearn a language.

643
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,700
If you had one back in high school

644
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,820
and you kind of lost it a little bit,

645
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,980
babble gets you sharpened up real quick.

646
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,860
I have really dug that it's more conversational

647
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,940
than a lot of other foreign language apps

648
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,620
that I've tried before.

649
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,540
And baby, I've tried them all.

650
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,420
You're having conversations-

651
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,340
Did you get so enthusiastic about that

652
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,420
that you uppercutted your microphone?

653
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,860
I can always tell when it happens.

654
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,620
No, there's a dragon punch.

655
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,980
It starts with conversations really early.

656
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,220
So it's not just vocabulary.

657
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,180
You're discussing things.

658
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,140
The words are organized by ideas and conversations

659
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,300
you might have rather than just vocab.

660
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:11,220
So it's a really cool, much easier way to learn a language.

661
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,740
And right now babble, B-A-B-B-E-L

Welcome.

670
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,500
Thank you.

671
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,100
These are real podcast listeners, not actors.

672
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,060
What do you look for in a podcast?

673
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,980
Reliability is big for me.

674
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,700
Power.

675
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,660
I'd say comfort.

676
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,020
What do you think of this?

677
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,620
That's Jordan Jesse Go.

678
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,660
Jordan Jesse Go?

679
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,940
They came out of the floor?

680
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,740
And down from the ceiling?

681
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,020
That can't be safe.

682
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,300
I'm upset.

683
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,660
Can we go now?

684
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:03,620
Soon.

685
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,180
Jordan Jesse Go, a real podcast.

686
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,940
Here's another question.

687
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,820
I have always wanted to hold a pigeon.

688
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,100
The city pigeons seem like such funky little docile guys,

689
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,740
and I'm curious to see if they would let me get close enough

690
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,580
to let me scoop one up in my hands.

691
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,060
However, my girlfriend does not think this is a good idea.

692
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,260
She's worried I'd get attacked

693
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,420
or contract some sort of disease from said bird.

694
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,980
Please either help me to convince her

695
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,260
that this is a safe plan

696
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,580
or talk me out of trying to snag a pigeon

697
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,020
next time I'm in a city.

698
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,460
That's from The Pigeon Pal.

699
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,820
I don't actually know.

700
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,300
You know what?

701
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,940
I actually have...

702
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,500
Let me make...

703
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,580
Who could possibly possess a level of expertise

704
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:48,980
about this exact subject?

705
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,020
Oh, I bet it's the pigeon lady from Home Alone 2.

706
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,140
Is it Brenda Fricker, Justin?

707
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,180
Do you have Brenda Fricker?

708
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,140
It's a lot of numbers.

709
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,180
That's too many numbers.

710
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,300
Still calling.

711
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,860
Still calling.

712
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,860
It's the MC Bat Commander,

713
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,300
the lead singer of the Aquabats.

714
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,420
Hold on, let me see if he's...

715
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,260
Wait, you're gonna use our one token?

716
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,620
Yeah, he gave me this token

717
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
to whenever we're in need,

718
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,460
and I feel like this is pretty dire.

719
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,580
Hello, this is the Bat Commander.

720
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,860
What can I do for you?

721
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,460
Hey, it's us.

722
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,420
We're using our token.

723
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,140
It's the McElroy Brothers.

724
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,820
You remember the token you gave us?

725
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,020
You said it for anything?

726
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,780
Sure, yeah.

727
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,700
Who is this again?

728
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
McElroy Brothers.

729
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,300
We did your show for free,

730
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,380
and you said that there'd be money,

731
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,660
but then there wasn't money,

732
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,820
and so instead you gave us this token

733
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,420
that does have Chuck E. Cheese on it.

734
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,700
How are you guys?

735
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,740
We're doing good.

736
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,860
Bat Commander, where are you at on pigeons?

737
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,660
Well, pigeons, pigeons.

738
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,260
I feel like pigeons are our friends.

739
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,460
Like many of the animals we are friends with,

740
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,820
pigeons are some of them.

741
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,660
Where do you sit on scooping up animals

742
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:09,620
in the line of duty protecting Earth?

743
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,260
Have you had occasion to scoop up animals?

744
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,260
What's your sort of track record on animal scooping?

745
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,780
Yeah, there has been a few times

746
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:22,180
where there has been some necessary scooping of animals,

747
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,500
you know, scooping them out of the street,

748
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,060
catching some baby chicks

749
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,700
before they get run over by a Stingray Corvette,

750
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,100
things like this, you know.

751
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:36,180
How often does that happen, the Stingray Corvette line?

752
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:39,060
You wouldn't believe how much baby chicks

753
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,980
are attracted to Stingray Corvettes.

754
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,500
They love those 70s muscle cars, yes.

755
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,020
You might say it's kind of a chick magnet.

756
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,820
There you go.

757
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,180
Oh my God.

758
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,620
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

759
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,700
Here's the deal with the pigeons.

760
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,060
Let's just level with this.

761
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:54,420
Let's just level with it.

762
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,740
Finally, let's cut through all the ball crap.

763
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,820
Human relationships are important.

764
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,500
His girlfriend is scared of the pigeons, okay?

765
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,060
Pigeon attacks are on the rise, it is true.

766
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:08,180
I mean, there's thousands of pigeons out there, ready?

767
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,500
I mean, and pigeons.

768
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,980
Right now, they're desperate to find anyone to attack.

769
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,180
They are so hungry.

770
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,860
Can you imagine how many french fries

771
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,500
they're not eating every day from street cafes?

772
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,300
Those potato chips and chickpeas off of salads

773
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,340
that they can't eat.

774
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,740
Pigeons are starved and they are pissed off.

775
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,620
That's right.

776
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,140
Pigeons are angry.

777
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,540
So I can feel her pain, but at the same time,

778
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,780
any man, woman, whatever, that feels the need

779
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,220
to scoop an animal needs to get that scoop off their chest.

780
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,420
If you know what I mean.

781
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,340
Get that scoop right off your chest.

782
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:51,300
But it feels like there could be like an oils on the hands.

783
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,540
You know how you're not supposed to touch stalactites

784
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,620
or stalagmites when you're in a cave system

785
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,340
because your oils will forever leave an imprint.

786
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,700
Right, I've heard that, I've heard that.

787
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,900
Yeah, if the oils on my hands somehow like

788
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,860
coat the pigeon's wings in some sort of anti-flying juice.

789
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,420
That's true.

790
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,980
Is that a concern?

791
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,100
You know, pigeons are remarkable, remarkable animals

792
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,580
and we have to respect them and get our oils on them, right?

793
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,980
Essential oils, human oils, whatever it may be.

794
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,660
Olive oils.

795
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,860
Essential worker oils, all of those things.

796
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,820
But here's the thing.

797
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,140
Pigeons are the ancestors of our phones.

798
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,820
Let's face it, guys.

799
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,380
I mean, right?

800
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,940
Pigeons are caveman phones, right?

801
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,620
Tape messages to pigeons and they fly and deliver messages.

802
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,140
So we have to respect the pigeons

803
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,860
and that's why they live in the cities.

804
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,940
That's why we give the pigeons the licenses

805
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,940
to live where they do, right?

806
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,380
Maybe instead of just staring down at your phone all day,

807
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,700
like all of us are doing, like Banksy said,

808
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,300
in that one piece of art,

809
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,140
maybe look at the pigeons because they were phones

810
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,060
and we used to just stare at pigeons

811
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,420
and I would love to go back to that.

812
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,460
Let's go back.

813
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,260
Let's go back.

814
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,820
I tried to use a pigeon as a cell phone once,

815
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,140
but the only game that would work on it was Angry Bird.

816
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,940
That's two!

817
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
It's just fucking full of them, man.

818
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,260
Incredible!

819
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,620
That was really good.

820
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,980
Hey, we were on the Aquabats show

821
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,940
and I'm assuming that's available on YouTube now

822
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,860
as people are listening to this.

823
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,420
Yes.

824
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,220
Yes, that's right.

825
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,500
It came out.

826
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,340
The Shrinky Bats episode of the Aquabats Super Show

827
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,180
just came out and you guys are so fine in it.

828
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:46,980
You're great.

829
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,340
Your acting skills,

830
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,620
the pigeons that surrounded the hot dog cart,

831
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,100
that Justin was soliciting people's businesses,

832
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,980
the essential business of selling hot dogs

833
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,100
to people on the street.

834
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,580
It's fantastic.

835
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,180
Watching and enjoying that episode,

836
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,420
I don't think anyone will appreciate

837
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,740
the amount of discomfort that was involved

838
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,860
with the shooting of this.

839
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,660
It was cold, it was blustery,

840
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:19,220
and I had to pee so bad that I thought my brain was gonna melt.

841
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,820
You really sacrificed for your art.

842
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:21,620
Thank you.

843
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,380
Yeah, and there was no porta-potties,

844
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,820
there was no honey wagons, as we say in Hollywood.

845
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,100
There was just, you know, there was the street corner.

846
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,060
There was a lot of fun looks.

847
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,580
People were like, what are you guys doing?

848
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,340
Imagine how I feel.

849
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,100
I have a fake mustache all the time.

850
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:36,900
What?

851
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,620
It's fake?

852
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,100
It's a real mustache.

853
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,020
It's just not real hair, if that makes sense.

854
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:44,660
Oh, cool.

855
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,380
That's a perfectly sensible distinction.

856
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,820
MC Bat Commander, thank you so much for joining us.

857
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Yeah, you guys are on the episode

858
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,540
that just came out and we have a new record coming out

859
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,500
called Kooky Spooky in Stereo, June 20th.

860
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,380
So look for that, look for that, you guys.

861
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,260
It's gonna be great.

862
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,140
Or listen for that.

863
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:09,220
What's the advice that we're gonna land on with Pigeon Pal?

864
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,700
I feel like you have given every bit of advice on the spectrum

865
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,900
from respect the pigeons to pick them up

866
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,260
and get the scoop off your chest.

867
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,660
I feel like the question asker, Pigeon Pal,

868
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,500
can really just kind of choose their own adventure

869
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,540
as far as that goes.

870
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,700
They could just sort of go with whatever advice suits them.

871
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,540
Thanks, MC Bat Commander, we're even now.

872
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,100
We're square.

873
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,020
Well, I still owe you lunch.

874
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,300
So, and a port-a-potty and a hot dog.

875
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,420
Hopefully not all at once.

876
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,020
That would be an uncomfortable afternoon.

877
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,540
It could be fun, could be fun.

878
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,220
Hey, I got a Yahoo here that was also sent in.

879
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Okay, that was also sent in by several people.

880
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,260
So that's why Yahoo answers user Negotiator who asked,

881
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,900
I think we've done a Negotiator one recently.

882
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,820
Wow, they're big in the scene right now.

883
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:01,940
They ask, is it possible to discover new large birds still today?

884
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,060
Huh, yeah, sure.

885
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,540
I know that Justin's sort of the bird head among us

886
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,060
because he's seen, well, you've seen most of them,

887
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,940
if not all of them.

888
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,660
And you're always talking about that.

889
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,700
I was very excited about that.

890
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,140
But I guess my question is like,

891
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,780
we got satellites in the sky.

892
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,420
Yeah.

893
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,140
Let's start there.

894
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,100
Are they spreading, are they spreading the coronavirus?

895
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,260
Oh, no one's quite sure about that.

896
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,980
But we got these satellites in the sky

897
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,780
that are definitely spreading coronavirus,

898
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,780
but they're also, they have taken pictures

899
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,620
of every square inch of this planet.

900
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:37,940
And so we've seen all the land that there is.

901
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,380
You're not gonna, you discover a new island.

902
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,100
You know what I mean?

903
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,860
But what about a large, like a new large bird?

904
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,140
Well, the thing is, it's like,

905
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,500
like this is assuming that all birds look like birds, right?

906
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,340
That you'd see a picture of like, that's a bird.

907
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,740
But what if a bird looked like a bush, right?

908
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,180
And you're like taking a satellite picture

909
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,540
and you're like, that's just a bush.

910
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,100
No, no.

911
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,900
Oh, cool.

912
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,700
That's a bird.

913
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,780
Maybe something weird like this whole time

914
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,420
camels have been birds.

915
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,740
Ooh.

916
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,340
Like we just didn't put it together

917
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,460
because they just don't look in any way like birds

918
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,140
and don't have feathers and don't lay eggs

919
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,460
and don't do bird tricks.

920
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,780
Well, it'd be two birds, isn't it?

921
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,020
Each camel would be two birds.

922
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,620
If we had thought about it for like a fucking second,

923
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:28,420
we would have realized that all camels are two birds.

924
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,060
And you know what?

925
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,500
Maybe there's just a big bird

926
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,020
that we've all been seeing a lot,

927
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,700
but like taking for granted, right?

928
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,180
Like there is, it's a new species of bird

929
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,620
and we've all seen a bunch of them

930
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,020
and everyone thought definitely someone

931
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,940
like categorized that bird, right?

932
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,540
Catalog that bird, right?

933
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,580
Right, but we've just been taking for granted

934
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,420
that everyone knows that bird, right?

935
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,260
I could have seen, that's a great point, Charles.

936
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,340
I could have seen a new bird many, many times

937
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,140
and it would not have crossed my mind to think like,

938
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,580
hey, I don't know what that one is.

939
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,500
Maybe that means it hasn't been discovered yet.

940
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,300
I thought that whilst on the JoCo cruise last year,

941
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,100
you know, we'd sail past a tiny spit of land

942
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,700
and your thought is like,

943
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,300
definitely someone owes that land,

944
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,580
but what if they don't?

945
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,900
What if I was the first person to see that

946
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,140
and it's full of weird big birds

947
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,100
that I could be riding on or talking to?

948
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,380
And that's the fucking dream, isn't it, man?

949
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,860
Don't get me started.

950
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,340
Just saying.

951
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,860
There's probably a fucking diesel ostrich out there

952
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,380
that I could choke a bow, right?

953
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:30,100
There's probably like a fucking jacked ostrich

954
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,660
that I could just fucking mount

955
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,860
and ride across the countryside.

956
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,220
I understood what you meant,

957
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,220
but it also sounded like a fun way of saying

958
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,580
you wanted to choke an ostrich.

959
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,620
I mean, if that's part of the-

960
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,780
It's a lot of neck to not want to choke it,

961
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,420
is what I'm saying.

962
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,260
No, we've talked about this for sure.

963
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,260
We've definitely talked about this,

964
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,940
I think maybe in the context of geese,

965
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,420
but ostrich, that ball still plays.

966
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,380
And if the choking is part of this sort of riding process,

967
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,660
then that is a price I'm willing for the ostrich to pay.

968
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,660
I'm just saying that show me eight birds right now

969
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,220
and say which of these isn't cataloged.

970
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,060
I got no fucking clue.

971
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,180
I could go one day without Travis demanding

972
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,460
to see a picture of eight birds.

973
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,420
I'm saying, why has no one shown me these eight birds?

974
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,500
I don't feel like, if eight birds exist,

975
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,260
where's the proof, you know?

976
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,780
Where's the proof?

977
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,460
Wait, you're saying eight birds?

978
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,700
You're saying there's fewer than eight birds?

979
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,460
No, I'm just saying if there's more than eight birds,

980
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,100
I haven't seen them.

981
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:36,820
I yesterday had a cardinal outside my front door.

982
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,300
That's what?

983
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,500
That.

984
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,140
No, listen.

985
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,460
Okay.

986
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
I will list all the birds I've seen.

987
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:47,700
No, this cardinal would fly in front of my glass door,

988
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,700
kind of poke it with its beak,

989
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,700
and then fly off to the side.

990
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:55,540
And then 20 seconds later, it would fly back over

991
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,900
and be like, hey, what's going on?

992
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,060
Hey, can I come in?

993
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,860
This is weird.

994
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:00,340
Okay.

995
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,020
And then fly back off to the side.

996
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,020
This bird did this for 10 minutes.

997
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
Guys, I've never seen anything like it,

998
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,820
and I'm not a superstitious person,

999
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,980
but I thought it had to be important for something,

1000
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,540
an omen of something.

1001
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,140
And I don't know what it meant,

1002
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,820
but this cardinal just looked in the door for 10 minutes.

1003
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,940
Why was it doing that?

1004
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Now, was there a point in there, Justin,

1005
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,980
where you thought maybe this bird wants me to follow it?

1006
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,860
Okay, that's one option,

1007
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:37,140
that it knew where some sort of treasure or cool plant was.

1008
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,780
Okay, according to the very cursory Google search,

1009
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,100
apparently there's a lot of symbolism

1010
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,860
attached to red cardinal sightings.

1011
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,340
The Choctaw people believe that the cardinal's

1012
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,620
an omen regarding relationships.

1013
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,540
If you're single, it could mean

1014
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,980
that your status is about to change.

1015
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,140
If your relationship is in trouble,

1016
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,460
the cardinal may be a warning that things need to change.

1017
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,740
I'm not saying that your relationship

1018
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,100
with Sidney is in trouble.

1019
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:58,820
Things are good on that front.

1020
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,060
But if you did walk up to her and you're like,

1021
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:06,500
babe, I got a split, saw a badass cardinal outside,

1022
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,820
got a split, you know what that means?

1023
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,740
No, but at one point Sidney's mom told us

1024
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,060
that it was an omen of pregnancy

1025
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,940
and my hand turned into a hatchet like T2

1026
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,460
and I just chopped the thing in half.

1027
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,020
Oh.

1028
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,620
So without even thinking about it,

1029
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,460
it was insatiable, people.

1030
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,820
It was just instinct.

1031
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,460
Yeah, there's a lot of us talking about

1032
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,060
hurting birds in this episode.

1033
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,380
Well, what are they, that's what they deserve.

1034
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,300
No, I'm not, I don't mean that.

1035
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,100
But it's like, hurtin' birds.

1036
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,780
No Justin, I know when you're,

1037
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,380
I know when you're being serious

1038
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,660
and I know that your hand turned into a hatchet

1039
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,180
and you killed a bird with it

1040
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,940
and that's fucked up, dude.

1041
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,740
I know your joking voice

1042
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:50,180
and I know your serious voice

1043
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,860
and that was your serious voice.

1044
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,980
Be better, Justin.

1045
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:56,660
I don't condone bullying.

1046
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,380
No, only against birds, right?

1047
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,940
That's not applicable to this thing.

1048
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,700
You can't just say a good thing

1049
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,620
to counterbalance the fact that you killed a bird

1050
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:08,340
with your mercury shifting hand.

1051
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,260
I'm currently dealing with a dilemma.

1052
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,660
Is it okay to vape while in a Zoom class?

1053
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,100
Can I get in trouble?

1054
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,500
It's not like the professor can get mad at me about it

1055
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,260
because I'm doing it in my bedroom

1056
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,660
but it still feels like there's something morally wrong

1057
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:23,380
about whipping the jewel out on camera in front of everyone

1058
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,500
and if it is okay, how do I go about it?

1059
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,100
Should I try to be subtle

1060
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,020
or just act like I know what I'm doing?

1061
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,140
Am I overthinking this, vape shy in Vermont?

1062
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,140
I love that those are the two options.

1063
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,900
Should I be subtle or just act like I know what I'm doing?

1064
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,100
I'm going to vape.

1065
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,260
I will vape.

1066
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,220
I will vape.

1067
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,140
I might chief it and blow it back into my polo

1068
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,180
but I will vape.

1069
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,020
It is gonna happen.

1070
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,220
Here's a subtle way you could do it.

1071
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,500
You could take a bit, wrap it in your fist, right?

1072
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:57,060
So it just looks like you're thinking

1073
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,780
and then act like you're taking a drink of water

1074
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,860
out of a glass and blow the smoke into there

1075
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,860
so it blows out the sides

1076
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,180
and then just look at the glass horrified

1077
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,060
and then begin to change into a monster.

1078
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,660
Okay.

1079
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:15,380
Every day I pray, I wake up and I pray

1080
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,180
that it'll be the day I'll see someone vaping through a mask

1081
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,340
and I haven't seen it yet.

1082
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,580
I just pray to the sweet, sweet Lord above

1083
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,420
that one of these days I'm gonna see it

1084
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,700
and I drive by the Walmart

1085
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,620
just assuming that'll be the spot if I'm gonna see it

1086
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,980
but I haven't seen it yet

1087
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,620
but I'm still holding out hope.

1088
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,380
And you know, the irony is if they remade the movie The Mask today

1089
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,820
he would definitely vape.

1090
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,500
He would definitely vape.

1091
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:45,700
Vaping.

1092
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,820
And then he would say that instead of smoking.

1093
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:53,700
I hate that I had to explain.

1094
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,180
I hate that I had to fucking explain that joke

1095
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,260
to you two assholes.

1096
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
V-A-P-E-Y.

1097
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,860
I wish they would make another mask today.

1098
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,220
I would love that.

1099
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,020
That would make me so happy.

1100
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:16,580
Today?

1101
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,100
Right now?

1102
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,940
Yeah, he can't get close to anybody.

1103
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:29,700
They should remake The Mask shot for shot

1104
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,380
but nobody can get within six,

1105
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,820
no character can be within six feet of any other character.

1106
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,900
He has no respect for social mores

1107
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:39,220
but lots of respect for social distancing.

1108
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,580
That's fucking great.

1109
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,300
Jim Carrey plays this like nerdy banker

1110
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,060
and Cameron Diaz rolls up

1111
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,300
and stands six feet away from the desk

1112
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,500
as she does her bank business

1113
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,180
and he's like, boy, I sure would like to kiss pretty Cameron Diaz

1114
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,420
but I can't because of social distancing.

1115
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,420
Then he puts on this mask and he's like,

1116
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,740
I'm gonna get within six feet of ya.

1117
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,020
And you're like, dude, that's too crazy mask.

1118
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,460
Somebody stop me.

1119
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:04,500
Not physically.

1120
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:05,860
We're not gonna take risks.

1121
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:12,980
Nobody touch me.

1122
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:13,620
That'd be badass.

1123
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:15,060
P-A-R-T, why?

1124
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,100
Because I'm lonely.

1125
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,600
Zoom.

1126
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,300
Zoom suit riot.

1127
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:25,940
Oh boy.

1128
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,220
All right.

1129
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,060
Boy, I need to go watch The Mask.

1130
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,980
It's an extreme, extremely powerful desire right now.

1131
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,620
I'll watch, I'll settle for Son of the Mask, baby.

1132
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:38,340
I don't give a shit.

1133
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,580
Like honestly though, don't fuck around with that.

1134
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,340
Don't joke about watching Son of Mask

1135
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,820
because it's got some scenes in there.

1136
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,420
It goes places.

1137
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,140
It goes places.

1138
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,460
There's an extended urination scene.

1139
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,780
There's an extended urination scene.

1140
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,740
There's this scene and it's,

1141
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,820
I just double checked the length.

1142
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,820
On YouTube, it's four and a half minutes long

1143
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:12,580
and it's just the Mask lip syncing to too good to be true.

1144
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,460
You're just too good to be true, right?

1145
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,540
But he does like a rap version and a country western version

1146
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,300
and it is absolutely horrific.

1147
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,020
Why did they give the Jamie Kennedy mask hair?

1148
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,020
That's all I wanted to say.

1149
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,940
And we'll put it to bed there.

1150
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,620
I cannot believe how little we talked about this incredibly pure

1151
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,660
and beautiful question of how to secretly vape in Zoom calls.

1152
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,740
I cannot believe we didn't.

1153
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,180
Cause you can't just keep turning your video off

1154
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,420
every time you want to rip it.

1155
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,700
Cause everyone's gonna,

1156
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,460
I feel very, very self-conscious

1157
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,940
anytime I have to turn the video off on my thing

1158
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,340
because I think people are gonna assume

1159
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,740
that I'm fucking cranking a jewel up.

1160
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,380
That is what I assume when you do it.

1161
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,420
Can you keep pretending to drop things?

1162
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,660
Just have a pin on the side of your desk that you keep-

1163
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:05,460
Ah, fuck!

1164
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,820
This damn pin again!

1165
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,060
Can you pretend like you're on fire?

1166
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,860
Maybe your garbage can is on fire

1167
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,660
and you keep dipping down like to check in on it.

1168
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,500
Like I figured out at this time, guys,

1169
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,540
and then there's more smoke.

1170
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,460
Can you sit down when the class starts

1171
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,220
and have a like a Walgreens prescription bag

1172
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,540
that you pull your vape rig out of

1173
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,780
and then you can rip it, no questions asked.

1174
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,380
If somebody's like, what are you doing?

1175
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,100
You'd be like, did you see the prescription bag?

1176
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,540
My doctor said I need to.

1177
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:37,700
This is medicine.

1178
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,780
And also I should remind you

1179
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,580
the safest option is to quit vaping now.

1180
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,700
There might be,

1181
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,260
we're starting to see some research emerge

1182
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,420
about connection between coronavirus

1183
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:54,180
being more severe in people who vape.

1184
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,660
So I do want to just put this disclaimer on here

1185
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,340
that although we don't really understand

1186
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,700
the dangers of vaping,

1187
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,460
it's probably best that you stop vaping.

1188
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,140
Also, it's just not cool anymore.

1189
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,740
No, that's the problem.

1190
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,180
It's as cool as it's ever been.

1191
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,220
It's still fucking cool.

1192
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,060
Now listen, if you don't do Juul

1193
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,820
and you do your own rig with your own oils in there,

1194
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,100
it's probably fine.

1195
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,660
No, actually that's what Griffin has just said

1196
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,500
is inaccurate.

1197
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,020
Listen, if you're doing it from a big business like Juul,

1198
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,660
your health is gonna be affected.

1199
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:32,740
But with your own extremely powerful unregulated rig.

1200
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,700
Don't let the government regulate your omes.

1201
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,300
You are in control of your own omes.

1202
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,140
And if you make the fluid at home,

1203
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,660
you know what's going.

1204
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,500
If you empty out your sister's fog machine

1205
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,260
and dump some apple juice in there

1206
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,420
and just go to town vaping it.

1207
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,580
I'm not saying you're definitely in the clear,

1208
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,740
but you're probably fine.

1209
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,940
It's probably fine.

1210
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,740
It's organic at least.

1211
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,260
It's at least organic.

1212
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,300
Organic means things you make yourself, right?

1213
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,820
It's organic basically.

1214
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,100
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1215
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,980
my brother, my brother and me.

1216
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,740
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1217
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:17,780
We've got some new stickers over at McElroyMerch.com.

1218
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:19,700
Not for sale, Justin's just bragging

1219
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,100
about some bad ass stickers we bought.

1220
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,780
It's got Squidward.

1221
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:25,380
Here's fucking Lightning McQueen.

1222
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:29,700
I got one, it's Calvin and he's pissing on the coronavirus.

1223
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,820
It's Calvin pissing on a smaller Calvin.

1224
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:33,540
It's so cool.

1225
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,300
That one's pissing, you get the idea.

1226
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,180
But that's at McElroyMerch.com.

1227
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,220
I traded some Heathcliff the cat stickers

1228
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,740
for some Beyblade stickers.

1229
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:46,900
So that's a major glow up.

1230
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,780
I also want to, if you are looking for some,

1231
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,300

We've got a lot of fun stuff over there.

1235
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,060
I think it's real good.

1236
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,940
There's Monster Factory.

1237
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,700
You sound like a fucking cop.

1238
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,220
You say that every time.

1239
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,460
Maybe I am.

1240
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,300

1241
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,460

1247
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:26,660
Oh, I'm this Thursday, the 14th, I believe.

1248
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,660
Yes, I'm going to be doing a live stream event

1249
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,620

1250
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,060
where we're just gonna be funny for a while.

1251
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,460
And it's not to like raise money for anything

1252
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,500
or anything like that.

1253
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:41,300
It's just a fun time of me and Janet Varney hanging out.

00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:16,260
It's from Yahoo Answers user Drew, who asks,

1268
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:21,380
is it safe to flush grapes down the toilet?

1269
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,980
I need to get rid of them somehow.

1270
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:30,580

Let's go wear on the lips.
