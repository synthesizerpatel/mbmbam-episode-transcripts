1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown Honey, I'm still free, take your chance on me

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's My Brother, My Brother and Me, episode 13. We've arrived.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is an advice show for the modern era, and I'm Justin McElroy. I'm one of the Tequila Brothers.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm Travis McElroy, and I'm the other Boobular Brother.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm Griffin McElroy, and I'm not gonna stoop to that level.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But I will, I think we need to apologize again.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Again?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We made a decree, I think it was ep 8, which was like two eps ago, saying we'd never miss another show.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And we didn't miss it, it's just a little bit late.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I would say I missed it.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I missed it.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But I think because of that decree, the nice feelings that people projected last time we missed the episode of Sorrow and...

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It turned, right?

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, it turned, and people went absolutely bonkershits, and I didn't know how to handle that energy.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
They tore the internet apart.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
They fucking raged inside the internet, and they raged against it.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They flipped the script.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I would say that they hurt my feelings, except I knew that we had it coming.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And you don't have feelings.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I don't have feelings anymore, so I'm so sorry this time.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Even though it was entirely Justin's fault.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yeah, big refund coming your way.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm in West Virginia for a week.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Is there anything I should do whilst in Huntington besides listening to Clint McElroy on WTCR Mornings?

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Travamanman from Twitter.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're already doing the most important thing.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
All your news, information, sports, weather, everything you need is right there.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tear.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Comedy.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Comedy.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Tear off the knob.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Tear off the knob.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't touch that dial.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's got jam on it.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If by the time you leave Huntington, you don't know what the words Ducky Crabtree mean, then you haven't done your job, my friend.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Failed.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You failed.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel like we need...

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't fuck them.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We haven't had Ducky do a guest spot yet, and I think that a Ducky Crabtree guest spot on My Brother, My Brother and Me is...

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh my god.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Have you guys ever tried Googling Ducky?

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I wonder if Ducky comes up.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh my god.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now I need to check.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go on about your business.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to look.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
As far as other things to do, soak in the sights.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go for a walk on Marshall University's campus.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Dear Clint McElroy, why the hell doesn't Ducky Crabtree have a Facebook page?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Facebook page for Ducky Crabtree or I quit the internet forever because there's no point.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Go to Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You could hunt down Justin.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, don't do that.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You could hunt down Justin like he's wild game.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, don't do that.

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm going to vote against that one.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are we voting?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't think that one's very good.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Or you could stay there for 22 years and then leave.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just kick it.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let me give you an alcoholics perspective.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
$2 pitchers at the Union on Monday, karaoke on Tuesday at Sharkey's, $5 all you can drink

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
at Fat Patty's on Wednesday.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No, it's V Club.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're thinking of the V Club.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's Wednesday all you can drink.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, it's $5 all you can drink at Fat Patty's too.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Thursday is Thirsty Thursdays at the Thirsty Whale and then you have Friday, Saturday,

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Sunday, wherever you want to go.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You just recuperate.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yeah.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Think about the bad decisions you've made.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The terrible decisions and how you need to get out of Huntington or you're just going

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to drink yourself to death because it's so fresh.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It is.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's a good drinking scene in Huntington.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yahoo Answers user Timothy asks, and this question was sent in by TJ Madd, loyal listener

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
to the show.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you, TJ.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What does it mean when kids or Japanese people come and stand next to you?

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Are they trying to be friendly?

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was at the supermarket looking at herbs and a boy came and stood next to me.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I was at the sports field taking pictures and a Japanese guy in baseball gear came over

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and stood near to me and I started taking pictures too.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm a guy too.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm Chinese but look Korean slash Japanese.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Do you have a similar experience?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you think?

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You know what?

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm glad someone finally had the balls, the shi-hutsu to bring this up because I've had

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
this theory for years that the kids and the Asians are working together to fuck with us.

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No, it's not that.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's all about omens and portents.

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
On this, our thirteenth episode, we're talking about omens and we're talking about portents

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and if a kid comes and stands next to you, that is a bad omen.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is he on your left or is he on your right?

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Either side, regardless of which direction he's adjacent to you.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, I think if he's on your left, it's bad news for you and if he's on your right, it's

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
bad news for a loved one, I believe, if I'm remembering this correctly.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's also a daylight savings time component.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, fuck yeah.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But if a Japanese person comes and stands next to you.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh boy.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh man.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Get ready.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Get ready for good stuff because here it comes.

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's coming on down.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's that tumbling down the mountain?

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I think it's a nugget of fortune headed your way.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The problem is you can't try and stand next to a Japanese person to try and emulate that

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
good fortune because they'll run away.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There's fry.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And if they run away, that's six more weeks of winter.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yep.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Omens and portents.

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is a bad omen.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is from FormSpring.

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
My best friend's ex-GF constantly hangs out with her friend and group, having isolated

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
all her friends when they were dating.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a problem because even when they were dating, we barely tolerated her often selfish

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and childish behavior.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please help.

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ah, she's a zilch.

130
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Just tell her to go away.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Get out of here.

132
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
No thanks.

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Hit the road, sister.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Next time she walks in the room, just speak in this kind of tone and saying things like,

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
mm-mm.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No thanks.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't think so.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Actually, I'm trying to have a conversation with you.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, gross.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Too bad.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's grody.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's don't say we did.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So, bring up all mid-90s phrases.

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
P-A-R-T-Y, because I gotta.

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mask?

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, okay.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's just the mask.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Shoot.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Shoot.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, shit.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Reganomics.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What?

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If that doesn't work, you could always dump a bucket of pig's blood on her.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No harm could come from that.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She'll get the message.

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Dude's sweet, I think.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, talk to her ex that is a staple of your group, because it's his problem.

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's on him.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He brought this fucking albatross into your group, and now it's his job to dispatch her.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Next time, just be like, it's on you, Ricky.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's on you.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's on you, Ricky.

164
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Next time, she comes in and then walk out the room.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then you get the bonus of every time she keeps coming in the room, you get to give

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
him that look.

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You get to look at her across the room and be like, you son of a bitch.

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is your doing, Rick.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We talked about this, Ricky.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Richard.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Richard.

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Richard.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Kyle on Gmail asks, hey guys, is talking to yourself weird?

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Context.

175
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
All about context.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Context is so important.

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You know what?

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you're giving yourself a badass pump up speech in the mirror, I do that from time

180
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to time.

181
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know what?

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I decided it was weird because I talk to myself all the time.

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Talking to yourself about stopping talking to yourself is weird.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll start to say out loud, what am I doing?

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I need to stop.

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I look crazy and I use my hands a lot.

187
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But when you get out of the shower and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
just grit your teeth and you give yourself a let's fuck some shit up cowboy, then that's

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
not weird.

190
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's not weird at all.

191
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's natural.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I talk to myself all the time.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I say things like you're going to have a great day today.

194
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Send that positive energy my way.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can definitely do this ten thousandth push up.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I say things like, oh, God, oh, God, he's turning blue.

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You have to stop.

198
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You have to stop.

199
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, God.

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, God.

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, God.

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You have to stop.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You have to stop.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why aren't you stopping?

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You made me sick.

206
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You made me sick.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You made me sick.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I wish you were dead instead of him.

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, God.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, God.

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Is he dead?

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You have to run.

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,440
You have to find someplace to hide and bury the body.

214
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,640
And I don't think that's weird.

215
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,700
It's just it helps you sort your thoughts out, you know.

216
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,120
So there's this girl I like.

217
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I don't.

218
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,680
But I'm pretty sure a friend of mine likes her, too.

219
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,600
She works in the same office as him, so it's likely he's made more progress and just generally

220
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,280
has more access to her.

221
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
He's a good guy.

222
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
So I'm conflicted.

223
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
Should I continue the pursuit or back down?

224
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Shane.

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,280
This is great because this isn't one of those too late questions where it's like my friend

226
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
is engaged to this girl.

227
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
How can I get her?

228
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Yeah.

229
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,280
It's this is open, open season kind of question.

230
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Sure.

231
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,680
Well, that's kind of completely less offensive kind of way.

232
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I don't know.

233
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,720
He's already taken it that direction with this made more progress.

234
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
Yeah.

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
What is it?

236
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,320
Is he got to the eighth level of sleeping with her?

237
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,880
Like, what are you talking about?

238
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
He won the first 10 points.

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
I got two in there somewhere.

240
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,240
My question is, how much do you really like this girl if you're not seeing her any at

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
all?

242
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,320
Like if your friend's making all this progress because he works with her and sees her all

243
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,880
the time, what kind of interaction do you actually have with this girl?

244
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
How do you know her?

245
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
I think it breaks down to who saw her first.

246
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,200
Yeah, that's what it is, which the thing I don't think it's you, Shane, because he works

247
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
with her.

248
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,720
The key thing to keep in mind is just don't consider her feelings.

249
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Yeah.

250
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Sure.

251
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,480
That's the most important thing, because if you ask her what she wants, then, oh, I don't

252
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
know.

253
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
No.

254
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,480
The decision's not up to her.

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,280
But if it were, she would go with your friend.

256
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,040
Guys, I respectfully disagree.

257
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,600
I think Shane, step one, go to where she works.

258
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
Step two, barge into the office no matter who tries to stop you.

259
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Step three, stand over her cubicle yelling, which one do you choose?

260
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,840
You can only have one, you trollop.

261
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,840
Pick one.

262
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,360
Stop dragging my heart around.

263
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,160
I think that's the solution right there.

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,120
Or you form a bro pact with your buddy and say, you know what?

265
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,120
We both dig her.

266
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,400
I think to preserve our friendship, neither one can have her, and then two weeks later,

267
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,640
you flip it.

268
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,360
You're not really good friends with him anyways.

269
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,080
Don't even worry about it.

270
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,480
Or you say, I'll date her Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

271
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,920
You can date her Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and then Sundays will trade off.

272
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,160
This is all sounding really good, guys.

273
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,320
I think, you know what?

274
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,160
I was worried we wouldn't be able to come up with a really good answer on this one,

275
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,760
but I feel like we've- Or cut her in half.

276
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Cut her in half.

277
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,880
Whichever one of you stops doesn't really love her.

278
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,000
You know, obviously, which have to take the bottom.

279
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,800
I thought you meant cut her in half lengthwise.

280
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Oh no.

281
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Oh no, she'll die from that.

282
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Yeah.

283
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,840
You'll have to put her together like one of those whistle suckers that doesn't work unless

284
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
you have...

285
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,880
Remember those whistle gummies that people used to have?

286
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,720
You stick two gummies together, you turn into a whistle, she'd be like that.

287
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,720
I gotcha.

288
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,400
I might've dreamed them.

289
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,140
I think you may have dreamed them.

290
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:34,720
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user Kibby MIA, who asks-

291
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,520
What happened to Kibby?

292
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
He's MIA.

293
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
I don't know.

294
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I haven't seen him in a while.

295
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Did he go AWOL?

296
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
No.

297
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
No.

298
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
VTOL?

299
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
No.

300
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Those aren't...

301
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
He's MIA.

302
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Guys, I just got the news.

303
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
He's Kibby POW.

304
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Oh no.

305
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Yeah.

306
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
No.

307
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
We're going to get you, Kibby.

308
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Stay strong.

309
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,160
Tristan's going to come, he's going to bust up Osama's-

310
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,080
Tristan's coming, Kibbs.

311
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Just hang on.

312
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,360
Hang on to hope.

313
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,200
This is a topical sports question, which we'll know a lot about.

314
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Who better?

315
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,200
LeBron with no legs or Kobe with no legs?

316
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,040
This is how much I know about sports is the thought I just had was, okay, so they both

317
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
have legs.

318
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I do know they...

319
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
I've settled that.

320
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,780
Now, I know they both have legs.

321
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,800
They both have two big, strong legs each.

322
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Sinui.

323
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,760
Big, sinui, beautiful trunks.

324
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,120
You know, you said, you said, who better, beautifully phrased, and I, you know, I first

325
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,200
thought who would be better in a sporting event, but maybe he's asking who would learn

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
the most and become a better person.

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,560
Okay, so let's cut it in, let's split this question in half like we would with-

328
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
Shane's girlfriend.

329
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Shane's girlfriend.

330
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Okay.

331
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,360
So, who would be better at sports?

332
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,840
Me.

333
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Okay.

334
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Really?

335
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Is this between us?

336
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,840
You think if you went Chicago 21 against LeBron and Kobe, neither of which had legs.

337
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
Let me tell you-

338
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,360
Would they, like, Cripple Masters join up and one would be the arms and one would be

339
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,720
the legs?

340
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
And their torsos would fuse and they'd be like a push me, pull you, but they'd be really

341
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
good at basketball.

342
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Yeah.

343
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
And-

344
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
I love this.

345
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I love it too.

346
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
And really good at defending reporters.

347
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,800
Oh, but they play for two different teams now, don't they?

348
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Yeah.

349
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
That would get tricky.

350
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
So, okay, Kobe Bryant, 31 years old.

351
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Okay.

352
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,360
Are you looking up some stats?

353
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Yeah.

354
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,800
Kobe Bryant, 31 years old, and according to this card that I cut off the back of his action

355
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,000
figure, he's got a power rating of eight.

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay.

357
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay.

358
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's a lot of fucking power, dude.

359
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yeah.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
On a scale of-

361
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's a lot.

362
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a big-

363
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Scale of 10?

364
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah.

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okay.

366
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,280
Kobe Bryant's stats are a nine and his tech skills-

367
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Jesus.

368
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
His tech skills are a seven.

369
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
Wow.

370
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,560
This guy's a fucking super genius.

371
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Yeah.

372
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
He's a super genius.

373
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Holy hell.

374
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
He's a super genius, super slam dunk artist.

375
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
What's he doing balling?

376
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,160
He should be up in NASA taking us to the moon and shit.

377
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,960
He balls at night and invents during the day.

378
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
Oh my God.

379
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,520
LeBron James, age 25, power rating nine.

380
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Ooh.

381
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Oh.

382
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Yeah.

383
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Smart.

384
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Kick it up.

385
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Seven.

386
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Seven.

387
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Holy shit.

388
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Holy shit.

389
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah.

390
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
LeBron James is really good with tech.

391
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,520
Do you guys remember when time travel was invented in the year 2010 by the king, by the

392
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,360
basketball king, the king of all basketball?

393
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
We have to get back.

394
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
How?

395
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
There's only one way.

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,800
We have to subvert the laws of the LeBron continuum.

397
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Fuck.

398
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Fuck, LeBron.

399
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,800
You missed that really important three pointer and now the Miami Heat lost their basketball

400
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,800
game.

401
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Not so fast.

402
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,320
Pew, pew, pew.

403
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,480
Only time travels back and makes the shot.

404
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Yeah.

405
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
That's what that sound was.

406
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,800
He goes back and he meets George Washington and a clown and he helps him decide where

407
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,320
to put the state capital.

408
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,280
LeBron James in the time belt.

409
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,320
So I guess, I guess that answers that.

410
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
LeBron James.

411
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
LeBron James.

412
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,100
Who would be a better person?

413
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,360
We talked about sports side.

414
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
Who would be a better person?

415
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,560
It depends.

416
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,680
If you live in Cleveland, it's Kobe.

417
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,440
If you live outside of Cleveland, it's LeBron because Kobe didn't, didn't know, but here's

418
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
the difference.

419
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,240
I think Kobe has the most to learn.

420
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Kobe's got a lot.

421
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,240
What?

422
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Why?

423
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Well, he's kind of a dick.

424
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
Because his tech skills are.

425
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,400
No, you're, you've flipped them.

426
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
You flipped them.

427
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
LeBron's kind of a dick.

428
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,120
No, LeBron's a dick to people in Cleveland, but people in Miami think he's great.

429
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Yeah.

430
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,200
They think he's the best.

431
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,680
Did you move down to Miami, Travis?

432
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
Did you get down there?

433
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,440
I am, I am noncommittal to any geographic location.

434
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah.

435
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay.

436
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
So you're a world president.

437
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,440
Except for Norman, Oklahoma.

438
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Represent.

439
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Um, so I guess that answer, yeah, I think we've pretty well addressed that one.

440
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,720
Driven it right into the ground.

441
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
BC Potter.

442
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Maybe that's what happened.

443
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
Maybe they didn't lose their legs.

444
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
They've been driven into the ground.

445
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Who put this cement here?

446
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
A whole Larry Bird.

447
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Larry Bird from Bugs Bunny.

448
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Just getting into shenanigans.

449
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Space Jam 2.

450
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
We took LeBron.

451
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Kobe.

452
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Kobe.

453
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
Kobe.

454
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Kobe.

455
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Kobe.

456
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Kobe.

457
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
Kobe.

458
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Kobe.

459
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Kobe.

460
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Kobe.

461
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Kobe.

462
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
I hate Kobe's legs.

463
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,200
Get on Taffy's shoulders, stupid.

464
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,620
Bc Potter from Twitter writes, my woman wants me to shave the old berry patch.

465
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,040
Any suggestions to get the job done as clean as possible.

466
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,680
What's going on in her scene, that she wants you to be clean shaving down there?

467
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,900

weird you're a weird you're a weirdo you can say why why don't you get your head

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,760
on the gunner it's my dad sicko then they're the sick ones I think there's a

528
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,880
way to be creepy about it now I'm just kissing my dad on his sweet bristly lips

529
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,880
look at me what's up with that stainless double that I'm by your Gillette fusion

530
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,560
I think it's the creepiest thing I've ever heard oh there it is I'm just gonna

531
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,960
be straight up I'm usually pretty accepting of abnormal behavior but fuck

532
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,080
that that is weird I don't think you know though until you do it I think

533
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,080
everyone after they're done listening to this episode needs to go find their

534
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,960
pep-pep and plant one on him right on his sweet lips I've been looking for a

535
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,800
good sign-off for the show for so long and I think kiss your dad square on the

536
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:03,440
lips is probably square on his sweet plump lips kiss dad god I'm so disgusted

537
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,320
right now you're like drenching in your throat yes I hate both of you I'm

538
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,040
muting my microphone as we speak so I can bomb it in the corner

539
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,160
here daddy come here pep-pep here it comes is it worth it to pick up a penny

540
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,800
that is considering the amount of energy expended in the cost of food required to

541
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,560
pick up said to provide said energy can a penny be considered profit Ryan gmail

542
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,980
no no what no you know what I do when people give me pennies no joke I throw

543
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,280
them in the garbage that's where pennies go in the garbage do you know why

544
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,360
because that's a penny receptacle because pennies are in garbage pennies

545
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,880
are garbage they're worth more the metal in them is worth more than the value

546
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,080
that we've artificially passionate they're awful they're the worst coins

547
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:55,560
they're only they're politicians from from zinc states can can keep jobs and

548
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,560
in their home hometowns imagine this you're cleaning your room and it's been

549
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:04,380
a while and you move a chair and there's a glint in the carpet and you say oh my

550
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,960
goodness a coin but then it's a penny is it worth it no because I like this

551
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,840
feeling in the world I just throw that across the room and say I'll find that

552
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,600
again later I like to call pennies hobo pranks because hobos asked for change

553
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm like sure here it comes here comes a big fistful of pennies gotcha better

554
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,480
luck next time they like wear cargo pants with like 18 pockets and just

555
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,920
fill them with pennies and then wait for someone to ask you for change and then

556
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,520
just start dumping out your pockets oh man that's gonna be a real good prank

557
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,880
it's gonna be a real good goof and it's gonna be worth it to have all those

558
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,960
stinky heavy-ass pennies in your pants what smells worse side side topic what

559
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,640
smells worse than a receptacle that has held coins something that has held coins

560
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,040
previously and then you get your you get your your snog in there get your sniffer

561
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,800
yeah that's a well that's on the other hand what smells better than a

562
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,760
receptacle that has contained a large sum of paper money yeah oh yeah that's

563
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:12,560
that's sweet right that coin stuff smells like you made a robot out of dookie

564
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm gonna go one step further and say fuck nickels and dimes too and quarters

565
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,640
quarters are where it's at and that's that's the only thing let's see it when

566
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,560
was the last time like nobody's ever bought anything with a penny but when

567
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,640
was the last time you actually bought something with a nickel or a dime never

568
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,560
yeah I put them in the parking meter yeah you put them in the parking most

569
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,320
parking meters though they don't even take those anymore they only take

570
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,080
quarters I actually I only believe in using Sacagawea coins you want to try

571
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,160
that again for all our Native American listeners who are so angry right now

572
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Sacagawea but you'll get it I call them I call them

573
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:10,760
savage sense see I think it might be a think it might be offensive check our

574
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,600
lips and stats and see if we have any listeners on reservations because if so

575
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,400
I will I will delete that around the outside of the coin it says in many gods

576
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:40,840
we trust so let's let's end the show cuz you know we've all got things to do

599
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,520
it's basically gonna be a conduit for listening to shows and getting in touch

600
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,680
so it'll have like buttons for you know emailing and form springing and and

601
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,640
calling the show and the biggest feature is you'll be able to listen to all the

602
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,160
episodes right there without the use of iTunes or anything like that as

603
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,840
background the background listening and and all that stuff but it certainly is

604
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,400
no pressure or anything if you want it cool if not it's only if it would be of

605
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,960

607
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,120
