1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
One, two, three, four!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My brother and Elrod and me

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Have a rare, have a radio station you see

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We try to give people some simplicity

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To understand their problems endlessly

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We try to be solvers of problems

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And solutions to them

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We try to give them hope and encouraging again and again

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That they will get wisdom and understanding

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We try to see the sunset at the end of a storm

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When things are torn

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We try to help people find out

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Solutions not problems all about

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We are psych psychologists

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Giving people the best through their impressions

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We try to understand the world

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Just like a guy tries to understand his girl

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, everybody, welcome! Gosh!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What an honor to be here at the Washington, D.C. Press Corps Correspondence Dinner.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Man, wow. Filling in for Conan and O'Brien at the last minute is a lot of pressure.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Especially since they had to get three people to do it.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yeah, and we're all huddled around this microphone.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's just, let me try the mic.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Go ahead.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's just start out with this.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hey, New York Post, you're a bunch of racist pieces of shit.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And everything about your fucking shit rag sucks bloody cocks.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Fuck you guys to death.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Good one.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My farts that come out of my butt are better journalists than you real human beings.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You giant fuck holes.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's pretty good.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's try something political.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Maybe a little lighter, Griff.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, okay.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Keep up with the politicians.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yeah, just one real quick for the Fox News Correspondence.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I hope all your kids have diarrhea to death.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oh, wow.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's just where I'm at right now.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you have one for like any, maybe like maybe you want to roast a politician?

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, sure, sure.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've got one for basically every congressman.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
All that stuff I said about Fox goes for you too.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I ran out of stuff because really once you wish dysentery,

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
once you wish like the 10th plague on a group of people,

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you can't really get much worse than that.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Okay, great.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, okay, I see we are getting the wrap up sign.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you so much.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thanks.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fuck everyone here.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thanks.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can I get this to go?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You don't have any boxes or anything?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Anderson Cooper, you're okay.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wolf Blitzer, you're on fucking thin ice dog.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You goofed the Boston stuff.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's all.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's usually really solid.

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But you goofed all the Boston stuff.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So I'm Justin McElroy.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sorry for the harsh words.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I had a great bit about Senator Lindsey Graham having a woman's first name.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That was actually the joke.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That was not a bit.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Was it the dick pic guy?

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He tweeted a dick pic?

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who was the dick pic guy?

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Lindsey Graham is the one who hates all goodness and purity in the world.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Probably got teased a lot for having a girl's name.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm talking about Tony Weiner, who recently just got back on Twitter,

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
and his first tweet since getting back on Twitter.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
His last tweet before this tweet was,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
looks like I got hacked or something.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Super didn't get hacked.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Unless the hacker had intimate log-ins.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And his first tweet back was an at mention of his own name.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And that was the entire contents of Twitter.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good job on Twitter, Tony.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Doing pretty good on Twitter so far.

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tone.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Tone.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Tone Love.

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is my brother.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
My brother made an advice show for the modern era.

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We could have taken questions, Griffin.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know why you had to be so aggressive.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Everyone fucked up.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everyone fucked right up.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
At the dinner or just in general?

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If both the press and politicians could maybe take the night off

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
from goofily zinging each other and just like,

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
maybe do one thing right instead of that.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe just do a thing right.

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Can I be honest with you guys?

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hit me.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I realize now I made that joke about can I get this to go.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Do they actually eat dinner at the Correspondents' Dinner?

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't know anything about it,

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
but I imagine it's a pretty good spread, right?

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
They had halibut and filet mignon.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like at the same time?

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, they baked a filet mignon inside of a halibut.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And we got people starving on the street while they eat fish steaks?

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not right.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Everything's wrong about it.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Good job fucking up, guys.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Here's some halibut.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This isn't how Benny Franklin would have done it.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
President Ben Franklin.

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Our greatest president.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I feel like we've joked about Ben Franklin being president before.

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think we've joked about Ben Franklin.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's not because we're unoriginal.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's because we're fucking dummies.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because we're idiot children.

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's help people.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That would be our penance.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
My fiancÃ© and I want to get married.

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Problem, it's expensive.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not to mention the hassle.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Starting to think we should ditch the big ceremony reception ordeal

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and just elope someplace nice.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is there any way we could get away with that without being disowned?

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's from marrying in merryland.

133
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In this day and age, eloping just means going to the courthouse.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He's not climbing to your window and you're sneaking off on a night.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What Travis and I are doing has become the counterculture.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A courthouse wedding is, I feel like, the norm.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I feel like 96% of people do that.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Not an exaggeration.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I think about half the people I am friends with have been married in a non-ceremony.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's an anomaly because it's usually closer to 96, like I said.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sure, right.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't have all the numbers in front of me.

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What Travis and I are doing is adhering to some archaic ceremony.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's a ritual.

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's like a blood ritual.

146
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you know what I mean?

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's practically aboriginal in nature.

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I am very cautious now when we talk about marriage.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Because the last time we addressed ceremonies that are perhaps on their way out,

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:48,000
we talked about the preponderance of people where the man asks the woman's parents for their daughter's hand in marriage.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And oh manzies, there are some people who that irritates.

152
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A man alive, that was a booby old firestorm.

153
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What were people irritated by?

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That apparently our West Virginia values are not good enough for urban, hint hint wink wink, America, I think.

155
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't understand what urban wink wink means.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Urban, you know.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Urban.

158
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And Keith Urban.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We got a lot of emails from Keith Urban.

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I did that.

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He's not Australian.

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He is.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait, is he?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He is.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Okay.

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I did that.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I asked Rachel's parents for permission.

168
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I know Travis did something similar by which I mean he asked Teresa to ask for him.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yep.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is that not a good thing to do?

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I think it is.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I think that apparently it really made people mad.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I think there's a better way we could have phrased it.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think if you talk to, I think the way we specifically addressed it was asking a dad for his daughter's hand in marriage.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think the preferred sort of approach now is maybe talking to her parents beforehand and letting your intentions be known.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So it doesn't completely catch them by the willy.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Before we actually help this person, I think the problem.

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No, this is tied in.

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think it's all sort of tied together.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I think the issue is the image of asking for or the appearance of it being asking for the daughter.

181
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Right.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That was not how I.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think that is what seems sexist because you're saying like, hey, may I take your property?

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, you may.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think it's more of a discussion.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't frame it like that.

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There was no exchange of wampum.

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Like I just said, hey, I'm going to do this thing if that's cool.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is that all right with you?

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is that cool with you?

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And they actually their actual response was I didn't think people did this anymore.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They were grateful, but they were they were startled.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please take back your crates of beads and blankets.

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I wrote up actually on one of those bicycles where the front wheel is like enormous.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It was a it was a very kitschy pre-proposal.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think that you've hit the nail on the head, question asker, because I think that at least a lot of people that I talk to that still do the big weddings,

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
especially as it gets close to the crunch time of the actual ceremony.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And they're like, oh, my God, it would be so much easier if we just went to the courthouse and got it over with.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Usually it has something to do with.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But my family would kill me, you know, which is never a reason to do anything.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But like it is something it is a factor that should weigh on your mind.

202
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will say this, though, if you don't do the big ceremony reception, which I get and I understand that, don't ask like don't ask for gifts.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think those two are pretty well tied together.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, I don't know unless it's like you frame it like a payoff for making them not have to get on a plane.

205
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Like I am making you not fly here in return.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How about two blenders?

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What if you only sent out invites and save the dates to people you knew couldn't make it,

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and then you didn't have a reception or ceremony and just got the presents?

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Huh, huh, OK.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm actually happy, which I mean, it is a long con.

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is a grift.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is a grift with what I would classify as a relatively high possibility of being completely fucked.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's going to turn into a movie because your great aunt that lives in Hawaii is going to show up

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and you're going to have to stage the whole thing last minute.

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah, exactly.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know.

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We started out thinking that we were going to get out of ours on a dime.

218
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And boy, oh, Chef Boyardee, who are we wrong about that price tag?

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Who?

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I think that's true.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I think of everyone because I like Teresa and I thought we are going to reinvent the wedding.

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You know what I mean?

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You guys haven't been through this yet.

224
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What I would say to this question asker is I understand the expense is an issue.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I do think that there are some clever ways to sort of handle that in a way that really makes sense for you.

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You can personalize.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There are no rules.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Just right.

229
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Weddings are like the outback.

230
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What I would say to you is that day where we had all of our friends and family in one room sort of seeing us off,

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:35,000
as it were, on this metaphorical journey that is marriage, that day means a lot to me.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Remembering that day and thinking back on it, it makes me feel really entwined with all the people that were there.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Is that a memory?

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I wouldn't trade that day for anything.

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Now, of course, I did minimal planning.

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It didn't pay for mine.

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A lot of the specialness, maybe it's like Christmas.

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Christmas is much more magical when you don't have to reduce any of the magic yourself.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But once you get into the price per memory ratio, is that memory a 15 large memory for you?

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Because that's some total recall shit.

241
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's some come into the memory sphere.

242
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This will cost you 20 million credits to remember the time that you fucked an octopus.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

244
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ink me.

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Ink me, you whore.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Ink me.

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Octopuses don't have whores, so squids.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

249
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Octopuses don't have ink.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Did I say whore?

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yep.

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Octopus is a very moral creature.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It is.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's why you got to pay 20 million space credits to simulate the octopus anyway.

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You guys want Yahoo?

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I guess.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Thank you, Ira Ray.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's by Yahoo Answers.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you Ira Ray?

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Who wants to know?

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We did it.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We did it.

264
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
We did the set up.

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We did the call and response.

266
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Now the bit can die.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Now the bit is dead forever.

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Goodbye, bit.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Goodbye, bit.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Have a good run.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is asked by Yahoo Answers user SP, who asks, how do I find my place in the circle

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
of life?

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How do I find my place in the, quote, circle of life, like Mufasa told Simba to?

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I feel like I've forgotten who I am.

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What does it mean to find your place in the circle of life?

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And also, what does it mean to know who you are?

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Good question.

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
My Spain, your money.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's step one.

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Have you guys heard Travis's one-man Ladysmith Black Mombasa cover band?

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's called Ladysmith Black Travis.

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Keep going.

283
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I like this question so much because he asks how to do these things, and then he follows

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
that up with, by the way, what are these things?

285
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think if your dad didn't hold you up over a cliff when you were born.

286
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh my god.

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That was, I feel like there was 1990, what do you think?

288
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go on.

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You were doing really good.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
94, 95.

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
With the sun rolling high.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Stop, stop.

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
In the sapphire sky.

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It was definitely the I'm king of the world of neonatal dads.

295
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Every neonatal doctor in the fucking biz, from like 1995 to 1996, every dad, he would

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
be like, oh, good.

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yeah, like the movie, like the Lion King film, the animated motion picture that came out.

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Even Michael Jackson got in on that trend, and we crucified him for it.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, he did it wrong.

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He did it wrong.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
No, he didn't do it wrong.

302
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He did it big, just the way MJ did everything, Travis.

303
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He didn't, though, because he fucking covered the bit.

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He didn't proudly hang him over the edge and let people take, he just very briefly was

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
like, he did it in the creepiest way possible.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He's like, just go and dangle this little baby, toast, bye.

307
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's all he did.

308
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He's the worst, except his music was so good.

309
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm conflicted now.

310
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Like, I think the literal way is you fucking jump into the zoo pen and get eaten by a lion,

311
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and then that lion poops, and it grows grass that a buffalo eats, and then you're inside

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
the buffalo.

313
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I think the good news for this question asker is I doubt very much that on your deathbed,

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
somebody whispers to you like, by the way, you were supposed to be an astronaut.

315
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What a wonderful service that would be.

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You blew it.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You blew it.

318
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You blew it.

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Just before you go, before your light flickers and dies, I just want you to know, you got

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
a married Heidi Klum.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's tear open the envelope.

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Ah, fuck.

323
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't wait to see this.

324
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I can tell you what it doesn't say.

325
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It does not say quickie lube attendant.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You have done fucked up.

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Now, what is the alternative?

328
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The alternative is that some people have somehow jumped the track and have gotten your spot.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yeah.

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's like, oh shit, you were supposed to be a quickie lube attendant, Mr. President.

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Nice work.

332
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
How'd you jump that?

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I mean, where is your place?

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Like, what?

335
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is it?

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
All right.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Let's start.

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What's the circle of life?

339
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Question my question.

340
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Circle of life.

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are we talking about food chain?

342
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Are we talking about photosynthesis?

343
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I think it's the life death circle, the endless circle that is life and death.

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, now we're talking about so many different things.

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are we talking about reanimation?

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's not what it's called.

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, Jesus.

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Reanimation.

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That fucks up the circle of life right good, though, doesn't it?

350
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah.

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Are we talking about zombies?

352
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No.

353
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's the figurative life.

354
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Because then it's the Mobius strip of life.

355
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah.

356
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I mean, we're at the top of the food chain.

357
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There's not much.

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And that's why it's such an insult when one of us gets eaten by an animal, because it's

359
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
like, ugh.

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What are you doing?

361
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We're better than that, you know?

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,660
If I could balance that out whenever somebody gets mauled by an animal, I eat a lion.

363
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,400
Just to keep it all on the list and let them know what's up.

364
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,120
Why aren't one of the three of us like a mad hunter?

365
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,000
Why aren't one of the three of us like a general czar-of-esque, like ivory for days?

366
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why?

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,880
I mean, there's probably a lot of reasons.

368
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,200
If you we get a lot of people asking us, you know, will you guys come out and do a live

369
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
show in our area?

370
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:23,560
And the answer is always no, unless you can arrange some sort of hunt where we get to

371
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:30,480
shoot something beautiful and perfect and hopefully from the Lion King.

372
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,920
Now I want to be clear here.

373
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,880
I love animals.

374
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,000
Me too.

375
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,640
And so I don't want any of those PETA guys calling me.

376
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,480
I just want to kill one.

377
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
You just want to kill one.

378
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah.

379
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
One of each.

380
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
There's nothing wrong with that.

381
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
And let me tell you this.

382
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
You better have some trim on hand, because I'm going to be fucking rock ready to go.

383
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,880
I want to, I want to like kill something and eat its heart to get its power, right?

384
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
So that I'm really potent.

385
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
You know what I mean?

386
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Sure.

387
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Like a Mega Man boss.

388
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
Yes.

389
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Now I have legs of an antelope.

390
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Sprawling.

391
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,560
Kermit, are you saying to me that if you killed an animal from the Lion King, you would become

392
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,560
rock hard?

393
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,560
That's what you're saying to me right now.

394
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
One bigger than me.

395
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,600
You remember when GoDaddy killed that elephant and we were like, boo GoDaddy.

396
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:27,440
But then at the same time you think about like, that guy has to be stiff till November.

397
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,080
And just imagine that, but if it was a person.

398
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,120
Now listen, are we talking hypotheticals or?

399
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
Always on this show.

400
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Okay.

401
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm going to say first, if you're a police officer, you legally have to stop listening.

402
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,000
If you're a police officer, you have to tell us.

403
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,680
Also we're going to talk about Lost Spoilers, so unless you want to know what happened.

404
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,640
If you have not watched Lost or you're a law enforcement officer.

405
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,600
Or both, God forbid.

406
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,080
Um, I, that's, I don't know Justin, you're getting into uncomfortable territory for me.

407
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,800
Hunting people is uncomfortable?

408
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,880
I would never hunt.

409
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,200
I don't think I can do it.

410
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
I feel bad when I would never do it.

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,480
Although I do remember when kids used to get out of school in Huntington because hunting

412
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
season, the first day of hunting season.

413
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,760
Well, I mean, it wasn't called fucking Macromayton was it?

414
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,560
It wasn't called Paintington was it?

415
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
No.

416
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Nope.

417
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
Sure wasn't called that.

418
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
It wasn't called Skateboard Town.

419
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,040
It was not called Skateboard Town.

420
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,240
So, I don't know what to tell you.

421
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Mathsburg.

422
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Here, where all the kids do math for fun.

423
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,620
I've been dating this wonderful girl for three months now and things are going great.

424
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
I'm like half.

425
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
I'm like a sentence in.

426
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
I'm bored of this question.

427
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
Alrighty.

428
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
No, it gets good.

429
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,000
I hope there's some conflict.

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
We're finishing up our first year of school and making plans for when we return in September.

431
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,960
We both lived in the dorms this year and would like to live off campus in the fall.

432
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,920
But the thing is she's dead set on living in a house together with four of our friends.

433
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,920
This seems like a big leap for such a new relationship.

434
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,200
I've explained to her, but she insists we will have each have our own space and there'll

435
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
be four other people living there.

436
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,120
If we're not really moving in together, I shouldn't worry about it.

437
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,480
Am I wrong for being hesitant?

438
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,640
I don't want to miss out on what could be a fun experience.

439
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,760
I just know if we break up, it'll make the next year we're stuck together completely

440
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
miserable.

441
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
That's from Cautious in California.

442
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Get out of the way.

443
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:29,440
Slow-mo diving in front of you right now.

444
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,520
That's me putting my head underneath the pin that you're going to put.

445
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,640
I don't care if it stabs through my brain and kills me.

446
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
You have to not.

447
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
I know.

448
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm going to tell you this straight up.

449
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,880
Look at your girlfriend and say, honey, this is worse than if we are just living in together.

450
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,560
It is literally the worst situation that you could be in because here's what you're piling

451
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,560
on top, right?

452
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:56,220
So these other people you have to get used to living with six people in the same house.

453
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,920
Like that's Bummerton.

454
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,140
I don't know how big this house is, but we've got a huge company house that our actors stay

455
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,800
in and there's six people there and like it just breeds the occasional fight because you're

456
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,200
sharing bathrooms, you're sharing living spaces.

457
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,800
Plus, if you and your girlfriend have fights, the rest of the thing has to deal with it

458
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,280
or one and vice versa.

459
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Yeah.

460
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Like necking on the couch.

461
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,840
They're like, oh, God, again.

462
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,840
They don't want to.

463
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
They don't.

464
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,600
They're trying to watch Lost and you're trying to make you're trying to make fuck juice and

465
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,120
they don't want to see that.

466
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,800
While they're finding out that the polar bear is escaped from a research facility.

467
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Yeah.

468
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
That's spoilers.

469
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,520
We did warn you ahead of time, to be fair.

470
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,620
I just think that three months is wicked soon to move in with somebody.

471
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:47,200
Even if your shit is going perfect, moving in like living, especially if your shit is

472
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,200
going perfect.

473
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,200
Now, counterargument, Teresa and I moved in together after three months.

474
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,280
You were obviously meant to be the one that was the difference because we literally had

475
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
the conversation.

476
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,920
If we're going to move in together, are we going to get married?

477
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,760
Jesus obviously molded both of you from dust to be each other's partners into infinity.

478
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
Obviously.

479
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,760
Yeah.

480
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,880
So I guess if you put at no point did I ever worry about breaking up with her.

481
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,440
Not that I'm saying there's anything wrong with your relationship, because I think that's

482
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,200
perfectly normal to think about when you're a freshman in college and you've only been

483
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,440
dating someone for three months and they want to sign a lease.

484
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,360
So I'm just saying that it's probably very smart of you.

485
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,520
Very logical of you to say, honey, we're only nineteen and we've only been dating three

486
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,840
months.

487
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,600
Let's just live in the same apartment building if that's the way you want to go with us.

488
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,380
Even that is fucking a tall grass like the weirdest.

489
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,440
The important thing, though, is separate leases.

490
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,680
If you move in with somebody after three months of dating, I personally think that's a little

491
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
fast.

492
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,480
But if you are fucked up, Travis, like, sorry, Jeff, but if you're dead set on it.

493
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
But no, I'm Travis.

494
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
It was a risk.

495
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,520
And you came out on the winning end.

496
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,080
I'm saying that could break bad.

497
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,280
Oh, God, yes.

498
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,640
What if you have turned out to be a huge dick, Travis?

499
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
Like what?

500
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
I know.

501
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
I know.

502
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Because I know.

503
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
What if she had realized?

504
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,640
Right.

505
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
I know it wasn't going to be Teresa.

506
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
That fuck that deal.

507
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Angel.

508
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Yeah.

509
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:15,040
But if you like living with other people is not.

510
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
We've talked about this before.

511
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,000
I feel like ad nauseum, but living with other people that you're not dating is like the

512
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,120
pits and you could get to a point where, like, you need out and you're that is going to be

513
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,560
tough on your relationship.

514
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,440
If one of you like hates the situation, the other one doesn't.

515
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,960
That's going to be a lot of strain.

516
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,680
I feel like the situation is going to put a lot of unnecessary strain on on on you guys

517
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:41,640
unless unless let me hit you with this.

518
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,080
It's a new it's a new reality show that I'm thinking about pitching to the Fox reality

519
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,080
network.

520
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,640
They still in operation does not exist.

521
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,640
Go on.

522
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,640
It's not functional.

523
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
Solitary.

524
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
Put him out of business.

525
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
I just started watching that show.

526
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,640
Yeah.

527
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,640
It's Rachel.

528
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Fuck it.

529
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
It is a show.

530
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
It's on Hulu.

531
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,640
It's on Hulu.

532
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

533
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
Is it?

534
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
It's finally my Hulu plus subscription.

535
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
It doesn't stream to consoles.

536
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Sorry.

537
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Hit you with this.

538
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,480
So young couple, young.

539
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,600
They got to be sexy.

540
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
I'm just assuming this.

541
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,920
It's Fox.

542
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Yeah.

543
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,880
And then the four people that they live with for a year.

544
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,600
So like the budget of this show is going to be astronomical.

545
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,320
Just in terms of like tech, I have a lot of cameras, the editing for years or the footage.

546
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,120
Each of the four people try and seduce them away.

547
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,960
And if you can make it through that, if you can make it to that year long gauntlet of

548
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,720
strange sex, then you not only win $50,000, which admittedly is not a lot for a year's

549
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,120
worth of game show.

550
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,720
You also know that your relationship is legit because you fended off the sex wolves.

551
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,040
That's the name of the show is Sex Wolves.

552
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
I saw that coming.

553
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah.

554
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,960
I didn't think that seemed to be a pretty good name for it.

555
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
The Sex Wolves.

556
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,680
Let me hit you.

557
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Here's the other twist.

558
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Okay.

559
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:11,320
Once a month, actual wolf released into the house or they, everybody dresses up like,

560
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,120
like furry wolf humans.

561
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:19,160
Just to add another layer, another, another layer to this onion of sexuality.

562
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,760
It's called the onion of sexuality.

563
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,440
It's the web, the webisode companion piece.

564
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Wait.

565
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,680
So you're going to record a year of footage and then put it on a five minute webisode?

566
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,800
Well, the companion piece.

567
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,760
It's going to be action packed.

568
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,040
I'm talking, what I'm talking about is transmedia.

569
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,060
Oh yeah.

570
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,420
We're talking cereal.

571
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,920
We're talking action figures.

572
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,480
You can have sex wolf cereal, exactly.

573
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,240
Start your day in the sex wolf way.

574
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,920
Is there any, does that idea got legs at all for a reality show?

575
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,420
But also as a practical, like if you're, if you guys can make it, it could be like maybe

576
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,180
you're 90% sure you want to test that other 10%.

577
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,560
Here's how you test that other 10%.

578
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,640
Here's your litmus test.

579
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,340
Go fucking live in the worst situation imaginable.

580
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,120
And if you can make it through that, you're aces.

581
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,820
Can you guys, is there some way you guys can buy yourself something amazing or like bury

582
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,960
some cash somewhere and leave it for yourself as a reward at the end of this?

583
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,880
So at least you'll have something to cling to when things get bag safe, but remember

584
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,600
we put $50 in that lock, in that safety deposit box.

585
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,360
We bought a trust fund.

586
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,900
They're young.

587
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,900
You know what I mean?

588
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,080
They're young.

589
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,320
They're so sexy.

590
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
You know what I mean?

591
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,640
They're very sexy and sexual.

592
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
They're sexy and sexual.

593
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,320
And that's why the wolves, that's another element cause like wolves can smell sexuality

594
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
and they will hunt them.

595
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I'm sorry.

596
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I zoned out for a second.

597
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,160
Is this actual wolves?

598
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,680
Like are you letting at least four wolves in this house?

599
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,120
Once a month.

600
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,640
Fucking read, read the fucking script, Travis.

601
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,120
Your elevator pitch has gone off the rails, Griffin.

602
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,040
Wait, are you telling me sex wolves is scripted?

603
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,520
It's been scripted this whole time.

604
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
I knew it.

605
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Oh my God, it's a sham.

606
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,000
It's only for the wolves.

607
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,720
The wolves have speaking lines and the lines are, what do you got to shoot today, Bill?

608
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,520
I'm doing another pouncing scene.

609
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,600
So they want me to deliver this back to back.

610
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,960
Woo, I want to fuck you.

611
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,680
And like how am I, the first one was supposed to be a howl.

612
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:24,800
Like my heart's not even in it.

613
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Wolves can't read.

614
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,320
Well that just is a reflection of our school system.

615
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,760
When we just send our wolves to school, what kind of nation is it that hines?

616
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Guys, stop.

617
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
Wolf school.

618
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,400
It's a new concept.

619
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm tired of all these mass shootings in our schools.

620
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,400
The only way to protect their kids is wolves.

621
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Wolf school.

622
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,400
2013.

623
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
Catch it in the fall.

624
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,080
The sound track sounds a lot more like an 80s summer movie.

625
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,880
Every child in the American school system had a wolf.

626
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Look at Game of Thrones.

627
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
They're fine.

628
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,760
Protect mass shootings.

629
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:10,000
We put in armed volunteers in our schools, but a lot of those, a startling amount of

630
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,800
those ended up being perverts.

631
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,540
How are we going to get those out?

632
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
Wolf school.

633
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Fall 2013.

634
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,200
Catch it on Fox Reality.

635
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Oops.

636
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,920
The wolves apparently have a taste for kids too.

637
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,080
What are we going to do now?

638
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,200
Sharks flood the school.

639
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Flood school.

640
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Flood school.

641
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Shark school.

642
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Sharks and wolves.

643
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Sharks and wolves and kids.

644
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,200
Oh no, the wolves have learned to swim.

645
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Kid battle.

646
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Battle Royale.

647
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,440
Battle Royale, but with more sharks than wolves.

648
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,160
That is going to hurt property values in that area.

649
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,520
If your kids have to go to wolf shark school, the flooded, I don't know Debra, I like both

650
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
of these houses.

651
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,120
At one, the kids are going to have to go to a flooded school full of wolves and sharks

652
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
and it's on TV.

653
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,760
There's so much gerrymandering because the wolf school has such a great football program.

654
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,760
That's the other problem.

655
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,760
I hate it.

656
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,760
Plus I mean the fame.

657
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,680
Yeah, that's a lot for a kid to take on.

658
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,440
The fame of getting eaten by wolf sharks.

659
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Oops, they breeded.

660
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Didn't see that coming.

661
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
I did though.

662
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
And then they're warped.

663
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
It's all scripted.

664
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
I have an executive producer credit.

665
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Let's go to the money zone.

666
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Let me tell you guys about Marc Maron.

667
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,440
Everybody.

668
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Everybody knows.

669
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,600
He's a podcaster just like us.

670
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:31,520
He's got a new show coming to IFC.

671
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
It's called Maron.

672
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,920
It starts Friday, May 3rd, 10 p.m. on IFC.

673
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,280
It's a fictionalized version of Marc's life.

674
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,680
I mean it would have to be because he makes a podcast so they know he's going to, they

675
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,360
got to sex it up I guess, right?

676
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,920
I mean I wouldn't watch a show about me.

677
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,840
Would you guys watch a show about you?

678
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
Definitely.

679
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,760
I mean I would but I have a lot of issues.

680
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,520
I might if it had Judd Hirsch, Gina Gershon, Aubrey Plaza, and Adam Scott on it.

681
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,320
Which Marc Maron does.

682
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,720
And oh and this week's episode is one of my heroes, Dave Foley.

683
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,840
Who Griffin and I saw in LA once.

684
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,040
He gave me a, he gave me a Kurt head nod.

685
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
Oh really?

686
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,800
Yeah, it was a big moment for us.

687
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,680
So you guys are like best friends?

688
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Basically.

689
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Okay.

690
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,200
So next week's episode, Marc, well not this, yeah I guess this week's.

691
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,280
This is this week, isn't it?

692
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:26,920
And this week's episode, Marc and Dave are going to go after an abusive fan on Twitter

693
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,240
that has been tormenting Marc.

694
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,800
Wow, so this really is like my day to day life actually.

695
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,560
Only it stars Marc Maron so it'll be funnier.

696
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,640
He's the creator, producer, and again that's Fridays at 10 p.m. on IFC so don't miss Maron.

697
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
Is he playing?

698
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,280
It kind of sounds like, if you didn't know anything about it, Maron does sound like a

699
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,280
private eye show, right?

700
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
Don't you think?

701
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
A little bit.

702
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,280
Maron.

703
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Sounds like Castle.

704
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
You know what I mean?

705
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Castle.

706
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Or like.

707
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,280
Still not sure what's going on in that show.

708
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,280
Berks Law.

709
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,360
Yeah, he was like a writer and he was like solving, he was like using his writer powers

710
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,600
to solve crimes but now he's like a proper detective except he's really smarmy and he's

711
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,680
getting a little chunky.

712
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
Don't you dare.

713
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
I don't know.

714
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,680
How dare you?

715
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
How dare you?

716
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,680
There's some chunk there.

717
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Not on Marc Maron.

718
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,160
Not on Marc Maron though, he's thin and he's got a podcast and he's got a show about it

719
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,680
called Maron at Fridays on IFC at 10 p.m. so tune in to that.

720
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,040
While you're watching Maron, why not go check out the Morphe webcomic?

721
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,800
That's at morphe.thewebcomic.com.

722
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,520
Morphe is how that's pronounced.

723
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,920
I've recently learned.

724
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,960
In the next sentence, oh our producer just popped his head into the booth.

725
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
What's that?

726
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,760
Hey, what is that Antonio?

727
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Scarpacci from Winx?

728
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:56,080
Our producer is Antonio Scarpacci from Winx cause he's fake so why the fuck not?

729
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,280
It's just called fun guys, it's just called using your imagination for fun.

730
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,380
Morphe is a really actually, it's cool, it's not like a standard webcomic, it sort of blends,

731
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:15,120
it's coded in flash but it's scary and you have to click through it so it takes advantage

732
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
of today's technology.

733
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:23,520
You know so many webcomics, you could have read them in an analog format and this takes

734
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,200
full advantage of internet.

735
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,400
Sometimes I just print out webcomics just so I don't have to think about my life.

736
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,360
Sometimes I print out webcomics if it's a really good Ziggy and I just wanna keep it

737
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
on the wall.

738
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,920
And when I'm reading eZiggy, man, bad guy in technology, do not get along.

739
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:52,600
Morphe is not like Ziggy or like Marmaduke but you can find it at morphe.thewebcomic.com.

740
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,160
Very cool, very spooky, it's got sounds I think.

741
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,600
I can't print it if I lose its interactivity.

742
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
You could do like a flipbook.

743
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,000
I can't turn my speakers up, make sure it does have sounds.

744
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It does.

745
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I think it has sounds.

746
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It does, I'm clicking through right now.

747
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Oh Jesus Christ!

748
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:14,680
Okay, I actually just got scared by the webcomic by turning up my speakers too much so I will

749
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,360
caution you to not do that.

750
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,920
That is podcast history being made.

751
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,720
Justin scares himself made a podcast.

752
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,480
Okay morphe.thewebcomic.com, go check it out.

753
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,160
I'm puked, I'm puked.

754
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,660
Okay, you puked me, I'm puked.

755
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:42,880
You know what, speaking of puked or spooked or spuked, let's back off our usual XR approach

756
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,960
when coming at the Extreme Restraints marketing.

757
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,240
Let's rally around our marketing team.

758
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,880
Let's talk about something that doesn't involve nine foot long sex logs.

759
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,840
Okay here's what we got.

760
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,520
You don't know where to start, right?

761
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,320
Why not pick up an adult instructional book?

762
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,960
Don't let the kids find these, unless you want like a cool kid who understands a woman's

763
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
body.

764
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,480
How old a kid is that appropriate, starting with the youngest?

765
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,000
I want my two to three to four year old to understand a woman's body.

766
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,280
I don't think there's anything wrong with that, it's science.

767
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,220
There's about seven things wrong with that.

768
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:25,640
You could pick up the Ultimate Guide to Flatio, How to Go Down on a Man, $17, no problem.

769
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:29,120
I think you pronounced that wrong, I think it's full audio.

770
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,800
Man, I was at my Filotti's class the other day and my thighs are still burning.

771
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,520
You get on a recumbent bike and you blow a guy.

772
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,680
Here's a good book, it's called Jay Wiseman, Tricks to Please a Woman.

773
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,160
Jay has put his name before the title, which seems a little braggy to me.

774
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,160
But you know what, that's confidence in your product right there.

775
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,320
Let me pitch this question to you guys.

776
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Whose name would have to appear in that book's title for you guys to bite?

777
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Al Franken.

778
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Oh.

779
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
What?

780
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,920
You just said the first name that came to your head.

781
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,920
Nope.

782
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,800
What if it said a word that was obfuscated somehow, maybe it was fuzzy, and then it said

783
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
Quaid.

784
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,640
And so it's like, you're getting one of the Quaids.

785
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,760
You're getting one of the Quaid sex tip books.

786
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,480
Wait, do you know?

787
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,840
You don't know the Quaid, that's what I'm saying.

788
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
So you're saying like the first name is like smudged?

789
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,380
The first name has been obscured somehow, but it is definitely a Quaid.

790
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,960
You have a famous Quaid guarantee, so you're not just getting some Hammonegger Quaid off

791
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
the street.

792
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,160
Okay, it's a famous Quaid at least.

793
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,240
You're flipping the coin, one side is Dennis, one side is Randy.

794
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,960
I think you would know pretty quickly, even unlabeled.

795
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,840
Hit her vagina with a sandwich.

796
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,840
Oh fuck.

797
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,160
She got randied.

798
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,560
There is a book here called Masterclass Pregnant Sex.

799
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,320
There's a picture of a pregnant woman, she's holding her breasts, and it helpfully has

800
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,800
the label sexually explicit on it, which is, I think, is a little redundant.

801
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,920
But again, you can pick up all this stuff at extremistraints.com.

802
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,540
If you use the coupon code FANNYTIME, you're gonna save 20% on your order, and it's all

803
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,720
shipped discreetly.

804
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,480
This is one of the only kinds of information that I would want to get out of a book instead

805
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
of internet.

806
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:36,880
Because if you search internet like, how do I do good sex to a woman, then you're gonna

807
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
be flooded.

808
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,680
If nothing else, do yourself a favor and just go to extremistraints.com and just kind of

809
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
browse.

810
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Just look around.

811
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,320
The nice thing is, unlike other sex stores, there's no creepy person behind the counter

812
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
judging you.

813
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Yeah.

814
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,920
Doesn't hurt to look around, unless you're in the library, then don't do it.

815
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,520
And you can probably, if you look around, you can probably find someone to jerk off

816
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
to.

817
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Oh yeah.

818
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
I think.

819
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
I bet.

820
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Yeah.

821
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Or lady jerk off to.

822
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
That's still called that.

823
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
I don't think...

824
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,760
No, I think it's called you jilling off at that point.

825
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Can you not?

826
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
Can you not ever?

827
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
Again, please, sir.

828
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
You jill off.

829
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Because you jack off, and then you jill off.

830
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Can you...

831
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
If you would not, I would appreciate...

832
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Please don't.

833
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I would, if you would not, sir.

834
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Why jill off?

835
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
It's not weird.

836
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
It's not weird.

837
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,880
Why does female pleasure make you sick?

838
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
I have...

839
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,480
I have no way of knowing.

840
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,720
You know that feeling you get when you hear a song that you just love?

841
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,320
What about a new movie, or a new book, or a TV show?

842
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,540
I'm Jesse Thorne.

843
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,240
My show Bullseye points to the good stuff in popular culture, the kind of stuff that

844
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,920
will change your life.

845
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,320
In-depth interviews with cultural creators, critics' picks for the best new releases,

846
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,080
and a weekly recommendation from yours truly.

847
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:52,560
It's Bullseye with me, Jesse Thorne, for MaximumFun.org and PRI.

848
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,600
For years, I've been heavily into the video game and nerd culture in general.

849
00:37:55,600 --> 00:38:00,480
I have an upright glass case in which I have my pop culture and video game related articles,

850
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,360
such as a replica, lightsaber, and video game figures.

851
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,200
I'm trying to be a woman, and I'm horribly self-conscious about my glass case, making

852
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,600
me seem like a man-child, which I guess I am, since I have this in my house.

853
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,320
I'm trying to make change be more appealing to opposite sex, and I feel like this glass

854
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,440
case makes me seem immature.

855
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,160
The problem is, my friends have given me many of these things, and if I store their gifts

856
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,100
away or sell them, I'm afraid they'll be a little hurt by it.

857
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,560
How do I avoid hurting my friends' feelings while at the same time trying to present myself

858
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,600
as an actual adult to potential romantic interest?

859
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,440
That's from Glass Case of Emotion, Cincinnati.

860
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,160
This is a damn good question.

861
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,160
This is a good question.

862
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Can I real talk for a minute?

863
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Yeah, sure.

864
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,560
Because I have like a real serious non-funny answer.

865
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,000
We haven't had any of those so far, so please.

866
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,880
Okay, here's my real talk.

867
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,040
It has nothing to do with the items in your home.

868
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,840
I don't care what it is that you've collected or what it is that you have.

869
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,360
It is the person that you are that determines whether you're perceived as that thing or

870
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,360
not.

871
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:06,240
I've known lots of people that had toys or sports memorabilia or anything, and that is

872
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,720
not who they are.

873
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,560
It's just something that they happen to like.

874
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,240
I know a guy, one of the coolest guys I've ever known.

875
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,400
He's a really successful director around town, has an awesome wife, and he has all these

876
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,480
amazing little tin soldiers, and I've never looked at him and gone, oh, he collects toys?

877
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
What a nerd.

878
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,280
Well, that's fine, Travis, but you have to recognize that there's a limit in everything

879
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,120
else to this question where if the things that you are collecting is like tentacle porn

880
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:38,800
anime busts, then maybe, yes, that's a bad, that's gonna be a turnoff for 99.9 repeating

881
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,440
percent of people in the universe.

882
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,800
I have to say, I'm a big fan, I think he's already made the most important stride, and

883
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,160
that is to put your displaying in a glass case.

884
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,920
That seems to me to be like, okay, it's not a decorating motif, which a lot of people

885
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,600
go for, and if you want to, that's fine, but to me, this seems like a little more regimented.

886
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
It seems more grown up to me.

887
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
It's sectioned off.

888
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,960
You're saying this is my display.

889
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,720
This is this part of my life, and everything that's not in there doesn't belong to this

890
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
part of my life.

891
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,380
Yeah, it makes it seem like a facet of your character rather than just my personality

892
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,680
is a remixed, yeah, exactly right.

893
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,080
Now if you're someone that when you have someone over the house, the first thing you do is

894
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,800
now come look at my case, then yes, maybe that's not a good way to go.

895
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,280
Try not to talk like comic book nerd from Simpsons.

896
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
That's not gonna help you.

897
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
That's not where someone's like, oh, what's all this?

898
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,640
Be like, oh, that's just stuff I've collected over the years.

899
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,680
Well, no, because there's gotta be a happy meeting, because you just sounded fucking

900
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
ashamed.

901
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Oh, that's my shame.

902
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Oh, that?

903
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
That's my case.

904
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
That's my shame rectangle.

905
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,200
Please don't acknowledge it.

906
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
That's why I'm embarrassed by it.

907
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Don't get on my case.

908
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
No, that's just a little joke I make.

909
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Come on over.

910
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Hey, seriously.

911
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,640
Get the fuck out of there.

912
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
That's limited edition.

913
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,080
I said leave.

914
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,880
That's my Mad Mardigan Willow special edition figure.

915
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,800
It was a chase item.

916
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
He has, you see, only one eyebrow.

917
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
That's worth $17.

918
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Are you gonna replace it?

919
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,760
I didn't think so.

920
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I don't know.

921
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,760
This is so alien to me.

922
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,480
I'm such a big ass fucking nerd, and I don't know.

923
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,520
This is something I feel like I struggle with a lot.

924
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,800
Maybe less than I did when I was in college, but I've always been a big nerd, but I have

925
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:41,960
never been fast to show it, to have things displayed in my house that act as insignias

926
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,280
for visitors.

927
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,600
This is the kind of shit I'm into.

928
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Yeah, it's funny.

929
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,600
I have stuff, but I've never crossed that line.

930
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,620
I have one thing that if you're looking carefully, you'll see my collection of California raisins

931
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:59,120
and Houdini action figure and Doctor Who stuff, but no one's gonna see it surface level right

932
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,120
away.

933
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:01,120
This is, oh man.

934
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,720
I don't know.

935
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,880
I feel like if you have things that make you happy, that is the most important thing, and

936
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,960
that's who you are.

937
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,200
I think if you're holding on to stuff because your friends gave it to you, that's a bad

938
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,080
reason to hold on to things, because I guarantee they don't care.

939
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,080
They really don't.

940
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,600
Unless you're holding on to it because it means something to you because a friend gave

941
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,600
it to you.

942
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,960
Well, he used the word store, which isn't typically the word you use for sentimental

943
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,960
presents.

944
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Yeah, sure.

945
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,960
Yeah, fuck it.

946
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Put it, yeah.

947
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,960
Sure.

948
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
How long?

949
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,960
A month?

950
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,960
Yeah, I guess.

951
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,280
I've put away so many, I've put away my childish things as I've grown older, and then I bought

952
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,520
new things on eBay.

953
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,920
I bought Captain Power toys because those are nostalgic for me and they make me really

954
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,920
happy.

955
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
So I have them.

956
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:55,860
So you basically, you refresh your stock of childish things like the Bible tells you so.

957
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,340
I got that elite childish stuff that seem more collector-y.

958
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,160
They seem more like harder to come by.

959
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,640
Like fushigi balls.

960
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,300
No, those don't count.

961
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:16,920
There is a difference between hiding something because you think the person, somebody's gonna

962
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,600
think less of you, and hiding it because it's not the image of yourself that you wanna put

963
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,760
out there.

964
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,680
Because I think that those are two different things.

965
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:31,360
I mean, I do think we have a, I think we have a problem in a lot of facets of what people

966
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:37,000
would call nerd culture of not being able to distinguish between things you like and

967
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
things that you are.

968
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah.

969
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And I think that-

970
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,120
I think it's just, I think it's inherently unhealthy to self-identify based on media

971
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,600
consumption of any kind.

972
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,120
Because if you do that with nerd shit, and say you're a nerd, you're painting yourself

973
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:59,040
into a corner, but like on the flip side, if you just watch independent art house films

974
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,840
from the 1930s and say, oh, that's me.

975
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:09,000
That's where I'm coming from, is I'm independent art house movies from the 1930s guy.

976
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,720
Like that guy sucks too.

977
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,600
Like that guy's not very great.

978
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:17,380
If that's the only thing that he uses to define the shape of his character.

979
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
That's what I'm saying.

980
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,200
I think the problem is, is like when you have something any quality like that, it's overwhelming

981
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,200
to it.

982
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Oh, me?

983
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
I'm jazz guy.

984
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
You know me.

985
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
I'm jazz guy.

986
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
I'm sports guy.

987
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,240
Let me tell you all about my sports team, because that's all I'm going to talk about

988
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,360
for the next two hours, because it's literally all I know.

989
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,560
Like nobody likes that person, no matter what it is.

990
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,700
Start trying to put things in your house that keep people on their toes.

991
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:39,700
That's what I'm saying.

992
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,700
Have a knife somewhere.

993
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,440
Just somewhere.

994
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:45,140
Half a mummy.

995
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,140
Which have you asked?

996
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,140
Player's choice.

997
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,140
Player's choice.

998
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
Doesn't matter.

999
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,140
You guys want a Yahoo?

1000
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,140
Please.

1001
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:52,320
This question was sent in by Julie Martin.

1002
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Thanks, Julie.

1003
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:59,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Leonardo, who asks, how do the birthday spankings?

1004
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,520
How do the birthday spankings?

1005
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,520
I am Brazilian.

1006
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,640
I'm 24 years old.

1007
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,120
I graduated in law in the United States, and I'm doing post-graduation.

1008
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,600
Also I have friends and relatives here, like this country.

1009
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,160
Tomorrow's my birthday, as tradition is the birthday spankings.

1010
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,320
How this game works?

1011
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Is it custom here?

1012
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
I'll have my birthday party tomorrow.

1013
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
Thank you.

1014
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:28,480
Oh, how it works is awfully... No, it's really common here in our country.

1015
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,040
I'm so glad you came to us.

1016
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
Welcome.

1017
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,880
Basically every... Welcome, welcome.

1018
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:37,800
On your birthday, you should find people.

1019
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,360
You don't want them to be too close to you, so someone you're more of an acquaintance

1020
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,240
with, or... Law school buddies, maybe.

1021
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,360
Most desirably, law school buddies, perhaps professors would be a good fit here.

1022
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:55,440
You go to them, and you say, hello, it's my 24th birthday, and I got a hanker for spankering,

1023
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,640
and then you turn around, and you show them your hindquarters, and you say, go to town,

1024
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,640
James Brown.

1025
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,360
Are we talking about bare tushy, or are we talking...

1026
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,920
Good question.

1027
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,160
Because you have different levels, you could go pants, underpants, bare tushy, or three

1028
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,160
pairs of pants.

1029
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,880
It's up to you.

1030
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,320
Are we talking, do you want to get a belt in there, maybe an extremely strange pain

1031
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,480
paddle of some sort?

1032
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,320
I think you really need that open hand contact to really get the emotion across.

1033
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:31,560
Just say, my tushy's 24 years old, and I need to knock some of those years off, so please

1034
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,360
go to town out of my butt.

1035
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,520
It would be great, too, if they had a little water bottle, and they could spritz a little

1036
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,840
moisture on their hand before each one, just so you get that really nice wet skin on skin

1037
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
action.

1038
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,920
Oh, God.

1039
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,040
It is also important that they give you, quote, one to grow on, end quote, or you will die.

1040
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,960
Yeah, numerically, let's talk about it, because are we talking one per year, or are we talking

1041
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,640
about 18 is an important birthday, should maybe we double up on that?

1042
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,480
If I remember correctly, when I turned 18, Nonnie doubled up the amount of money she

1043
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,240
sent me, and I got $36, so I think it works the same way with spankings.

1044
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,760
So double up on the spankings.

1045
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:16,960
I think it's every prime number, you do an extra, whatever the last prime number was,

1046
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,280
you tack that on, too.

1047
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:24,680
So I mean, once you get up into like, you know, like 97 years old, is that a prime number?

1048
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
Somebody gotta get me.

1049
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
No.

1050
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,680
37?

1051
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Yeah, you're good.

1052
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
97.

1053
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
97's good.

1054
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
You're gonna-

1055
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,040
Anything ending in seven, except for 27, maybe some others.

1056
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,800
Just don't let them put their finger in your butt.

1057
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,800
Oh god, no.

1058
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,800
That's so gauche.

1059
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,160
That's like the French way of doing it.

1060
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:48,640
It's like getting a wet willy, it's like, ah, we were doing something else.

1061
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,280
I have not thought about birthday spankings in, like, if you had asked me about birthday

1062
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,960
spankings 15 minutes ago, I think I would have said I'm not sure if that was ever a

1063
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
thing or not.

1064
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,320
Like, I'm not sure I would have fully recalled birthday spankings being-

1065
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:08,400
But then you remembered the joy of the game of birthday spanking, said this person.

1066
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,200
It's not- there's no- there are no combatants.

1067
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:18,560
There aren't rules and goals and points and a win condition.

1068
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,040
There's no fail state in birthday spanking.

1069
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,380
There's no fail state.

1070
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,080
Everybody wins!

1071
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,240
One swat with a hand of paddle for every year of birth.

1072
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,840
Not supposed to be too hard.

1073
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:31,600
Hey, Yahoo Answers user David B., this guy's from another country, can you maybe go easy

1074
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
on him?

1075
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,680
Like, you are fucking- you are- you are putting forward the stereotype.

1076
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:42,000
You are making it worse for the rest of us by saying, hey, foreigner, you don't understand

1077
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,680
our traditions, stupid.

1078
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,720
I think not supposed to be too hard is don't spank them too hard, Griffin.

1079
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,080
Yeah, Griffin.

1080
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,440
Not that it's not supposed to be difficult.

1081
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,720
Well then he's fucking goofing them twice, because it's supposed to be very, very hard.

1082
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,040
Sorry, that's another thing that we should have mentioned.

1083
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,040
Oh, it should take off a little bit each time.

1084
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,040
Oh my god.

1085
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,880
It should- it should hurt- they should be physically exhausted.

1086
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,160
They should feel like a- like a rail splitter at the end of a shift.

1087
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,160
Like you-

1088
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,160
By the end of it-

1089
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,160
That is why old people walk so funny.

1090
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Exactly.

1091
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,400
Your butt should look like the face of the guy that looked inside the Ark of the Covenant.

1092
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,280
It should just be all melty and bones in there.

1093
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,520
Your butt should be- it should be the fourth type of substance, plasma.

1094
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,320
It should be- it should be between states.

1095
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,960
It should be like cold chowder.

1096
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,480
It should be like coal slurry.

1097
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,680
I wish people would stop fracking my butt.

1098
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,080
How about it, Uncle Sam?

1099
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,320
Do you have the courage to stop big, big coal from fracking my butt?

1100
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
I just-

1101
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,400
They just keep shooting water into the loosened stuff up down there.

1102
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,680
I don't know how fracking works.

1103
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,840
I'm just getting tired of all the butt top removal, because it's getting hard to prop

1104
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,320
myself up in a chair.

1105
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,240
You know, politicians keep claiming that there's clean butt.

1106
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,640
There's no such thing as clean butt.

1107
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,760
Baby's butts aren't clean.

1108
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,880
There's like original sin in there.

1109
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
No.

1110
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,200
Though I will say at extreme restraints, they do have a series of enemas that will guarantee

1111
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,760
a clean butt.

1112
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,640
One of which you just attach to a shower head.

1113
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,640
Holy shit.

1114
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
That sounds really convenient.

1115
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,640
Yeah.

1116
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,880
Can you propel it all the way up your body so it comes out your mouth?

1117
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,400
I guess it depends on your water pressure, really.

1118
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,120
I mean, that's going to be a-

1119
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
Oh, no.

1120
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,120
Sorry.

1121
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,120
It would come out of your belly button.

1122
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,360
It's like one of those safety drains in a sink.

1123
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,720
I started a new job this week.

1124
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,120
The office often orders lunch for everyone, paid for by the company.

1125
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,280
My coworkers eagerly eat the food, and I have been game for the first week.

1126
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,800
I want to be a social part of the group, but at some point, I will want to bring my own

1127
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,320
healthier lunches.

1128
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,440
How can I make this change smoothly with my delivery devouring coworkers?

1129
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,960
That's from Dining Dilemma in Dallas.

1130
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,960
You missed it already because you had to say you had a gluten allergy.

1131
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,240
Yeah, but here's the thing.

1132
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,440
What if they're really conscientious and then they start ordering things specifically to

1133
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,520
accommodate your- and they're like, it costs a little bit more, but we care about you,

1134
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,720
Susan, so we want to make sure you don't die.

1135
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,720
Why don't you just say that you're a fucking 30-year-old adult, I'm assuming you're 30,

1136
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,960
and that you want to fucking eat your own food that you picked out for yourself because

1137
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,000
that's one of the great privileges that adulthood brings you.

1138
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,660
You can do whatever you want when you're an adult.

1139
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,900
You don't have to eat that stuff.

1140
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,560
Say you're trying to slim down, who can't appreciate that?

1141
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,760
Yeah, I think that this is- okay, on one hand, this is a totally perceived problem because

1142
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,380
I doubt very much that any company is going to be like, but I wanted to spend more money

1143
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,380
on you.

1144
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:51,100
Yeah, or that any of your coworkers will be like, oh man, there's more sandwiches for

1145
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,320
my fat fucking face to eat, aw, nerds.

1146
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,960
Why isn't she eating the Jimmy John's?

1147
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,960
Ugh.

1148
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,680
But then on the other hand, this just might be me because I am a gluten, the idea of someone

1149
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,160
saying, hey, I'm going to get you free food, and you'd be like, no, that's mean.

1150
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:09,160
Eat that food.

1151
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,160
You want that food.

1152
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Everybody wants that food.

1153
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,140
It's not free, though, because you helped earn that money.

1154
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,720
You worked so they could get those profits and then it's going to feed your friends.

1155
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,560
Maybe you could arrange a deal where it's like, hey, instead of getting a sandwich every

1156
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,680
day, you give me like a $5 a day raise.

1157
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,600
Just bring your lunch in a paper sack that says Rebecca on it and then look sheepishly

1158
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:32,560
and said, yeah, mine, my Nana packs them, so I have to eat it.

1159
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,120
It's just a thing.

1160
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,760
She packs it for me every day and I love her so much.

1161
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm not going to have her much longer, so I'm just going to keep eating my lunches for

1162
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,720
Nana.

1163
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,720
And then when they're like, oh, is Nana your grandmother?

1164
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,360
I'm like, no, she's my servant.

1165
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,360
She's my servant.

1166
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,360
Yeah.

1167
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,360
I'm not going to have her much longer.

1168
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,360
That depreciates.

1169
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,360
She's my, she's my giant dog, like in Peter Pan.

1170
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,760
You open the bag and there's just a bone in there and it's adorable.

1171
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,760
Dirt again.

1172
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,360
It's just a bag of grass.

1173
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:02,920
Can you just not bring, here's the one thing I would request of somebody who worked in

1174
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,200
like close quarters for many years.

1175
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:12,120
Can you not bring something that stinks for your lunch?

1176
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:18,600
That used to fucking kill me when people would bring like, this is garlic salad and they

1177
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,600
would bring it and eat it.

1178
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,600
It's just a big bowl of cloves of garlic.

1179
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,480
And they would heat it up in the microwave and the whole office would smell like a taxi

1180
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,120
and it made me want to die.

1181
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,120
So please don't bring-

1182
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,120
You know what I realize?

1183
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
What?

1184
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,120
That goes the same way if it smells good too, because I mean then you're sitting there in

1185
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,840
the office going, what is it, what it, oh God, now I want that.

1186
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Now that's all I want.

1187
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,040
You need to bring food that doesn't smell.

1188
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:48,280
You need to bring a tube of nutrient slop.

1189
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:49,280
By which I mean go-gurt.

1190
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,100
Do they make healthy go-gurt?

1191
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,100
All yogurt's healthy.

1192
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,100
It's got protein in it.

1193
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,100
I guess that's true.

1194
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,840
I have a Yahoo answer if you guys will allow it.

1195
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Yes.

1196
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,620
This Yahoo was sent in by, help please.

1197
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,120
I didn't say I would allow it.

1198
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,000
Travis, can I have your-

1199
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I will allow it.

1200
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Thank you.

1201
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
It was sent in by Alex-

1202
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,040
It's so antiquated to ask Travis's permission.

1203
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,960
It was sent in by Alex Krasminski, thanks Alex.

1204
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,660
It's by Yahoo answers user, help please, who asks, where do I put my hands when making

1205
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,280
out and I am a girl?

1206
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,280
Straight up in the air.

1207
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,480
Just straight up in the air like you're being mugged.

1208
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,800
Like you just do not care.

1209
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,960
I like that.

1210
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,200
Or maybe like you're on a rollercoaster, because when you're making out with me, you sure as

1211
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
hell are.

1212
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,080
Oh, what if you did that thing where you were kind of like rapidly waving them like you

1213
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,080
were being electrocuted.

1214
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,240
That's going to be exhausting.

1215
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,240
Did you feel that?

1216
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,240
I felt it.

1217
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,400
And she sounds like she's in the long haul.

1218
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,600
I feel for her because like as a dude, I feel like making out is means to an end to get

1219
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:57,000
your hand on those sweater dogs, but when you're a girl, it's like you don't have any-

1220
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,440
That's my favorite Kuba Goode Jr.

1221
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,280
It's hands down.

1222
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:11,480
Lots of people like Jared Maguire, but I like sweater dogs.

1223
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,280
Just use your hand to steal his wallet because he's not going to stop you, especially if

1224
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,160
he's a young boy, a young man.

1225
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1226
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,280
When you're a guy and you're making out, it's like how are you going to grab those

1227
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,280
boobs?

1228
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,600
And as a girl, it's like you don't have a secondary objective.

1229
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,600
You know what I mean?

1230
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,600
Like straight footballs.

1231
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,760
Yeah, but that's jumping six or seven sharks.

1232
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,920
That's like you are skipping some steps there.

1233
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:36,480
You shouldn't be making out around sharks unless you go to shark school.

1234
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:42,800
Then somebody suggested shoulders, thighs, ribs after a while on his tap handle, which

1235
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
I guess is his dick.

1236
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1237
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,960
On his what?

1238
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,280
The creepiest word in there?

1239
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,000
Do you want me to specify the creepiest word?

1240
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,440
Because it was ribs.

1241
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
Let me just-

1242
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:00,120
Just play you like a xylophone.

1243
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,520
Let me imagine I'll be inside that cage.

1244
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,520
What's in there?

1245
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:04,520
Is it your heart?

1246
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,520
You know what?

1247
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
I've got one of these ribs.

1248
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
We sync up, Steven.

1249
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,520
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

1250
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,520
Thanks for the rib.

1251
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,520
Shaysu.

1252
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,520
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

1253
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:12,760
Thanks for this.

1254
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,880
The problem is is you want to be careful because if you don't sync it up right, you could end

1255
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,920
up breaking one or both of your arms.

1256
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,600
None of these suggestions are good except for the dick one, I guess is all right.

1257
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,600
But shoulders, thighs.

1258
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,600
Let me just, let me grab you right there, buddy.

1259
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,240
Let me get you right there, buddy.

1260
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
Little tickles.

1261
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
You started giving him a back rub.

1262
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
You know, reach around back.

1263
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
Shoulders.

1264
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:34,240
Shoulders.

1265
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,240
I'll just give you a little trailing horse.

1266
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Shoulders seems like you're-

1267
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,560
Give him an Indian rub burn while you're doing it.

1268
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,040
Shoulders seems like you're trying to stop the guy and you're just very bad at it.

1269
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,360
Like that would be the signal I would get from shoulders.

1270
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Maybe stick your fingers inside his ears.

1271
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,000
Maybe stick your finger down his throat.

1272
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,480
Hey, baby bird me.

1273
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:52,600
Hold on, there's something I like to do.

1274
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,320
It gets in real wet.

1275
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:58,760
Oh God.

1276
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
Maybe go for his boobs.

1277
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:04,980
That's one of the answer sleeves responded put her hands in your bonkers

1278
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,280
You are batting a thousand from for wrongness for mistakenness

1279
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,200
It's his insinuation that the best thing to do your hands is to take his hands and put them on your bonkers

1280
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,520
It's that the insinuation

1281
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,520
What are bonkers?

1282
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:33,960
What aren't bonkers? You know where you can touch a woman that will really drive her crazy, right? Where's that?

1283
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:37,500
Her heart. I learned that from milk money.

1284
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:41,700
I learned to fuck from milk money

1285
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,080
I feel like even answering these questions is heteronormative of me

1286
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:52,500
I feel like I should I have to keep qualifying all my pronouns and stuff because I want everybody to feel included. Yeah

1287
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,220
That's a good point. What if there's a girl making out with a girl?

1288
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,220
Sorry Justin. Slow down.

1289
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:04,220
Well, then it's like where can't you put your hands?

1290
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,820
Exactly. There's fun stuff all over. I don't want to be offensive

1291
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,540
I'm gonna walk a very delicate line here

1292
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,900
But there's got to be a moment where both girls go for the boobs at the same time and then they just kind of

1293
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:19,780
And they play patty cakes accidentally. Oh, well now we're just pushing on each other. Let's stop making out

1294
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:24,700
Let's just play patty cakes. This is way funner. I love this podcast is brought to you by Baptists

1295
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:33,420
We don't know any better. I think regardless of gender or sexual orientation go for the ribs

1296
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,820
Maybe little little punches

1297
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:44,420
Do those punches like she doesn't kill Bill where you put like your hand flat and then when you she's trying to break out of

1298
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:46,420
The coffin. Oh, yeah

1299
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:51,020
That's gonna feel trying to break into your heart call that's really gonna

1300
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:59,940
Accentuate some stuff, but all the wrong stuff. Just don't make out who makes out anymore. Just fucker. Nope. Eat some food

1301
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,620
You know what I mean, it's got the time who's got the time

1302
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:10,620
This has been my brother. My brother meets. It's a show that we do every week. We sure hope you had a good time listening

1303
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:15,860

1308
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,500
amazing theme song

1309
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:42,260
Our amazingly fantastic theme song for mr. David Liebhardt. Do we want to put that at the beginning of the end?

1310
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:46,420
I feel like at the beginning would be a more special way of

1311
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:49,300
Beginning the show

1312
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,780
Okay

1313
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,180
So thank you to him for for that. It means a lot

1314
00:59:54,180 --> 01:00:00,100
I think he's really actually captured the spirit of the show better than anybody else could it's a collaboration. It's been long in the works

1315
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,780
It's mutual

1316
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:09,820
Meet also just a reminder make sure to check out Marin on IFC at 10 p.m. It's this week with Dave Foley

Thank you to John Roderick and the long winters

01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,520
Still waiting on that new album. I know it's I know it gets out a lot probably but

1323
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:42,380
