Don't give it to ya. Fuck wait for you to get it on your own.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,260
The McElroy Brothers

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,260

Go hard getting busy with it

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,260
The McElroy Brothers

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,260
Got such a good heart that

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,260
The McElroy Brothers

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,260
Make a mother fuckin' wonder if you dead. Damn right

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,260
The McElroy Brothers

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,260
The McElroy Brothers

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,260
I was worried it would break the flow of the song

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
But it sounds super natural

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
I think it sounds better

20
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,260
Girl Talk actually got in touch with me

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,260
Like teach me your secrets

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,260
Hi everybody

23
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
Is it okay if I lead things off?

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
Wow okay. Sorry but

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,260
I just wanted to bring up before we started

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,260
Because it would be a smooth transition

27
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,260
Three different people have come up to me this weekend

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
And told me that they had horrible dreams about me

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
So

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,260
If anyone can lend any specificity

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
To the terrible way I'm apparently about to die

32
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
So I can look out for it

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Omen's importance

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,260
You can introduce us now

35
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,260
Hello welcome to my brother and my brother and me

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
An advice show for the modern era

37
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,260
I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

38
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,260
And I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
I'm your baby brother Griffin McElroy

40
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,260
If you've never listened to our show shame on you

41
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,260
Yeah

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,260
This is an advice show where we help people

43
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,260
We have been here at Mc...

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,260
Well hold on

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,260
I have a PowerPoint presentation I've prepared

46
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,260
To help this guy...

47
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,260
Fucking brace your asses

48
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,260
This was my first PowerPoint presentation

49
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,260
But I think I really nailed it. Here we go

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
Okay

51
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Now

52
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Is that

53
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,260
Helvetica?

54
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,260
It's a nice tasteful Helvetica I think

55
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,260
Some nerdlinger here probably knows what it is

56
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
Come on

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,260
There we go

58
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,260
One nerdlinger was a conservative estimate

59
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,260
Yeah

60
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,260
No smokers

61
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Fourteen thot experts

62
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
That's MaxFunCon

63
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
So we uh

64
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Did something funny happen to

65
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,260
Were we going to talk about something? I forget

66
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
Funny shit happens at camp all the time

67
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,260
Yeah

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,260
How has everybody

69
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,260
Else's MaxFun been so far?

70
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
MaxFun

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
That's easy

72
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
Raise your hand if you forged

73
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,260
A lifelong friendship this weekend

74
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,260
Lifelong friendships?

75
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
That's a lot

76
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
That's pretty good

77
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,260
I saw some people not raise their hands which bums me out more than

78
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
You have like three hours

79
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,260
For our radio listeners I would say like 90% of the people

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Raised their hands but that 10% was like ah come on guys

81
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,260
There was probably a moment where somebody

82
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Raised their hand expecting the person next to them to raise their hand

83
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,260
You didn't

84
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,260
We didn't it seemed

85
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,260
I thought okay

86
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,260
Um

87
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,260
Do you think people get like friendship

88
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,260
Desperate at the end of the party like I drove

89
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
All the way up this fucking mountain

90
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,260
It's like last call

91
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
I'm not leaving this party at midnight until I find

92
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
Someone to be my best friend forever

93
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
We wanted to mention

94
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,260
Before we leave the camp

95
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Chat segment of our show

96
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,260
The extended well thought out camp

97
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Chat segment

98
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
We will be doing some questions from you the audience

99
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
In the second half of our program

100
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,260
So try to think of something

101
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,260
That we can help you with

102
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Don't be a bummer

103
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,260
Nope

104
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,260
Keep it light, keep it fun

105
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,260
And make sure that we remain the center of attention

106
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
Did nothing

107
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Did nothing talk worthy

108
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,260
Happen to you guys this weekend camp wise

109
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
The only fun moment I had

110
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,260
No

111
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,260
My favorite moment so far

112
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,260
Was Friday night

113
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,260
I was hanging out and I saw this gentleman

114
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Who I was just amazed he was so funny

115
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
And I was like you know he should be a comedian

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,260
And it was Kyle Kinane

117
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Um

118
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,260
And I did not realize that until Saturday

119
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,260
And I'm just really glad I didn't

120
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Walk up to him like hey kid

121
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Keep those stars in your eyes

122
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
I see something raw in you

123
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Something I can mold

124
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,260
I got a pocket

125
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,260
It's a real launching point

126
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
We can make you a star

127
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Are we able

128
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,260
To talk

129
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,260
Cause there's this ubiquitous thing that I feel like

130
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,260
Everybody experiences at Max Fun Con

131
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,260
Um

132
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,260
But it involves regularity

133
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,260
So to speak

134
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,260
No I don't want to talk

135
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,260
Is anybody else deucing like a rock star

136
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,260
Like it's your full time job

137
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,260
Is it the altitude

138
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,260
I honestly don't know

139
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
What is going on

140
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,260
I can overrule this hold on wait I can save us all

141
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Press the button that we can't

142
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,260
Ah camp is gone

143
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,260
So we were at if you want to discuss it more

144
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Come find me after the show and we'll talk about poop all day

145
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,260
You won't find him

146
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,260
He'll be in the bathroom

147
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,260
So we stopped at

148
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
LA Hotspot

149
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles

150
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,260
The Englewood location

151
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,260
We stopped at the authentic one near LAX

152
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I'm not sure they all seem

153
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Pretty authentic to me

154
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,260
So we ate a big meal and then as we were leaving

155
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,260
We spotted this flyer

156
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Griffin do you still have it with you

157
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,260
I do I don't want to hold up the unsavory parts of it

158
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm sure you LA locals

159
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Read it every week you're all

160
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
Subscribers

161
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
It's LAXpress it's a

162
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Massage guide

163
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
It's a massage guide it's what they advertise

164
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
Can you fold that half

165
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
So yeah

166
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
There's a woman in it and she's

167
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
We don't want that

168
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
We don't want to talk about that because it's gross

169
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
The whole flyer is grody

170
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
There are full length

171
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,260
Features that are just ripe with

172
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Grossness but there are a few

173
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Pretty amazing things in it

174
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
Now keep in mind every page of

175
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,260
This flyer is filled

176
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
To the brim with

177
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260

179
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Sort of enticements

180
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,260
To the flesh

181
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Honey pots of

182
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Sexual delight for money

183
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Basically except for

185
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
I assume

193
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
That's a gig you work your way up

194
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
To spoiler alert he hated

195
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
All four movies

196
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Where's the nudity

197
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,260
I think there's probably nudity

198
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
In at least two of these movies

199
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
So that's the first page

200
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
It gets weirder from here

201
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
There's a picture of Brad Pitt

202
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
The story above this is not about Brad Pitt

203
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
It's about people you can have sex with

204
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
In the area that you live

205
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
And thank god that right up in the top corner

206
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,260
They've labeled it just in case

207
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Who

208
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,260
This guy's going places

209
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
And the piece de resistance

210
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
Yeah I actually just wanted to point out

211
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
There is an ad on the adjacent page

212
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
That is advertising women as silky

213
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
Which I did not know

214
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Seems more like a fabric softener

215
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Ad but here

216
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Okay so here's the last one

217
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
This is not bullshit this is just one of the pages

218
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
So what we're working with

219
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Are audio fans

220
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
Our listeners at home are probably just like

221
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
It's a butthole it's definitely a butthole

222
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,260
I know I've listened to this show before

223
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,260
It's a ghost horse butthole something

224
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
This is Mackenzie

225
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Again still like listeners at home

226
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,260
Like oh man oh no

227
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
What's wrong with Mackenzie

228
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
It is a

229
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
We are talking about a kitten

230
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Sweet precious and I would say

231
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
Appropriately horrified

232
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Kitten

233
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
This is an advertisement for a local

234
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Animal shelter

235
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Looking to get rid of this cat

236
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Which seems like the most inhumane

237
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
Thing ever because this is the

238
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
Grossest this is

239
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
The grossest publication

240
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
Diagram of people who are going yeah I definitely

241
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Want to have some sex and also I'm looking

242
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
To adopt a kitten

243
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,260
It's just one circle that says lonely

244
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,260
So anyway

245
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,260
That was the flyer that we found it's time

246
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
To get into the vice portion of our program

247
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
This is our wheel wheel wheel house I guess

248
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,260
This is where this and talking about

249
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,260
Porn advertisements

250
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Actually that is actually kind of

251
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Our wheelhouse also thanks

252
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
So

253
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Here's our first question submitted to us by

254
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,260
A reader earlier

255
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Today I bought lunch at a local bakery

256
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
And as an impulse purchase I bought a

257
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
York peppermint patty at the register

258
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,260
However despite paying for the candy I accidentally

259
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Walked out without taking the snack

260
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,260
Out of the jar what's worse

261
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,260
I didn't remember that I had abandoned the candy

262
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,260
Until long after the deli had closed

263
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,260
Meaning that if I want to retrieve

264
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
The patty I actually have to go back

265
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,260
A full business day later and

266
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
Embarrassingly explain my mistake

267
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,260
What is the protocol in these

268
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Situations do I return

269
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
Tomorrow and let them know about my

270
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Error or is this a dollar I'm simply

271
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Not going to get back that's from snackless

272
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
In San Francisco let me tell you

273
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
One thing I know for sure you're getting that

274
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Fucking patty

275
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
We are going to get through this

276
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,260
Together

277
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
This is a this is a great opportunity

278
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
I think to steal

279
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
Because you can steal with a clean

280
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
Conscious it's yours it's just living

281
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
Without the peppermint patties

282
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
He did pay he exchanged currency

283
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
For goods and services

284
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
He just put it on layaway

285
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
I got the remaining 37 cents

286
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,260
I'm ready to get the sensation

287
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:20,260
What if that was this dude's steez

288
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
In that he just sort of went around

289
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
His town and just sort of

290
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
Planted seeds of like next

291
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
Time he's in this convenience store

292
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
He can be like I need to

293
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
You know get a pack of cigarettes and also

294
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
You owe me one York peppermint patty that I did

295
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Purchase a while ago and then he has a little surprise

296
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
Treaty wasn't expecting review the security

297
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
Get the security camera

298
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
I did pay for this

299
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
That's going to be hard to convince him

300
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,260
To give you that though

301
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,260
Because he's not going to remember your face

302
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
There's people in there trying to scam

303
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
York peppermint patties all the time

304
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
I know how this

305
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
I know that you probably get this a lot

306
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
But I want to get the sensation

307
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
And I did pay for the sensation so just

308
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Give me the patty already you think it's a big patty

309
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,260
These are the big ones one of the small ones

310
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
For a dollar you're getting a full

311
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
Size patty right one would hope

312
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
There's not a joke here

313
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
I'm really would like economy

314
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
You guys the economy

315
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
The joke

316
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
We're doing a little bit more observational stuff

317
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
This time yeah we're working

318
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
Out some new material on this supportive

319
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
Crowd you

320
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,260
Want to Yahoo yeah I do thought there'd be more

321
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Meat on the peppermint patty bone yeah me too

322
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
I thought it would be funnier for longer but no

323
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,260
So when you guys ever

324
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
How do York peppermint patty you guys

00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Know I'm talking about right behind alley

326
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
So we actually have

327
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Another resource for people

328
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
That we help

329
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
From the Yahoo answers service

330
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Where people submit

331
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
Nigh anonymously submit questions

332
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,260
And then we find them

333
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,260
And then we help them whether they

334
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Want it or not so Griffin what's our

335
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
What's our first this

336
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Answer was asked by Yahoo answers user Gerald

337
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
Who

338
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
Asks just Gerald is funny

339
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
I guess it is

340
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
Context that he's a Yahoo answers user

341
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Paints it paints a real nice picture

342
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Gerald asks

343
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Is it safe to drink my brother's sea monkeys

344
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I

345
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Told

346
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
My brother that if he doesn't get back my vintage

347
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
Motley Crue t-shirt I got from my uncle by today

348
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
I was going to drink his sea monkeys

349
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
But he didn't believe me and he didn't

350
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Give it back yet and said he won't

351
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
I think I should stand my ground and drink them

352
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
But I don't want to die or catch a disease

353
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Or something

354
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
You

355
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
That I like that stick

356
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
To it of this though that's the kind of that's

357
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
The kind of gumption this nation was built on

358
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
I don't want to drink your weird babies

359
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
In water but I'm going to

360
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
I want that shirt

361
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
He's not going to

362
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Get the shirt back to ultimate we're talking about

363
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
We're talking about punitive damage I

364
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Think if you watch a man

365
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
Drink your water family

366
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Right in front of you

367
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,260
That is a man who is capable of anything and you will

368
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,260
Give him whatever he wants

369
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
I have a particular set of

370
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Skills actually just one it's drinking

371
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Your babies especially

372
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,260
If you don't do it all at once if you just like

373
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Slowly sip and go I'll keep going

374
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
I love this

375
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Gerald has informed

376
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,260
Us of what his brother's hierarchy

377
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Of favorite shit that he owns

378
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Is and apparently

379
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
At the top of that is a Motley Crue

380
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,260
T-shirt that he is not willing to part with under any

381
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,260
Circumstances and then right behind

382
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,260
That is his sea monkeys and

383
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
It's like that dude is beyond punishment

384
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Isn't he?

385
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
He's like he's too sad

386
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
To fail at that point

387
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
I think brother of Gerald has made

388
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
A serious miscalculation just

389
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Strategically because he has a pretty clear

390
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Vulnerability what with those pets

391
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
And a big tank of water that's made of plastic

392
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,260
I mean you don't even need a brother to drink those

393
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,260
A stiff wind and your whole sea monkey

394
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Or just the passage of like

395
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
Six days because that's really all those guys

396
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,260
Have in them. Some of them get very full

397
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
That's where shrimp come from. They have bad hearts

398
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
Sea monkeys have bad hearts

399
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,260
It's all the inbreeding. Yeah it's true

400
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
That's real look it up

401
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,260
What else are they gonna fucking do? They're not gonna

402
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,260
They can't like get out. They can't hold down a job

403
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,260
Maybe it's the best if he does

404
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Drink the sea monkeys. Okay now wait

405
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
They would be killed I presume by the stomach

406
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Acid right? Oh god you better

407
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,260
Hope so. Yeah. Or else

408
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,260
You're gonna have a fucking inner space scenario

409
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
Happening. You are gonna have an

410
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,260
Inner space on your hands

411
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,260
That's what happens

412
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,260
In that movie. Yeah yeah

413
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Martin Short drinks some

414
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
Baby prawns and Dennis Quays like

415
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,260
Don't worry I got this

416
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,260
I'll take him out buddy. Don't worry

417
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,260
I got this prawns. This is inner space 2 where he

418
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Doesn't shrink down. It's a very

419
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
He's normal size

420
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,260
Wait okay hold on wait

421
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,260
Are you saying

422
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Martin Short

423
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,260
Full grown Martin Short in inner space

424
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,260
2

425
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,260
Is

426
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Has a full sized Dennis Quaid

427
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
Okay we'd have to write

428
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,260
Some sort of sci-fi in the script because we'd have

429
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,260
To shrink Dennis by at least

430
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
25 percent. Or

431
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Grow Martin Short. Exactly

432
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
Martin Tall

433
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,260
Stupid

434
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Stupid

435
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Low hanging fruit

436
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
Idiot

437
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
Is that as bad as it's gonna

438
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Get today. God Christ let's

439
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
Hope so

440
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,260
I

441
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,260
I think it's safe. I just don't think that

442
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,260
You don't get your shirt back

443
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,260
And you're queasy. And you're both gonna

444
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Know that that happened for the rest of your life

445
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
You'll always be able to. That's a thing. Yeah and

446
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,260
You're gonna have sea monkeys controlling you from the inside

447
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,260
That's terrible. It'll be like inner space

448
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,260
You know. Hey if you guys

449
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Inner space jokes

450
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
How about the next question Jeff. Okay

451
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
Hello brothers

452
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,260
McElroy. This one is actually submitted by

453
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
Somebody who is in the audience assuming

454
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
They are not hungover or dead

455
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Hello brothers McElroy are you

456
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Having fun at Mac's Fun Con? Me too

457
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,260
This was written before

458
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Mac's Fun Con right? This was before Mac's Fun Con so this is

459
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
A big leap

460
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
What should I name my car?

461
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,260
It is a 2011 Mazda 2

462
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Hatchback in black. It's very

463
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Cute. I thought I could

464
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Go for a while without naming this car when I first got

465
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,260
It but I've had some bad luck in the first year of my ownership

466
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,260
Broken windshield in the door, punctured

467
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
Tire while driving on the highway, broke up with my boyfriend

468
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,260
So I think not

469
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
I didn't

470
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,260
Write that. So I think

471
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
Not naming the car might have something to do with this

472
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
If it helps I name my last

473
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,260
Car Sally Ride

474
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Sincerely

475
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Lisa W. Lisa W are you

476
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
With us today? Okay well we'll do our best

477
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
Are you blaming all of your bad

478
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Luck on the car? You really think it's the car's

479
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,260
Fault?

480
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Is it a boy car or a girl car?

481
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
You didn't ask?

482
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
You gotta check, look at the car fact

483
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
When it talks

484
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
I always wondered what those were for apparently

485
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
It's for having your car sexed

486
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
What color is it?

487
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Black. That helps. Hatchback

488
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Call it Hatch Black

489
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
That's not a good name

490
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
What?

491
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,260
Griffin what have you

492
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
Have you had a car that you've named in the past?

493
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,260
My 2006

494
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,260
Toyota Matrix. I call it

495
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Trixie because Trix is like in it

496
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,260
It's not funny but

497
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
I just answered the question you asked me on stage

498
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
Can you call the car

499
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Jason Mrozda and then

500
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Cause those words

501
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,260
Are almost the same

502
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,260
That's actually not bad

503
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
How do you feel about Jason Mrozda?

504
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
That's pretty good. Hold on

505
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
Do you love the music of Jason Mrozda?

506
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
Can you learn to?

507
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
Can you open your heart

508
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
To Jason Mrozda and let him

509
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,260
Just sidle on in?

510
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,260
You gotta jam a cassette

511
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Cause I assume that your 2011

512
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Your car that was produced in 2011 has a cassette

513
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Jam a Mrozda cassette in there

514
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,260
And then get like a butter knife and then

515
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
Really wedge it in there and then that'll be like

516
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,260
The permanent soundtrack for Jason Mrozda

517
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
It's a super good idea

518
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
I worked at a Borders that was exactly like that

519
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
24 hours a day

520
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
That's not a joke

521
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,260
How about a Yahoo? Yeah sure

522
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Oh this will be interesting if the call and

523
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Response works out

524
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
This one was sent in by Ira Ray

525
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Are you Ira Ray?

526
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Wow it works

527
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
That is gratifying

528
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,260
It was by Yahoo Answers user

529
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Sammy who asks

530
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,260
What are some simple mysteries that I can solve?

531
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
Be serious

532
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,260
My dad said to start

533
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,260
It's misspelled start but it's hard

534
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,260
To pronounce it

535
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,260
Small and build my way up to big mysteries

536
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Like spirits in houses, hauntings, etc

537
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
I need to know

538
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Some simple cases, please and thank you

539
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,260
One of the more mannerly Yahoo Answers

540
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,260
Yeah I like that

541
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,260
Don't start with Encyclopedia Brown

542
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Those were way hard for me still

543
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,260
I cracked one open recently

544
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm 32 now, these should be

545
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,260
I'm cut to 20 minutes later

546
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,260
The first Battle of Bull Run couldn't have been this

547
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,260
Because the sword said on that

548
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Love those books

549
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Didn't make me any better

550
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,260
At mysteries though

551
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
I think your parents have to plan the mysteries for you

552
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,260
I don't know how old this person is

553
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,260
I hope not too old

554
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,260
You gotta get an early start on the mystery game

555
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
It's like being a gymnast

556
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
You can't start young

557
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
What could start as a small mystery

558
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,260
Could unfurl to be like

559
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Gangland violence

560
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Drug trade

561
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Just like a national treasure

562
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,260
He's trying to find the constitution

563
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,260
And then it turns into a whole thing

564
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Starts out with him doing a tricky sudoku

565
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
And by the end of it he's just wrapped up

566
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
In a fucking John Voight shoot em up

567
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
That is the problem

568
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
If you've ever read any

569
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,260
Mystery, it always starts

570
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,260
With what appears to be a simple mystery

571
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
I don't think you can definitively say

572
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
This is gonna pan out

573
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,260
To be very simple

574
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Because what if it's like that sweater

575
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,260
You start pulling that yarn and then it's just

576
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,260
There's a whole case here

577
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Then you have the mystery of the unraveled sweater

578
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,260
Your mom is super pissed off

579
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,260
That her sweater is fucking gone

580
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
And she's like here's a mystery

581
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
Mystery solved

582
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,260
That was simple

583
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Let me look at some clues

584
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,260
It's a pretty good clue

585
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,260
When we were little

586
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
When we were kids

587
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
When we were smaller

588
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,260
I don't think Griffin was born yet

589
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
Can we not tell the story then

590
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
This is BGM

591
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
Before Griffin McElroy

592
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Travis and I had

593
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Discovered food coloring

594
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
So we filled

595
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Every drink we could get

596
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Our hands on with food coloring

597
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,260
And then we decided

598
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,260
To see what effect it would have on the carpets

599
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,260
And then

600
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,260
And then our mom came down

601
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
And I just

602
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Wanted to tell this story because that seems like a pretty

603
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Easy mystery for her to solve

604
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,260
So if you could set that up for him

605
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
Just put some food coloring on your mouth and on the couch

606
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
And then sit there and wait

607
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
And I think that as his parents

608
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
It would be pretty easy

609
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,260
That was also just a really good bit for the family

610
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,260
Circus fans in the audience

611
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,260
Not me

612
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
People who don't like all the blue humor we usually do

613
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
And just want some Dennis the Menace-esque

614
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
I don't think there's anything wrong with being

615
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Tasteful for a few minutes

616
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,260
I've been pushing to get us to be a little

617
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Cleaner and I think that was a great start

618
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,260
What did you guys think?

619
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
We don't

620
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,260
That was muted

621
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
That was definitely muted

622
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
You want to do another question

623
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
It's actually my turn

624
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Oh wait

625
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Don't worry I was

626
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Not allowed to do that

627
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Yeah

628
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,260
No sad libs

629
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
No

630
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
It's the worst

631
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
Whoa

632
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,260
You guys know I can't improv

633
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,260
I can't just make it up

634
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,260
There's just a story

635
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
When you improv mad libs it's just shouting

636
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
It's time

637
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,260
For a break for some farm wisdom

638
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Farm wisdom

639
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Here's a song that I just wrote

640
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Farm wisdom

641
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I think he just did the Hot Pockets

642
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Farm wisdom

643
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
Farm wisdom

644
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,260
It's a song that I just wrote

645
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
Farm wisdom

646
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Come on and get yourself a goat

647
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
There's two more verses in there

648
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
In that beautiful head of yours

649
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,260
Maybe not

650
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Farm wisdom

651
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,260
This comes from

652
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,260
Here's a bit of wisdom

653
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,260
If you see a skunk or possum

654
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,260
During the day or any nocturnal creature

655
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
You shouldn't approach it

656
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,260
It usually means that there's something wrong with them

657
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,260
And that they're sick

658
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
That sickness is usually rabies

659
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,260
Farm wisdom

660
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
Here's a song that I just wrote

661
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,260
Farm wisdom

662
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
In what scenario at any time of day do you see a skunk or a possum

663
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,260
Like oh I gotta get up on that

664
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,260
Hey little guy let me approach you

665
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,260
Don't worry it's nighttime

666
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,260
This is totally cool

667
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,260
I'm gonna adopt you and teach you to pick pockets

668
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,260
Come hang out with me

669
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,260
The only way I approach a skunk is if there is a larger skunk behind me

670
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
That's it, that's all

671
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
You guys ever seen a raccoon

672
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
Like in real life?

673
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
Yeah they're dicks

674
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
There was one on our balcony once

675
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,260
Not a joke

676
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Obviously

677
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Clearly not a joke

678
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
How about an actual question

679
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
Okay let me actually

680
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Let's help somebody for once

681
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
My cowork and I have been dating for the last year

682
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,260
You wanna start over?

683
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,260
Can you edit that not Griffin

684
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
All of you

685
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,260
Up here

686
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
And set that out

687
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
My coworker and I have been dating for the last year

688
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Since I don't answer to him

689
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
And he doesn't answer to me

690
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
There is no rule in it

691
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
However we've done our best to keep it on the DL

692
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,260
To avoid gossip

693
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Recently when we were put

694
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
When we put in matching vacation requests

695
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,260
My manager put two and two together

696
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,260
And figured it out

697
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,260
My question is does there need to be

698
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,260
An I know you know conversation

699
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
If so how do I broach the subject

700
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Of our not so new relationship to reassure her

701
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
She hasn't been duped

702
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
And reiterate my good work ethic

703
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,260
And loyalty to her

704
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,260
And the company that's from Exposed

705
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,260
Wait so the fear here is that the manager

706
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
Found out and went why didn't you tell me

707
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
I'm so hurt

708
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
I thought we were close

709
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,260
We go to Margarita Tuesdays every week

710
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
You gotta not do it at all

711
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
Is the right answer

712
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
Because it's not her fucking business

713
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
I guess it is

714
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
It is her business

715
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Literally it's her business

716
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Finances and profit margins

717
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
I think one of my rules is

718
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,260
If you want to

719
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,260
Convince someone that you haven't been

720
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
Hiding something from them

721
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
The time to tell them is not

722
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,260
After they discover

723
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,260
That is a tough

724
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,260
Sell if you can pull that off

725
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
This is apparently a simple mystery

726
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,260
That somebody can solve

727
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,260
There you go

728
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,260
Here's the thing

729
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,260
You are just going to deflate

730
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Your boss if you come out and tell her straight up

731
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Because either she's very satisfied

732
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
With herself that she fucking cracked

733
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
This da Vinci code

734
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
This sexy sexy da Vinci code that's going on

735
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
Right under her nose

736
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,260
It's going to diminish the sexiness

737
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Of the whole thing to be like

738
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Yeah we are together

739
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,260
And it's not a sexy dark sexy secret

740
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
Say sexy more

741
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
I'll get to it

742
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
I want to space him out

743
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
I mean they have to know

744
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,260
You have to tell them

745
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,260
But I do think it sets up an unrealistic

746
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,260
I don't have an end of the sentence

747
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Is there a way you can say it

748
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
That acknowledges the fact that they already know

749
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,260
That you are dead

750
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Say oh yeah we are going on vacation together

751
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,260
We are brother and sister

752
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,260
And we have been hiding it

753
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,260
From you all this time

754
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,260
We are related this whole time

755
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
We are the same person

756
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,260
Surprise

757
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
You are missing the obvious answer

758
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
That doesn't sound like us

759
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,260
I know you have to admit it to everyone

760
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Come clean but then stage a big fight and break up

761
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
Re-hide the secret

762
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Double back on your secret

763
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
It's sexy again

764
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
Maybe this time you invite another person

765
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
And just keep growing the sexy

766
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
It got weird

767
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
I got halfway through that sentence

768
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
No no no no

769
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
It's too late

770
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
My new thing is

771
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
This is a secret improv

772
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
You can take this one if you want

773
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
If you don't have a joke

774
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
Just say you don't have one

775
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
And then wait

776
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
Another joke will find its way

777
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,260
Onto your path

778
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
In a very organic manner

779
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Sometimes I start a sentence thinking I have a joke

780
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,260
And I realize I'm just saying

781
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Literally the next word

782
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
Conjunction

783
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Article

784
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Is there a subject coming up?

785
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
Just keep the ball up in the air

786
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Mr. Conjunction fuck it

787
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Roll with the punches

788
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
How about another yahoo?

789
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
Yeah sounds good

790
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,260
This one was sent in by Ira Ray

791
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,260
No I don't do it twice

792
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
Yeah

793
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
It's by yahoo answers user

794
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,260
Wewalkalone

795
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
Who asks

796
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
You are sitting

797
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Registering for yahoo answers

798
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
You know what's sad?

799
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Is that the O in alone

800
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
Is like a special character

801
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
It's like the O with the slash through

802
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Like a no smoking sign

803
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
I don't know what that's called or what its purpose is

804
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
Tilde

805
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,260
It's an interior tilde

806
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Which intimates that

807
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
Somebody else already registered

808
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Wewalkalone

809
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,260
I bet there's probably a few variations on that throughout

810
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,260
Wewalkalone asks

811
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,260
How do you ask a girl out to breakfast

812
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,260
Without it sounding like you want a one night stand?

813
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
This is

814
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
This is a tricky needle to thread

815
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,260
Additional details

816
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,260
She loves waffles

817
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,260
And basically most breakfast foods

818
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Is that any additional details?

819
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,260
Yeah that's it

820
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,260
Okay so that does tell you something about our character

821
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,260
I mean you could go the blunt approach

822
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,260
And say I want you to have waffles but not sex

823
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,260
That's how actually I order it

824
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,260
I hop every time

825
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Me? I'm going to have

826
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,260
I don't look so good

827
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,260
I'm so hungry we waited a long time

828
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,260
I'm going to have waffles but not sex

829
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,260
Please do not try to have sex with me

830
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Keep it under your apron darling

831
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
Is he wearing

832
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
And also some berries

833
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
And no sex

834
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,260
Some sex, some light sex

835
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
This is my fourth time at IHOP

836
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,260
I'm willing to entertain it

837
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
Do you still have the bottomless sex?

838
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:44,260
The bottomless sex?

839
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,260
Wait

840
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
I get it

841
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Okay

842
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
If this guy is worried

843
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
That she is going to

844
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
Assume that post breakfast

845
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,260
He is going to want to have sex with her

846
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
That it seems like a fallacious

847
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Thing to be worried about

848
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Because nobody has ever

849
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
Eaten waffles and then been like

850
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
I feel like ready to get down

851
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
People in this room are fucking chock full

852
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
Of cheese blintzes, nobody's looking around like

853
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
Who's going to be my 11 o'clock hook up?

854
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I wish I was napping

855
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
I wish these three brothers would be quiet so I could take a

856
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Theater nap

857
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
Griffin actually wouldn't let us

858
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Me and Travis have cheese blintzes

859
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
He said we wouldn't be funny if we ate those

860
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
He said we'd be too full

861
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,260
This is not a joke

862
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,260
Griffin has gotten super protective of my diet

863
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
The whole time I've been here

864
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
He's been really demonstrative

865
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
Justin kept getting

866
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,260
I don't want to put you on fire

867
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Justin kept getting salads

868
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,260
And then just like

869
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Eating around them in such a perfect manner

870
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
The salad would sit unmolested

871
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,260
Like in the perfect shape that he put it

872
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,260
On the plate

873
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,260
And he even addressed the fact like

874
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
Maybe next time salad

875
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,260
I thought about a salad

876
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
I want to be the sort of

877
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,260
I look around

878
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,260
I look around at everybody here and everybody's getting salad

879
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Like they like it and I just think I want to be

880
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,260
I want to be where the people are

881
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,260
Eating that salad

882
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
And seeming to enjoy it

883
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
People are getting salad

884
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,260
With their own volition

885
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,260
Like it has a flavor that they like

886
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,260
And I don't know how to process it

887
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,260
So I just get some salad and then I get embarrassed

888
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
Because I eat everything else because it all tastes better than salad

889
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
You're so much of a salad

890
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Salad noob Mario

891
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
But you know you don't walk back with the salad on your plate

892
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,260
To throw it away and then go we tried

893
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
He's wasting it

894
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
So that's good

895
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
He thinks oh that's salad that somebody else doesn't have to eat

896
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,260
You're welcome the rest of the world

897
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,260
Oh god I've been waiting

898
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,260
I hope the salad bowl will be empty

899
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Those stars

900
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Actually aligned yesterday there was no salad

901
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,260
Gotta rough up

902
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,260
The first time I got no

903
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,260
I did not realize

904
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,260
Here's my salad in expertise

905
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,260
I got no dressing

906
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,260
So just a big pile of

907
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Leaves and then

908
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,260
The next time I grabbed

909
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,260
Something that looked like dressing and was

910
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Olive oil so I just kind of coated it

911
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,260
I wondered why you were doing that

912
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,260
I don't know what dressing is

913
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,260
You were doing like a fancy flourish

914
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,260
Like a subway sandwich artist and I was like what are you

915
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,260
That's not for that

916
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
For a time I tried to get into salad

917
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
At restaurants my lovely wife

918
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,260
Can attest to this I tried to get into salads

919
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,260
At restaurants by asking them to bring

920
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,260
A side of pizza sauce

921
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
What was the illusion that you were

922
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,260
Chasing there like it's

923
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,260
Tomatoes

924
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,260
Did any waiter ever act like that was

925
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,260
Something anyone else had ever done

926
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Oh yeah pizza salad

927
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
That's actually right there on your sides

928
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Is it possible for you to serve the salad in like a

929
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,260
Bread bowl but like just flat and triangular

930
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
And like if you want to melt some cheese on there

931
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
And let's get a light on the leaves

932
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
You can I want pizza

933
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Can the leaves be from a pepperoni tree

934
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Anyway Justin didn't eat a salad and I had to develop

935
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,260
A system of reward points that he could

936
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,260
Exchange for dessert

937
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,260
I would be eating a bite of salad

938
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,260
And Griffin would say I

939
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,260
That looks like about 80 cookie points

940
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,260
You need 100 cookie points to get a cookie

941
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,260
So you can either have 8 tenths

942
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Of a cookie now or you can finish the last

943
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Two bites of your salad

944
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,260

945
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,260

946
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260

In your field what field is it

1052
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
Maybe we can find some humor in there

1053
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
It's got to be somewhere right

1054
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260

Emotions are there in that job

1058
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,260

This year you get a desk

1061
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,260
Greg I think

1062
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,260
That you you I can

1063
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,260
Understand why you think that the good news

1064
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
I think is that people

1065
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
Will always think about

1066
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,260
Others a lot less than they think about

1067
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,260
Themselves so if you

1068
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,260
Just do Greg

1069
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,260
Just do Greg for

1070
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,260

Do Greg three more

1074
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,260
Weeks and people will

1075
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,260
Inevitably move on to their own problems

1076
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,260
They cannot keep in their head

1077
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Actual facts about other humans that

1078
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,260
Long they have to just let it slip out so they can

1079
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Remember the lyrics to the new

1080
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,260
Song

1081
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260

Question everyone's worried about right now

1122
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,260
Because you're not leaving it here

1123
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,260
You finally got

1124
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,260
Lube without having to buy it from a store

1125
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,260
You're never

1126
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,260
Letting it go this is the loophole

1127
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,260
Or making it

1128
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,260
Making it yourself out of coconut

1129
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Oil

1130
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,260
You don't really have to make anything you just

1131
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,260
Use the coconut

1132
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
You go to Target and you buy

1133
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
The travel pack of empty

1134
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Three ounce bottles and then you just split

1135
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
It into multiple three ounce bottles

1136
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,260
And then you actually have to say I'm putting lube

1137
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
In these and then you line them

1138
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,260
Up on your nightstand so when people come in

1139
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,260
You'd be like this is my collection

1140
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
There's single server or you could do

1141
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Like the bandolero of just lube

1142
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,260
Packets

1143
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,260
Lube of sexual

1144
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,260
Lube this is

1145
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,260
Of a lubricant that one uses during

1146
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:40,260
Love making this is gonna be gross

1147
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,260
Do we know if the bottle is under

1148
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,260
Like do we know if the bottle is

1149
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,260
Under over three point six ounces

1150
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,260
Yeah it's four ounces

1151
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,260
Okay first off you gotta drink some

1152
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
This is gonna be

1153
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,260
Simultaneously gross and too forward

1154
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,260
To bring up to a stranger but if you are

1155
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,260
Going to hide it in a cavity it will be

1156
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,260
Super easy to do so

1157
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Cause you have what you

1158
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,260
Have what you need to do that

1159
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
And the problem with the bottle itself

1160
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,260
Is that you can't use that bottle

1161
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,260
Because can you imagine

1162
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,260
That TSA security screening guy

1163
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,260
Dressed down by a superior just to be clear

1164
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,260
We're keeping an eye out for

1165
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Terrorist threats and the bottle said

1166
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,260
Rocket lube

1167
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Nothing set off any alarms there

1168
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,260
That maybe it is right that's what you use

1169
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,260
On the missile silo to make sure

1170
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,260
That the rockets come out as soon as possible

1171
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,260
Right through there

1172
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
You could also just

1173
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
Do it in little baggies do you have any like

1174
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Zip lock baggies she was cheap

1175
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:42,260
She didn't want to buy things let's be clear

1176
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,260
People answer the question

1177
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,260
I don't think they let you just put loose fluid

1178
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
And zip lock baggies and bring it on airplanes

1179
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,260
I don't think you can

1180
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Fucking do a makeshift capri sun

1181
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,260
And be like no no no it's cool

1182
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,260
Maybe like soak a towel in it

1183
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
And then wring it out when you get home

1184
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,260
Haha that's great

1185
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,260
The perfect crime

1186
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,260
Is it though

1187
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Is it the right

1188
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,260
The problem with any solution here is you have to be

1189
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Ready with an answer because you cannot

1190
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Go to the screener and they say

1191
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,260
So what are these and you say well there's several

1192
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,260
Small baggies of lube

1193
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,260
I have many pistons at home

1194
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,260
Which I need to keep

1195
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:24,260
Working in their most efficient state

1196
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,260
They're sex pistons

1197
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
I hope we've helped

1198
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Yes thank you very much

1199
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Who else

1200
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
Elliot come on up

1201
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Just complete silence

1202
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Through the just no talking

1203
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
Namaste

1204
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
Hi Elliot from London

1205
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
So fancy

1206
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Hey Elliot what's your

1207
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,260
What's your not bummer question

1208
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
So I have a flatmate

1209
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
He's a lovely lovely guy

1210
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
Remate

1211
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,260
I'm just translating for people I wasn't correcting

1212
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,260
Let's have one non completely

1213
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,260
Xenophobic show this year

1214
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,260
Who's afraid of Xena

1215
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,260
I've been sitting on that

1216
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,260
Joke for three years

1217
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:20,260
Oh god

1218
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,260
So he's a

1219
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,260
Lovely guy he's got a job just like I do

1220
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,260
Same wage and all the rest of it but

1221
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
It's like living with a

1222
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Toddler that has a career

1223
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,260
In that he doesn't seem

1224
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,260
To understand the concept of

1225
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
You know cleanliness and

1226
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Not leaving marks all over the walls

1227
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
And

1228
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
Wait a minute are we dealing with a

1229
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Harold and the purple crayon situation

1230
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,260
Is he imagineering

1231
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
No he's sort of like

1232
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
The grubby marks around light switches

1233
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
And leaving stuff on camera

1234
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Holy shit

1235
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
He's eating peanut butter with his hands

1236
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Why are you rooming with pig pen

1237
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,260
The problem is I've known him

1238
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
Since we were 12 and I can't

1239
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
I can't sort of you know

1240
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
Leave him in the lurch and stuff like that

1241
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
Otherwise a lovely guy

1242
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
I've tried every sort of pleasant conversation

1243
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
That you can have with a lifelong best friend

1244
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Without this sort of thing

1245
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260
How do I get him to you know be an adult

1246
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
You could try cookie points

1247
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
Cookie points would be good

1248
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,260
Bath time points I guess

1249
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260
Bath time vouchers

1250
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
They serve bath time vouchers in this magazine

1251
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
Ellie give me a sample like in the conversations

1252
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,260
You've had with him what's the tenor of those

1253
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
What's the general tone

1254
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:36,260
Well they've ranged

1255
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
Yeah right

1256
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260
But generally it's along the lines of like you know

1257
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:42,260
If you clean things up now

1258
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
It will be easier than cleaning them later

1259
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,260
And I won't have to yell at you and try and be your mother

1260
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
You don't use that tone though

1261
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
I don't but that's what I'm thinking

1262
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,260
Did he have like when you were growing up

1263
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,260
Did he have a nickname like Grubby Hank

1264
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:56,260
This one's on you dog

1265
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,260
You don't live with Grubby Hank

1266
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,260
You go out and hang out at bars with Grubby Hank

1267
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
You don't bring him into your domicile

1268
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,260
His nickname was Scruff as a child

1269
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,260
Same principle

1270
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,260
But the cleanliness thing wasn't the thing

1271
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:10,260
Until I actually lived with him

1272
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,260
Oh no he just had a beard when he was a child

1273
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:14,260
Basically yeah

1274
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,260
You gotta move

1275
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:18,260
Don't move

1276
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:20,260
I'm rethinking it I was rash

1277
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,260
I'm sorry

1278
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,260
I mean

1279
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,260
You were his last shot you know that right

1280
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,260
Like his parents done fucked it

1281
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,260
Yeah that's done

1282
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,260
You were his last shot at having a normal life

1283
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,260
And you've gotta sit him down

1284
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,260
And grab

1285
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,260
Don't touch him

1286
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,260
I was gonna say grab his face

1287
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:42,260
And it's like oh is that jelly

1288
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,260
Did you put jelly on your face

1289
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,260
I keep little tubs of those

1290
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,260
You know those alcohol hand washes around

1291
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,260
Just because

1292
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:52,260
At like a barbecue restaurant you just hold on

1293
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,260
They're just everywhere

1294
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,260
Let me tell you

1295
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,260
People might not know this

1296
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:00,260
I'm kind of a messy person

1297
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,260
How the fuck would they know that

1298
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,260
They don't live with you Travis

1299
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,260
They know your fucking voice

1300
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,260
They don't know your mannerisms

1301
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,260
I'll post some pictures

1302
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,260
We rarely leave in the sound of you

1303
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
Tripping over a milk carton

1304
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,260
The argument if you clean it now

1305
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,260
It'll be easier than cleaning it later

1306
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,260
Is false because cleaning it later

1307
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,260
Is inherently easier because

1308
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,260
It never comes

1309
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,260
That's his entire attitude with everything in life

1310
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,260
And I don't know

1311
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,260
Have you considered leaning into it

1312
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,260
Getting super dirty yourself

1313
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,260
Getting on the British version of

1314
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:36,260
Hoarders whatever it's called over there

1315
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,260
Just shitting all over his bed

1316
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,260
Don't shit on his bed

1317
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:42,260
What the fuck

1318
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,260
You gotta think about mass

1319
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:46,260
And you gotta think about volume

1320
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,260
Hoarding is a volume game

1321
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
You wanna have stacks of shit

1322
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,260
Not shit shit

1323
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,260
And then the money that you get

1324
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,260
From being on Hoarders

1325
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
You can buy a maid or a nanny

1326
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
I don't think they pay people to be on Hoarders

1327
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
Yeah if you're on Hoarders

1328
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,260
They pay you like a Hoarders stipend

1329
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
Get like an appearance fee

1330
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
They look at you and say

1331
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,260
Don't spend it all on crackerjack paraphernalia

1332
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
Boink

1333
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,260
Do you think that the

1334
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:18,260
Hoarders guardian angels that come in

1335
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,260
They're just like oh yeah your shit's super fucked up

1336
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,260
Later bye

1337
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:24,260
Have fun with your whole situation here

1338
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,260
I think a good twist on Hoarders

1339
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,260
Would be if they left all their stuff together

1340
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,260
In a specific location

1341
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,260
And then gave them a clue

1342
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,260
And then it turned into like the Amazing Race

1343
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,260
You can get it all back

1344
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,260
It's all waiting for you

1345
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,260
Whatever you do make it fun

1346
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Round of applause

1347
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
How we doing on time?

1348
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,260
What?

1349
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,260
We're doing good

1350
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,260
Who else has a question?

1351
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
Oh wait hold on

1352
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,260
Let's do a Yahoo answer

1353
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
Let's drop in and just

1354
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,260
Remember my password

1355
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,260
This Yahoo answer was

1356
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,260
Sent in by Christa Whalen

1357
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,260
Thank you Christa Whalen

1358
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,260
It's by Yahoo answer's user Janine who asks

1359
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
Financial aid at Hogwarts?

1360
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,260
Does Hogwarts provide financial aid?

1361
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,260
Or do I need to submit the wizard

1362
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,260
Equivalent of the FAFSA?

1363
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,260
So this raises some legitimate questions

1364
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,260
I think if you don't have financial aid

1365
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:26,260
At Hogwarts it's gonna create

1366
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,260
Sort of like a class warfare

1367
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,260
It's just a rich get more magical

1368
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:32,260
You know situation

1369
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,260
It's you gotta have financial

1370
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,260
Like I imagine they never really touch on this

1371
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,260
In the books or the movies

1372
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
But I imagine it's an expensive institution

1373
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,260
It's a fucking castle

1374
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,260
Right

1375
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,260
Most castle based schools require

1376
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,260
A large sum of money

1377
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,260
I'm gonna ask you guys a question

1378
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,260
I've been wondering for a while

1379
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,260
It's slightly off topic

1380
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Perfect

1381
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,260
There has to be one Slytherin kid

1382
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,260
Who's like cool

1383
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,260
Who's like nice

1384
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,260
Who's sitting there in the conference room

1385
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,260
Just be like you guys are dicks

1386
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,260
Harry's okay

1387
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,260
The four house based system

1388
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,260
Of Hogwarts

1389
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,260
Creates it's own class warfare

1390
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,260
In and of itself

1391
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
You got the one percenters in Slytherin

1392
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,260
You got the

1393
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,260
I just don't know what the Hufflepuff people are up to

1394
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,260
They're just a bunch of fat babies

1395
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,260
That's all I can think of

1396
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,260
When I think of Hufflepuff I just imagine fat babies

1397
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,260
Waddling around doing magic

1398
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,260
You know why are there only humans

1399
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,260
Another terrific point

1400
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,260
There are only humans going to Hogwarts

1401
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,260
We know that this world is populated by several different races

1402
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,260
Intelligent races

1403
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,260
Intelligent races

1404
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:44,260
There are fucking centaurs in the fucking backyard

1405
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,260
Like hey guys can we get some magic too

1406
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,260
And it's like yeah that'll be 200

1407
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,260
Currency

1408
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,260
200,000

1409
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,260
Knots

1410
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,260
I think

1411
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,260
Zenny

1412
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,260
You're welcome

1413
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,260
You know there was one ogre

1414
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,260
There was one ogre kid that got admitted

1415
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
And just like

1416
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,260
Tried to pick up a beaker of magic

1417
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,260
And smashed it in his hands

1418
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,260
Nevermind I'll see myself out

1419
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,260
I'll walk through the wall

1420
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,260
I'll telecommute

1421
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,260
I'll just go to Hogwarts online

1422
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,260
Hogwarts online

1423
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,260
Oh man what a bummer that would be

1424
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,260
Like oh shit

1425
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,260
There was a fucking

1426
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:32,260
This crazy wild troll got out

1427
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,260
There was a fucking

1428
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,260
The second wizarding war

1429
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,260
You missed some shit man

1430
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,260
No I was eating this hot pocket though

1431
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:42,260
Gmail servers went down and I missed my final

1432
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,260
It's like literal

1433
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,260
Phoenix University

1434
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Cause magic

1435
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,260
Alright let's help somebody else

1436
00:50:54,260 --> 00:51:02,260
Help you

1437
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,260
I apologize for sweating through

1438
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,260
The shirt I'm wearing

1439
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,260
It's hot up in this comedy lodge

1440
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,260
Are you apologizing to me? Yes specifically

1441
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:12,260
Hi I'm Sarah

1442
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:14,260
Hi Sarah I'm Justin

1443
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,260
I just got a new job that's work from home

1444
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,260
And I was wondering if you had any advice on

1445
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,260
How to do that

1446
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,260
Sister if you can figure it out

1447
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,260
Let me know

1448
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,260
Can you afford to hire six to eight people

1449
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,260
To just be around you

1450
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,260
I've been working out of my home

1451
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,260
For

1452
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,260
Four years now

1453
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,260
Just my home

1454
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,260
It's just me and my cats

1455
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,260
And your wife

1456
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,260
And my wife

1457
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:44,260
Well no I mean during the day

1458
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,260
I pay someone

1459
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,260
I pay someone to clean the house

1460
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,260
Just so I have visitors

1461
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,260
FedEx man is my best friend

1462
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,260
Get okay

1463
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,260
And get your boss okay

1464
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,260
With the fact that your first year

1465
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,260
You're not going to do very good

1466
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,260
You're going to do a super bad job

1467
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:06,260
At your job

1468
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,260
All the things you like are at your house

1469
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,260
They're right there and most importantly

1470
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,260
Your sleep zone

1471
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,260
The place where you do all your sleeping at

1472
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,260
Yeah it's a rough

1473
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,260
It's a rough transition and it really did

1474
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,260
Take me like a year and a half before I was

1475
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,260
Meeting my quotas so to speak

1476
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,260
Structure is really important

1477
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,260
I know it seems like well done with pants

1478
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,260
But you really

1479
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,260
You got to set a pants schedule

1480
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,260
You do have to set a pants schedule

1481
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,260
There's a primordial gene inside of you that's like

1482
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,260
I don't have pants on so just fuck it

1483
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,260
Let's watch a whole season

1484
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,260
Of the amazing race today

1485
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,260
I can't even wear sweatpants

1486
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,260
Because they send a signal

1487
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,260
To my brain that's like take it easy brother

1488
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,260
That song 5 o'clock

1489
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,260
Somewhere is about me putting on sweatpants actually

1490
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,260
Love his music

1491
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,260
So do bad for a year wear pants

1492
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,260
I'm not saying do bad for a year

1493
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,260
I'm saying you have no other option

1494
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,260
It's a really tough transition

1495
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,260
What do you do?

1496
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,260
No that's fine actually

1497
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,260
My employer is here too

1498
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:10,260
Oh fuck

1499
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,260
I always knew someday

1500
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,260
The advice would come back

1501
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,260
Circus closed

1502
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,260
What is your job?

1503
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:20,260
So I work for Make That Thing

1504
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Which is a subsidiary of Topataco

1505
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,260
Okay

1506
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,260
I imagine that most people there

1507
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,260
Work from home unless there's a

1508
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,260
Is there a centralized office for

1509
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,260
There is but it's in another state

1510
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,260
From the one I live in

1511
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
Are there a lot of remote employees

1512
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,260
Or are you more or less

1513
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,260
Will they notice that you're

1514
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,260
Not wearing pants?

1515
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,260
They haven't noticed yet

1516
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:46,260
Nice

1517
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,260
There's a robot

1518
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,260
That's at the hospital in my town

1519
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,260
That has a

1520
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,260
This is the beginning of my favorite

1521
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,260
Tom Waits song

1522
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,260
There's a robot

1523
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,260
That lives in the hospital

1524
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,260
Near my town

1525
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,260
There's a robot that lives

1526
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,260
In the hospital near my town

1527
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,260
And he has a

1528
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,260
He has a TV screen

1529
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:12,260
On his face that is his face

1530
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:14,260
That's his face and there's a doctor

1531
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:16,260
I'm not making

1532
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,260
I'm so excited to see where you go with this

1533
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,260
This isn't a joke

1534
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
It was on a commercial I saw

1535
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,260
There's a

1536
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,260
There's a doctor that lives

1537
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,260
The doctor's on the TV

1538
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,260
And he rolls into your room

1539
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:32,260
And he has robot arms

1540
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,260
And everything is a robot except his face

1541
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,260
It's still a robot

1542
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,260
It's a remote robot face Justin

1543
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,260
You know it's not his actual

1544
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,260
It's not his actual face

1545
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
Pulled in a ghastly manner

1546
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,260
Over

1547
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,260
Does he have a pill dispenser?

1548
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,260
No? I made that up

1549
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,260
It's like a

1550
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
It's like a gashapon machine

1551
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,260
You put in a quarter and maybe you get the

1552
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,260
Maybe you get the treatment you need

1553
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,260
So he does have a pill dispenser

1554
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,260
I'll edit that out when she said that he doesn't

1555
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,260
And you could

1556
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
I guess what I'm saying is maybe do that

1557
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
Which part?

1558
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,260
Good question

1559
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,260
That is going to be

1560
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,260
I imagine there's a lot of pranksters in that office

1561
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,260
And when you're not there to fend those pranksters off

1562
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,260
And all you have are robot appendages

1563
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,260
Oh yeah they're going to TP you

1564
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,260
And you won't realize it because you only have the one camera

1565
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:26,260
Guys be honest

1566
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,260
Am I covered in toilet paper right now?

1567
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,260
You will have robot

1568
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,260
Which model of robot you get

1569
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,260
If you get a terminator robot

1570
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,260
Then what?

1571
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,260
Is there a rest of the goof?

1572
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,260
No that would be terrific

1573
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,260
Dangerous and kind of scary

1574
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,260
What about a Johnny 5 robot?

1575
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,260
What about an iron giant? How big is the office?

1576
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,260
That would work

1577
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,260
It's a fucking big office

1578
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,260
You guys are doing pretty great

1579
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,260
Vacation request

1580
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,260
Softball sign ups in the break room

1581
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,260
Aye supervisor

1582
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,260
Supervisor

1583
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,260
I'm going to start crying

1584
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,260
I'm going to cry too

1585
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,260
He just wants to be a hero

1586
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,260
He just wants to be in charge of some employees

1587
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,260
Did any of that help?

1588
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:30,260
Oh it was great

1589
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:36,260
No you fucking dropped the mic

1590
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,260
That was a baller move

1591
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,260
Put DMX back on

1592
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:42,260
Play it off

1593
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,260
I think we have time for maybe one more

1594
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,260
One more person needs help

1595
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,260
That's Joe Dan right here

1596
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,260
Come up to the stage

1597
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,260
Quicker

1598
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,260
I like that

1599
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:56,260
Cut across

1600
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:58,260
Oh flavor

1601
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,260
I like your style Dan

1602
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,260
What's your name?

1603
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,260
Holy shit that was amazing

1604
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:06,260
How did you?

1605
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,260
Raise your hand if your name is Dan here

1606
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,260
So your odds were pretty good

1607
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,260
Bad

1608
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,260
All the smokers are Dan

1609
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,260
I'm smoker Dan

1610
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,260
My friends call me

1611
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,260
What's your story smoker Dan?

1612
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,260
I recently moved in with a friend of mine

1613
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
Is he really dirty?

1614
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,260
Because we just did this one

1615
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:28,260
Actually I was going to ask a question related to that

1616
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,260
Because I'm on vacation

1617
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,260
And I don't know how to keep my house clean

1618
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,260
When I'm not there

1619
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,260
Because he doesn't do it when I am there

1620
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,260
But no that wasn't

1621
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,260
We've done that

1622
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,260
Wow I like this pivot

1623
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,260
We should learn how to do this

1624
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,260
Days after moving in

1625
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,260
He had a falling out

1626
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,260
With all of our mutual friends

1627
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:52,260
Can I ask what he did?

1628
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,260
Was it so much of a dick move

1629
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:56,260
That you don't even want to

1630
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,260
I have no idea

1631
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,260
It's a simple mystery

1632
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,260
Sounds actually pretty

1633
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,260
If only you could ask somebody

1634
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:10,260
There has to be some material witness

1635
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:12,260
Time to look for clues

1636
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,260
The way he says it

1637
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,260
It was the thing

1638
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,260
That finally happened

1639
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
I don't know what the thing is

1640
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,260
My question was really

1641
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:24,260
How do I go about maintaining those

1642
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,260
Other relationships

1643
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,260
Dan there is no reality in which we can answer this

1644
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,260
Without more insight into what the action was

1645
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:32,260
That you were trying to defend

1646
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,260
What if he killed a guy?

1647
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:36,260
The only story

1648
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,260
He's told me is

1649
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,260
Him and his friend

1650
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,260
They had a podcast

1651
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,260
I already fucking despise this

1652
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,260
Fuck them where do they get off?

1653
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,260
If you plug the podcast in

1654
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,260
I'm not going to say it

1655
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:54,260
Jordan and Jesse go

1656
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,260
They were doing a movie review

1657
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,260
Of Iron Man 3

1658
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,260
They disagreed and it turned into

1659
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,260
A life fight

1660
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:10,260
Are you fucking kidding me?

1661
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,260
We've all been there

1662
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,260
It's a fickle thing

1663
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,260
That I have a hard time

1664
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,260
Taking seriously

1665
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,260
Because it's dumb

1666
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,260
All of my friends are fighting

1667
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
Can I give you some advice that I haven't given in a while?

1668
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,260
You need to pack your bags and move the fuck away

1669
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,260
Because this whole group of friends

1670
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,260
Sounds eight

1671
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,260
They have that quality

1672
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,260
He said mean things about Iron Man 3

1673
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,260
Hey, come on now

1674
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,260
I haven't seen it yet

1675
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,260
If that was really the

1676
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,260
Realistically

1677
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,260
That's what your roommate is telling you

1678
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,260
And the other ones are like

1679
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,260
He shit on my bed

1680
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,260
Did he say he didn't like Iron Man 3

1681
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,260
Because it had black people in it?

1682
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:04,260
Because that would be

1683
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,260
Cause to say

1684
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,260
I don't think I want to be friends with this dude anymore

1685
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,260
There may have been subtext

1686
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,260
I like Iron Man in that movie

1687
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,260
He reminds me of your dad who I had sex with

1688
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,260
I disagree

1689
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,260
He does not remind me of my dad

1690
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:22,260
People ask me how to build an audience

1691
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,260
For their podcast

1692
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,260
That would be the best fucking episode of anything ever

1693
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,260
Just let it roll

1694
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,260
Just let it play

1695
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,260
Watch it all crumble around you

1696
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,260
Yeah, all new friends

1697
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,260
Start over

1698
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,260
You're young, you got a lot of time to rebuild

1699
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,260
It's a rebuilding year for you, Dan

1700
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,260
I guess that's how I ended up here

1701
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,260
We got bad news this year, but great news next year

1702
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:46,260
You're gonna feel great

1703
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,260
You made a bunch of new friends here, so you're gonna be fine

1704
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,260
Move in with them

1705
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,260
Who's got room for Dan?

1706
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,260
There's one hand

1707
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:58,260
How many people do you need to live with, Dan?

1708
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,260
Round of applause for Dan

1709
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,260
Alright, that's all the proper advice questions

1710
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,260
Yeah, that's all the proper advice we have

1711
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:14,260
Before we wrap this show up

1712
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,260
In the only way we know how

1713
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,260
We want to say thank you so much

1714
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Seriously, this is even earlier than we did it last year

1715
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,260
Which was still pretty early

1716
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:26,260
And I know you guys had super late nights

1717
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,260
Behind the curtain

1718
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,260
It felt like a lot of people were up really late last night

1719
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,260
Saw a lot of auras

1720
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,260
Thank you guys, seriously, for coming

1721
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,260
And thank you to all of the other

1722
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,260
Presenters and performers and everyone this year

1723
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,260
Let's do one big round of applause for everyone

1724
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,260
And now one just for us

1725
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,260
I can't applaud

1726
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,260
For people that have sent me to a

1727
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,260
Three day panic attack

1728
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,260
And I'm confronted by genuinely talented people

1729
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,260
Oh, he's like really funny

1730
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,260
He has jokes and things, oh shit

1731
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,260
Oh god, oh god

1732
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:04,260
He's worked at this, ah shit

1733
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,260
So last year we

1734
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,260
Closed the show out with a bunch of

1735
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:10,260
Final yahoo questions

1736
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,260
Layered delicately

1737
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,260
So delicately

1738
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,260
Over Vanessa Williams

1739
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,260
Saved the best for last

1740
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:20,260
We're not going to do that this year

1741
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:22,260
No, we're doing something incredibly similar though

1742
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,260
We are going to

1743
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:26,260
Read the final yahoo answers

1744
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:28,260
Yeah Nick, if you want to go ahead

1745
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,260
Over the best last day of camp song

1746
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,260
Possibly of all time

1747
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,260
Should we stand up? Can we take these out of the thing?

1748
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,260
I don't think we can take them out of the thing, we can try

1749
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,260
They move

1750
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,260
That's awkward

1751
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,260
Should I start?

1752
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
Go ahead

1753
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,260
Do you have to mentally add the prices

1754
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,260
If you work at Subway?

1755
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,260
What do you think of the idea of people

1756
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,260
Evolving like Pokemon?

1757
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,260
Can spiders have fun?

1758
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,260
Is it possible to break your

1759
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:08,260
Titty bone?

1760
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,260
Is it possible to break your

1761
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:12,260
Titty bone?

1762
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,260
Is the movie Jumanji based on a true story?

1763
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,260
Are a kangaroo's fingers flexible enough

1764
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,260
To pick up a can or a magazine?

1765
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,260
Why don't we go

1766
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,260
Does the Pringles guy remind you of Frederick Nishi?

1767
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,260
Nishi

1768
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,260
Notice there are no photos of

1769
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,260
Notice there are no photos of Jesus with a hat?

1770
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:42,260
Think about it

1771
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:44,260
Two and two, add it up

1772
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,260
Where can I find Gordon Ramsay fan fiction?

1773
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:52,260
What is the opposite of being a gynecologist?

1774
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,260
How much does Africa cost?

1775
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,260
How do I tell my parents that I am a horse?

1776
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,260
If you have a gun rack on your bike

1777
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:08,260
Then you might be a redneck

1778
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:16,260
I was washing my car

1779
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:18,260
And my neighbour came out and said

1780
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:20,260
Washing your car huh?

1781
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,260
Billing ball

1782
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,260
I said nope, just watering my jeep garden

1783
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:28,260
Here's your sign

1784
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:30,260
Ladies and gentlemen

1785
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,260
Get her done

1786
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,260
I am Justin McElroy, wear the blue collar

1787
01:04:36,260 --> 01:04:38,260
This has been my brother, my brother and me

1788
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:40,260
Kiss your dad's square on the lips

1789
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:52,260
Music
