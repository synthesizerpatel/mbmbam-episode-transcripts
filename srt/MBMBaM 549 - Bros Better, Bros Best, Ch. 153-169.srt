1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Here come the McElroys. We've got jokes and bits. We're gonna give advice and do funny

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
sips. Laughter, it is in store. Come inside and see. It's time to start. It's my brother,

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
my brother and me.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yahoo answer once responded, flowers are plant genitalia. Secret exposed. Secret revealed.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Farmers probably know some shit though. They probably know some fucking Earth wisdom. Well,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
not these days. These days farmers just flip the switch on the machine that yanks the milk

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
out of the cow's tits. Do you think that farmers still know how high the sycamore grows? I

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
don't think, no. Why does the grinning bobcat grin? They don't care about why the bag of

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the bobcat grins. They just want to shower him in chemicals. You know, can you paint

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
with all the colors of the mountain? Listen, Douglas, I think your farm is great. I do

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
think that if you did not have that giant sycamore in the middle of it, just to see

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
how tall it'll grow. What if I cut it down? I'll never know. You won't live to see it.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No one will. My children's children will. Their children's children are going to turn

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
it into magazines. Man, that bobcat sure seems to like it though. That bobcat seems pleased

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
his punch. How did he do that? I don't know. He's just that way. That's just how he is.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Call him Henry. Everything is shale colored. Yeah, dog, it's mountain colors, idiot. Paint

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it with the colors of the mountain. That's what I do. Apparently, sunflowers fucking

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
rotate to follow the sun across the sky. Yeah. It's called heliotropism. Didn't know this.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just learned about heliotropism from Yahoo Answers. Is it real? I don't want you to learn

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
from Yahoo Answers ever. Griffin, you just yearn. This is the singularity. Everybody

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
else. I don't want to learn anything from Yahoo Answers either, but if it happens, then

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm willing to accept it because I love knowledge and I love drinking it up, and apparently

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
heliotropism is the thing. Apparently, Wikipedia is telling me all about waggle dances now.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going down a fucking rabbit hole right now. Griffin to knowledge is like a sunflower

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
to the sun. Griffin just tilts his genitalia. I tilt my plant genitalia towards it. One

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
of the Yahoo Answers responded, carrots. Indeed revealed. I bet you guys cows know some shit,

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
but mostly farmers know some shit about Earth and the way things work that they're not telling

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
us. About good dirt and bad dirt. I bet that's something they know a lot about. You know

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
what's funny is they know a lot about farming, but they've never seen a tall building or

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
a car. Yeah, right. They would be horrified. It would be very scary, but I bet they know

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
all about what happened in Benghazi. I bet they know the truth about Benghazi. If you

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
want to fucking suss that out, put a farmer on the stand. There's two things farmers know

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,000
about, like agricultural shit and foreign affairs. Benghazi specifically. I've been

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
trying to get into gardening. Sydney and I have been trying to plan some stuff. Speaking

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
of secrets that farmers know, one of those secrets that I don't know that I'm betting

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
farmers do is basically not knowing what plants will emerge from the ground and which I will

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
have to retrieve from there. I literally had to ask Sydney about basically every plant.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Like, will the pepper be in the ground or will it be above the ground? And I bet that's

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
a secret that farmers have on a lot, pretty much. Yeah, I bet that that's pretty important

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to just their general survival and their fiscal stability is just knowing sort of like where

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
the carrots are at any given time. I can never remember. Ah, shit, I did it wrong again.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I dug up the plant. Is it a carrot tree? Fuck. I can't remember. I did it bad. I am the

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
worst farmer. I don't know any of the secrets of Mother Earth's beautiful womb that I grow

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
my carrot children inside. I should never cut down that sickle. One of my neighbor farmers

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
told me that if you feed a cow rocks, then he'll poop out whole watermelons that you

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
can sell at the country fair, but they just killed them. They died. They're tricky farmers.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's the secret about farm wisdom is they're either telling you something that will enrich

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
your life, like heliotropism and bee dances, or they'll give you a little riddle. They'll

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
play a trick on you. They're like bridge trolls. They're actually descended from bridge

50
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
trolls. They are. All farmers are descended from bridge trolls. They only speak in riddles.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There's another secret for you. You know that poem, God Made a Farmer? It's not true. God

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
made a bridge troll, and then they just sort of naturally fell into another vacation. They

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
defied his teachings and they left the bridges. And so they were cast out of Eden. That's

54
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Genesis 1-1, baby. Read a book. Read a book. For once. Specifically the Bible. Specifically

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
our new version of the Bible. The Bradley's Grimm presents the Bible.

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is it appropriate to leave a small party? Six people. When someone puts on Gangnam Style

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and asks everyone to start dancing. That's from Unsure in Oklahoma. Oh, this is the shittiest

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
oops, you're in the shittiest party. I would actually argue that six people does not constitute

59
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
a small party. Well, it's not a party until Gangnam Style comes on and then uh oh, it

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
is it is a small party in the Dungeons and Dragons sense, but not but not in the typical

61
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
social sense. Here's here's okay. The verbiage in this question that really throws me off

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
is that if you had asked, is it appropriate to leave a small party when someone puts on

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Gangnam Style and everyone starts dancing? Yeah, if you leave that, if you leave that,

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
then you're a stick in the mud. But if you when someone puts on Gangnam Style and asks

65
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
at attention, please attention, please all rise to our feet. I'm going to teach everyone

66
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,000
the dance. I learned it from YouTube. Move your legs from side to side as if you were

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:43,000
straddling an invisible pony. Dance you beautiful bastards. This we are golden gods there. The

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
fun thing about this question is that this person has already lived this scenario and

69
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
one of two things happened. Either they they feel bad because someone said everyone start

70
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
dancing to Gangnam Style and they said I'm leaving and then they walked out the door

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and never look back or they did do it and they dance and they're wondering was there

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
another way? Now, I think it was the former and I think the next day the host of the party

73
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
this this psychopath who dictates when the dancing occurs. She came up to them is like,

74
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
hey, what the fuck man? Like we were having a great time last night. That was inappropriate

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Dave. You left and then there were only five people and that definitely doesn't count as

76
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a party anymore. You ruined my birthday. What if the host of the party was Psy? Oh, that

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
is egomaniacal. He put on his own song and said, please. It's all I have. I don't think

78
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
there is an organism on Earth that is more sick of that song than than Dr. Psy. I have

79
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
to assume nobody likes his ballads. You know what I mean? Nobody likes his likes his tender

80
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
lovemaking stuff. Everybody will try to get into gentlemen, but they're not feeling it.

81
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
People. Yeah, people. People listen to gentlemen out of fucking courtesy. You know what I mean?

82
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But the hook, the hook, we owe him this one. Yeah, he's given us so much and we in turn

83
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
have also given him quite a bit, but the hook on that one does not bring me back. It's sort

84
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
of like, it's sort of like how people continue to listen to if it makes you happy by Sheryl

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Crow because they, they really appreciated all I want to do so much and it was like they,

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
they did all they could do for all I want to do. They bought the single, they bought

87
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the album, and then when that next album came out with it makes you happy, they thought,

88
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
well, you know what? I still owe her. I am still in debt to her for all the fun that

89
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
that first song brought me. Right. Yeah, it's exactly like that. There's so many similarities

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
between science, Sheryl Crow that I feel like a lot of people just like goes right over

91
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the head. Have you ever seen them in the same room together? I have not. No, I have not.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Could it be a Phoenix rebirth? You think Sheryl Crow fucking die? No, I'm saying that Sheryl

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Crow met with like her advisors and she said, I need a new persona and they said, she went

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:01,000
to Phoenix online university, took some classes in Korean. She took a minor in hammer dancing.

95
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Did you guys see that mashup? Oh, that went down good. When the two of them performed

96
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that together, take a chance. How can I get my dad to be cool? He's a really shy, nerdy

97
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
guy. He's like 50 so can he really change? My mom walks all over him and it makes me

98
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
see that my father is not a real man. Yes, he's a responsible man and a kind man, but

99
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
not a real man. I want to teach him how to be cool and not so uptight. He needs to start

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
hitting the gym, going out to socialize and maybe pick up a fun hobby like pool hustling

101
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
or joining a motorcycle gang. Oh my God, 50, any too late to just fucking switch it and

102
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
change it. We're talking about a dad's all that, right? I can't take those glasses off.

103
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh shit. Your stigmatism. I forgot. Hey dad, get off that riding lawn mower. Can't buy

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
me dad. Come on. Let me clean you right up. Oh my goodness. Hey, dad of the year. Was

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
that the Rick Moranis movie? What was the Rick Moranis movie? That was Honey, I Shrunk

106
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:13,000
the Kid. Honey, I Shrunk My Swag. Honey, I Blew Up My Swag. How can you get your 50 year

107
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
old? Well, first of all, you're going to have to have a Frank conversation with him. With

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
your dad, Frank. If your dad's name is Frank, it helps to say like, listen, you have raised

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
me. You're kind and you're responsible. I know my mom's walks all over you, but I respect

110
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
what you've done for me and my family, but fuck you are lame. Manzos. Man, I look at

111
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you and it's just, you're just a pitiful husk of negative manliness. The stork has not been

112
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
kind enough to bless me with a baby from the cabbage patch, but I am 32. Right. So I would,

113
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I can address something for you. Your dad is a hundred percent aware at every waking

114
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:07,000
moment, how uncool he has become. This is not a, a wake up one day and you have those

115
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:17,000
socks with, you have Argyle socks on. This is a slow descent from relevance that started

116
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
like in his late twenties and just kind of got worse. I would bet statistically though

117
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
at some point he was probably cool. That's the thing. He might be still, he might be

118
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in full blown dad denial. He might be in dad Nile. Like he might be like the biggest Niles.

119
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There's not a river in Egypt. I know it's not, it's not, it's not bad at all. He, like

120
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
he might be like a big parrot head and that might be like a mainstay from his youth. And

121
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
he might just think like, I fucking get it. The world is, the world is moving in the wrong

122
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
direction and that direction is away from Jimmy Buffett's relevance. I am still on the

123
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
fucking cutting bleeding edge. Is this going to be a Buffett full episode? Maybe it's his

124
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
birthday. What? Like, do you know what I mean? Like there are those dads out there that are

125
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
like, oh yeah, man, I saw the Eagles three times last year and it fucking changed. Like

126
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
that's, that's not, that is literally only your definition of cool. Even the Eagles don't

127
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
think that that, that, that Steve, the Eagles know, the Eagles are like, here's the thing.

128
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We need to talk about your Eagles consumption. The Eagles said to the Eagles fan, the other

129
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
side of this coin is so much more embarrassing that if you had a dad who suddenly just rolled

130
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
up one day in full on like leather outfit and biker gear and like we ride in the motorcycle

131
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and he was like, Hey kids, let's go check out the concert scene. Like does anybody here

132
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
like Drake? And then he fans out some Drake tickets. Yeah. You're not going to be more

133
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
proud of him. I would actually, that would be, that would be if my dad rode his motorcycle

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
from Ironton, Ohio to Austin, Texas, and then fanned out a fucking fistful of Drake tickets.

135
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't even, I don't know a single Drake song, but I would say yes. And I would hop

136
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
on the back of that Harley and we would go have the best ride in the sunset. Oh, this

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
will be interesting if the call and response works out. Um, this one was sent in by Ira

138
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ray. Are you Ira Ray? Wow. That's gratifying. Uh, it was by Yahoo answers user Sammy who

139
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:52,000
asks, what are some simple mysteries that I can solve? Be serious. My dad said to start,

140
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it's misspelled start, but it's hard to pronounce it, uh, small and build my way up to big

141
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
mysteries like spirits and houses, hauntings, et cetera. I need to know some simple cases.

142
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Please. And thank you. One of the more mannerly Yahoo answers we've got. Yeah. I like that

143
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
play. Don't start with encyclopedia Brown. Those were way hard for me still. I cracked

144
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
one up. I cracked one open recently. I'm 32 now. These should be, and I'm cut to 20 minutes

145
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
later. Well, okay. The first battle of bull run couldn't have been this because the sword

146
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
said on that love those books didn't make me any better at mysteries though. I think

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
your parents have to plan the mysteries for you, right? Cause I don't know how old this

148
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
person is. Um, I hope not too old. Um, you gotta, you gotta get an early start on the

149
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
mystery game. It's like being a gymnast, but it can't start young. What could start as

150
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
a small mystery could like unfurl to be like gang gangland violence, drug trade. Yeah.

151
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Just like, just like, just like a national national treasure. He's trying to, he's trying

152
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
to find the constitution and then it turns into a whole thing. Starts out with him doing

153
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
a tricky Sudoku. And by the end of it, he's just wrapped up in a fucking John Voight,

154
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
shoot him up. That is the problem with, if you've, I mean, if you've ever read anything,

155
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
any mystery, it always starts with what appears to be a simple mystery. I don't think you

156
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
can definitively say this is going to pan out to be very simple because what if it's

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
like, it's like that sweater, you start pulling that yarn and then it's just, well, there's

158
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
our whole case here. Then you have the mystery of the unraveled sweater. Yeah. Your mom is

159
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
super pissed off that her sweater is fucking gone. And she's like, mystery solved. That

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
was simple. Let me look at some clues. Let me just think back. Yeah, that was me. I did

161
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
that. It's a pretty good clue. My memory. When we were, uh, when we were little, little

162
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
kids, uh, I don't think when we were smaller, I don't think Griffin was born yet. And Travis

163
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and I tell the story then cause like, oh, this is okay. This is BGM, uh, before Griffin

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
McElroy, uh, and Travis and I had discovered food coloring. So we, uh, filled every drink.

165
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We could get our hands on with food coloring. And then we decided to see what effect it

166
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
would have on the carpets. And, um, and then our mom came down and I just wanted to tell

167
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
this story cause that seems like a pretty easy mystery for her to solve. So if you could

168
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
set that up for him, just put some food coloring on your mouth and on the couch and then sit

169
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
there and wait. And I think that as his parents, you could, it would be pretty easy. And it

170
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
was also, that was also just like a really good bit for like the family circus fans in

171
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the audience. Like people who don't like all the blue humor we usually do and just want

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
some like Dennis the menace-esque shenanigans. I don't think there's anything wrong with

173
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
being tasteful for a few minutes. I've been pushing to get us to be a little cleaner and

174
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think that was a great start.

175
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I told the story on Twitter today about the, uh, jawbreaker in the theater. You guys know

176
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
that one. I don't think so. Where, uh, we were, uh, seeing a play with dad and he, our

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
dad used to be obsessed with these, um, they were birds egg jawbreakers, birds eggs. Sometimes

178
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I call them psychedelic jawbreakers. Uh, they're, they're the white ones with the colorful

179
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
flecks on them that, that when you eat them enough, those flecks turn into like, they

180
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
become tactile. They became, they become like fucking birds. They become a topographical

181
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
map of, of, of the, it's the worst thing to have in your mouth. I don't know why he was

182
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
as obsessed with them as he was. They're, they're why our daddy has diabetes now, but

183
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
he loved them back in the day. He had a whole, you could get him a cracker barrel. It was

184
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
like his exclusive dealer. And I remember he had an empty shed spread country crock

185
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
container that he kept up, up, up out of our reach. Mac, you're back, huh? Uh, wait till

186
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you see this new shit I got in. I've got the dopest prickliest kush. But anyway, so he

187
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,000
was, he was enjoying some of his prickly kush and he, uh, he laughed and the jawbreaker pops

188
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
out of his mouth and rolls down two aisles. And without missing a beat, he says, Oh, my

189
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
glass eye. And he covers the socket with his hand. And this one, two aisles down, picks

190
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
it up and hands it back to him. He pops it right in his mouth cause he's a dirty creep.

191
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Our dad's a dirty creep. Our dad's a creepy dirty fuck. Just kidding. He's the best dad

192
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
of all time. If you say anything like that about my dad, I'll, I'll take, I'll take your

193
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
skin. Take a chance. Farm wisdom. Get your fork. It's not us pork. Farm wisdom. I would

194
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
like Griffin to read the first one please. Um, here's the first one. I grew up on a race

195
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
horse farm. Oh, the most exciting life. I grew up on a race horse. Welcome to the show.

196
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Paul Bearer, the late Paul Bearer joined us. When a veterinarian castrates a race horse,

197
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
they throw the detached balls up on the roof of the barn for good luck. Pretty gross. Jesse.

198
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Thanks, Jesse. And I fact checked that. That's a hundred percent. That's a hundred percent.

199
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
A hundred percent. Fuck you. There's no, it doesn't horse sperm sell for like hundo

200
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
thousand on. You castrate a race horse if it's having behavioral problems. And then

201
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,000
you, you have like, tell me though, promise me that if you are going to do this for behavioral

202
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
problems, you definitely, definitely bring the horse out of the yard. When you throw

203
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
its balls on the roof. Hey, come see this. What? How did this old wire you get for playing

204
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,000
in my yard? Hey orb, come watch this. See what's funny to eat my pocket. Orb. Come on.

205
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How, how did this fucking witchcraft kiss? I can't imagine there was just a super lazy

206
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
veterinary old timey. You never heard balls on the roof fast in the hoof. I'm imagining

207
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
like an 18th century veterinarian. Like what do I, ah fuck. What do I do with these? They're

208
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
slippery. Maybe in that, maybe in the heat of a passionate horse crime, they, they cut

209
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
off a ball, a horse's balls unwillingly and then had to dispose of the evidence. Chinkle

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
chinkle balls. What do you know? Oh fuck. You gotta, you gotta tie them on the back

211
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
of your truck so that they hang comically as though they're the trucks testicles. It's

212
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
very comical. Is that the implication? I believe so. I'm going to go back when I'm editing

213
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
the podcast and find the minute Mark where Travis said he was going to start adding whiskey

214
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to his beverage and then time it out to now and then we'll know like the porousness of

215
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
his liver. What's the other farm with him? Uh, chickens play dead and fart through their

216
00:20:44,000 --> 00:21:08,000
mouths. It's the best Smith's album. I don't care what anybody says is the best. Hey

217
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
everybody. I hope you're enjoying this bros better bros best. Sorry. It's not a new episode

218
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that Justin and Griffin both lost power for a long time. When I'm recording this, Justin

219
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
still doesn't have power in his house and is staying in a hotel. Everybody is safe.

220
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everybody is warm. It's just been very chaotic for the last week. So I hope you'll bear

221
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
with us and understand and now enjoy the money zone. Online shopping can be daunting. It's

222
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
listen, I'm worried enough doing my grocery shopping online. I still do it because it's

223
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
cool and it's the good thing to do, but it's even scarier buying clothes because I don't

224
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
know what's going to fit on my body. I don't know what's going to look good on my body

225
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,000
and I barely even know what my own style is. That's why I love Stitch Fix. This season

226
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
let Stitch Fix do all the hard work for you. They are going to find clothing hand selected

229

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Stitch Fix for a while now. So if you see me and you're like, huh, Travis's style game

232
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
has really stepped up. It's all thanks to Stitch Fix. I wish I could take credit for

233
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
it, but so much of that is Stitch Fix. And it's not just like, you know, shirts and pants.

234
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000

239
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to be super honest with me? Do you like your sheets? Do you love them? Or have you just

240
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
been sleeping on them so long and you don't think about them anymore? Because I'm willing

241
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
to bet that when you really stop to think about it, you maybe don't even love your sheets

242
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
as much as you could. And that's because you don't have Brooklinen. See, Brooklinen are

243
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
amazing sheets that I love. And so I know you'll love because Brooklinen was founded

244
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000

247
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
is so much more than sheets. They've got comforters, pillows, towels, even loungewear and more.

248
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Listen, I love their sheets very much. That's absolutely true. But my life changed when

249
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I got Brooklinen towels. It's all I use now. Highly recommend. Love them. The sheets are

250

Hey, kid. Your dad tell you about the time he broke Stephen Dorff's nose at the Kids

274
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Choice Awards. In Dead Pilot Society, scripts that were developed by studios and networks

275
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
but were never produced are given the table reads they deserve. When I was a kid, I had

276
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,000
to spend my Christmas break filming a PSA about angel dust. So yeah, being a kid sucks

277
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,000
sometimes. Presented by Andrew Reich and Ben Blacker. Dead Pilot Society, twice a month

278
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
on MaximumFun.org. You know, the show you like, that hobo with the scarf who lives in

a magic dumpster. Dr. Who.

280
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm sorry if this is too weird. Do you smell a person while hugging? Be true.

281
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
He adds, definitely yes. It gives you a kind of an idea of what kind of a person he or she is.

282
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Does it? I'm trying to think if I've ever like, intentionally... Yeah, because that's

283
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
the thing. Do you mean like, oh, I hug someone and, you know, like, I'm breathing. Yeah,

284
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
that's the thing. Or do you mean like, I hug someone and go... It's like when you scope

285
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,000
it out, when you scope out a situation. You see it with your eyes. Like, the neurons are

286
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
already in your brain once you perceive the thing. The neurons are going to go where they

287
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
want to go. They're going to fire off the synapses that they want to fire off and then

288
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
all of a sudden you know if that person's attractive or not. When you hug someone, you

289
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
have smell particles going in your nose that are firing off those... Your eyes can be deceived,

290
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Griffin. Right, that's true. But smell particles can't lie. I actually have... I think that

291
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
my usual MO is to... Like, I'll do a regular inhale, like, as I'm going in for the hug,

292
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
just breathing. Oh, man. But then if I like, sort of, I like... Oh, you'll go in for

293
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
secondsies. I'll go... You'll take a second... Hey, do you mind if I take a second scoop?

294
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Just real quick. Let me just get a second scoop real quick. Is this one per customer

295
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
or can I have two? How much for an extra shot? I feel like if you get an extra whiff in,

296
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
though, you definitely do have to comment. Oh, man, definitely. You just have to say

297
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
like, okay, can I hug the other shoulder now and then go to the right? Yeah, like the French

298
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
do it. The French do it. Double hugs. This is a serious, serious problem for men of my

299
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:18,000
kind, cynacistic, who have my particular almost constant set of maladies relating to my nose

300
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,000
zone. Which is to say, it's some kind of... It's either hay fever season or mold season

301
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
or some kind of season constantly here in Austin, so I'm constantly sniffling. And if

302
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm hugging someone, I mean, every 10 seconds I have to sniff. And like, if they land in

303
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
that period, it is going to seem like I'm like, oh, hey, bring it in. Yeah, I haven't

304
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:49,000
seen you in a while. I love it. What? No, it's just... Yeah, I'm sick. Well, then why

305
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
don't I just embrace it and be like, you smell great. Just say you smell great. Everybody

306
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
wants to hear that. You brighten somebody's day. They don't think it's weird. Or you've

307
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
been working out. A compliment. It's a great compliment when not said right after sniffing

308
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:07,000
someone. Because when somebody's fit, the scent that they produce is way, way, way better

309
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
when they've just... Oh, no, I'm in the day of working out immediately prior to the hug.

310
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Oh, God. So they smell like Jim Funk. Also, have you guys met my friend Jim Funk? I want

311
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
to ask you guys... This is related, and it's something that's been on my mind for a few

312
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
days. I was watching something on TV. I don't know. But you see it all the time. And two

313
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
people were meeting... The TV show? Yeah, a television program. A few people were meeting,

314
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and when they were greeting each other, the guy goes in and kisses the woman's cheek as

315
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
like a greeting, right? And you see this happen... Was it his wife or his mom? No. Okay. But

316
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
you see people doing it. I mean, it happens. People do it. I don't know... I mean, grownups

317
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,000
are always doing this, and I see it on television and sometimes in real life, and I don't know

318
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:07,000
how you would even begin to add that layer to your social repertoire. Yeah, because I

319
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
honestly... I've tried it. Like, I've done a couple of, you know, just preliminary tries

320
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
of the cheek kiss greeting. Just to kind of take it for a spin and see how it goes. I

321
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
got to hear about your dry runs. I don't want to weird you out, but do you want to

322
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,000
experiment with me? I want to try something out. Okay, so you know that awkward moment

323
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
when someone goes for a hug and you go for a handshake? Yeah. It's like that times like

324
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
eight. Just eight? That seems so conservative. Griffin, I've done a lot of number crunching

325
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
on this. It's eight. The chances that someone's going to fucking headbutt you is pretty high.

326
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The person pulled back and was like, that was eight times weirder than when you go for

327
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
a hug and they go for a handshake. That was exactly 800% weirder. Griffin, I took fucking

328
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
statistics in college and I do, in fact, know what I'm talking about. I've got a survey

329
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,000
size of a thousand. Well, you told us it was two. What? No, I said a couple. That could

330
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,000
be a thousand. How did you... What? Were you... Had you been drinking? Like, what? I don't

331
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
know what... Yeah, I can't even imagine making this decision. That's a horrible experiment.

332
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I did it in laboratory conditions. Did you do one dude, one lady? Just to see how it

333
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
felt like... I did 500 dudes and 500 dudes. And it was mostly for college credit because

334
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I can't afford to pay that many people. Sure. Your fucking mouth would have been busted

335
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,000
after a thousand smooches. I had a robot. Okay. I didn't do it myself. Right. Pretend

336
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
this robot is a loved one you haven't seen in a long time. Your acquaintances, but not

337
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
lovers. Okay. Now the scene is set. How many times worse was that? Enter the smooching

338
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
chamber. The background is set. Enter the smoochitorium. Well, you don't want to skew

339
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
the results, so I had to tell them they were there for a sleep study. Something is going

340
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
to happen in this room with this stranger robot that's going to make you uncomfortable.

341
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Have fun. Science. Get your college credit on the way out. It's important that they don't

342
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
know that the robot is part of the experiment, though. Or else it'll ruin the truth of the

343
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:25,000
experiment. Farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Get your cow into a suit. Farm wisdom. Oh, what

344
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
if you put your cow in a person suit? Yeah, I'm a humie. I'm a skin. I'm a flesh-o. What

345
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,000
would they be called? Humies? Humies, maybe, I guess. I'm a humie. Cows are proven to

346
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
have, oh no, you know what, Travis, you should read farm wisdom. That's your thing, I think.

347
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Cows are proven to have best friends. If they are separated from each other, they get stressed

348
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,000
and their milk yields suffer. That's from Victoria. I don't know why, but I find that

349
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
fucking, like, heartwarming. Oh, it's amazing. I actually watched, there's this documentary

350
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
on Netflix about, I think it's called Animal Odd Couples, and it's about, like, this dog

351
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and this cheetah are best pals, and they interview zookeepers. They're like, yeah, I don't know

352
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
what fucking happened. This dog and cheetah just started hanging out together. But you

353
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
knew that they just put them in a cage, like, let's see what'll happen. You know, they went

354
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
through, like, 14 dogs and six cheetahs before they found the right mix. Griffin, I cannot

355
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
imagine how bad of a day you have to have before you decide that you deserve Animal

356
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Odd Couples. We watched a very bleak marathon of Homeland, and I was like, we gotta fucking

357
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
boost these spirits. Let's watch a monkey on a dog. Travis, any other farm wisdom this

358
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
week? Yeah, I want Griffin to read the second one. This one is sent in by Laura, thank you.

359
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
She says, if you want to get rid of a groundhog, pee in its hole. It will move to a better

360
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
neighborhood. Oh, the property values around here have just plummeted ever since Jeff P.

361
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,000
in our borough. I feel like a Bad Elements moved in ever since Jeff P. in here. Hey,

362
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Jeff, what are you doing? Hey, neighbor. Howdy, neighbor. Hey, neighbor, I'm just gardening.

363
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Yeah, I just put in my last mortgage payment today. We own the- oh, fuck. Oh, Jeff. Just

364
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
repainted the kid's room. We pretty much have- oh, damn it, Jeff. At least the smell's gonna

365
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
go- oh, you ate asparagus- oh, fucking Jeff. You know, honey, earlier today I was telling

366
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Jeff about our groundhog problem- oh, goddammit. Goddammit, Julia. I told you not to tell Jeff

367
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
about our groundhogs. Oh, he's outside already. Son of a bitch. Yeah, I kind of feel like

368
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
that's a catch-all way to get anything to move out of the neighborhood. Like, is there

369
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
an animal that, like, you pee in its burrow and it's like, nice. Nice. Sweet. Probably

370
00:34:50,000 --> 00:35:00,000
prairie dogs, fucking nasty ass rodents. Let's get some piss up in here. Yeah, now the party's

371
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,000
really getting started. We're all freaks. You know rattlesnakes are getting dirty. You

372
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
love it. You guys wanna Yahoo? Please. This Yahoo was sent in by Bobby Mitchell. Thank

373
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
you, Bobby. That's why Yahoo answers user demonica, who asks, do these guys want to

374
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:29,000
steal my horse? It's very complicated, but I'm going to try my best of what's happening.

375
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I got a healthy- sorry, I already fucked up. I got an healthy racehorse. He's four and

376
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
beautiful and calm as anything. He's a dream horse. So, anyway, there's a group of lads

377
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
that keep on pointing my horse out in the field or in the stable. They asked me if he

378
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
was mine today. I was on a hack out with him, and the guys keep their eyes on him. And when

379
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
they noticed I was watching them, they turned the other way. So when I came back to the

380
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
stables, they were outside my stable door and said, oh, he's beautiful, isn't he? But

381
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
there's something suspicious about their behavior, right? They also want some beating it. I also

382
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
noticed- gross- I also noticed when I'm riding in the arena, they watch him in the far distance

383
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
outside the gate. So any idea of why they seem more attached to my horse? Are they flirting?

384
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Other people are also interested in him, but they don't do what they do, so I'm finding

385
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
their actions very suspicious. What should I do?

386
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
She means, are they flirting with her?

387
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Ah, it's hard to tell.

388
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Okay.

389
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
By lads, she may actually mean four other horses. Like, horses are following her horse

390
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,000
around. I'm going to steal this horse. It'll be like, horse taken.

391
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You know, I think that any- I think she might be projecting a little bit. She just loves

392
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:50,000
that horse so much that she assumes everyone else would want to get into this dream horse.

393
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Get into it?

394
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Like, get- you know, like get-

395
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
They just want to take a- you know, they want to get inside, like sit in the passenger seat.

396
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Right, right, right. Get into its whole scenario. They think, hey, like you could, you know,

397
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
really get into it.

398
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Like that scene in Ace Ventura when nature calls and he's inside the rhino.

399
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
God, if we could go one episode-

400
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
No, I don't mean like literally into. I mean like, like when you go to the car dealership,

401
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
it's like, I can get you into a new sedan.

402
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
What's it going to take to put you inside this horse?

403
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
You know, I don't think a horse can have a sidecar, Justin, if that's what you're-

404
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
if that's what you're suggesting.

405
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Does AC come standard on this horse?

406
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Is this a standard or automatic horse? I see.

407
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Can you even steal a horse? Like-

408
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
If you can, the worst thing you can do is sit there and go, that's a beautiful horse.

409
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
No, you know what?

410
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's a lovely horse.

411
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What kind of oats? Does he eat any kind of special oats?

412
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Do you lock the barn or how would I steal him just hypothetically?

413
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The problem with the idea of stealing a horse is because it implies that you can own a horse

414
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
and as we all know-

415
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Not possible.

416
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Nobody can own a horse. They are like freedom incarnate.

417
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You can-

418
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Can you steal a dream? Can you steal a hope?

419
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
You can-

420
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Can you steal wishes?

421
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
At best, you can form a partnership, a voluntary partnership with a horse.

422
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
At best.

423
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
But there is no title involved in the process.

424
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And if anything, it's a tenuous agreement.

425
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Can you steal a sunset?

426
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Can you?

427
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
How about a yahoo?

428
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
This yahoo is sent in by Andy Hill. Thank you Andy.

429
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
It's about yahoo answer user John. It's gonna get gross.

430
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Here it goes. John asks,

431
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Detailed, how to kiss please?

432
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Some girls like making out with me and some say I use too much teeth.

433
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Help me out here guys. How should you kiss?

434
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You shouldn't use your teeth.

435
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Teeth is a bad-

436
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well sometimes you can, you know, if it's getting all-

437
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Of the enunciators, I would say that teeth are the least important in the equation

438
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
and lips and tip of the tongue are probably much-

439
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Yeah, I don't think he's worried about hitting his hard consonants while he's mouth deep.

440
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Help with my plosives.

441
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Guys, I actually just got a letter from my lawyer.

442
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
He says that it would be actually too weird for me to continue to participate in this particular conversation.

443
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I actually just got a letter from my copyright lawyer who said that if I give away my secrets, I will be infringing on my patents.

444
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Okay, then let's go off the record here.

445
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Let me turn the chair around and that officially means we're off the record.

446
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Okay, just to be clear, any kissing secrets I give away here cannot be used professionally.

447
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Do not tweet them. Do not quote us in your local periodicals.

448
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
But we are about to drop some science on you.

449
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Girls love it when you just run your teeth into their teeth.

450
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
If there's not a loud click-

451
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I did that a lot in high school and the girls would be like,

452
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Ow, what the fuck?

453
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
And I'd be like, what's wrong? Don't you know? That's how it's good.

454
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's what's good. That's good now.

455
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Girls also like it when you sword fight with your tongues.

456
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
When you really get in there and Greco Roman wrestle with that shit.

457
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
If you make a mistake and you seem to set them off right, set them off wrong rather,

458
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,000
you need to pretend that it's the way they do it in whatever the next level of education for you is.

459
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
So if you're in middle school and your teeth click and they say,

460
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Oh, I hate that. You say, well, that's-

461
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
This is what they do at the adult learning annex.

462
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is how they do it in my doctorate program.

463
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
So I don't know. You just need to maybe get a little more mature.

464
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
If you do make a mistake, though, the best way to do it is to just lean in real close to their ear and just go,

465
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Uh oh, cheerios.

466
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yeah, that's going to really ignite that.

467
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I think it's really going to set this situation ablaze.

468
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
The trick is to be thorough.

469
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Just get your whole mouth in their mouth and just sort of scout around like a surgeon fish.

470
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
My number one kissing rule is kiss every tooth.

471
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Kiss every tooth one by one. Let me see that.

472
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Wait, you got a little more?

473
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And then, and if that starts to get stale, just start going around the face.

474
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
You know, go for the eyes, you know, the nose.

475
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
No holds barred.

476
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Use your nose.

477
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Put your fucking eyelash on their tongue and like just give them some of that for a bit.

478
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Put your nose, put your nose in their ear.

479
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Yeah, just act like you're a puppy looking for some straight pizza sauce after pizza night.

480
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,000
After pizza, after pizza Thursdays.

481
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Don't explore their mouth after pizza Thursdays though.

482
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
No.

483
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And you know what else girls love?

484
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Women and gentlemen enjoy that before you do anything, you ask, and I mean constantly,

485
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Is it okay if I kiss your eyeball?

486
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
May I kiss your nose?

487
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
You can kiss them.

488
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I'm going to look behind your ear for pizza sauce.

489
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Yeah, or just if you're doing the mouth too, just give them like a,

490
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Can I kiss your mouth?

491
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Can I kiss your mouth?

492
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Can I kiss your mouth again?

493
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I really like it.

494
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
And keep growing in intensity every time you ask.

495
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Can I kiss your mouth?

496
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
How about that mouth?

497
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Can I kiss it?

498
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Can I, please?

499
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Can I ask,

500
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Give me that mouth!

501
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:25,000
How are we going to alert our listeners that it is now safe to walk across the room and pick up the headphones that they have surely by now cast, cast from the,

502
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I've got like at least three more minutes of snitching tips.

503
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Somewhere there's some dude with a notepad going, ask before you do anything.

504
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
This is good.

505
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
This is good stuff.

506
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Pizza Thursdays.

507
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Okay.

508
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
This is all good.

509
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This Yahoo was sent in by Wayne Rowan.

510
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Thank you, Wayne.

511
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's by Yahoo answers user Sophie who asks,

512
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Do horses have any emotions that humans don't have?

513
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I am actually doing a horse behavior presentation for an equine class I'm in,

514
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
but I was wondering if horses had exactly the same emotions that we humans do.

515
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Humans is in parentheses as if like you didn't fucking know.

516
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
As we humans do.

517
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I went on a website that told me the types of behavior that horses have.

518
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Buckle your asses in.

519
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Can I make one quick point before you tell me the behavior that things that horses have?

520
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I want to see if you did something valuable from this before your presentation.

521
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I definitely, definitely can't wait to see this line on the bibliography.

522
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I can't wait to see how you cite the information you received from Yahoo answers.

523
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Acceptance.

524
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's fair.

525
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
If you're professionally being written, right?

526
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Well, it's not ideal, but I don't have a problem.

527
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I love oats and apples.

528
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Affection.

529
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sure.

530
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Sure.

531
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
This is my favorite.

532
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Anger one and anger two.

533
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Anger one is like a quiet, reserved anger and anger two is like an explosion of biting.

534
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

535
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
It's just spurs.

536
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
That's the only thing that if they see spurs like,

537
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I am angry one.

538
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Breaking out the dose today.

539
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Annoyance.

540
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It doesn't apathy.

541
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Fine.

542
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I accepted too much oats.

543
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
I guess another ride.

544
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Sure.

545
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Perfect.

546
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Whatever.

547
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Jumps tricks.

548
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
It's all the same.

549
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Be beautifully.

550
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Sorry.

551
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
They made like an earthbound dragon.

552
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Sure.

553
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Why not?

554
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Anxiety.

555
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
What if I ran out of oats?

556
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What would happen?

557
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Boredom.

558
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Well, what?

559
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Okay.

560
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I can't blame them too much for that.

561
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Right.

562
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's like they can't even watch Game of Thrones.

563
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They don't get HBO.

564
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Could you turn the TV towards the window, please?

565
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Right.

566
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Towards the window.

567
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I got a big day today.

568
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm either going to stand in grass or run in a loop.

569
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I can't wait to see what fate has in store.

570
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Well, I mean, that's okay.

571
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Tame horses, yes.

572
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I could see them falling prey to boredom.

573
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Wild horses?

574
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

575
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

576
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Boredom for a wild horse?

577
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
It can't happen.

578
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Wild horses aren't familiar with this emotion because they can just go jump over a brook

579
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
they've never jumped over before.

580
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I have to imagine that for a wild horse, it's mainly about anxiety because they're very fast.

581
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And I can see a situation where you're in a conversation deep with another horse friend

582
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
and then all of a sudden you look at them and you think, hey, Rodrigo, have you seen

583
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
any grass for a while?

584
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And then Rodrigo's like, oh my God, you're right.

585
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
There's no grass.

586
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And they're in the middle of a parking lot.

587
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
They're in a parking lot.

588
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Oh, great.

589
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
This is going to be on the news.

590
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Was no one paying attention?

591
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Who was following who?

592
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm feeling annoyance right now, which could be upgraded to anger one if something doesn't

593
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
change.

594
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
If you keep running your fucking mouth, Rodrigo, it's going to get upgraded to anger two and

595
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
you don't want to see that.

596
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Dude, just relax.

597
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Let me figure this out.

598
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Compassion.

599
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
It's got a fat rider.

600
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It's too bad.

601
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Did you see Lucy?

602
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Lucy's got a fat rider.

603
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
I know.

604
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Poor thing.

605
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Poor deer.

606
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
If you are a being that is mainly bred to be ridden and you can still work up compassion

607
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
for anything else, God bless you.

608
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That is a beautiful, beautiful reserve of goodwill.

609
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Well, they feel bad for the burros.

610
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Sure.

611
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Sure, they do.

612
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
For the burros.

613
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yeah.

614
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
No, roll the R's because it's not authentic if you don't.

615
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
For the burros.

616
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Thank you.

617
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I don't know what animal you're talking about if you don't roll the R.

618
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Contentment.

619
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Very few horses, I imagine, feel this.

620
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Orb definitely feel...

621
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Orb appreciates the fact that he has reached the physical fucking apex of possibly any

622
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
creature on the planet.

623
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
He probably...

624
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I think it's just anxiety, right?

625
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Even if you win the Kentucky Derby, it's like, well, am I going to get the Triple Crown?

626
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That's what everybody starts asking.

627
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
That's a lot of pressure.

628
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Am I going to be able to fucking keep up this perfect body until the Preakness?

629
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
They're going to shower me in oats after this fucking thing.

630
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
What if I can't perform my stud duties?

631
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Right.

632
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh, man.

633
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Pressure.

634
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Curiosity.

635
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Doubtful.

636
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Based on what?

637
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Why is that doubtful?

638
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
What are they curious about?

639
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
They have everything they need hand delivered to them.

640
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I wonder what driving a car is like.

641
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Right.

642
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
If they are curious about it, I refuse to...

643
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
If they're curious about anything, they're certainly not acting on it, because they seem

644
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
to be kind of in a rut as a species.

645
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yeah.

646
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Nobody's ever said curiosity killed the horse, because a horse will see...

647
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
A fucking helicopter could land next to a horse, and a horse would be like, that's not an

648
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
apple.

649
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Is that an apple?

650
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Come back when you're...

651
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We check for a stem.

652
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Nope.

653
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
No stem.

654
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No thanks.

655
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Come back when you're hay.

656
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah.

657
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Come back when you're hay.

658
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Fear.

659
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Sure.

660
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah.

661
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yeah, daily.

662
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If there's a bull snake around, those things are terrified.

663
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Yeah.

664
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Loneliness.

665
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,820
Not if I have anything to say about it.

666
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,820
Physical suffering.

667
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,820
Yes, sure.

668
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,820
100%.

669
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
Absolutely.

670
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:17,820
They are...

671
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,740
Their entire being is suspended in a state of constant suffering.

672
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,760
So, yes.

673
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,000
Think about how Sat...

674
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,080
When horses get the spurs and then they run faster,

675
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,280
they're trying to run away from a danger

676
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,960
that is like physically attached to them.

677
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,780
That's the saddest thing in the world.

678
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,840
Which most humans have,

679
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,360
but do horses have any emotions that humans don't have

680
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,760
or that humans can't relate to?

681
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,840
Thanks.

682
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,760
Prance. The latter?

683
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,800
Yes. What?

684
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,060
Prancing.

685
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,040
Prancing is my- Okay.

686
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,080
Yeah. I've never felt prancing.

687
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,840
I don't think that's beyond human,

688
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,840
it's beyond you, yes,

689
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,800
just because of like your physique, no offense.

690
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,840
Wouldn't you think, though,

691
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,120
that if the horses did have an emotion

692
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,200
that we don't have in humankind,

693
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,040
then we probably don't have a human word for it, right?

694
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,840
Right. It's sort of like,

695
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,280
it's kind of like the flavor umami.

696
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,120
Sure.

697
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,760
It's an indescribable thing.

698
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,320
It's like if there were any new colors that we didn't know,

699
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,760
we would know about it.

700
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,360
You know what I mean?

701
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,200
Chicken chance.

702
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,520
You know, I lose stuff a lot

703
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,040
so I have a tendency to like absentmindedly sit stuff down

704
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,680
and then just keep going.

705
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,400
And it's like, I know that I've sat my keys down

706
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,000
at some point, but I can't picture where.

707
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,480
And what I do, and it's not exactly like a very proud moment,

708
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,120
but I'll just loudly announce,

709
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,960
like I'm setting my keys on the dresser

710
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,520
and make it active.

711
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,840
It's pretty dorky, but it works

712
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,520
and I don't lose shit anymore.

713
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,480
Do you ever sing a little song?

714
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,840
Dresser keys, dresser keys.

715
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,040
Will you be there when I need?

716
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,320
Putting my wallet on the toilet paper dispenser

717
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,920
in the bathroom.

718
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,720
Gotta do it, gotta do it.

719
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,680
What if there's pee on the floor?

720
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,280
It's okay if it gets on my pants.

721
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,360
I'm just wearing these for one day.

722
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,800
But who am I, mister buy a new wallet every week

723
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,840
when I get pee on it guy?

724
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,680
No.

725
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,600
Toilet paper wallet.

726
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,720
You're my best friend and I love you.

727
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,640
You know, people say Widow Yankovic has lost his step.

728
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,680
But I think his tunes are as fresh as they were

729
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,440
in the 80s.

730
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,280
Take a chance.

731
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,160
Can a 27 year old sign up for high school again?

732
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,720
I want to see if I can go back to high school.

733
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
I have a car and bigger muscles now.

734
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,120
So I think I'll be more popular the second time around.

735
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,400
And I've always wanted to be prom king.

736
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,360
So what do I need to go back to high school?

737
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,200
Oh God.

738
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,400
Bust marketing for 21 Jump Street.

739
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,760
I'm getting my masters in high school.

740
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,880
I'm getting my post grad in high school.

741
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,360
What you need is a teaching certificate.

742
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,200
And then you can go back as a teacher.

743
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,040
I guess that's true.

744
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,880
Yeah.

745
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,880
That's the only way you can go like that

746
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,360
and then beat up all the people who are mean to you,

747
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,200
I guess.

748
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,880
There's no loophole where you can like,

749
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,520
I recognize now at the age of 26 when I finished,

750
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,480
unless I go back for some master's program,

751
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,840
which doesn't seem likely,

752
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,480
I've done all the school I'm going to do.

753
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,440
And it's only now that I realized,

754
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,200
man, I actually like learning.

755
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,240
Fuck, I wish I'd paid attention to anything.

756
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,440
I feel that way too.

757
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,000
Now that I'm older,

758
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,560
I'm reading books to teach myself.

759
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,520
I'm trying to teach myself complex subjects

760
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,880
that are impossible to teach yourself.

761
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,560
And I'm like, man, if only I had fucking done anything,

762
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,040
like any amount of work instead of just like the

763
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,840
requisite shit to get by.

764
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,600
I think college should be something

765
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,880
you get to do in installments.

766
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,960
Cause that way you really appreciate it.

767
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,200
Cause as you get older, you want to learn.

768
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,360
I like learning now.

769
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,400
Back then I hated waking up more.

770
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,960
I think that after like,

771
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,520
when you complete your sophomore year,

772
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,840
someone should sit you down and be like,

773
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,240
are you appreciating this?

774
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,280
And you're like, yeah, I'm not.

775
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,120
I'm probably not.

776
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,240
I'm like, okay, great, cool, cool, cool.

777
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:12,600
Just go off for a while.

778
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,760
And when you do appreciate this,

779
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,560
we'll welcome you back.

780
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,720
But Travis, you can't put that gene like that.

781
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,000
If there's a definition of what adulthood is,

782
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,840
it's realizing that you didn't appreciate stuff enough.

783
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,680
Yeah.

784
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,840
Cause if you could figure out how to turn back time

785
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,720
and do that easy stuff again,

786
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,200
cause like, let's be honest,

787
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,720
going to college for all its ups and downs

788
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,760
is a lot easier than having a job.

789
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,600
Yeah.

790
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,440
So what if,

791
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,080
what if we start giving jobs to 12 year olds

792
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,440
and then you work from 12 to 21

793
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,040
and then you get to go back to school?

794
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,880
What if-

795
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,520
But the only jobs we give them are college professors.

796
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,120
Now hear me out.

797
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,840
Don't do this.

798
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,240
Don't go to a high school like you are,

799
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,560
as you are now as a man.

800
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,320
You won't, you won't be allowed in.

801
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,400
They won't let you in like you are now.

802
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,520
You're old and-

803
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,360
They'll know.

804
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,200
They'll know that you,

805
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,280
that you don't want to do great things there.

806
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,920
So don't even, I wouldn't even try.

807
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,520
They'd probably, seems like a good idea in the brain,

808
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,880
but I'm pretty sure hindsight's going to be 20, 20

809
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,120
on this particular thing that you want to do

810
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,960
that's terrible.

811
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,240
Especially when you're on 20, 20

812
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,720
and they're like, what were you thinking?

813
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,680
And you're like, you know, in hindsight.

814
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,200
This grown man tried to wear a Justin Bieber t-shirt

815
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,560
and go back to high school.

816
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,320
What would you do?

817
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,040
What would you, but fucking what if he went four years

818
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,440
and he made it to senior prom and he was in the running

819
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,800
and then like two days before,

820
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,080
like, I don't know, some kid lost his legs,

821
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,120
that he was also in the running,

822
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,480
lost his legs in some sort of industrial accident.

823
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,760
And this guy's like, fuck!

824
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,480
Like I spent four years for this day.

825
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,440
And this no-

826
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,280
This is the worst day of my life.

827
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,280
And this little leg kid's gonna fucking swoop in

828
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,120
at the last second.

829
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,120
He probably won't be swooping.

830
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,920
Like some sort of legless Tarzan.

831
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,480
Son of a bitch.

832
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:06,320
On the plus side-

833
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,160
Gotta do it again.

834
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,000
Gotta do it again.

835
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,560
31, start all over in a different town.

836
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,360
On the plus side, I'm sick at times tables

837
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,680
and my cursive is off the chart.

838
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,840
It's fucking insane.

839
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,480
How can I legally change my dog's name?

840
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,200
His name is Larry.

841
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,320
I want to change it to Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

842
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:28,600
I'm sorry.

843
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,280
I'm gonna open up a food truck inside my dog.

844
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,560
Or additional details, or hot dog party days.

845
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,600
It's a really good name for a dog.

846
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,080
Why do people keep sticking with one word name for dogs?

847
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,560
What this person doesn't say is that

848
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,000
this is the dog's request.

849
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,760
Hey, Larry feels so unsophisticated, so unironic.

850
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,080
I don't know what channels you need to go through,

851
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,280
but I've written down some suggestions.

852
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,040
It's why we don't teach dogs English,

853
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,560
because they ask for stupid things like this.

854
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,880
Here's what I'm, this is why I brought this question up,

855
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,640
is because it brings up a good point.

856
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,800
I'm learning all about the life of dogs.

857
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,840
We already discussed my revelation about dog periods.

858
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,320
Dogs go through a lot of the same shit that we go through,

859
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,080
but at the same time, if I take my dog,

860
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:23,080
nay Larry, right, previously,

861
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,800
his previous given name was Larry,

862
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,840
and I have decided to change it

863
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,840
to Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

864
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,680
And I take that dog.

865
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,600
The puppy formerly known as Larry.

866
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:34,000
Right, and I take LFPH to the vet,

867
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,240
and they're like, Larry?

868
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,680
And I say, no, it's Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

869
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,680
They're not gonna be like,

870
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,400
uh, says here on his documentation it's Larry, right?

871
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,200
Or do I need to like go to the fucking courthouse,

872
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,640
get a new social security card for my goddamn dog?

873
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,800
I thought it was just like my property.

874
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,840
Like if I call my table Jerry,

875
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,440
then I can change it to Jerry's Fiesta Party on the house,

876
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,280
my table.

877
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,120
I'm gonna throw this out.

878
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,240
There actually is a circumstance

879
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,880
in which you would have to go through some channels

880
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,960
to change your dog's name.

881
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,200
What the fuck?

882
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,560
If it is AKC registered,

883
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,760
if it is registered with the American Kennel Club

884
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,240
as a purebred dog,

885
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:12,960
then you have to register your dog.

886
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,360
If it's a competition dog?

887
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,200
Is that what you're saying?

888
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,680
No, if you breed it, our dog Nessie,

889
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:20,880
Nessie was registered with the AKC as Nessie Bell McElroy.

890
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,400
We would have had to contact them to change her name.

891
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,240
This makes me angry.

892
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,480
I think back to the pioneer days,

893
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,520
horses didn't have no documentation.

894
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,680
You know what I mean?

895
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,320
What about when all the dogs go to heaven,

896
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,800
don't you want St. Pete to have,

897
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,880
what if he doesn't have them?

898
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,720
Then they go to hell.

899
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,200
I don't have a Larry Fiesta Party on the house.

900
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,080
Can I break down actually Larry's Fiesta Party on the house?

901
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,320
On the house is a parenthetical.

902
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,560
I mean, you could just do it.

903
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,160
I mean, Fiesta Party is obviously problematic.

904
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:56,160
Because we're really just saying Larry Party Party.

905
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,760
This is my dog Lawrence Party Party.

906
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,360
Larry's Fiesta Party casual get together.

907
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,800
The dog.

908
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:05,640
The movie.

909
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,000
Did you see that movie?

910
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,480
Oh Christ.

911
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,440
It asks for hot dog party days.

912
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,400
I think we are Larry's Fiesta Parties.

913
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,440
I think we're pretty,

914
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,280
I have my heart set on it.

915
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,960
In any case, the first name is already taken.

916
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:22,800
With the AKC.

917
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,040
We actually already have Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

918
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:27,600
We have a champion Basset Hound

919
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,160
named Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

920
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,480
This fucking, the fucking commentators

921
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,640
at the Kennel Club show,

922
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,000
the annual Kennel Club show,

923
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,840
like ladies and gentlemen,

924
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,080
I know this is gonna get confusing,

925
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,160
but here comes the second Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

926
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,720
Another purebred Basset Hound.

927
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,720
It's a battle of the Larry's Fiesta Party on the house.

928
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,760
Somehow we all knew it would come down to this.

929
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,320
A hush falls over the crowd.

930
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,360
It all comes down to the heat of the genitals.

931
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,680
They both defecate at the same time.

932
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,760
It is perfect.

933
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,600
We may have a multiverse situation.

934
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,240
We may have a multiverse bleed.

935
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,080
It's perfect.

936
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,080
They've made eye contact from across the room.

937
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,360
Travis, you know about dogs and shit.

938
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,280
Is a perfect defecation a category

939
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,600
in the Westminster Kennel Club dog show America?

940
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,080
Only as a tiebreaker.

941
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,240
I've been researching extensively

942
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,240
to try to find some information about making swords.

943
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,840
And I found this page from anvilfire.com.

944
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,880
And they have sword myths slash fiction.

945
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,440
So let me hit you guys with some sword myths.

946
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,840
Yeah, what have I been getting wrong

947
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
about swords this whole time?

948
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,760
Is it actual slash fiction?

949
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,200
Because I feel like that's really appropriate with swords.

950
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,800
Swords myths and sword fiction.

951
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,880
The buster sword from Final Fantasy VII

952
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,960
and a samurai sword, they met one day.

953
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,600
He said, you looking really good, buster sword.

954
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,560
And then they clanged.

955
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:03,720
They clanged and clanged.

956
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:04,840
I'm gonna clang.

957
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,640
I'm gonna clang all over your sheath.

958
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,640
Blood does not make a superior quenchant.

959
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,840
This is an old myth.

960
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,600
Neither virgins or slaves have been used to test swords.

961
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,600
That is a children's story.

962
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,440
What?

963
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,280
Children's story.

964
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,120
That is my favorite children's story.

965
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:23,960
Get around kids.

966
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,600
Help me test the blades.

967
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:26,960
How many y'all fucked?

968
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,200
None of y'all?

969
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,040
Let me tell you.

970
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,200
You'd be good sword fodder.

971
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,280
You cannot chop a machine gun barrel in two

972
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,760
with a Japanese sword.

973
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
Modern myth.

974
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,320
No, I saw that on Mythbusters.

975
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,560
Myth busted.

976
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:44,920
Ancient steels were not superior to modern alloy steels.

977
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:45,760
Yeah, no shit.

978
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:46,800
Another modern myth.

979
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:49,680
It's cause our steels are genetically superior

980
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,000
in every way.

981
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,200
They've been modified and enhanced and chopped and screwed.

982
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,000
Here's where things go weirdly askew.

983
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,080
Atlantis was not in the Atlantic.

984
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:00,280
The story of Atlantis was based on rumors

985
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,400
of the demise of Minoan Island culture

986
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,840
in the Mediterranean by volcanic eruption.

987
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,000
The story was handed down by Egyptians to Plato

988
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,480
who turned the little truth into a myth.

989
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,680
Listen, animal fighter.

990
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,600
I'm not gonna tell you you're straying

991
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,800
from the path of sword myths,

992
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:19,800
but throw the word sword in there somewhere.

993
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,440
Yeah.

994
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,200
They sometimes had swords, somebody in there.

995
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,200
Atomantium is a fictional comic book element

996
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:29,160
without any basis in reality like kryptonite.

997
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,640
It's just another unobtainium.

998
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,320
JFK was not actually assassinated by a sword.

999
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,800
Like yeah, dog, like I know.

1000
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,640
I know that one.

1001
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,280
Swords are not good food.

1002
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,560
Yeah, okay, thank you.

1003
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,880
Clouds are not made of small white swords.

1004
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,000
Like thanks, website.

1005
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,760
Mythril, J-R-R token, is another myth-ical metal.

1006
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,440
Myth is all caps.

1007
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,280
Thank you.

1008
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,400
Last one, you cannot, and this is the one

1009
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,560
that I find very confusing on several levels.

1010
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,200
You cannot cold forge a sword from a leaf spring.

1011
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,560
Modern web myth slash parody.

1012
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:07,040
What's the most hilarious parody on the web?

1013
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,120
There's a guy who cold forges a sword in a leaf spring.

1014
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,720
Everyone gets a real kick out of it.

1015
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,280
I think that's a weird all Yankovic jam.

1016
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,640
Does it say anything on there, Justin,

1017
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:19,120
about whether or not steak knives are just little swords?

1018
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,040
Are cocktail swords real swords?

1019
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:21,960
True or false?

1020
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,000
I feel like we all learned a lot about swords today.

1021
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,840
Sword wisdom, sword wisdom.

1022
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,880
Atomium is not a blade metal.

1023
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,640
It is not intrinsically sharp or hard as recent TV

1024
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,960
commercial for razor blades indicates.

1025
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,440
There's more Hollywood hype and bad science

1026
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,120
written by advertising executives

1027
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,200
that know nothing about metallurgy.

1028
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,520
Big corpos selling out.

1029
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,200
Well, what are you gonna tell me next,

1030
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,720
that adamantium's real?

1031
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,560
Ugh.

1032
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,160
Here we go.

1033
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,000
Last question.

1034
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,320
This one is edited by Charles Decker.

1035
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,240
Thank you, Charles Decker.

1036
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Ive, who asks,

1037
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,120
is Mr. Pringle still alive?

1038
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,440
Why does my son make laser gun noises in the bathroom?

1039
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:07,800
My name is Justin McElroy.

1040
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1041
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1042
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:11,840
This has been my brother, my brother made.

1043
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,680
Kiss your dad.

1044
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,080
Skool.

1045
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,840
Air on the lips.

1046
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:17,840
Okay, that was the show.

1047
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,840
Hope you had some fun.

1048
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,840
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1049
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,840
Go back into the world.

1050
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,880
Face the day ahead.

1051
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:30,160
Please don't tell our grandparents

1052
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,040
all the cuss words we said.
