1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:10,260

16
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:56,340

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,300
Yeah, it's for jacking. But today we're talking about the biggest news of all and it's freaking

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Y'all heard of a little

23
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,780

We know she's got anything left there for you

26
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,180
Statistically speaking most of you have hacked or naughty at least one of you has a I also want to say so I don't get much

27
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,220
tweets about I sound different this week cuz I'm I had a power outage at

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,380
My home and I'm here at my wife's clinic

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,300
Recording the podcast this was like the old days and he's doing a good old

30
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,460
He's doing a little bit of medicine help for people who come I'm doing a couple band-aids and what have you?

31
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,700
Yeah

32
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:03,300
So anyway, big tech news exciting thing this Facebook website that are not keeps getting hacked on because she has so much fucking Bitcoin

33
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,100
Is that it's gonna it's not gonna be a Facebook anymore

34
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,540
And because that's been the problem the problem with Facebook is the name. Yeah

35
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,460
Yeah, I know that there's been a lot of sort of reports about how they have fostered an environment that is good for hate speech

36
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,100
but

37
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,940
But that's all gonna be different now cuz it's not gonna be hate speech Facebook anymore

38
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,940
It's gonna be something even cooler and safer and nicer, you know how Google

39
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Their their company motto is like don't be evil. Yeah, don't do bad

40
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,600
Facebook's is like fuck it. Let's get it wet, right?

41
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,860
Whatever it takes is there is their

42
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah, Facebook's Facebook's motto is a rhetorical question. It's just what are you gonna do?

43
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,280
What the Google change there's the company that owns Google and all the various Google paraphernalia

44
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
including team google.com

45
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,820
Especially team is me. No teen google.com is me

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,800
They changed the alphabet and it'll be tough for Facebook to find something. It sounds as sinister as

47
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,860
Alphabet. Yeah, so what about the Facebook? That's strong

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,480
That's right, because then that's definitive right because it's been so wishy-washy like oh, let's check Facebook

49
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,940
You're like which one right? And if you were just like, oh check the Facebook, right?

50
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,800
No, no, okay. We're not changing the name of Facebook. It's very important here that we're clear about this

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Facebook will continue to operate in its own special way

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,520
okay, that is so good for everybody as Facebook the company that owes Facebook and

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,600
oculus and

54
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,120
Instagram and

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,880
You know probably 35 different ad companies

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,220
Will change its name the parent company. Okay, so then just change it to Facebook senior. Yeah, it's Facebook's dad

57
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,160
Yeah, this Facebook's dad Facebook senior. Mr. Facebook. So that way Facebook can say no, please. Call me Facebook. Mr. Facebook is my father

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,040
Good Facebook would be neat because then it's like you don't have to sweat like the ethics of it

59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,480
It lets you know right there on the tin. Of course, there would have to be some behavioral

60
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,920
Changes there. What am I really it's all branding. What about mr. Zucker's old-time Internet Palace?

61
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,360
Yeah, well, that's got it. Like that's got a real geo cities vibe that I'm into. Yeah

62
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,000
Retro, how about O'Callaghan's authentic Irish pub and Family Fun Center? Oh, I like that kicks ass

63
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,200
Yeah

64
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,140
If you are not gonna think there's anything weird about Facebook if it's suddenly one day

65
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,620
a officially owned by O'Callaghan's our authentic Irish pub and Family Fun Center. Yeah, that's good

66
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,020
They should sell it to Jolly Pirate Donut. Yeah, wait, so

67
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
sell

68
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,940
ownership

69
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:58,300
Sell ownership of Facebook. Yeah, the company to Jolly Pirate Donut and then operate as like Jolly Pirate Donut is

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,720
The company that owns Facebook and Instagram Facebook a Jolly Pirate production

71
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,920
Mm-hmm. You'd be like a lot more down with it. And yeah, I mean it'd be cool to work then get

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,100
Donut like free doughnuts and it would be nice for Nani to know that on the 12th time

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
She got hacked the 13th one is free

74
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,640
A baker's dozen hacks. Uh-huh

75
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,960
I

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
mean

77
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Zucks place could be fun

78
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Zucks place is good

79
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,720
That would be a better name for the plat see I feel like they're gonna find a new name for the company and they're gonna

80
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,080
Be like, well, this is so good. We got to change the website's name to Zucks place a

81
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,160
Place for Zuck to come and hang out and let loose

82
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Maybe fun suckers

83
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,080
Fun suckers fun suckers. Yeah

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
Yeah, man, what's wrong with that

85
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm trying to think of the joke here. There's not a joke

86
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,600
What about Dave and Zuckers while we're at it

87
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
Zucky cheese

88
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,360
Uh-huh. That's okay. These are all so good. We'll use that in oculus will become Zucky cheese

89
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Yeah, Facebook will be fun suckers, of course, and Instagram will be Dave and suckers

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,080
All all of which are subsidiaries of Zucks place

91
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
All which are owned by O'Callaghan's

92
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,040
So you open up Zucks place and it's a it's like an animated gif of a map

93
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,420
Unscrolling and it's like which which of Zucks amazing experiences would you like to dive into today?

94
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like oh, do you want to do you want to hack Clint McElroy's mom?

95
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Good news

96
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,560
It's like a Club Penguin minigame

97
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:05,160
Yeah, that's cool. That's awesome. I want I want all that shit on like let's not just limit it to Facebook and oculus and

98
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,920
Instagram and all that like let's get neopets on there, but they're called

99
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,920
Zucky beasts and there you go and have fun with them

100
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Mother suckers. Yeah

101
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,320
Now you don't what what what would mother suckers be just

102
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,280
the the the neopets thing

103
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Oh cuz they're like a virtual caregiver

104
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,800
Little little mother suckers. Yeah

105
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,160
Hey, can we do a garbage pail kid mark Zuckerberg thing? What would if they bought Facebook?

106
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,460
If Zuck, if O'Callaghan's authentic Irish family fun center bought

107
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,480
Garbage pail kids. Yeah, what would be a fun joke to say about Facebook?

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,520
About like what kind of name could you get Zuck into garbage pail kids?

109
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,600
Oh, you're saying like what's like a dirty joke? I don't have it. I don't have like a joke. Wild!

110
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,600
Then that's a wild joke you just did Justin.

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,200
Yeah, no, I was hoping you guys would have like a funny joke.

112
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
You know sometimes on the show Justin

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,200
One of us does like a bump set spike kind of maneuver and what you did is you set the ball in the middle of the

114
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,960
Floor and said wouldn't it be cool if one of you spiked that? Yeah, someone figure

115
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,280
You throw it in a garbage can across the street

116
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,240
You know like someone figure out how to spike that and get a point like a lady in a toilet and said imagine if I had

117
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,520
Spiked that. Yeah, sure. How cool would that be?

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,720
It's like if there was no ball and you said imagine if there was a ball in the air and you could spike it. Yeah

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,320
This is good times. This is good. This is good. Hey, thank you to Mark Zuckerberg for encouraging us to do that bit

120
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
I'm sorry about everything

121
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:48,400
We'll take your money right now. I don't know why. I'm not sorry. Sorry you fucked up so bad and made things so bad.

122
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
Sorry Griffin. Griffin zucked up. It is legally done.

123
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Sorry you zucked up the entire fabric of our society.

124
00:09:53,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Can we stop for a second? I feel like the zuck sounds like fuck thing is so played. Like I'm sure he's got it later.

125
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Should we go the other way and say like Mark Fuckerberg, right? No guys. These are too obvious for us. We have we have

126
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Mark Mark Duckberg. What if he replaced himself with a cartoon duck named Mark Zuckerberg?

127
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:23,400
And I see his brain inside the duck. Yeah, he's controlling it like alter ego that the new Alanis Morissette show. Uh-huh.

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I feel like he's controlling it and it's an animated duck that he controls named Mark Zuckerberg.

129
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I feel like if they do that, they don't even need to change the name of the company.

130
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
No, that's gonna do a lot of PR work for them. Yeah.

131
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,400
This is an advice show. I don't know if you've gotten that. We have a special guest this week. It's very exciting.

132
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Yeah, it's later though. Don't worry about it. Right now we're going to help you and we'll do other things too.

133
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:54,400
But first the help. I recently started a job that at certain points involves driving a big truck that tows an even bigger trailer.

134
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Badass. Let's take a second to just badass. Badass dude.

135
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
You know when you see a big truck you're like that's a big truck and then you see the even bigger trailer and you're like whoa.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Shit. Real nice. I'm not the biggest fan of this job. Stupid. So I was planning on-

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Wait, hold on. Who's stupid? The question I was gonna ask.

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I just think it's stupid. They don't like that job. It'd be like so cool.

139
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Oh, I see. That's a bold stance.

140
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,400
If you smash that truck into anything, it is donezo. Like that's gotta be empowering.

141
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah. So I was planning on only keeping this job until I found a new one.

142
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Unfortunately, my second week on the job, I was towing the trailer on the interstate and the trailer jackknifed on me.

143
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Fuck. The truck rolled twice and landed upside down.

144
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

145
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Nobody, including myself, was hurt.

146
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Okay. But now I feel like I can't quit because I totaled the truck and the trailer.

147
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Oh man. Accurate.

148
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Brothers, should I stick around a little bit longer or should I just piece the hell out?

149
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
That's from career confusion at Colorado. That's a sticky wicked.

150
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Yeah, hold on, because I feel like I have a different feeling it seems than my brothers do.

151
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Because Justin, it seems that you are of the mindset that it is now difficult to quit after you jackknife and roll the truck and trailer.

152
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,400
I, on the other hand, think that if you quit, your job will be like, oh thank god they quit.

153
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Yeah, at this point your boss would be like, oh yeah, that makes sense.

154
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I actually didn't even know you still worked here after you rolled the truck and trailer on your second week.

155
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,400
You made a big spectacular exploder on day 14 it says here in your file.

156
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
So yeah, it makes sense that you wouldn't want to be this job.

157
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You did what we in the business call a truck whoopsie.

158
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:38,400
And that usually is a fireable offense and we actually just assumed you had quit already.

159
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
What was in the trailer? Was it something funny?

160
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Oh god.

161
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
You know, like bouncy balls or like...

162
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Oh boy. Yeah, this is good. This is good. Where are we going next?

163
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Oh, a bunch of like KY jelly.

164
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Yeah.

165
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:58,400
And it spilled all over and like all the cars started slip sliding around and like porking.

166
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Huh.

167
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Yeah, I think...

168
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
You lost it a little bit.

169
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I think you should, if you don't want to drive the big truck anymore because you crashed it pretty much instantly in the grand scheme of things, I feel like that's okay.

170
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I feel like they aren't going to keep you there and say like, no, you have to stay here and do this because...

171
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
The only problem is that you...

172
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Well, I guess you needed the job for a little bit longer, right?

173
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
You weren't ready to quit then.

174
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Yeah.

175
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
You didn't want to quit because I was going to say like that's the moment.

176
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
You jackknife it.

177
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Nobody's going to judge you for being like, I'm done.

178
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
That's it.

179
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Never again.

180
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
It sucks to drive a car this big on the same road.

181
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
It's too big of a car.

182
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Can I deliver this in a Jetta maybe?

183
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,400
God's mistake, this giant truck, we went too far as a species.

184
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Time to take it back.

185
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Yeah, you should.

186
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:10,400
One time I got a job at Petsmart and on my first day of training, halfway through the training session, I got a call letting me know that I was actually supposed to be somewhere to perform a play that they had not told me.

187
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
And it was like, you know, a thing that they sent out for, you know, like the touring thing.

188
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
The life of an actor.

189
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I know.

190
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,400
So I just like walked out of training and my boss was like, where are you going?

191
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
And I was like, sorry, I just got a call.

192
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
I gotta be somewhere else.

193
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Be back tomorrow.

194
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
And when I came back the next day, they didn't fire me.

195
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,400
So let that and this question be a combined sign to you, the listener.

196
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,400
It's actually a lot harder to get fired from things than you would think.

197
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,400
That's like the end of rent, Trav.

198
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,400
I mean, I guess.

199
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Think about it.

200
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
It's basically what rent's about.

201
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Hey, do you all want to talk to the wizard on the cloud?

202
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Call him up real quick.

203
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Yeah.

204
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
You know what?

205
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
How come he never calls us?

206
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Good point.

207
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Good question.

208
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I mean, because he's the wizard.

209
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
All right.

210
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Let's see what the wizard's got for us today.

211
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
A stinker.

212
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:04,400
You know how it's a cool these days not to be like strong sports type, but like what?

213
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Yeah.

214
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Smart type.

215
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Oh, man.

216
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Well, this is going to help us sort of get there.

217
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Yeah.

218
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
I'm sorry, buddy.

219
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I just didn't know.

220
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Okay.

221
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,800
This one's going to make you very popular with a lot of people because it is how to

222
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,400
live like Socrates.

223
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Oh.

224
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah.

225
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
And here's the thing.

226
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Here's what I'm excited about is that it worked out so good for Socrates.

227
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Yeah.

228
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Everybody loved that guy.

229
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Being Socrates and being like how he is was really great for him.

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Yeah.

231
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Yeah.

232
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,400
So let's I mean, let's hop right into it because I think that some of this stuff is just timeless,

233
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
right?

234
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
So just start by reading some of Plato's dialogues.

235
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Actually, fuck that.

236
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
That's so boring.

237
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Skip that part.

238
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
No.

239
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,400
That's a bad place to start.

240
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
That's a wicked bad place to start.

241
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Where is it?

242
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
What about that?

243
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Couldn't you start with the movie?

244
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Oh, yes.

245
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
The one that Bill and Ted.

246
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
The Keanu Reeves biopic.

247
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Is that right?

248
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
No, no, no.

249
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:06,400
The movie about Socrates with Channing Tatum as Socrates.

250
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Right.

251
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
They made like a biopic.

252
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Magic Socrates.

253
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,400
I think it was called Magic Socrates.

255
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I think it was called Socrates.

256
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I love that at the end of the trailer, when he looks at the camera, loads the sunglasses

257
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,400
and he's like, I guess you could say I'm pretty smart.

258
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
Yeah.

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I like that.

260
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Then he looked down and said nothing platonic about this relationship.

261
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah.

262
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Then he had sex with everybody.

263
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Yeah.

264
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Yeah.

265
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
That was a good flick.

266
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
I wish I knew more about Socrates.

267
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,400
I wish I knew more about Magic Mike.

268
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
So yeah, you got to read Plato's shit.

269
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
I guess Plato was like a big Socrates fan.

270
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I'm going to show my hand here.

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I don't know fuck all about this dude.

272
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Which one?

273
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I thought about tossing him a quick Google.

274
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Sure, my boy.

275
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Quick Google.

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I know that that would throw off the metadata that Google has on me.

277
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Normally, Travis is looking up the voice actors of the show Avatar The Last Airbender and

278
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,400
suddenly he's Googling the teachings of Plato.

279
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Do we need to start worrying about Travis being too smart?

280
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh, no, no, no.

281
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,400
He's back to Googling voice actors of different cartoons.

282
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
We're all good.

283
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Hey, here's the second one.

284
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,400
This is a good tip for like any sort of thing you're trying to do with your life is don't

285
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
change your life immediately.

286
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Do it gradually.

287
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,400
If you do it too fast and you're like, I'm fucking Socrates now, like you're going to

288
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
burn out too fast.

289
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,400
You got to really step into it.

290
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Griffin, is there a heading in there of what to do when you want to be kind of contendered

291
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,400
like the Socrates of say, and this is just the top of my head, but like soccer, so you

292
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,400
can be Socrates and you're like the Socrates, you know, like the Socrates of soccer.

293
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Is there any instructions in there?

294
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Because that's kind of what I've always thought of myself as.

295
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
The Socrates of soccer?

296
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Yeah.

297
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
In that I bet he was also pretty bad at soccer.

298
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Yeah, exactly.

299
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
So just start with these plain simple steps.

300
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Okay.

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Wear simpler clothes.

302
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
That's going to be hard for me.

303
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
Yeah, I don't know about that.

304
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm kind of a peacock.

305
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Sort of a real clothes peacock.

306
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Eat plainer foods.

307
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
That a day I could swing with.

308
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I could hang with that.

309
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah, that's good for advice for anybody.

310
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,400
It'd probably be good for my belly.

311
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
And then do not waste your money on material things.

312
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, I'm fucked.

313
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:25,400
That's it.

314
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm done.

315
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Well, does that include like food?

316
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Spicy foods, maybe.

317
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Foods that are not just very plain.

318
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah, probably.

319
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,400
So next tip is to follow Socratic principles and ideals.

320
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Again, it's a real snooze fest.

321
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Yeah, that feels like a lot of research involved.

322
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Can't you just tell me?

323
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Yeah, I'll sort of give you the CliffsNotes version of it.

324
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
And this is really where the article starts

325
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,400
to maybe show how there are lots of people, especially

326
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
on the internet, who follow Socratic principles and ideals

327
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
and that nobody likes them.

328
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Oh, OK.

329
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Yeah, so just here's how to argue using the Socratic method.

330
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Question everything.

331
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Cool start.

332
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Do not merely take something at face value

333
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
or do something because someone says so,

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
whether it is one person or 100.

335
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Hey, can you stop fucking being a reply guy

336
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
and just like jumping in there whenever anyone says anything

337
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
and being an asshole and saying like, are you sure?

338
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,400
But that's what Socrates does it.

339
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
That's what Socrates does it.

340
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Yeah, I think health care is a human right.

341
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Is it though?

342
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
Thanks, Socrates.

343
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I have to question it.

344
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Like everybody's out here saying it's cool to not die

345
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
because you don't have enough money.

346
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
But is it though?

347
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
It's me, Socrates.

348
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
If you truly wish to live like Socrates,

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,400
then you need to devote yourself entirely to philosophy

350
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
and searching for truth.

351
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Which if you have a-

352
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
That person's great too.

353
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
That person's really cool.

354
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
If you have a WikiHow membership,

355
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
you're already halfway there, baby.

356
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
You're already there.

357
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Can I just say right now, Socrates right now,

358
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
what I've learned basically in the last five minutes,

359
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,400
he seems like the type of person now

360
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
who would say like, I don't watch TV

361
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,400
and I wouldn't really want to talk to that person.

362
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Yeah, I mean, back in the day, I get it, right?

363
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,400
If back in the day they're like, oh man,

364
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,400
we got to kill a hundred of our own people every year

365
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,400
or else the sun will devour us.

366
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,400
And it was probably good for Socrates to step in there

367
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,400
and be like, can I maybe suggest

368
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
that we don't have to sacrifice our people

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
because maybe the sun won't swallow us up?

370
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Yeah, it is like, back then we didn't do anything.

371
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Yeah.

372
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
So yeah, question all of it.

373
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,400
But now it's like, we got it.

374
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
We got it.

375
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
You know what?

376
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I'll take it one step further

377
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
and say back in Socrates' time,

378
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
it was also probably really easy

379
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,400
not to buy material goods or eat spicy foods

380
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
because the stuff they had was bunk.

381
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
But now Socrates is like,

382
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
did you see those fucking sneakers, dude?

383
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
I had to buy them.

384
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
They were really cool.

385
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,400
And I just heard that this new Indian place

386
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
opened up down the street

387
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
and I got to check that shit out.

388
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Make sure where you debate with others is in a public area.

389
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
I think Twitter counts like that.

390
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Man, there's a lot of people out there

391
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
trying to be Socrates.

392
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Never be afraid to voice what you think

393
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
or more importantly, the truth.

394
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Hey, it's cool to complete those two things.

395
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
Socrates sucks.

396
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Yeah, like Socrates,

397
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I feel like those are different ideas.

398
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
The truth is the things that you do.

399
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
No, no, no, no.

400
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
I think it's important to be Socrates

401
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,400
to know 100% whatever you think is right.

402
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Question everything,

403
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,400
unless it's one of your sweet little thought bubbles.

404
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Question everything except your own thoughts and ideas.

405
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Those, solid.

406
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Those, truth, truth.

407
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Hey, here's a universal.

408
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
This is a bad-ass one

409
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,400
and maybe the most attainable one.

410
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
And that is number seven, never fear death.

411
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Cool, cool, cool.

412
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Maybe that's oh.

413
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Let me flip this switch.

414
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Boom.

415
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Maybe that's why Twitter reply guys

416
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
are so cocksure all the time

417
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,400
is because they don't spend an hour of their day

418
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
just thinking about death.

419
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
I have wondered how they get so much done.

420
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
For other shit.

421
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
They don't fear death.

422
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,400
That's daredevil shit.

423
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Socrates was wasting his time

424
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
with all the philosophy and stuff.

425
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,400
He should have been defending the innocent

426
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
in Hell's Kitchen or whatever.

427
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
They didn't have kitchens back then.

428
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
One thing I do know about Socrates

429
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
is he got sentenced to death

430
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
for all of his cool thoughts.

431
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,400
And then the day before he got his just desserts,

432
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,400
he had a bunch of buddies who swung by

433
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
and they're like Socrates,

434
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
we're going to get you out of here, buddy.

435
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
And he was like, nah, they got me.

436
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
And then he drank him off and beat it.

437
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,400
His buddies are like, come on, dude, we got to go.

438
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Your brain is so special and you got to help.

439
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Nah, they got me fair and square guys.

440
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
I ain't scared.

441
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
I ain't scared.

442
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
They did a trial fair and square.

443
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
Yeah, but the trial was like a hundred

444
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
extremely religious people who were like,

445
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
no, he stinks.

446
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,400
They got me.

447
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Bye.

448
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
And also, I think it's a big assumption

449
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
to assume that Socrates wasn't afraid of death

450
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
just because he never wrote down like,

451
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
fucking death has got me shitting myself, dude.

452
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Yeah, maybe he was just so busy

453
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
thinking all of his cool thoughts

454
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
that he just didn't even think to buy.

455
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
And so he guzzled down that sweet hemlock

456
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,400
and then he was like, wait a minute.

457
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,400
This is, this is what death.

458
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Maybe he sucked so bad his friends handed him hemlock

459
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
and were like, hey, this is like a wheatgrass shot.

460
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
And he was like, okay,

461
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
you guys are going to get me out of here.

462
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you got it.

463
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
But take that wheatgrass shot first.

464
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
And then they walked out and like, wait,

465
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I thought you guys were going to go help Socrates.

466
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Oh, we tried.

467
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
We really tried.

468
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
But he said.

469
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Alternatively, his friends were like, dude,

470
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
you cannot beef it.

471
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
That is going to stink.

472
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
And he was like, well, I have to fucking question that.

473
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Damn it.

474
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Damn it.

475
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,400
I wasn't gonna, I didn't want to beef it.

476
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,400
But now.

477
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Now everybody's talking about how bad being dead is.

478
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
And I was like, shit, I gotta question it, right?

479
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I'm the great philosopher.

480
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
So crazy.

481
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I'm so great.

482
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm so great, Tim.

483
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Show humility.

484
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Yeah, that's not.

485
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Those ideas don't really mishmash together.

486
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,400
I don't trust anything you say.

487
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,400
But hey, that's just me.

488
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
That's just me.

489
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,400
That's just me.

490
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
My thing is that truth is knowable.

491
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,400
And I've got it here in my pocket.

492
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
The next one is so boring.

493
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I don't even want to talk about it.

494
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,400
But remember the Socratic paradoxes.

495
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Yeah, obviously.

496
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Stick to your principles even in the face of death

497
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,400
as Socrates did as described in Phaedo.

498
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
Phaedo.

499
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
Which I suppose is a cool book.

500
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Listen, you all know me.

501
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,400
I'm a pretty cool dude, right?

502
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,400
Very cool.

503
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
If I'm facing death, I'm going to do whatever it takes

504
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,400
to get out of there.

505
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
You know what I mean?

506
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
Sure, sure.

507
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'll sign anything.

508
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
I will say anything.

509
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,400
I'll make fun of anybody.

510
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,400
And then later be like, I didn't.

511
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
Nope, not true.

512
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I totally didn't.

513
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,400
But anyways, I'm still eating this hamburger right here

514
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,400
and loving it.

515
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Be sure to know thyself.

516
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
That scene.

517
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
Of course.

518
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
You clearly don't, though, because you're like,

519
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,400
I know myself, but I'd rather know myself as Socrates.

520
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Knowing thyself is a lot easier when no one else

521
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,400
really wants you to know them.

522
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
Yes.

523
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
So it frees up a lot.

524
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,400
I don't actually want to spend that much time

525
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
letting you get to know me,

526
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
so you should probably just know yourself.

527
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
That's probably a better use of your time.

528
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,400
And meet distinguished or influential people.

529
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Yeah, that's easy enough.

530
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Hey, what's up?

531
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Is this Zach Braff?

532
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
Come here, my cool farts.

533
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Zach Braff?

534
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
Zach Braff?

535
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You're going to love them.

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,400
And finally, remember that truth is the most important thing ever,

537
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
and you must do all you can to find it.

538
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,400
That's a cool one, because I don't think about things that way

539
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
even a little bit.

540
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
No.

541
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Truth, wildly subjective and often incredibly hurtful.

542
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Well, I mean, it's good to not live in fantasy times

543
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,400
where you think that vaccines don't make you jump as good

544
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
or whatever.

545
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
True.

546
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,400
But there's also so much other cool shit you can do in the world,

547
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
like ride a roller coaster.

548
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Or VR experiences.

549
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,400
A virtual reality experience.

550
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
Yeah, I can't dedicate all my time to, you know,

551
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,400
cracking open the Shelby Woo mystery files.

552
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
You know what I mean?

553
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I got a lot on my plate right now.

554
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Do you think because Socrates didn't eat food with any flavor

555
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,400
and didn't own cool shit,

556
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
that's why he wasn't afraid of death?

557
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Because he was like, what am I even doing?

558
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,400
You know what I mean?

559
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I'm filling my time with you, Jags.

560
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
I can't wait to get out of here.

561
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
One of those stinkers that didn't like it was like,

562
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,400
you've never had spices?

563
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Dude, you've got to try this one.

564
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,400
It's called Himlock.

565
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,400
It's got good umami potential.

566
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,400
And you know Plato was waiting in the wings.

567
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
And he was like, Plato?

568
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
You know more about flavors than I do.

569
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Is this cool?

570
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
And Plato was like, definitely.

571
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
Go for it.

572
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Delicious.

573
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
It's going to be good.

574
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
What'd you say?

575
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
Nothing.

576
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
I've written a cool book about how cool you are

577
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
even though you're dead.

578
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,400
And it's in a holding pattern for obvious reasons.

579
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,400
A lot of publishers interested, just waiting for the finish.

580
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Just waiting for the ending.

581
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400
We're going to take a quick break right now.

582
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,400
I want to stop doing the hard part of this job

583
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
and do the easy part, which is selling,

584
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,400
which is my true passion is products.

585
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
So let's do that now.

586
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:55,400
In a little segment we tend to call the money sound.

587
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Wrap yourself in a dream.

588
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,400
That's right.

589
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I'm telling you about Brooklinen.

590
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400
And here's what's great is when you say Brooklinen, right?

591
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,400
It kind of sounds like Brooklyn.

592
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,400
You ever notice that?

593
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,400
Yeah.

594
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy,

595
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,400
spokesperson and best friend of Brooklinen.

596
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,400
They told me that they like me better than anyone else.

597
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Makes sense.

598
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
And it's because I sleep on their sheets.

599
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,400
Not by force.

600
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
No one's making me do it.

601
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,400
I chose to do it.

602
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
That is what you would have to say though.

603
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,400
No, Griffin, I promise you of my own volition and free will,

604
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,400
I sleep on Brooklinen's sheets.

605
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
Still things that you would say if being sort of.

606
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,400
No one is here making me.

607
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,400
No one's standing right next to me

608
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,400
telling me what to say with an earpiece

609
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,400
and like some written notes that are scrawled in an angry hand, right?

610
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,400
I am choosing to say of my own experience

611
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,400
how comfortable and life changing Brooklinen can be.

612
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
A lot of people think that their sheets don't stink.

613
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Okay.

614
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,400
But maybe yours do and you should check out Brooklinen.

615
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Yeah, that's good.

616
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,400
Hi, I'm Justin McElroy.

617
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Travis, take a back seat.

618
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Juice has got it from here, I think.

619
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Okay.

620
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,400
We got a lot of ads to get through

621
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,400
and honestly, Travis is taking too long.

622
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
These are great sheets.

623
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,400
If you don't think so, you don't know fuck all about comfort

624
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,400
and Brooklinen's are great to give as a gift.

625
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Once you experience it, it is a actual mortal sin

626
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,400
to not want to share it with other people you love.

627
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah.

628
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,400
I love every Brooklinen thing I've ever owned

629
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
more than my next breath.

630
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,400
I mean, it is the-

631
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
More than Zach Braff.

632
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,400
More than Zach Braff, more than Braff Zachary,

633
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
more than scrubs.

634
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,400
What?

635
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
That's just the way I feel.

637
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
Go.

638
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
There's a gift guide so you can find the perfect present

639
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
from Brooklinen at every price point.

640
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,400
You just go to Brooklinen.com, use the promo code MYBROTHER

641
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,400
and you can get $20 off with a minimum purchase of $100.

642
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,400
That's B-R-O-O-K-L-I-N-E-N.com

643
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,400
and enter promo code MYBROTHER.

644
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,400
Brooklinen.com, promo code MYBROTHER.

645
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Justin, now that we're out of the ad,

646
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,400
do you want to take back what you said about scrubs?

647
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah, I actually, they're not paying me anymore

648
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
so scrubs is the best.

649
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
It's better than new sheets.

650
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
Okay, great.

651
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,400
I'm assuming they were asopolis-ing.

652
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Clothes go on your body and make you look cool

653
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
and they make you look not like everybody else

654
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,400
who's wearing different clothes.

655
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Your clothes are going to be better than theirs though

656
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
because you're getting them from Stitch Fix.

657
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Stitch Fix is the best because you don't have to go

658
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
to a building where they are like,

659
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,400
here's a million shirts.

660
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Most of them won't fit you good.

661
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,400
You're like, fuck.

662
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,400
They do a quiz for you, but like a fun quiz

663
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
where they're like, what do you like?

664
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
What size is everything?

665
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,400
And you tell them and then you get clothes

666
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,400
specifically for your body, your style.

667
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
They also have Stitch Fix Freestyle

668
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,400
where you can just pick stuff yourself

669
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
from a range of over a thousand brands,

670
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,400
personalized though to your size and fit.

671
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,400
And there's no subscription required.

672
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,400
They offer free shipping, returns and exchanges.

673
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
You gotta do it.

674
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
You gotta do it.

675
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
I got a Stitch Fix box waiting for me downstairs.

676
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I haven't cracked open yet.

677
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Stoked out of my gourd.

678
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
So get started today by filling out your style quiz

679
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
at stitchfix.com slash my brother.

680
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother

681
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
to try Stitch Fix Freestyle.

682
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

683
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Now listen, we're going to talk about Zip Recruiter here

684
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,400
and Zip Recruiter, listen, it's not fun looking for a job.

685
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
We've all done it.

686
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,400
And you know what?

687
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,400
I'm going to say it.

688
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,400
It huffs farts, right?

689
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Yeah, big time.

690
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,400
And Zip Recruiter has encouraged us now

691
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,400
to talk about things we'd rather do

692
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
instead of looking for a job.

693
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
And I would rather.

694
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
There he goes.

695
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Get out of its way.

696
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,400
Eat the space needle slowly, one bite at a time

697
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,400
over 10 years, then look for a job.

698
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,400
But now that I've said that, I think eventually

699
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
I could probably turn that into money or get arrested.

700
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
I don't even know, you know?

701
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Right.

702
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Definitely.

703
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
So quick, I'm going to do a really fun game

704
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
right here for our listeners.

705
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
If you can tell me what this ad is about,

706
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
like what the company this ad is for

707
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,400
after the last minute of this show

708
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,400
and it hasn't completely glazed over

709
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:19,400
and exited your brain, I will send you $2.50.

710
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Because there's no way.

711
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm part of the show and I forget what the advertiser is.

712
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,400
It's about how to eat the space needle.

713
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,400
But like what's the company that gives us-

715
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
The ad, the person who wrote the chat.

716
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Oh, right, right, right, right, right.

717
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Well, it's ZipRecruiter.

718
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,400
And you know, it doesn't have to be boring

719
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
to look for a job.

720
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
They figured out how to make the job process better

721
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,400
and a lot easier.

722
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,400

741
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,400
Well, hello, I'm Renee Colvert.

742
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Hi, I'm Alexis Preston, and we are the hosts

743
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
of Can I Pet Your Dog?

744
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
And we got breaking news.

745
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,400
We got an expose that all the beans have been spilled

746
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,400
via an Apple podcast review that said,

747
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,400
this show isn't well researched.

748
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
Well, yeah, no duh.

749
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Of course, it's not.

750
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Not since the day we started has it been well researched.

751
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
Guessing and anthropomorphizing dogs is what we do.

752
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
The Can I Pet Your Dog promise

753
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
is that we will never do more than 10 seconds of research

754
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,400
before telling you excitedly about any dog we see.

755
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,400
I'm gonna come at you with top 10 enthusiasm, minimal facts.

756
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
We're here for a good time, not an educated time.

757
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
So if you love dogs and you don't love research,

758
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
well, you know what, come on in

759
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
to Can I Pet Your Dog podcast every Tuesday

760
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
on Maximum Fun Network.

761
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Hey, now that ZipRecruiter's gone,

762
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
you remember when we said they told us

763
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
we could talk about things we'd rather do than look for a job?

764
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah.

765
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
They included four examples.

766
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,400
And the second one is eat dry, salty crackers.

767
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Yeah.

768
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
Do they know?

769
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
Do they know about you and the stuff you're into?

770
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Do they know about your dry sensibilities?

771
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,400
It's like somebody who's never struggled.

772
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I feel like this was written by someone

773
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
who's never had actual challenge in their life.

774
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Because eating dry, salty crackers,

775
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,400
that might not even be a negative.

776
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Yeah, some people like those.

777
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,400
I mean, they also included watching a documentary

778
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
about sea slugs, which I would happily do.

779
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
They're fascinating creatures.

780
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
Yeah.

781
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,400
And it also says to hear about my mother-in-law's bunion surgery,

782
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,400
which like, sorry that I'm concerned about-

783
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
Yeah, sorry that I love my mother-in-law so much

784
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,400
and she's in pain and she had surgery?

785
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,400
Yeah.

786
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,400
What?

787
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,400
I said.

788
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Oh, spooky.

789
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
I want a Munch Squad.

790
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Squad.

791
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,400
I want to Munch Squad.

792
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Squad.

793
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Welcome to Munch Squad.

794
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
It's podcast to the podcast,

795
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

796
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
It is no longer being sunset.

797
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,400
It has been revived for season five.

798
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
So I'm so excited to have-

799
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Now on Netflix.

800
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
It's been picked up.

801
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,400
It's now streaming.

802
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,400
It wasn't right for broadcast television anymore,

803
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,400
but thanks to all of you who sent in your old hamburger wrappers.

804
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
They picked it up.

805
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
There's a protest.

806
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
On Quibi.

807
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Arby's, I just want to, this is quick,

808
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,400
Arby's is going to launch Boneless Wings

809
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
for a limited time this week.

810
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
Neat.

811
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,400
They like, they've already got nuggets.

812
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Yeah.

813
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
So actually fuck off.

814
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah.

815
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
You know what I mean?

816
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Like they've actually, this kind of thing.

817
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Okay.

818
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
I think that was it.

819
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Hey boys.

820
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Hello.

821
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Sorry.

822
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I had to take care of Justin.

823
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Two in a row.

824
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Count Donut.

825
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,400
Well, he said.

826
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,400
And also Griffin, a limited window

827
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,400
where are we going to have Count Donut on

828
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
and it makes any kind of sense.

829
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
Yeah, that's fair.

830
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Oh, it's kind of late breaking.

831
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
I've got the paper.

832
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,400
This is late breaking is exactly it.

833
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
I'm very frustrated.

834
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,400
And when I'm angry, I don't always sound like myself.

835
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
So I'm going to bring the energy down,

836
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
but no, I'm holding back the range

837
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
with everything in my multi.

838
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Okay.

839
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
All right, what's, what's, what's.

840
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,400
I am Count Donut.

841
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Yeah, we, yes.

842
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Wow, we know.

843
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah.

844
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I am called and summoned, if you will,

845
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,400
when Donut News is breaking in this segment.

846
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
And last week-

847
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
Is the killing of Justin part of that

848
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
or is that just for funsies?

849
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,400
I, I inhabit Justin's body and I need it to function.

850
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Huh.

851
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
So here's the thing.

852
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,400
That's a new Wrinkle in the Vampire kind of mythology,

853
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
isn't it?

854
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Yeah.

855
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Well, it's Justin's intrigue.

856
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Me and, me and Richard Stink share the vessel

857
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,400
when we need to.

858
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
Huh.

859
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,400
And we bumped into Richard in here.

860
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
It was awkward.

861
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,400
We shared a nice cup of tea.

862
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
It was pleasant.

863
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
You know, people often ask,

864
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
can I just start at the latest episode

865
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,400
of My Brother, My Brother and Me,

866
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
and I say like, oh, you'll be so confused

867
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
without all the backstory of the different things

868
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
that inhabit Justin's body.

869
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,400
But go on.

870
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,400
The mythology.

871
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
So, you know, last week I brought you

872
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,400
the incredible story of all the different Halloween donuts.

873
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Yeah, Krispy Scream.

874
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
From all, Krispy Scream.

875
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, you scared me with that.

876
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,400
Yeah, I know.

877
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
I wasn't even ready for it,

878
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
and you scared me.

879
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Well, I was ready to go back into my coffin

880
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
and die for another year.

881
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,400
In Justin's body?

882
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,400
No, the spirit is in a coffin.

883
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
Yeah.

884
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
It comes out.

885
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,400
It's like you don't know fucking anything, Travis.

886
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I'm just trying to catch it up for people at home.

887
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
But then someone lays across my desk,

888
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
that I have, which is my coffin.

889
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Okay.

890
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
The top of my coffin, I call it.

891
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
I like that.

892
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Do you like, do you live in like a tiny house?

893
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
And you just like, you're very sort of efficient.

894
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Well, it's a coffin, which is a tiny house.

895
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,400
Yes.

896
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Oh, so it's a sort of all-in-one living,

897
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
or unliving experience.

898
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,400
If you're trying to ask me if I poop in there,

899
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,400
I'll never tell.

900
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I don't think we were.

901
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Sounds like you do, though.

902
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Like you definitely do.

903
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Okay.

904
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,400
So, this is killing me.

905
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
Let me get this off my chest.

906
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
Yeah.

907
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
Tim Horton.

908
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,400
Do you know this man?

909
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah.

910
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,400
Canadian.

911
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Canadian.

912
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
I think he's a hockey player.

913
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,400
They do the name after him.

914
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:09,400
They put out an announcement on October 19th,

915
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,400
that they have a Halloween sprinkle donut.

916
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,400
And I am so furious at these guys.

917
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,400
This Halloween sprinkle donut.

918
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
So festive.

919
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
Yes.

920
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
It's available October 27th.

921
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,400
Begins October 27th.

922
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,400
This Halloween sprinkle donut.

923
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
And you don't like it?

924
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
But listen to this.

925
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Listen to this.

926
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Okay.

927
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
For your Halloween spirit.

928
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Tim Horton's U.S. restaurants are celebrating Halloween this year

929
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
with all treats and no tricks.

930
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,400
I would say it's mean trick to wait until October 27th.

931
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,400
The Halloween sprinkle donut is a classic yeast ring donut

932
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:01,400
dipped in chocolate fondant and topped with festive orange sprinkles.

933
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,400
Oh my!

934
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
Chilling!

935
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,400
Yeah.

936
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,400
What a festive thing you've done.

937
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,400
It's chocolate with orange sprinkles?

938
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
That's a little too much for me even.

939
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,400
You're in the spirit now.

940
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Oh boy.

941
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,400
And you say it's available for three whole days.

942
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Oh boy.

943
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Look at the Frankenstein over here really getting into it.

944
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:33,400
This festive donut will make the perfect sweet to serve Halloween parties

945
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:41,400
or delicious treat to enjoy while carving pumpkins and making costumes.

946
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,400
This person definitely forgot about Halloween is what they're saying.

947
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,400
They definitely forgot.

948
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh yeah.

949
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,400
We've got one.

950
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Wait until you hear about it.

951
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,400
It's available in a week and it's a chocolate donut with orange sprinkles.

952
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,400
We've been working on this one for a while.

953
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
Yeah.

954
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
The boys at R&D, the D stands for death,

955
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,400
they've really spooked you out with this one.

956
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,400
It's a real crazy scary donut.

957
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,400
You wouldn't believe it.

958
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,400
They definitely forgot, Tim.

959
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Just say, put out an answer that says, oops.

960
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,400
Oops.

961
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
We didn't do Halloween this year.

962
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,400
I hope you in these challenging times.

963
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,400
We forgot to do this Halloween donut.

964
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Don't try.

965
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,400
I'm furious.

966
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
This is what I want to say.

967
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
This is all.

968
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,400
It's a terrible donut.

969
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,400
But the good news is it's not available for very long.

970
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
So anyway, I'm back to the beyond.

971
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Goodbye, boys.

972
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
I'm not.

973
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Bye.

974
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
How does he bring Justin back?

975
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Do you need me?

976
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
I don't want to let them.

977
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,400
You know, I don't just do donut stuff.

978
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
I have a lot of great.

979
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,400
You guys want to talk about Dune?

980
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,400
It's coming out.

981
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,400
Yeah, tell me your vampire thoughts about Dune.

982
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Yeah.

983
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,400
I wanted to read the book, but who's got the time?

984
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Yeah, maybe you should go.

985
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,400
My joke was good.

986
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,400
It was pretty common mortal, you see.

987
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Oh, I didn't get it at first, but now I definitely do.

988
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,400
Awesome.

989
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
That's the kind of comedy I do.

990
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,400
More thinkers.

991
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I've loved your stand up sets.

992
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Oh, OK.

993
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,400
He's gone.

994
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
Hey, I'm back.

995
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,400
I'm getting used to it.

996
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,400
You know what?

997
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Weirdly, Socrates, I get it.

998
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,400
Yeah, sure.

999
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,400
It's not too bad, honestly, being basically dead.

1000
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
It's not bad.

1001
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Cool.

1002
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,400
Cool thing.

1003
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
I no longer fear it.

1004
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,400
How about another question?

1005
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,400
Hey, can I read a question?

1006
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,400
I never get to read a question.

1007
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,400
Hold on.

1008
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Are you ready for this level of responsibility, Griffin?

1009
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,400
I mean, I read and make up bullshit questions throughout the show.

1010
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
Well, that's a little different, isn't it?

1011
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
Because now you're using real people's real words.

1012
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,400
Here it comes.

1013
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
OK.

1014
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,400
My cousin is getting married on Halloween this year.

1015
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Small family wedding.

1016
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Vaccine required.

1017
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,400
All chill.

1018
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Thank you for including that because I was ready to judge.

1019
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
The invitation does not list any dress code,

1020
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
and I have no idea how much Halloween cheer

1021
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,400
I should bring to the event.

1022
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
The couple is very nerdy into board games,

1023
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,400
D&D, video games, et cetera,

1024
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,400
but they're not specifically Halloween nerdy.

1025
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,400
They chose Halloween because my cousin's birthday is on April Fool's Day,

1026
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,400
so they thought it'd be cool if their anniversary was also on a pseudo holiday.

1027
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,400
They're even getting married on a classy beach.

1028
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Surely I don't just wear a normal dress to a Halloween wedding,

1029
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,400
but a costume also has to be out of the question, right?

1030
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
Can I get away with a fancy witch's hat, a cape, a broom?

1031
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
From Confounded in California.

1032
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
This one is tough.

1033
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
I actually have no, absolutely no idea.

1034
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,400
I don't know anything about weddings or Halloween or clothes.

1035
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,400
Oh, you know who I could call?

1036
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
Who?

1037
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,400
Mr. Halloween himself.

1038
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,400
The king of horror, as I call him.

1039
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,400
The king of podcasting horror.

1040
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,400
The Duke of Doom.

1041
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,400
The Duke of Doom.

1042
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,400
The Sultan of scares.

1043
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
And SWAT.

1044
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
Five more.

1045
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Five more of them, please.

1046
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Joseph Fink.

1047
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
He's one of the Nightfall guys.

1048
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,400
They've got a whole writers' room over there, but he's one of them.

1049
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Hold on.

1050
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I have a yellow book of fellow New York Times bestselling authors.

1051
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Let me look at this.

1052
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh, no, that's Hank Green.

1053
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,400
If you can't find him, let's just do Dan Brown.

1054
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
Dan.

1055
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
No, no, here he is.

1056
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
Here he is.

1057
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,400
Hold on.

1058
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I'll call him.

1059
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,400
Beep, boop, beep, boop, boop, boop, beep.

1060
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,400
This is Mr. Halloween, the king of horror podcasting.

1061
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,400
Oh, hey, Joseph.

1062
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,400
Hey, Joseph.

1063
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,400
Justin McElroy.

1064
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,400
My brothers and I do a different podcast.

1065
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
My brother, my brother, and me.

1066
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I don't know if you've...

1067
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,400
We did PodCon together.

1068
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
We did PodCon.

1069
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
It's like a not scary...

1070
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
I know this is for people.

1071
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh, not sure.

1072
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Not scary podcasting also exists.

1073
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Yeah, not all podcasts are supposed to be scary ghosty tales.

1074
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
Ours is for babies.

1075
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
Yeah.

1076
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,400
Exactly.

1077
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,400
So you've been kind of the king of horror for years now.

1078
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
What would you...

1079
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,400
We do advice on our show and we had someone ask us what they would wear to a Halloween

1080
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,400
wedding and we were curious what would be an appropriately ghoulish ensemble for that

1081
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
kind of thing.

1082
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,400
Yeah, I mean, kind of through the ether, I heard the question and I just want to...

1083
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,400
That must be so distracting, you living your daily life, hearing all podcast questions.

1084
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Like a real Bruce Almighty, but for podcast bullshit.

1085
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,400
I just want to first address pseudo-holiday.

1086
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,400
Thank you.

1087
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
Pseudo-holiday?

1088
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,400
Yeah.

1089
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Like it's Halloween.

1090
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,400
This isn't...

1091
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:52,960
I mean, April Fool's Day I get, but like respect Halloween.

1092
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,160
I do understand because as far as I know, not a federal holiday.

1093
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:01,280
You don't get Halloween off from your job.

1094
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,000
It's one of the big three.

1095
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's a huge holiday.

1096
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's one of the big ones.

1097
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,280
I will tell you as a Jew that there are a lot of important holidays you do not get off

1098
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,280
from the federal government.

1099
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,280
This is fair.

1100
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,880
It's an excellent point.

1101
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,040
And you know, I said that you don't technically get off work, but nothing gets done on Halloween

1102
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
in a workplace, right?

1103
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,840
Everybody's eating candy and wearing costumes and doing fun games, I assume.

1104
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
I don't know.

1105
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,200
On a day when your sister could turn into a bat and gremlins can mess up all your cassettes,

1106
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,160
how are you supposed to get any work done?

1107
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
It's too scary.

1108
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Yeah.

1109
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
Anything could happen.

1110
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Way too scary.

1111
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,740
To address the question though, I mean, I feel like you don't actually have to do that.

1112
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
Don't feel like...

1113
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,740
We rarely do.

1114
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:45,440
But if you want to take a swing at it for the novelty, please go ahead.

1115
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,880
Well, they found the answer, I think themselves, which is an elegant witch's hat.

1116
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:50,880
Sounds perfect.

1117
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,320
I mean, that's perfect for most occasions.

1118
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
This is true.

1119
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,960
What if you go indoors though, what if there's an indoors portion of the wedding, you have

1120
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,480
to take it off, then you just have matted witch hat hair.

1121
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,920
Well, you have a smaller hat underneath.

1122
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,600
Okay, okay.

1123
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Or an owl.

1124
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,120
There you go.

1125
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,040
No one's noticing your hair at that point.

1126
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,040
Yeah.

1127
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,520
And if they do, they'll blame it on the owl.

1128
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,520
Yeah.

1129
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,520
Sorry about my hair, guys.

1130
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,600
I'm just picturing the national anthem happens and someone has to take off their elegant

1131
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,760
witch's hat and hold it in their chest.

1132
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,160
You know Disney bounding where people dress...

1133
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,720
You're not allowed to wear costumes to the parks, so people will dress up in outfits

1134
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,620
inspired by characters that they...

1135
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,040
You are reading my mind.

1136
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,200
So like for Winnie the Pooh, you would wear like a red t-shirt and like...

1137
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
And no pants.

1138
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
No pants.

1139
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,200
Sort of like...

1140
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,200
It's not a costume, it's just like...

1141
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,200
Yeah.

1142
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,360
So for this, I think you'd want to do like Halloween bounding, where it's like doffing

1143
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,960
your cap to Frankenstein.

1144
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
You know what I mean?

1145
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,640
Like an elegant bolt on your, two elegant bolts on your neck.

1146
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,280
Listen, I'm just going to say two words that you could Halloween bound, Sanderson sisters.

1147
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,880
Right there, little hocus pocus action.

1148
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:07,760
Those dresses could easily, easily translate to an elegant...

1149
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,320
Now it is a beach wedding, so maybe not an elegant ball gown, which is what I was going

1150
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
to say.

1151
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,320
This is what fucks me up.

1152
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:17,960
That's the least terrifying environment, unless you are afraid of sea creatures, as I am,

1153
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,960
but I doubt that there's going to be a swimming portion of the wedding, right?

1154
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,680
So like, it's not going to be, it's tonally strange.

1155
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Yes.

1156
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:33,680
Could you, could you, could you Halloween bound like a mermaid or a shark or a shark

1157
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,680
victim?

1158
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,680
The creature from the Black Lagoon.

1159
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
Yes.

1160
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,680
There you go.

1161
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Good idea.

1162
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,240
Something very aquatic.

1163
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,880
Maybe just dress as a shell and you're laying on the beach the whole time.

1164
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:47,440
They're like, I can't believe that, you know, Sandy didn't make it.

1165
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
And then boom, you pop up.

1166
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,440
Sorry.

1167
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
Wait, wait, wait.

1168
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Yeah, I know.

1169
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,800
Is that because you were thinking beach, so Sandy is the name you got too?

1170
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Yeah.

1171
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
Yeah, it is, Justin.

1172
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
What's wrong with that?

1173
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,800
It is.

1174
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,800
Thank you.

1175
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,800
Okay.

1176
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,800
And then the shell pops up, but it's you.

1177
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,800
I could have said Shelly.

1178
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
Damn it.

1179
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,000
If you have a wedding on Halloween, I feel like you have to address that.

1180
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yes.

1181
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,000
In the invitations.

1182
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,960
You've been set up to fail here.

1183
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,600
You should have mentioned on that invitations, look, we know what day this is.

1184
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,160
Do not show up dressed up like a big Pikachu.

1185
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
That's fucked up.

1186
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:27,440
I think it, I think it is morally indefensible to have a wedding on a day that is most well

1187
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,360
known here in the US as a day that one dresses in costume and to say, I expect you to be

1188
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,400
there and not in costume.

1189
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Right?

1190
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,520
That feel, then why did you do it?

1191
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,440
Like unless you just decided to get married two weeks ago, right?

1192
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,720
And then otherwise you knew you planned it on Halloween.

1193
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:48,280
Just do it on Thanksgiving or something.

1194
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,560
No, it's a weird thing.

1195
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:50,560
Yeah.

1196
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
That's sort of the premise of the show.

1197
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,560
Oh, right.

1198
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,560
Here's where I'm at.

1199
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,560
It's like, fellows, we've all been married.

1200
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
Yeah.

1201
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,560
It's a day of joy.

1202
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,000
It's a, it's a very happy day.

1203
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,560
So like, you know, if someone shows up dressed as a giant Pikachu, I'm, I'm fine with that.

1204
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,120
That's an expression of joy.

1205
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,880
Like what am I going to be upset about someone doing something they love on this joyful day?

1206
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,640
Well, I guess the real question, Joseph, is would you let them into the pictures?

1207
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,280
That is a fucking actually fantastic question.

1208
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,860
My friend Eric came to our wedding and this was during a period where he had, I would

1209
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,920
say the most perverted mustache any human being has ever grown on his face.

1210
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,920
And this was for, he had this mustache for two months.

1211
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,320
So it was not like iconic Eric pervert mustache.

1212
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:45,440
It was like something he grew on a dare and then is in every single one of the like crowd

1213
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,400
shots of the wedding photos.

1214
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:53,480
And it's like, it's hard not to, when you look at, oh, there's my nanny and she's, she's

1215
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,760
talking to our friends.

1216
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,760
That's so, ah fuck.

1217
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,680
Look at, look at, look at, there he is trying to, he's going to steal my grandma with that

1218
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:01,680
mustache.

1219
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,020
Well, this is especially, this occurs to me now, especially if question asker, you decide

1220
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,760
to go with a very topical costume and you're like, get it, I'm from squid game or whatever.

1221
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,400
And then like 20 years from now, this person's kids are like looking at the photos and like

1222
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,040
this is so beautiful.

1223
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,600
Are you, what, what is that?

1224
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,080
And you're like, oh, it was from, oh, what was that?

1225
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:25,600
Uh, Joseph, what's your favorite character from your own podcast to cosplay as?

1226
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,600
Good question.

1227
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,280
Um, I like, uh, Cecil because no one knows what he looks like.

1228
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,400
So I am always cosplaying as Cecil at all times.

1229
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,960
It's possible that all of us are.

1230
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
Yeah.

1231
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
Whoa.

1232
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,960
Whoa.

1233
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,960
Guys.

1234
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,960
I got it.

1235
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:42,960
I got it.

1236
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,960
I got it.

1237
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,960
All right.

1238
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,400
So, uh, Mamoru Chiba, tuxedo mask.

1239
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,760
Oh yeah.

1240
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,800
Tuxedo mask of sailor moon fame.

1241
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,800
You go as tuxedo mask.

1242
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,520
You arrive, elegant cape, tuxedo.

1243
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,760
Everyone's loving it.

1244
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,760
Yes.

1245
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,880
White mask in your pocket.

1246
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,560
And then you get there and you check the vibe.

1247
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,600
You have the rose in the back pocket.

1248
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:17,600
You're ready to dress out if the situation is one where tuxedo mask would be appropriate.

1249
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:23,760
If not, you leave the mask in your pocket and you're just someone in a very elegant

1250
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
tuxedo.

1251
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
Right.

1252
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:26,760
Sure.

1253
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:31,600
What I like about that is it addresses my concern, which is the inverse, uh, sort of

1254
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:37,680
fear, which is that you show up in your, you know, Sunday best, but then you show up and

1255
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,400
everybody's squid game and Pikachu.

1256
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,800
And you're like, shit, I didn't realize we were having fun with this one because it's

1257
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
a wedding.

1258
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,800
Oh, okay.

1259
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,000
Wait, this isn't an answer for the question asker, but if you are a wedding thrower and

1260
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,240
you're ever in this exact situation, instead of one side for one participant and one side

1261
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,880
for the other, you have a side of the audience for costumes and a side of the audience for

1262
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,640
squares.

1263
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,880
That's good.

1264
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,000
And then you get two photographers, one angling from the square side.

1265
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,400
Oh, and you, oh, the two participants, you're wearing half costume, half wedding clothes

1266
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,160
so that when they take pictures from this side, it's all wedding baby.

1267
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,200
And then pictures from this side, all spooky Halloween fun.

1268
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,840
Hey Joseph, do you got a new book coming out?

1269
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
I feel like you helped this person.

1270
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
You helped this person.

1271
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,280
Now, if you got a new book coming out.

1272
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,280
It's a good question.

1273
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,280
I do.

1274
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,280
You often do.

1275
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,280
Okay.

1276
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,280
Thank you.

1277
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,280
Thank you.

1278
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,280
Thank you, Joseph.

1279
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,280
And thank you for coming on.

1280
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,280
So glad.

1281
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,280
No way.

1282
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,360
I need to know the title of it so that I can sleep tonight.

1283
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,160
Yeah, that makes sense.

1284
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,680
It's called the Halloween moon, coincidentally.

1285
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:51,160
And it's a middle grade novel about Halloween and the experience of trick or treating.

1286
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,880
And then also the experience of when Halloween night never ends and it just keeps going and

1287
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:00,120
going and time gets stuck and you have to save the day because you're stuck in Halloween

1288
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,220
forever.

1289
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,220
It's out now.

1290
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,800
It's a great, great time to read it.

1291
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,080
I mean, it's, it's for ages 10 and up, but I think adult fans who like the spooky and

1292
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,680
maybe like Welcome to Nightville will really enjoy it too.

1293
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,680
Who read the audio book?

1294
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,680
I see.

1295
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh, Kevin R. Free, who plays Kevin on Welcome to Nightville and is just a truly wonderful

1296
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,320
performer.

1297
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,320
Oh, excellent.

1298
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,560
That sounds very good.

1299
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,760
Is this a follow up to Mr. Bone Clown's scarifying adventure?

1300
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,280
Your last, your last book?

1301
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,320
I think of it more as a spiritual sequel.

1302
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah.

1303
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,040
You're saying there's ghosts in it.

1304
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:40,480
Because the Mr. Bone Clown series, like usually you get his name in the title, so I was confused

1305
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,120
about this one.

1306
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,840
I really, I felt like stretching myself this time trying something new.

1307
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,760
Joseph, are you getting ready to pull them all together with references from one book

1308
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,680
appearing in the other series until eventually you, the author, appear in one and like reveal

1309
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:58,680
that it's all been connected and springing forth from your mind?

1310
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,680
Yes.

1311
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,200
It's a, it's the shared Thinkiverse.

1312
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:10,400
Now I, yeah, Joseph, if you, you, you wrote, if I'm, if I can, let me check my, yeah, this

1313
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,160
is 37 Scare Gobblers books for kids and you're finally departing from the Scare Gobblers

1314
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,480
series.

1315
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,560
Why is this, I guess, why is the Halloween moon available now, not in the Scare Gobblers

1316
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,560
franchise?

1317
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,200
In answer to your question, I'm just going to tell you my favorite anecdote I ever heard

1318
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,480
from the Goosebumps guy.

1319
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,880
I was listening to an interview with R.L.

1320
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,240
Stein in which he was talking about a fan letter he got after having written, I think,

1321
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:48,320
over 200 books and the fan letter said, I've read all of your books and they're all terrible.

1322
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,080
That's commitment to the bit, isn't it?

1323
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
You think R.L.

1324
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
Stein's one guy?

1325
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,080
Whoa.

1326
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh, you think he's like a Shakespeare thing?

1327
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,760
That Shakespeare wrote them?

1328
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
Yeah.

1329
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,760
Shakespeare wrote.

1330
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,760
Shakespeare wrote Goosebumps.

1331
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,720
Hey, the Halloween moon is good.

1332
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,400
I love all of your books, Joseph.

1333
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:09,900
You know that I, after I read one of your books, I like to tell you that I liked it

1334
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,960
and this, I'm sure will be no exception for all of our listeners.

1335
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:14,960
They're going to love it.

1336
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,960
You know what I love?

1337
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,000
Joseph wrote a book called The First 10 Years with his wife, Meg Bashwiner, and that is

1338
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,860
a very good book as well.

1339
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:26,920
It's both of them are calling their relationship independently and how those stories overlap

1340
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,200
is very touching and lovely and I love that book too.

1341
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:36,240
So if you read The Halloween Moon and you want something exactly like it, check out

1342
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,520
that book as well.

1343
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,960
Thank you so much, guys.

1344
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,000
And Night Vale, are you guys still doing that?

1345
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I feel like-

1346
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Yeah.

1347
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,280
We're about to hit our 10 year anniversary.

1348
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,240
Yeah, we're in that club where it's like, we very justifiably, if people hear about

1349
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,880
either of our podcasts, I think, are you guys still doing that as a completely legitimate

1350
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,160
response to my brother, me and Night Vale?

1351
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,800
A tweet I get literally weekly, if not daily is, wait, Night Vale is still happening?

1352
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
It's better than ever.

1353
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,200
Now's the best time to hop on board, wouldn't you agree?

1354
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,240
What do you tell people if they're like, where do I start?

1355
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,240
Because you don't want to go back to, I mean, I guess you have to go back to the beginning.

1356
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,240
Do y'all ever do that?

1357
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,760
Like, do you ever do like Marvel does and do like a universe reset?

1358
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,760
Our argument is always you can start wherever because, yes, it's confusing if you start

1359
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,160
at episode 170, but it's also confusing if you start at episode one.

1360
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,200
You'll get it eventually.

1361
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,320
Just start where you want.

1362
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:34,560
I like to start in the middle and listen out, so like listen to one next and one before

1363
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,360
and then keep going like that and then back in until the universe collapses in on itself.

1364
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,360
That's cool.

1365
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,360
Yeah.

1366
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,360
Yeah.

1367
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,160
Joseph, this has always been a treat.

1368
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,360
Listen to Joseph's work and read Joseph's work and support him because he's a real solid

1369
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,360
person.

1370
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,360
Joseph, can I tell you something?

1371
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:58,200
I've never told you before and we've known each other for years now, but I didn't want

1372
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,200
to miss this opportunity to tell you.

1373
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:05,480
When I started listening to Night Vale for a long, long time, I thought Joseph Fink was

1374
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:10,680
a character that you created to play at the beginning of every episode introducing it.

1375
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,440
I did not realize you were a real person for many years.

1376
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,720
A lot of people did because we did this fun joking thing where we had multiple people

1377
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,440
pretend to be like, hi, I'm Joseph Fink and I just thought it would be a fun way to get

1378
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:30,200
people to listen to the ads and then it turned into people thinking I'm fictional.

1379
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:37,920
Joseph Fink is his SAG name because there already was a Joey Funk, which is his real

1380
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
name.

1381
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:39,920
Yeah.

1382
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,280
And then Joey Funk changed to Bruno Mars, which is very frustrating.

1383
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:46,760
Because you could have just stayed Joey Funk.

1384
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,200
And the original Joseph Fink had to change his name to Finkasaurus Rex, but all of his

1385
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,160
albums are available on Spotify now.

1386
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,760
So yeah, get there.

1387
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,920

Boy, can you take this was fun just one more time, but really put a little bit more emotion

1392
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,240
behind it.

1393
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:13,160
I could feel, if you could just give me like one more punch up of that.

1394
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,040
Thanks so much for having me.

1395

00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,880
What are you even doing?

1403
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:38,360

I mean, don't save your money.

1439
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,200
Don't save your money.

1440
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,200
No, don't save your money.

1441
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Dang it.

1442
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
Don't save your money.

1443
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,200
But just make more money.

1444
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,200
Just get out there.

1445
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,200
Yeah, then give it to us.

1446
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,660
Hey, thank you Montaigne for the Use For Art theme song.

1447
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,860
It's called My Life Is Better With You.

1448
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:07,400
You can find that in any sort of music, like trough that you go to to get the music that

1449
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,820
you get.

1450
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:12,960
And while you're out there, you got to check out this new track from Montaigne.

1451
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:13,960
Now In Space.

1452
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,280
It's called Now In Space.

1453
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,440
The music video is on YouTube and it's so fucking good.

1454
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,440
It's a contender for your schedule.

1455
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,160
It feels like Montaigne made the music video for the three of us to enjoy.

1456
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:30,280
It feels like a DM music video and it's so fucking good.

1457
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,800
It's been stuck in my head all day.

1458
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,800
It's a top up.

1459
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,800
And that's it.

1460
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,800
Y'all want the final?

1461
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Yeah.

1462
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,800
Oh, real quick.

1463
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:37,800

1464
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,840

01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,080
You're so deep in it.

It's called Great British Bake Off.

1470
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,080
Oh yeah.

1471
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,240
It's called Great British Bake Off, but the name of the show is Bake On.

1472

Cool.

1479
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:07,520
This one was sent in by Alf.

1480
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,760
I want you guys to know that sometimes I just start, I say like a phonetic sound and then

1481
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,480
just like try to build it in real time.

1482
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,800
No one's surprised by that revelation.

1483
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,800
Oh, okay.

1484
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:21,800
Cool, cool, cool.

1485
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:22,800
Yeah.

1486
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:29,080
So you can hear, you can actually hear your loading screen in your brain as you do it.

1487
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,360
So yeah.

1488
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,360
So Alf sent this in.

1489
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
Thanks, Alf.

1490
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:46,720
It's asked by Yahoo Answers user den, denet, denes, denesquade, which is wild.

1491
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:51,920
It's wild that it like specifically says here to say denesquade.

1492
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,840
So we've all been saying it wrong all these years.

1493
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,640
We've all been wrong.

1494
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:07,480
And denesquade says, denesquade asks, I'm having trouble reading because I'm translating

1495
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,480
it from Sanskrit.

1496
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,480
Oh really?

1497
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,480
Yeah.

1498
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,520
I didn't even know Yahoo allowed you to do Sanskrit.

1499
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:28,000
Denesquade asks, does anyone have tickets for sale for the big New Year's Eve Hoobastank

1500
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,000
concert?

1501
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:37,720
I'm trying to get out there, but I don't have as much sway as I used to.

1502
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:39,560
Thank you.

1503
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,560
