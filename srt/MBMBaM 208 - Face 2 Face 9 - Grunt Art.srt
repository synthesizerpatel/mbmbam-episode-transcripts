1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Good evening, side audience. Hello, other people. My name is Clint McElroy.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Anybody named McElroy is going to get a big round of applause.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're going to be starting the show in just a second.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wanted to kind of prime the crowd a little with some very important Mabim Bam trivia.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Just to kind of see who's been paying attention.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
First of all, anybody listen, has listened to all 201 episodes?

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The rest of you get the hell out.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So you'll know these answers.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First of all, which McElroy brother is deathly afraid of spiders?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Travis.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Give yourself ten points.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Number two, what is early onset jack disease?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Early onset jack disease.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
175 pounds in the womb.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right, when you have a 175 pound child in the womb.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Security, row one, scene two.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Question number three, and this, now we'll resort to animal.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Which business, which animal was the subject of the business name suggestions?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Speed rats, shitty cats, your mother gets on it.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Exactly.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Number four, which animal has received the most Mabim Bam references?

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And finally, who is Goofy Hart McKinley?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, sorry.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,000
She was the warrior cat question answer.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So maybe she gave birth to Brangle Cat.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But these are the midwives.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, his brother, his brother in him, Justin Travis and Griffin Acklemore.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh wait, there's more.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but there's a nerd degree on his palm.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I haven't seen anything.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I only mentioned so the babies out there know how cool they are for listening.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's up, you cool babies?

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Get up, get up, get up.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Y'all get it twisted.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Distraction is mine, motherfuckers.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll fucking get it.

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Fuck what you heard.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's what you hear it.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's what you hear it.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Listen.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's what you hear it.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Listen.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's what you hear it.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Listen.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The McElroy brothers.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yo, give it to your motherfuckers.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now open up, close the door.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Stop the crime.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go fuck this baby, baby.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The McElroy brothers.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Got such a good heart.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The McElroy brothers.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Beat the motherfucker one day if you can.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Damn right.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The McElroy brothers.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Go in and dance.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The McElroy brothers.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hell yeah, son.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The McElroy brothers.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Got something to break, man, with the enemy.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We've used that before, and it's just so great, man.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I worked so hard on it that I didn't want it to just be a one.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me,

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the advice show for the modern era.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm your baby's brother, Griffin McElroy.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I just took a bite out of a cupcake from this,

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and it expressly says, for Sydney.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who got us these?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you for the cupcakes, whoever.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No one's going to mess up, all right?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Secret cupcakes.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Secret cupcakes.

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Copier and non-poison?

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What the fuck are we doing?

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is so many podcast shows.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I really, I don't remember if anything that I've said

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
has ever not been recorded.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Speaking of which, let me start recording.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, no.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, we got it on the six other recording devices.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll just say everything again.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you for the cupcakes, our dad.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you, cupcakes.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You know the shit about the question asker,

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
because that's, god damn.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think my favorite thing is when he asked about

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
who was deathly afraid of spiders,

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
that like three people that said Justin

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
got so harshly shouted, it's Travis.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fucking fuck.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Fuck this guy.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, thank you, everybody, for coming tonight

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
to this late, late shift.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This was the original.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It used to not be the late show.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It used to just be the show that we were doing.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You guys weren't worth it from the beginning,

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I appreciate that.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's what you got.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So what you're going to have now is like

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
live, unfiltered, unadulterated Nagler brothers.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There's nothing.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No kidding.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean, we've done half the work that Justin

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
has done tonight, and I already feel like

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
just keeling over dead.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So this is probably going to be the worst

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
or best show that we've ever done.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You know what's kept me going the entire time?

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
My second audience to my right hand side,

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
my dog, Perry.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dog time opens up.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We will not look or talk to the dog time.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Sir, we asked everybody to arrive on time, sir.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's extremely rude of you.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So what do we do in this podcast?

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is this the medical history one?

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Travis, how about, okay,

123
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you've never listened to our show before.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What are you doing here?

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's possible they came here for saw bones, ass.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's an advice show.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We try to help people who ask us questions

128
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and questions we find in the Yahoo Answers service,

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and we turn them an alchemy like into wisdom.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So let's do that right now.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I believe we have some questions for people

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
who are actually visiting here in the meeting space.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We should also mention, oh, do we not have

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
another microphone that we can...

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yeah, we do right here.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay, we'll get comfy.

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah, we may give people on stage to ask questions.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So think about what you might want to chat about.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Listen, let me be extremely fucking clear about this.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are playing a dangerous game.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because, first off, I'm drunk.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And...

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The only thing I'm bummed about is that I don't have any...

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I had like a Jameson ginger ale for the first show.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now I don't have any more.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But I believe in a higher power that...

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Dear Jesus.

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Dear Jesus, Jameson.

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I haven't talked in a while.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, but that's the one thing.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But don't make it a bummer.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't make it about poopy.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you're going to ask us a question over here,

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
just don't ruin the entire show with your question,

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
or we will save the show,

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and you will not like the sacrifice we have in it

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
in order to get it back on the rails.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Believe me.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Travis, questions.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This question comes from Jeremy Franklin.

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you here?

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is your girlfriend here with you?

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yep.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Great. Terrific.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So here's the question.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is she about to get real?

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My girlfriend stinks like butts.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Whoa!

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No.

170
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Jeremy?

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How dare you, sir?

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So Jeremy actually says,

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
My girlfriend has just moved in with me,

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and it's going great.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Except...

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
She has no sense of bed geography.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She's constantly rolling over on top of me,

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
sleeping diagonally so there's no room for me,

179
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
or kneeing me in her sleep.

180
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How can I train her to sleep like a normal person

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
so I can get good bed sleep?

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't think the two of you sleeping in the same bed

183
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
is going to be a problem.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I understand this question because I have these instincts.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When my wife gets out of bed earlier

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
than I'm going to get good bed,

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I will instantly reorganize in a diagonal position.

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I do not know why.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There's something about the luxury.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
My body's covered by bed space.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No matter...

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Whoa.

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Whoa.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My body's covered with bed space,

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
but there's something about the fact

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
that I'm absorbing an entire bed.

197
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, no.

198
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's about the denial of comfort

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to your pregnant wife

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that is so close to you.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She's already up.

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
She's got to get up early to make my room.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you want to...

204
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is my reason I just sleep in separate beds.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
In separate rooms.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Separate houses.

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I haven't seen my wife in two years.

208
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have a theory that if you don't have this problem

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
with your significant other,

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you're the problem.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Because I think in every relationship...

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's like living around a bed

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
where you don't see the sucker in your head.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Right.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I am a straight-up princess and a pea sleeper.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I am a delicate flower.

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Justin and Sydney are coming to learn this

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because we're showing a hotel room here.

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I build a fucking exoskeleton of pillows around myself.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I need two under the head,

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
one between the elbows,

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and one between the knees.

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I need four pillows.

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We had six in the room as soon as you got in.

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, man.

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's going to suck for two of you guys.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think I'm the troublemaker.

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That was actually a really hard call

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we had to make last night

230
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
because we are staying at the garden.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, the garden, you know.

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's still about 28 between 6 and 7.

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We're staying there.

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We realized that we had four people in the room.

235
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We had six pillows.

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's not going to fly.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Especially since my wife doesn't have

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
her special S-shaped pillow snookle

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that she needs for breakfast.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So I said,

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
we're going to need some more pillows over here.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I called a friend to ask, and they said,

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
how many pillows do you need?

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Did you call them?

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I called because you can't talk to people like anybody.

246
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Like a girl.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Girl didn't call.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Also called to cancel dinner reservations tonight.

250
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And then Justin asked,

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
were they mad?

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
In his defense, they were pretty mad.

253
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They were not psyched about it.

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Everyone calls in front of us and says,

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
we need more pillows.

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know, this is ridiculous.

257
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And they say, how many?

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
And I think we had this moment at the beginning

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
because it's like...

260
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Ideally, like 10.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How many can you get?

262
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How many you got?

263
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
How many do you have?

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How about you start the negotiation?

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We'll work it out.

266
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Exactly.

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't want to make the first offer.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You make the first offer.

269
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I wrote a number down on this piece of paper.

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Send your man out to collect the paper.

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What were we talking about?

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Bad sleepers.

273
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
People are bad at sleeping.

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
See, I'm bad at sleeping.

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I tend to be the one who flares around.

276
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
And then I also wake up from flailing around.

277
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So the number of times I've hit my wife in my sleep.

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In my sleep.

279
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In my sleep.

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And then I've woken up immediately going,

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is that real?

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Did I dream that?

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm a horrible person.

285
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How about a Yahoo?

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, Yahoo.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This Yahoo...

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, that helped.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
See, I think it was sent in by Jacob Locker.

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you, Jacob.

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's by Yahoo Answers.

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hold up.

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Meowchel.

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Who asks,

295
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Would you consider the Tim Allen grunt art?

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I can assume you're familiar.

297
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like an actor, which is considered an artist.

298
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Wait, I just want to make sure we're on the same page.

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So on the count of three,

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
if everybody can give me a Tim Allen grunt.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is going to be fucking awesome.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, one, two, three.

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I just want to say,

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a lot of the people that only get one,

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've never heard Tim Allen go grunt.

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Explain that.

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And raise your hand if I'm right.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I think some people were doing...

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's multiple.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And then the other people were doing

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
the questioning grunt.

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Really?

314
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's so bad.

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Who does that?

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, the breathy.

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The breathy, excitable grunt.

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Then you also have that kind of like

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
you just found out disappointed.

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Being derogative.

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't think he ever had a...

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I think he did.

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Where like, Wilson would say something very...

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wilson?

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That was when Fyre was brought up.

326
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, he would say...

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When Wilson would say something really deep,

328
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
he would go...

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Like, reflected fucking grunt.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're right.

331
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, he has to have a nasal grunt.

332
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He said,

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Artful.

334
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Agree or disagree?

335
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's more artisanal.

336
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I feel like it's a...

337
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I feel like Tim Allen's a comedic artisan.

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But I don't know if I would say it's an art.

339
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's a work of art.

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I mean...

341
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a piece.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a piece.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's a creation.

344
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's an effort.

345
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you think he crafted it?

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Like, he stood in front of the mirror and went,

347
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh.

348
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

349
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Wait.

350
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm on to something.

351
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Hey, sweetie.

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Is this funny?

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
When I do that, do you laugh?

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Do you have nerve problems?

355
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Just imagine...

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I want you to imagine

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
that a T.J. just broke a window with his slingshot

358
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and I walk into the house and I see the window and I'm like,

359
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm very disappointed in T.J.

360
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And when I see the window, I make this noise.

361
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's sort of like a zombie having a stroke.

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
The ring for me started $10.

363
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll tell you what was fucking hard on that show

364
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
were all the wipes.

365
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
All the transitional wipes.

366
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's what it seems.

367
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
God damn.

368
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Can we all tell about how that was the only show

370
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
literally in existence to ever do...

371
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I guess Boy Meets World actually did get a little bit creative

372
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
with its shit.

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Early, like, season one through three.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then they fell off.

375
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And they went straight to Cross Dissolves.

376
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I miss, like, a lawnmower eats up the scene.

377
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's so fun.

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think we have a greatest hits reel

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
that was cute.

380
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's watch that.

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They fell together.

382
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, we don't.

383
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Did we do it?

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's on the USB drive.

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Labeled the best bit ever.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's labeled a very good bit,

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but the Macro is playing the head.

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Is it art?

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Absolutely, yeah.

390
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah.

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Next question.

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Hey, brothers.

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey, Travis.

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, that's the...

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Okay.

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I recently decided that I want to move out of my mom's house.

397
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The problem is that it is expensive

398
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to live anywhere around where I live,

399
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and I am currently paying for schooling,

400
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
so there's not a whole lot for me to offer.

401
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
My brother has offered for me to live with him,

402
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and he said we can discuss the details later.

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But I was wondering what I could do to

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
pay rent without paying cash.

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If you put...

406
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
If you put quotation marks around the word pay,

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
then it gets gross.

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Buying groceries and driving him around

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
since he can't drive himself

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
are the only things I've thought of.

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you could offer some suggestions,

412
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
that would be great.

413
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And that's where we're moving on up to the cheap side.

414
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Yeah, right there.

415
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
All right, right on.

416
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Cool.

417
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Backrubs on demand.

418
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Backrubs on demand.

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, I have a backrubist who lives with me.

420
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
We're also brothers,

421
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
but mainly he rubs my back.

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And that's how he pays.

423
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He pays me with backrubs.

424
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Whoop!

425
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's the reason Wilson never came up

426
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
from behind a switch

427
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
is because he had a brother backrubist.

428
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He was constantly getting a backrub

429
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
whenever he saw him.

430
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because if you had somebody that you had hired

431
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
with rent professionally to rub your back,

432
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I think you would have somebody do it

433
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
in full time, right?

434
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

435
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Eventually the meat would...

436
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
And by full time you mean

437
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
every waking torture hour of his life.

438
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Can I get a drink real quick?

439
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
No, absolutely not.

440
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
These attendants aren't going to release themselves.

441
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Uh, Jesus.

442
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't like anything as much as I like having money,

443
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
so it's really tough.

444
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I mean, you could make him a picture,

445
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
but money would probably be...

446
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Could you make me a vision board,

447
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
like inspirational mindset

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you guys are going to have together?

449
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're going to make him a new one every day?

450
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It would have to be...

451
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Figure out the length of time

452
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you could get away with not paying rent

453
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and his frustration peak,

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and then be like, oh, vision board,

455
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
got you a new one.

456
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
God damn, that is pretty inspirational.

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You're right.

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can hang out for four more days.

459
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's like Dread Pirate Rawlings in the sky.

460
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Good luck.

461
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I will have that picture in the morning.

462
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
How about any other answer?

463
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yep.

464
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
This one was sent in by Jeff Danielson.

465
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you, Jeff.

466
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And thank you to everybody who sent in Yahoo's.

467
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There were trillions, which was exhausting.

468
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They weren't all drew down report,

469
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
but they were mainly.

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They were mostly drew down report.

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He's gained two levels in Yahoo shaman-dom

472
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
since we started this morning.

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Isn't he here?

474
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, he doesn't know.

475
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you, Jeff.

476
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's by Yahoo answers user Fabricio.

477
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's just a name guy.

478
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
By laughing at it, that's racist.

479
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Fabricio has a 4% on Yahoo answers.

480
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We've only recently become aware of the fact

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
that Yahoo answers has like a rating system for users.

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We had somebody who had a 1% in the last episode,

483
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
and god damn, they didn't earn it.

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't think that there's like a rating system

485
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
you can have for like,

486
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
you're a more worthwhile user of Yahoo answers.

487
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're the smallest piece of shit on this website.

488
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Fabricio asks,

489
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,000
does emotion count as an ingredient when cooking?

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's it.

491
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, no details.

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No further questions.

493
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I mean, they say like,

494
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
put a little bit of some special love in it.

495
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Does that go the other way though?

496
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Like, I put a little border in it.

497
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Someone was really fucking angry

498
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
when they made this chili.

499
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You taste it.

500
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't like when I read a recipe on like,

501
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
the internet or a book,

502
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
where they have in the list of ingredients,

503
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
like a little extra love.

504
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And that's a legal document.

505
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hold on, you read a recipe on the internet,

506
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
like that's legal.

507
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Some of us build a shopping list,

508
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
and some of us maybe are confused

509
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
when we see love?

510
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What?

511
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know.

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What am love?

513
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What am love?

514
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I was trying to bake some cupcakes.

515
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So you're suggesting that if you had a recipe

516
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
for turkey chili,

517
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and you went to the store and bought it,

518
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and then followed the instructions,

519
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
put a lot of love in there,

520
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and then you cooked it,

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and it came out,

522
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
and the whole time it was strawberry pie,

523
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
you would be like,

524
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm pressing charges.

525
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is false advertising.

526
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It clearly said chili at the top.

527
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I was curious when it put strawberries in it,

528
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
but okay.

529
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm saying the ingredients list

530
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
is a legally binding document,

531
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and they should have just put like great...

532
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I see a little extra love in there.

533
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You know what I think?

534
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Grow love.

535
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You really showed them.

536
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I know, right?

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If I want to put some extra love in there,

538
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
you know how I show my love?

539
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I made you this.

540
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But if...

541
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What do you care if I had emotion or not?

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're still full.

543
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If you blow a kiss in your turkey chili,

544
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
don't I get to taste it?

545
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Can you taste a kiss in a turkey chili?

546
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I love having built-in punchlines.

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think that's like the crux of home and Peru,

548
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
but I think that's...

549
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can actually build like three fours

550
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
that are showed by hilarious wives.

551
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You get that fence sound of a bitch in there.

552
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You have Tim,

553
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
you go vroom, vroom,

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and you get three fours going to an episode.

555
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Get some discouraged looks from Patricia Heaton.

556
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You cast Richard Korn as the most...

557
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oh, yikes.

558
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Thank you.

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I thought so.

560
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, I didn't think so, obviously.

561
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Thanks, Dog Pound!

562
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thanks, Dog Pound!

563
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, stop.

564
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Okay?

565
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Just stop the Dog Pound.

566
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is the only thing they have.

567
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
They know the difference between the moms

568
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and everybody loves Raymond and...

569
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, this is weird, but...

570
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Go to Dog Pound.

571
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Travis, read a question, please.

572
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Great.

573
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm going to be honest.

574
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm going to be honest.

575
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm going to be honest.

576
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to be honest.

577
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm going to be honest.

578
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm going to be honest.

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to be honest.

580
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to be honest.

581
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to be honest.

582
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,280
Great.

583
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
You're killing me.

584
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
Go faster.

585
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
Go faster.

586
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,280
How could you not...

587
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,000
I've been working as a waitress at a 24-hour

588
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,840
cafe for almost two years now.

589
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Congratulations.

590
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,840
Thank you.

591
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,840
I've never heard of it.

592
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
I've learned ways to handle potentially awkward....

593
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,440
That's what I do works every time.

594
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,040
I've learned ways to handle potentially awkward

595
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,800
situations like tables that are drunk

596
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
or openly fighting,

597
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,480
but I still haven't found a way to manage

598
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,040
declined credit cards

599
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
that isn't totally uncomfortable

600
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,800
for everyone involved.

601
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,680
I'd say the tactful way to say that a card

602
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,040
down especially for people who are obviously on dates and that's from cough

603
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:37,000
it up in Austin Texas yikes I think you know you broke no I think you just have

604
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,320
to make the noise that the audience collectively made and just hear me you

605
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,280
want to fucking explain no they don't have they know they just gave you a

606
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:56,760
piece of plastic that represents dollars like here's my card you put the card on

607
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,200
the table you lean in gingerly to the earth

608
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,040
God can you print out can you have pre-printed out like letters from the

609
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,160
governor like you know how to take credit cards from his bank and then he

610
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,320
bring it back to them with the letter like check the letter man sorry I can't

611
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,160
no can do all you got to do is say I think something's wrong with our

612
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,520
machine the cards not work it works for everyone else but you

613
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,360
fucking machine yeah every person on a date it worked when I spent $500 early

614
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,760
on candy I'm just trying to envision a circumstance of what you're out of money

615
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:46,880
but also pretty happy on your day you got candy waiting to know

616
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:56,280
no matter how else the game goes a roomful of candy you know how the data has to be

617
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:05,400
going for you to be sitting there thinking oh yeah absolutely I think so

618
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:15,640
you have picked the

619
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:55,920
I mean we've gotten shit every show which is bananas like this has been the

620
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,080
most exhausting day I think of all ours but also like one of the best as we keep

621
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:11,480
getting nice shit from everybody and every show we like receiving I'm

622
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,680
exhausted for past me audio quality is not it's not super great and apologies

623
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:22,080
this is the last one though is the last New York live show that we did at the

624
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,320
pit thank you the pit I wish we had done better recording the audio there's a new

625
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,000
live show coming up the LA live show that we recorded Jesus a month ago Jesus

626
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,520
yeah well like three weeks ago the end it ended the second week we'll probably

627
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,800
throw that up later after Justin has a child and probably won't be super funny

628
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,600
for a while when the child of destiny is born yes all these jokes though talking

629
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,240
about all these jokes has gotten me pretty hungry I would say okay so you're

630
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,160
not really reinventing the wheel with this live show money zone interruption

631
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,080
all right you go ahead tough guy guys it's time we think outside the box or

632
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,360
inside the box time to think outside the bun yeah and inside the box okay just

633
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,680
like that you're both sued those are both copyright infringements nature box

634
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:22,920
live moss nature box bought up is nature box nature box does not have fast food

635
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:29,680
inside a nature box nobody does it like Sara Lee well well that that's a little

636
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,120
that's a little on the nose listen you know you're looking at your diet and

637
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,680
you're looking at your tummy and you're saying I need to not snack as much the

638
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:44,200
snacking is killing me Roger it's like me and you say listen let's be honest

639

658
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,520
you've been dying to try this is the moment tons of people have tried it from

659
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,960
our listener base and a lot of them have liked it all right listen I gotta be

660
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,440
sure you guys I don't understand this new advertiser we have I'm hoping Griffin

661
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,760
can explain it to me well that's because your your simple Promethean brain can't

662
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,160
understand the logic of computers I've been learning Prometheus the one who

663
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,800
brought computers to human to the people that's right now that was data that was

664
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,560
data from Star Trek when you travel I remember that episode time here's a fact

665
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:58,320
for you chuckle fucks coding has become the most desired job skill of 2014

666
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,880
whether it's HTML whether it's CSS that stands for cascading style sheets

667
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,320
chuckle fucks yeah I maybe know a thing or two about these subjects I've been

668
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,960
trying to learn it in my brain it's very difficult because I don't understand

669
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:22,480
like maths or sciences but one month is a website that will help you learn these

670
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,680
very very complex methods maths and sciences in a very straightforward way

671
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,320
for instance one month HTML is the easiest way to learn how to code to

672
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,560
build websites here's how it works you have 30 days roughly about a month it's

673
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,560
debatable but roughly the length of one month and you do 30 minutes a day and

674
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,920
then starting from scratch knowing nothing like you idiots do know nothing

675
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:54,960
that is you got me you got me now reel me in you will build idiot an actual

676
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,480
website from scratch starting from day one and you'll be welcomed into a

677
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,920
community of 12,000 more than 12,000 other students learning each other

678
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,120
helping each other touching each other it'll teach you the stuff that you need

679
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:15,040
if you're wanting to apply for a web focused job like HTML and CSS you get

680
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,480
video tutorials you get hands-on exercises and training and by the end of

681
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,120
the class you will have three projects including an online portfolio a blog

682
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,400
template and a landing page which is like basically everything you need in

683
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,100
this digital era that's amazing and if you if you already know HTML they have

684
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,680
other classes too for other for other stuff other coding things maybe jQuery

685
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,880
maybe Ruby maybe Python I have no idea I have one to teach you how to use

686
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,240
Facebook yeah they do rails is good they have one called Facebook for me ma's and

687
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,440
it teaches you the difference between a wall post and a comment and a private

688
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,980
message join right now at one month comm slash my brother you get 25% off Wow do

actually probably do this there are there's some good resources to learn how

693
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:20,040
to do this online but a lot of them aren't like super comprehensive like

694
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,960
they'll give you the groundwork and then sort of back off from there this one

709
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,520
just like a dad with a mustache and like a construction helmet and he would get

710
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,160
himself into thorny situations to extract children from those weird thing

711
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,440
you never saw his own kid he would talk about him a lot he didn't look wistfully

turkeys turkeys I am so excited for this Yahoo it was sent in by emerald member

737
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:09,080
level 13 yahoo shaman drew that it is by gap answers user bulls-cubs fan who asks

738
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:15,880
do you think the clock has sex at noon and midnight

739
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:28,000
I think I did you think about it here the big hand is on top of the little

740
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,440
hand so do you think at noon and night they have sex also I'm incredibly

741
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:55,200
stoned yeah I can't even ever become 69

742
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:20,440
works everybody alive if you don't put this on

743
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:28,720
you're right you know the worst part of this question is the fucking dumbest and

744
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,680
after we decided to put it in the show I had to sit there and think if there were

745
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,520
times when the hands also touched at the noon and midnight and it was it was a

746
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,840
crazy logic puzzle for a four-year-old

747
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:52,000
18 people in this audience are thinking about it right now no just me okay

748
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:21,160
you'll get someone down here yeah yes remember the metrics hey just put the

749
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,840
folks at home that's the sound of his chair scooting back he did my name is

750
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:34,120
Matt and my question is I started a new job in December and you know trying to

751
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,960
get my foot in the door I wrote up a real interesting cover letter where I

752
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,600
mentioned that I played Dungeons and Dragons and that's what got me the

753
00:37:41,600 --> 00:38:07,320
interview so it's great whenever when my job started if we would somebody who

754
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,840
would come into the office they would be like that's that's Matt he's our

755
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:16,360
dungeon master and it was funny for a while now there's certain expectations

756
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,560
you know more professional people in and the joke is sort of lost its much to me

757
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,880
yeah my way is how you bring it back do I suck it up and just accept it or what

758
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:56,680
can I do to get a nickname I fucking need them right now do you play with the

759
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,080
dudes that you work with no but the guy who is looking through resumes said oh I

760
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,480
used to play with my older brother when I was young and that's why your resume

761
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,760
stood out but can I tell you something I'm sure you made the job that's it

762
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:29,640
dumb yes there are people who would be happy to have a job where everyone

763
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:59,560
I just keep it at your desk have a bunch of skulls with like candles

764
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:04,600
on top of them what's melted down over it you can be I found this working in a

765
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,480
lot of jobs you can be such a character at the office that they often will

766
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,640
forget the work part you become so essential as part of their like daily

767
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,840
routine things they see things they interact with you can just not do the

768
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:38,840
work did you ever dungeon master when you play D&D yeah that's that's why I

769
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,360
got it oh what's great is you want to play your

770
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:55,120
card so that eventually you get introduced like this so you gotta play

771
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:01,920
your guys like this you want to get it so that eventually they say this is Matt

772
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:24,640
in a really like shameful embarrassing like don't talk to me you seem to be

773
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:32,520
adventure you found me once more this is my rat don't have rats you can have

774
00:41:32,520 --> 00:42:00,640
rats here was sent in by read Carpenter think you read it's by a green 33% not

bad still failing great green asks is it possible to eat a salt shaker is it

776
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,200
physically possibly for any human being to eat a salt shaker without assistance

777
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,280
like breaking it up beforehand as in actually putting a whole salt shaker in

778
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:30,800
your mouth chewing it up and swallowing do you ever wonder like when we find

779
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,800
these questions like what circumstance made someone go how about the fucking

780
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:40,640
coolest like business power move

781
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,240
we're gonna acquire your company for half the price if you ask for no you're

782
00:42:46,240 --> 00:43:06,280
not okay yeah I guess you got a good point yeah can we have the I'm having

783
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:16,560
salt and there is someone in this country who is having a very great stand

784
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:44,280
off with a salt shaker I mean some guys like that won't do that I just love that

785
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,840
the question is not is it recommended to eat a salt shaker listen I'm not looking

786
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,440
to cheat by breaking it up ahead of time I know I could do that and that would be

787
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,880
cool can I break it with my teeth the party thinks the salt would be the worst

788
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,440
part all that's all wait not the glass shards of the metal top there's a dude

789
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,120
who like ate an airplane there's like that dude that was on Guinness and he

790
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:27,120
thought or maybe this Ripley's believe it or not and now I'm saying yeah about

791
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,080
two months ago I was promoted to a new position at my job I love my job and the

792
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:35,700
trust my boss has put in me but the truth is I often feel like I have no

793
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,160
idea what the fuck I'm doing not only do I not have any previous job experience

794
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,240
in this field but it's not even related to what I went to school for I started

795
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,840
almost completely cold I like to think I'm a fast learner and my bosses seem

796
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,680
happy with my work so far but I still get overwhelmed I worry about earning

797
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,960
the respect of my more experienced co-workers how do you deal with

798
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:09,440
imposter syndrome and that's from sheep in wolf's clothing on the darkness all

799
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,160
right there's only one option you know what it is right oh yeah you got a fake

800
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:24,640
you gotta pick big you gotta pick big I know I'm gonna fuck up for a while now

801
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,400
for a good line for two months I know everybody in the office suspected I

802
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,960
don't know what I'm doing I'm 12 I know I know what you're saying you look like

803
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,360
an adult here is this fortune-telling machine

804
00:45:38,360 --> 00:46:06,960
I don't know what

805
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,720
good can you ask for a different job can you do that at a job you got anything

806
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:25,040
easier can I try boss boss would be cool boss is cool let's trade these I'll be

807
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:31,240
boss you'd be whatever my job is I'm not entirely sure what if the twist is like

808
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:37,560
the boss when someone asked you to do something just look at him go well how

809
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:43,680
would you do it and then when they say but I agree I'm gonna do this that's

810
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,360
what I was gonna say pretty much what I've been doing so thank you

811
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,120
can you show me one time

812
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Susan you're a surgeon you should have said something about your beginning a

813
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:10,800
long time with many many failed surgeries again maybe because she was

814
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,680
robbed of so many years jumping from 12 to whatever she is now she wants to rock

815
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:39,240
others it's like dark big big big saw started with your art

816
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:54,320
what should we get a live one yeah yeah we yes

817
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:12,640
short walk so we don't need to cover anything what's going on so every

818
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,920
morning my breakfast at the same deli that's like right down the street from

819
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:21,880
my work goes at this sign that's like a smoothie with Red Bull and I can't

820
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,640
decide whether this is a great idea or the absolute worst idea so brothers I'm

821
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:33,400
really curious is it how early is too early for soda Steve how early is too

822
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,160
early for diarrhea

823
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,920
we're wearing glasses right now it's like we said five hour energy drinks

824
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,400
backstage before Travis literally said okay you to move that down so you know

825
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:58,160
redirect your comfort is important we were I realized at what time was it it

826
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,720
would have been about eight o'clock we're eating dinner I realized that like

827
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,280
I have been meaning to take a five-hour energy shot all night and I'm not not

828
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,000
not staying awake any longer than I have to today so I can't have I can't have

829
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,120
shows over at 11 or what-have-you and then still be awake for another two

830
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,920
hours because I took my five-hour energy and Travis says to me fine just take

831
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:29,600
four hours worth okay here's the thing for a long time I've always wondered if

832
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,720
you do half of a five-hour energy drink do you get two and a half hours of a

833
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:55,400
hundred percent energy or five hours of like 50% energy but I think that is a

834
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:03,120
really rough way to get your day started not not the not the actual effects of

835
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:09,600
it it's fucking gross it's gross it's super gross

836
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,080
what if you come to depend on it then it's like oh that's Steve he drinks a

837
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:20,960
Red Bull smoothie every night oh that's Steve's morning slop he has to slap that

838
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,160
down his his gullet or else he just can't get started

839
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,440
Steve's a little sweaty he didn't have his glock on his mouth. Don't talk to him, tell him about my glock.

840
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,440
What if that deli shuts down? You'll die.

841
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,440
What else is in this smoothie except Red Bull?

842
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,440
I think it's like strawberry, banana, and kiwi.

843
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,440
Why are you saying those ingredients like they're gross?

844
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,440
It's like kiwi, I don't know, there's definitely Red Bull in them.

845
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
That's the good part.

846
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,440
Some kind of fruit?

847
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,440
Are you supposed to put carbonated shit in?

848
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,440
Carbonation is by its very definition not especially smooth.

849
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Listen, smoothies are kind of like freestyle like remixes anyway.

850
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,440
I've thrown celery in smoothies. What? You can do anything.

851
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:15,440
Wow, putting behind bars. A vegetable?

852
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,440
So what do you want me to do?

853
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Don't do it, don't fucking do it.

854
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,440
You should stop other people from doing it.

855
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:27,440
Everybody scream.

856
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,440
You like this one?

857
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
I do like that one.

858
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Travis likes this one so we'll do that.

00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,440
Some terminology to clear up.

869
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,440
It wasn't really an accident.

870
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Oh, he had the higher ground and he went for him. He got his legs done. I guess the lava was not intentional for either party.

871
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:25,440
If you're wondering, that's why he was yelling, no.

872
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:36,440
I think if they have the cybernetic parts for all of his burned out body, then I saw Bicentennial Man and they fucking perfected that shit.

873
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Okay, wait.

874
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,440
What you're telling me is...

875
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,440
Bicentennial Man and Star Wars exist in the same universe.

876
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
Right?

877
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:46,440
But different canons.

878
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:54,440
What you're telling me is that if Darth Vader were to in one flourish remove his copies, you would see behind him a separate...

879
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,440
Robin Williams penis from Bicentennial Man.

880
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,440
Perfect one to one.

881
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,440
Because listen, they've perfected that technology, but they don't want to risk chopping and screwing it too much.

882
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,440
So you get the same model across and you can get it in a back alley.

883
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,440
Wait, is it the same mechanical penis?

884
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,440
Are you saying...

885
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,440
The past Apple generation.

886
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:22,440
Are you saying that in a scene where Bicentennial Man dies and the camera goes to the right, you would see Darth Vader go...

887
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:40,440
I hope somebody was taking pictures of that out of context.

888
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:41,440
That's exactly...

889
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,440
For those of you listening at home...

890
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:48,440
Justin stood up and very ludely pointed to his bathing suit region.

891
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,440
To my Bicentennial Ball.

892
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,440
Bicentennial Man's? Is that what I...

893
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,440
I'm gonna stick with Dom.

894
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,440
Stick with Dom.

895
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,440
What?

896
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,440
Dom Pound?

897
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,440
What?

898
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,440
Sorry.

899
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,440
Does Darth Vader have...

900
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,440
I don't think the Empire would have any use for Darth Vader.

901
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,440
Okay, but here's the thing.

902
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,440
If not, he comes up off the table.

903
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,440
As if he's looking at Palpatine and he's like, okay, good, ankle, knees.

904
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
What the fuck?

905
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:29,440
So I'm just gonna pee inside.

906
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,440
Right in the screen.

907
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:37,440
The good news is I can't drink.

908
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,440
But I'm just gonna pee in the suit.

909
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,440
All right then.

910
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,440
She's always so angry all the time.

911
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,440
I can't stop thinking about Robin Williams' penis.

912
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,440
Because you think about it, because we're thinking about it.

913
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,440
So by the end of this episode, it's just gonna be a recurring string of

914
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:04,440
referencing Robin Williams' penis and just going...

915
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,440
This is something I'm actively thinking about, Dom.

916
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,440
Because I bet...

917
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,440
No, hear me out.

918
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,440
No!

919
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,440
I bet it's a lot like his knuckles.

920
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:24,440
But just one.

921
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
But just one.

922
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,440
There wouldn't be four.

923
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,440
Yeah.

924
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,440
I don't even know more.

925
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,440
Is the show done?

926
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,440
Yeah, I think we might be done with the show.

927
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,440
No, never.

928
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,440
I'm gonna keep thinking about Robin Williams' penis all night.

929
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,440
Let's do another...

930
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,440
Do you have any more in your notebook?

931
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,440
What about the...

932
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,440
What is it?

933
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
Tuxedo one.

934
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,440
Oh yeah, that's a good one.

935
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Guys, just wait.

936
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
You're gonna love this question.

937
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
Guaranteed.

938
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,440
It's very good.

939
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:59,440
Two years ago, I bought a tuxedo for my wedding through an online vendor.

940
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,440
It didn't fit right and wasn't made to be tailored.

941
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,440
So in desperation, I just bought a second one from the department store.

942
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,440
Now I own two tuxedos like I'm some kind of big shot.

943
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,440
I haven't had much luck selling it online.

944
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,440
So what can I do with a second slightly ill-fitting tuxedo?

945
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,440
And that's from Sartorial in San Fran.

946
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,440
Does anybody...

947
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,440
Quick poll.

948
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,440
Does anybody in here own a tuxedo?

949
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,440
There's like five.

950
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,440
That's not a lot of tuxedos.

951
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
Owned, though.

952
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:28,440
This is what I want to understand.

953
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,440
Did they not have renting tuxedos where this guy lives?

954
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,440
What kind of life are you living that you're like,

955
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,440
I'm gonna use this often enough that I need it?

956
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,440
I better get married in a while.

957
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,440
That sounds awesome.

958
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,440
I wish I was living here.

959
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,440
Not really, because I don't really like anything that I've ever been to

960
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,440
where I had to wear a tuxedo.

961
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,440
But I'm sure that you enjoy the satisfaction of design.

962
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,440
No judgment for me.

963
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,440
I think you're gonna need to wear the smaller one and hulk out.

964
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,440
What if he wore the smaller one underneath the bigger one?

965
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,440
Can you imagine the psych addict?

966
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,440
He has warm in here.

967
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:05,440
He's hot.

968
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
Sweat tux.

969
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,440
My restrictive tux.

970
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:16,440
Could you build robotics into it and make it like the...

971
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,440
Hey, you are backing into Robin Williams Phoenix.

972
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:28,440
No one should ever back into Robin Williams Phoenix.

973
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,440
This guy's really taking a beating this episode.

974
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,440
No, I was making...

975
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,440
Anything else?

976
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,440
I was making a super great...

977
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,440
Jackie Chan's the tuxedo.

978
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,440
Jackie Chan.

979
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,440
Jennifer Love Hewitt.

980
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,440
He has a magic tuxedo.

981
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,440
It's been a really long time since I've clutched it.

982
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Can you tear one up and use it to fake disasters?

983
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,440
Like you walk into a room in a regular one.

984
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,440
You switch, come out in the destroyed one.

985
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,440
Like, wow, do not go in there.

986
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,440
Woo!

987
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:04,440
Ate Ventura.

988
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,440
Ate Ventura was like, tuxedo.

989
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,440
He goes...

990
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,440
It's been a weird day, you guys.

991
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,440
Yeah, it's been a long day.

992
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:18,440
What other movies have tuxedos?

993
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,440
Is there a name?

994
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,440
I think we should be done.

995
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:31,440
Have we given...

996
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,440
You're on my blood!

997
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,440
Take my blood, negotiator.

998
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:38,440
No tuxedos in that.

999
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,440
Have you ever noticed how many movies there are without tuxedos in them?

1000
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,440
Let's name a few.

1001
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,440
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1002
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,440
We hope you've had a lot of fun.

1003
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1004
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,440
Thank you.

1005
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,440
Thank you to Michael and Kevin and Ronnie, everybody from the People's Improv Theater.

1006
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,440
They have done everything.

1007
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,440
We are like babies that they have nurtured all day.

1008
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,440
We have no idea what we're doing, and they kept us alive.

1009
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
They are wonderful.

1010
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:07,440
They have been our heroes.

1011
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,440
Thank you so much to you fine people.

1012
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,440
The dog pound.

1013
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,440
Thank you so much.

1014
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:17,440
And also, I enjoy your friendship.

1015
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,440
And thank you to our wives and our dads for being supportive, being in the show.

1016
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Our sisters.

1017
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:27,440
Our sisters are wonderful people.

1018
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:35,440
Big thanks to SawBelt for just like, their first day of life.

1019
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,440
On your way out the door, make sure to stop by the merch table.

1020
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,440
We have a bunch of new merch.

1021
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:40,440
Do this quick because it makes me uncomfortable.

1022
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,440
I know.

1023
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:42,440
It was made just for this show.

1024
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,440
Eventually, it will be online for sale, but you got the first crack at it.

1025
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,440
We got awesome patches, button packs that you guys are going to dig.

1026
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,440
Awesome new tote bags.

1027
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,440
Pack your bags and move away bag.

1028
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,440
On your way out, if nothing else, grab one of these postcards.

1029
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,440
It will give you a coupon code for 20% off if you order stuff online.

1030
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,440
So it's really great.

1031
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,440
Make sure you grab it.

1032
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,440
And we'll be out there doing a real quick short meet and greet before we call it a day.

1033
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,440
So come see us after the show.

1034
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,440
Thanks to, I guess, DMX and Sean for all joking along with their smart theme song.

1035
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,440
X, go and give it to you.

1036
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Chopped and screwed by a group from McElroy.

1037
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,440
And also, it's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1038
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,440
Thank you.

1039
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,440
Thank you to McElroy for having us.

1040
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Thank you to New York City.

1041
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,440
Ah, boy.

1042
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Good jokes, guys.
