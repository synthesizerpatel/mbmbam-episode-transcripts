1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:50,880
Hello everyone, and welcome to the event you've waited for all year long.

6
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,680
The season finale of My Brother, My Brother and Me is here.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm both of your dads. I've been both your dads this whole time.

8
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
Griffin reveals an embarrassing secret.

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,600
It's not embarrassing. I'm so proud of you two. I love you so much. Every week,

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,280
you come out here and you do your best, and I love you so much, and I'm your dad.

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,080
Wait, so then who's the guy that's been claiming to be our dad?

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
He's your grandpa.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,680
Who will live? Who will die?

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,520
We all, I mean, we're all just sitting down. We all live. Who will be sick?

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,280
Um, Travis.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
Who will get sleepy?

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,200
I would bet Travis. I know this about-

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Who will suffer from ennui?

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
I know this about you two because I'm your proud dad,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,320
and Travis gets sick more than you, Justin.

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,040
That is true.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,160
My dad is younger than I am.

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Yeah, it's one of those Terminators.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,320
Reality bends around on itself, and the advice show for the Modron era.

25
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
I can't believe people are going to have to wait all

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,120
summer long for these answers to be revealed.

27
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,160
To be fair, we'll do our reruns during the summer, do a couple of summer specials.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah, we gots to get it up.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,960
Little bitches and me got a bunch of bullshit about ghosts and horses and shit,

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,400
and it's like, I've heard this one before.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,160
We gots to get our episode count up to a hundo so we can get Cindy.

32
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,360
That's true.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,240
We can do a couple episodes over the summer where the few of us go to work at a beach resort,

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
so it's a little bit out of the normal setting,

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
but then one of us ends up falling in love with the resort owner's daughter,

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,800
and then hilarity ensues because she thinks that we're just a preppy,

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,880
but we think that she's really stuck up.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,480
I think in my fiction here, it's become that all three of us are in love with her at once.

39
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,520
The good news is that although my brother and my brother and me is going away for the summer,

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,920
it will be replaced by a mid-season replacement.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,560
It's a reality dating show called My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,880
How does that one work?

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,920
Now, that is a very different program.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,000
I think you're all still really going to enjoy it.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,680
There's a lot of scintillation and a lot of-

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,240
Ventilation.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,320
Just ventilation and nausea.

48
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,680
It's been perforated to allow the smoke that we generate,

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,520
just our sexy smoke that we generate during the dating show portion of the show.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,200
Got to let that out or else it's a real health hazard.

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
We should introduce ourselves.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,320
My name is Justin McElroy.

53
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,200
I will be mid-season replaced by Yolo Swaggins,

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,720
but for now, I'm Justin McElroy.

55
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
I'm Travis McElroy, and I plan on staying on as executive producer.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,920
I'm Griffin McElroy, and yeah, I don't have shit to do.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,080
I really don't have shit to do this summer.

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,280
This summer's starting to look like a bummer.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,160
Okay, let's get into the advice actually because I'm ready.

60
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,960
My body's ready.

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,200
What is the statute of limitations on apologizing for a dumb offense given to a friend?

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,000
I dated a friend's ex a couple years ago.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
I had her permission.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,800
She seemed happy for us.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,120
Unfortunately, the relationship was a train wreck and it ended badly.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
Oh, sorry, I handled it badly.

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,320
Uh, she and this guy are still good friends, and she is still one of my besties,

68
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,040
but I feel like I've never made amends for what an idiot I was.

69
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,200
Would it be super weird to apologize to her for it now,

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,280
or should I just let sleeping dogs lie?

71
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
That's from Monster Engine.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,480
Jeez, I think it's, I think you done fucked up.

73
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,440
I don't, I think that that is the kind of thing that you just, apologies?

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
No, wait, but here's my con- I'm confused.

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,440
I'm confused because it sounds like you want to apologize for your, to your friend

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
because your relationship with somebody else went badly.

77
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,080
No, no, they want to apologize for their friend for dating their ex.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,120
No, her, her friend was totally cool with her dating her.

79
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
She had her permission.

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
Yeah, sure she was.

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,080
Well, I think the problem is that the relationship didn't end so hot,

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
and it may have put strain on them.

83
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,800
By and large, I usually think apologizing is a good thing.

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,040
I mean, it may be awkward for you, but I think people appreciate it because,

85
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,680
I mean, worst case, one of two scenarios will happen.

86
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
Either A, they've been harboring resentment this entire time,

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,920
and they'll be relieved to finally get that off their chest,

88
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,280
or they won't think it's a big deal and you'll be relieved

89
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
because you'll find out that they didn't care as much as you thought they did.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,520
And either way, it's, it's, I think that's a W for you.

91
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
But if they burn your house down,

92
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
and then they're like, sorry, bro, that was out of line.

93
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,160
Is that really gonna, is that really gonna patch things up?

94
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
Is that really gonna, gonna suit you?

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,760
Do you mean metaphorically, or do you mean like by apologizing to your friend,

96
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,080
you'll make them burn your house down?

97
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm saying there are certain offenses.

98
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,520
And burning their house down is tantamount to dating their ex.

99
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,760
Now, Griffin, am I, am I correct in my assumption

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,480
that if a friend of yours burned your house down,

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,640
you would prefer they just look at you and say,

102
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,080
guess, guess these things, these things happen, eh?

103
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,480
How about this, actions speak louder than words.

104
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't want to hear, I'm sorry, I want to see it.

105
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,600
I want you to build me a new house,

106
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
or I want you to go, go buy me a key lime pie or something.

107
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,120
Do something sweet for me.

108
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
Build me a new ex-boyfriend.

109
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,320
Build him, build him for me.

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,840
Better, faster, stronger.

111
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
Maybe it'll be like when they built robot stuff on.

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Yeah, we have the technology.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,960
Man, that was fucked up, that plot line.

114
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,920
He breathed life into an inanimate object.

115
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,160
Urkel like played God.

116
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,920
That's like some Isaac Asimov, like ethical shit,

117
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,200
and he just ignored all of it.

118
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
His science was irresponsible, is what I'm saying.

119
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
He was so obsessed with whether or not he could,

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,520
he didn't stop to think, did I do that?

121
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
I have a suggestion, Monster Engine,

122
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,160
and it's that three words, I think, in vino veritas.

123
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
You're saying get this, Travis, this is terrible.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
No, no, no, no.

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm saying share a bottle of wine with your friend

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,160
in a hangout and let it like come up.

127
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,840
That's like, well, that way it's not like out of the blue

128
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,920
or anything like you're hanging out and you could do like,

129
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,520
you know, by the way, and you'll feel

130
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,480
a little bit more comfortable,

131
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,760
they'll feel a little bit more comfortable.

132
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,600
You guys can have a good cry about it and get it over with.

133
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,160
No, no, no, no, no, because there is a high probability

134
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,120
that this particular operation will go sideways

135
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,920
and you're going to need all of your faculties

136
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,280
if you're gonna get out of that one.

137
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,600
Exactly.

138
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,320
You could do the like dump your cup into the potted plant

139
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,360
while she's drinking.

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,880
Yeah, you take the sips.

141
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,840
I'm saying there's also the punch restraints in your brain.

142
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,360
Those get loosened up.

143
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,840
Envino punchitas is the alternate,

144
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
the flip side of that Latin coin.

145
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah, that's fair.

146
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,160
That was also my favorite Jason Statham movie.

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,480
God, I would watch that movie.

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,640
I'm gonna need a bottle of wine

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,720
if I'm gonna get us out of this one.

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,840
My punch receptors, my punch blockers,

151
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
they are engaged by the government.

152
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,600
Well, why doesn't he just break us out of here?

153
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Can't you see this man is sober?

154
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,560
He's sober.

155
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,520
He has a church house.

156
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,640
He needs booze.

157
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,680
Give me those apples.

158
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,640
We're gonna put them in this water for like two months.

159
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
Just hold out.

160
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,600
I got this.

161
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,640
Is that Windex?

162
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,200
Crikey.

163
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
We're getting out of here.

164
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,440
Shit, sorry.

165
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,800
I apologize for everything that's happened.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,880
Griffin, you have a Yahoo answer.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,480
I only got a few this week.

168
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
I'm gonna be honest.

169
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
I appreciate the people who sent them in.

170
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,680
Thank you so much.

171
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,360
I had to dip in the back catalog though.

172
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
My boy Ira Ray, nowhere to be seen.

173
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,880
Jacob Locker.

174
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,000
Jacob Locker might be dead.

175
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
Has anyone checked his Jacob Locker?

176
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Has anyone checked?

177
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,880
He might be inside of his Jacob Locker.

178
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,800
Or he keeps his thoughts.

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,520
This Yahoo was sent in by Mary Turner.

180
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,560
Thanks, Mary.

181
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Juliette, who asks,

182
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,360
a boy at school got dacked, pants pulled down today at school.

183
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,320
Was he still sad?

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,600
A boy today at school got dacked, pants pulled down

185
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,360
in front of everyone and he was crying and it's the guy I like.

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,720
He was crying, then he stopped.

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
Then he was crying again, but then he stopped.

188
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,280
And when school finished, I said to him,

189
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,400
I hope you feel better.

190
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,320
I have sort of gone through the same thing.

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
I've heard that boys are stronger than girls

192
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
with these kind of things,

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,880
but would he still be sad on the inside?

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,440
I've never heard dacked before.

195
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,940
No.

196
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,440
Oh.

197
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,180
You know, I got dacked once.

198
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm still sad about it.

199
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,820
Being a kid is the absolute pits, man.

200
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,100
They are savages.

201
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,420
If that happened in the adult world,

202
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,460
that would be the flashpoint of a major trial.

203
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,940
Exactly.

204
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,700
It would be everybody's going to court.

205
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,860
It happens in a life of a kid.

206
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,060
That's Tuesday.

207
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,740
I have some kid that's fucked up.

208
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,940
I've never heard a phrase like that,

209
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,460
but that's really messed up.

210
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,700
The only bullying I ever received was it was a rainy day.

211
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,460
I was in sixth grade and outside of school,

212
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,900
this fucking kid I had never met before,

213
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,340
a man I had never met,

214
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,020
fucking ran up to me and spear tackled me into the mud

215
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,180
and just got up, laughed, walked away.

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,500
Never fucking talked to that dude ever.

217
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,060
I don't even know-

218
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,140
It actually turned out to be Griffin from the future.

219
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,900
It may have been me from the future.

220
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,460
He was stopping an assassin's bullet from killing him.

221
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,380
Oh, man.

222
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,380
But I remember that fucking kid.

223
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,260
That was when I was a young man.

224
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,500
I had been playing on a playground

225
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,860
while our parents were doing something else.

226
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,540
I was young.

227
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,420
I was probably like eight.

228
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,820
And at the end of the hangout,

229
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:57,540
right before our parents came to get us,

230
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,860
this kid who I had like barely spoken to the entire time

231
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,700
punches me in the stomach and says,

232
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,620
I've been wanting to do that all night,

233
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,980
which is like awesome because it wasn't just bullying.

234
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
It was like, oh, that's me.

235
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,180
That's my steez, apparently.

236
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,940
That's the vibe I'm putting out

237
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,660
is that I make people secretly want to punch me

238
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,980
until their punch blockers can't take it anymore.

239
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,380
Isn't it nice to be wanted though, Justin?

240
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,300
Isn't it nice to be the object of somebody's affection?

241
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,100
Somebody else was looking across the playground

242
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,460
and saw that kid punch you and said,

243
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,980
I can't believe I missed my shot.

244
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,900
Yeah, I was going to punch him.

245
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
I'm going to think about that one.

246
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,340
Hey, do you mind if I just still punch?

247
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,060
Yeah, go ahead.

248
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,180
To answer your question.

249
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,100
Yes, he's still sad and he always will be.

250
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Forever.

251
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,540
I'm still talking about this time a kid punched me.

252
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,180
I'm 32.

253
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,680
Exactly.

254
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:57,140
But to have that happen to somebody that you're crushing on.

255
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,180
Oh, man.

256
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,860
What a bum.

257
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,140
Like, what a bummer to like,

258
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,420
if you're lusting after Dennis Quaid

259
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,700
and you see him on the street like,

260
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,660
oh my God, Dennis Quaid, this whole time, my whole life.

261
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,300
I've loved you ever since I saw you in inner space.

262
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,540
And just, I've waited for this magic moment

263
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
and then someone runs up and pulls his pants down.

264
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
You're like, I'm done.

265
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm out.

266
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,220
Unless.

267
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,100
Unless.

268
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,740
Unless.

269
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,260
The downstairs is real good.

270
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,620
No, even that.

271
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,060
Even that, because like, even when it's a prime pony,

272
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,780
seeing it without-

273
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,060
Oh, in that context?

274
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,180
Seeing it without preparation,

275
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,220
seeing it because someone else made it come out

276
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,500
is like the worst that it could possibly happen.

277
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,300
There's only one response for the kid

278
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,780
and that has been docked in this situation

279
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,380
is to raise his arms and scream,

280
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,580
are you not entertained?

281
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,460
You know that Gryffin that?

282
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,380
It's funny you use that specific example

283
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,540
because that happened to me when I was crushing on Randy Quaid.

284
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,580
But the person that pulled his pants down was Randy Quaid.

285
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,060
Yeah, so he said dingus time

286
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,500
and then he pulled his pants down.

287
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,020
He said, get a look at this, J. Edgar Hoover.

288
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,500
And then he said, now we have to flee this hotel room quick.

289
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,740
Quick, let's get out of here, Justin.

290
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,260
And then you two fucked?

291
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,060
Well, no, we made love.

292
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm pretty sure he doesn't make love.

293
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,860
He makes plans.

294
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,580
He makes plans to fuck and then he executes them.

295
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,580
He executes on his strategy to make love.

296
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,700
This poor kid is never gonna recover from this

297
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,860
and you should probably move on to another sexual conquest.

298
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,660
He's ruined.

299
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,100
He's permanently spoiled.

301
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,220
But it was nice of you to say,

302
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,340
that's a weird thing to offer somebody condolences for though.

303
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,540
Hey, same thing.

304
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,580
Sorry for your loss.

305
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,700
Similar thing happened to me.

306
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,260
Oh God, no, my pants weren't pulled down.

307
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,220
Jesus Christ, no.

308
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,620
I would never, listen to me.

309
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,740
I would never recover.

310
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,980
That's in a way that gives him permission

311
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,500
because if he can recover, it makes him feel strong.

312
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,940
He's not going to recover though.

313
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,020
It's like, if you recover from getting your head cut off,

314
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,460
you're gonna be so much stronger for it.

315
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,260
What if this is like his superhero origin?

316
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,220
What possible power could he have gleaned from this?

317
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,260
The belter.

318
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,820
Okay, so it's just like a man who wears a belt

319
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,780
and suspenders at the same time.

320
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,220
He wears like eight belts.

321
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,700
Okay, and he has his weapons.

322
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,380
He can remove one as a weapon.

323
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,380
Ultimate irony though, the belts are so heavy

324
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,580
that they pull his pants down.

325
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,180
That's his weakness.

326
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,900
If he removes more than one belt at a time,

327
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,060
it's not enough to hold up the sheer weight of belts.

328
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,100
We're gonna need three belts to bring this guy down.

329
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,980
Please, the belter.

330
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,540
I can't do that again.

331
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,860
You know, I'm thinking about it.

332
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,580
I think I saw a lot of people get pantsed or dacked,

333
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,580
you know, at middle school.

334
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,340
Please, Griffin, I'm trying to stay relevant.

335
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,860
Please, can you stick with that?

336
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:57,460
I saw tons of people get dac attacked in middle school

337
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,060
and maybe even early high school and like church camp.

338
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,540
And every time I saw people dac somebody,

339
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
they always just pulled down their pants

340
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,460
and not their underpants.

341
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,380
And that seems like a kindness to me.

342
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,460
Is there like an unwritten code that like,

343
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,740
if you are going to dac somebody, grab light?

344
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,900
Don't like grab two big old handfuls

345
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,580
because you're gonna get boxers too.

346
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,460
And if you do that,

347
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,900
then maybe it's a defense mechanism for the attacker

348
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,140
because they don't want to do a sex crime accidentally.

349
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,900
That is actually in one of the appendices

350
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,180
of the Geneva Convention.

351
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,260
It is a war crime of middle school

352
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,580
to pull someone's pants and underwear down.

353
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,340
You can't be tried for that.

354
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,620
Hey, let me ask you guys another question.

355
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,120
Okay.

356
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
I'm having a little bit of a moral dilemma.

357
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,620
A few months ago, due to an ongoing conflict

358
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,140
with a roommate, I had to evict her

359
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,700
because we live in an area where it's difficult

360
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,820
to find affordable housing.

361
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,140
My other roommates and I allowed her cat to stay

362
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,980
in the apartment until she could find a place

363
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,580
where she can have the cat.

364
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,220
Well, she just signed a lease on an apartment

365
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,420
where she cannot have her cat

366
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,900
and has more or less abandoned him.

367
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,140
The worst part is the cat's owner keeps coming over

368
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,620
to the apartment to visit her cat,

369
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,860
which entails her hanging out in my roommate's room

370
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,540
while she ignores the cat.

371
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,380
She's not even paying for the cost of foods

372
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,420
and other needs.

373
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,100
So after my novella of a backstory,

374
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,980
here's my question.

375
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,660
Can I just give the cat away?

376
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,540
Can I just start looking for a new home

377
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,100
for this, for the most part, abandoned cat?

378
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,700
Or do I need to give this person time

379
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,580
to do something about it?

380
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,980
It's been two months and no effort has been made

381
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,500
to find a different situation for it.

382
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,060
That's from feline frustration in Frisco.

383
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
Jesus Christ.

384
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,420
You made a tactical error, and now you have to live with it.

385
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,220
When you do something like that, like evict somebody,

386
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,540
you are cutting them out of your life.

387
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,380
They knew that by leaving that cat there,

388
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,500
they were leaving a foothold.

389
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,060
Mm-hmm.

390
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,100
You have to commit to cutting people out of your life.

391
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,940
They literally might as well have just literally

392
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,140
wedged the cat in the door,

393
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,500
literally put the cat in between the door and doorframe.

394
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,460
Oh, goodness.

395
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,300
I don't know what to say.

396
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,180
I don't think you can give someone's cat away

397
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,300
without being the bad guy.

398
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,340
Yeah, Justin, I think that's probably true.

399
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,780
I don't think you're allowed to release custody

400
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,020
of somebody else's cat to someone else.

401
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,860
But what is the other option?

402
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,700
I feel like there's a definite ultimatum in the water.

403
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,620
Mr. Boots is my cat now.

404
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,340
That's it.

405
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,700
He is mine.

406
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,780
Give that sweet little pussy bear sweet nuzzles and cuddles

407
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,220
for the rest of its life.

408
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,980
That's the other solution.

409
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,540
I guess, but then it's like-

410
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,100
But you don't want to pay for the life of this thing.

411
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,020
It wasn't your choice to take on the responsibility of it.

412
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,140
Here's what you do.

413
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,300
Pick up that sweet little pussy bear,

414
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
roll him into a little ball, and lay down on the couch,

415
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,260
and give him little nuzzles on his button nose.

416
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,780
You fucking dolt.

417
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,260
That's what you do.

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,820
Okay, well, Griffin, what about the custody battle

419
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,980
like a year from now when the roommate gets a place

420
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,100
that allows cats and she wants her cat back?

421
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,660
Well, then-

422
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,260
Kramer versus Kramer, baby.

423
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,060
Kramer versus Kramer.

424
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,940
Put that sweet little pussy bear in between the two of you,

425
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,500
and whichever one he goes to is the owner.

426
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,940
By the way, you've got sardines in your pockets.

427
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,100
He's gonna come to you if you put sardines in your pockets.

428
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,380
That's a little tip from me to you.

429
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,980
I feel like you are within your right to call your ex-roommate

430
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,660
and say, hey, I either need you to pay for the food and stuff,

431
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,140
and then I'm happy to keep the cat here

432
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,700
until Yuri will find a place that allows cats.

433
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,980
No, that's not happening.

434
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,740
She signed a lease on a new place.

435
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,060
She is not going to retain custody of this cat.

436
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,540
Okay, well, then say either pay for it,

437
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,540
or I'm going to give her away.

438
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,220
Why can't she just have a secret cat?

439
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:53,700
Cats are-

440
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,220
I frequently forget that I have a cat

441
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,700
because he's fucking ghost all the time.

442
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,340
Oh, you're saying like just let her out in the world?

443
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,540
Or no, I mean like, no, Jesus.

444
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
The cat will come back, there's lots of outdoor cats.

445
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,620
Don't say that, that's not like putting a baby on the curb.

446
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,380
I'm saying like, you let the cat out,

447
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,780
cat roams the city, comes back to you whenever it wants.

448
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,820
Yeah, he just roams San Francisco and he's fine.

449
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,100
And you think he'll be the only cat out there?

450
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,420
He'll just be a lone cat in San Francisco

451
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,580
because all the other animals are inside where it's safe?

452
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,900
Hey, Dale, I had a great day today.

453
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,740
I took the trolley down to the pier

454
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,540
and just walked it with some of my friends

455
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,700
and I got picked up by a seagull.

456
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,500
It was great.

457
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,300
It was pretty good.

458
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
This is a bad, this is a bad scene, man.

459
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,340
The trick is-

460
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,820
I don't know.

461
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,260
I know this isn't much use to you now,

462
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,140
but the trick is to not let yourself get in these kinds of situations.

463
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,140
Write a note to yourself in the future saying,

464
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,260
hey, remember that time?

465
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,100
I don't think she has to do that.

466
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,780
She has a living four-leg room around all the time.

467
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,780
I have renamed him Burden.

468
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,260
Come here, Burden.

469
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,460
Is it really that expensive?

470
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,580
Like, once the cat has gotten that first round of shots

471
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,700
and vaccinations and fixing, like, is it really that-

472
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,060
You're paying for his food, right?

473
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,020
It's really not that-

474
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,140
I mean, we're talking about like-

475
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:13,940
A couple bucks a day.

476
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,260
I mean, if that-

477
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,660
No, I buy that premium shit though for my sweet pussy beer.

478
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,340
Do you buy like wet food or dry food?

479
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,700
I mix it up.

480
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,740
I mix it because his constitution is weaker in the morning

481
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,860
so he doesn't really have-

482
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,340
He doesn't do saliva very well,

483
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
so like I'll give it to him wet in the morning

484
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,700
and then later in the day I'll let him have it dry.

485
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
What, his saliva game is bad?

486
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,300
This- He has dry mouth.

487
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,180
He's a heavy drinker.

488
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,060
I see.

489
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,940
A good friend of mine from grad school just signed a 15th monthly-

490
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,060
Guys, I have to talk.

491
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,820
Can I talk to you guys for a second?

492
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,580
From me to the listeners,

493
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,340
you guys have got to start condensing these backstories.

494
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,460
I can't keep reading these novellas every time that you want our help.

495
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,380
Just get it down to brass tacks.

496
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,860
And I want to tell you what, I edited both of these down.

497
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,660
Listen, it's like when you leave this much,

498
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,060
you're just leaving weaknesses we can exploit.

499
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,580
We will do anything to keep from answering a question.

500
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,700
So you have to leave us as little rope as possible

501
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,980
or we will hang you with it.

502
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:18,100
You have to put it to us concrete and direct.

503
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,560
Here we go.

504
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,180
A good friend of mine from grad school

505
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,940
just signed a 15th month lease on a new apartment

506
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,060
with his girlfriend of five years.

507
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,540
They're about to get a cat, and on all appearances, they're very happy.

508
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,340
Here's the problem.

509
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,820
My friend's girlfriend, let's call him George, and let's call her Wanda.

510
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,780
She, Wanda, told my girlfriend a secret.

511
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,980
The secret is Wanda has cheated on George twice

512
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,740
and she's tempted to do it again.

513
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,580
But Wanda swore to my girlfriend a secrecy.

514
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,500
Of course, my girlfriend told me,

515
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,700
so now I know that Wanda is habitually unfaithful to George,

516
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,260
and he's probably gearing up to propose to her the next week or two.

517
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,780
If I tell him it'll ruin our friendship-

518
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,280
Next week.

519
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,140
Next year or two, not week.

520
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,740
Next year or two, that's not gearing up to propose.

521
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,940
I just gotta build my confidence for 18 months.

522
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,660
If I tell him it'll ruin our friendship with Wanda because we ratted her out,

523
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,100
and part of me thinks maybe they could work it out in the long run.

524
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,780
Heck, for all I know, maybe George has cheated on Wanda too,

525
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,780
although I have absolutely no evidence of that.

526
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:22,860
Help me, brothers, should I tell George maybe in some anonymous way?

527
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:25,180
If Wanda told my girlfriend, maybe she told others.

528
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,460
I don't want to stir up shit.

529
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,420
But what if they get a divorce years in the future when I could have prevented it?

530
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,780
That's from Ify and Ithaca.

531
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,020
This is a sexy little nut.

532
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,580
This is like closer to the movie in question.

533
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,180
Let me say this, though.

534
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,900
You're worried about ruining your friendship with Wanda,

535
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,540
which I think is naive because you should be worried

536
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,700
about ruining your friendship with both of them.

537
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,220
Yeah, you're gonna-

538
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,300
I don't think anybody gets out of this one alive.

539
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,620
Yeah.

540
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,100
It's really-

541
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,180
George isn't gonna go, hey, thanks, buddy.

542
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:54,460
I- like, even though you helped him out, it's kill the messenger.

543
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:59,020
Like, nobody likes the person that gives this kind of information.

544
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,060
You gotta- you gotta pick- pick who's important to you.

545
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,740
Who do you want- who do you want to take with you into the finale is the- is the question.

546
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,700
Because if I were a- I don't know.

547
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,580
If I were in your shoes, I think I'd probably go for Jorge.

548
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,420
He seems like he's the one getting put-

549
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,060
I know.

550
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,220
Okay, listen, I gotta be serious with you.

551
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,700
Everybody likes to have secrets, these little juicy-

552
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,900
This is sexy for me to read this.

553
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,820
Juicy tidbits, and everybody likes to have these secrets in their head.

554
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,300
You cannot act on this.

555
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:30,860
Nope.

556
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,020
You cannot act on- here's the one move you have, okay?

557
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,780
You have a single move.

558
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:41,100
The single move is- nope, can't do that.

559
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,860
I was gonna say you talk to Wanda about the cheating and tell her that she should tell George,

560
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,180
but then Wanda knows that your friend told you that Wanda told your friend about the cheating,

561
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,260
and then your friend told you about Wanda's secret.

562
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:51,740
She'll fucking-

563
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,860
So you can't do that.

564
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,660
You don't have that move.

565
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,540
She will riposte, she will turn that shit right back on you,

566
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,820
she will fucking Cersei your ass, and you will be donezo.

567
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,420
Your relationship will end.

568
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,820
You'll find out that you've been cheated on.

569
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,500
That's how she'll twist it on you.

570
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,220
Because you're- you're dealing with a whoa man-eater.

571
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,260
Watch out, here she comes.

572
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,420
You can't do anything.

573
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,940
I think the best advice is that you need to take like three steps back

574
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,620
from your friendship with both of them.

575
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,620
You know too much.

576
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,580
Travis.

577
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,100
But you're- but George is gonna need someone.

578
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,820
When he realizes-

579
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,540
But here's the problem-

580
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,380
When these infidelities are- when they serve-

581
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,580
Wait, does George look her?

582
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,460
Is George sexy?

583
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,660
Oh, good question.

584
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,940
Oh, I like this.

585
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,980
What about that?

586
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,780
You twist that.

587
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,500
Maybe turn it into a little opportunity for you.

588
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,820
I don't- I don't understand.

589
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,660
Do you mean help George get his sexy right?

590
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:40,620
And then-

591
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,180
Be like, George, you're- you're the patsy in this relationship.

592
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,940
Come with- come be with me.

593
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,140
Let me take care of you.

594
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:48,860
But- right now.

595
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,620
Let me- let me- let you love me.

596
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,020
Let me love you.

597
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,620
You're assuming a sexual attraction between George and our question asker.

598
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,580
This is what I'm saying.

599
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,540
You can't feel that right now?

600
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,180
This is that closer shit that I'm talking about.

601
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,820
This is gonna be so decadently sexy.

602
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,700
But here's- here's where I think that you need- you need to get away safely.

603
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,620
Because picture this, every time from now into eternity,

604
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,540
when the four of you or even just like you and George and Wanda go out to a bar

605
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,980
and you see Wanda talking to any other guy ever,

606
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,820
you're gonna just get the strongest douche.

607
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,100
Your stomach's gonna clench up.

608
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,620
Just butt out though, then.

609
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,100
If you don't-

610
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,820
That's what I'm saying.

611
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,460
So back out.

612
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,500
You know too much.

613
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,700
I mean, you can still hang out with them, but when you observe shit like that,

614
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,820
just maybe George knows.

615
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,060
Maybe it's a part- maybe they got an open thing.

616
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,580
A secret open relationship.

617
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,060
It's none of your bi-

618
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,100
It's not sexier.

619
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:43,660
This is the- first off, let me thank you guys for bringing us into this sexual web.

620
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,220
Fuck.

621
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,540
I- it's either- it's one of two things.

622
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,900
It's either incredibly crushingly sad or just real sexy,

623
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,300
and I'm gonna pretend it's the latter because I need some jail material.

624
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,980
There's not a move here.

625
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,420
I mean, you don't have a move.

626
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,140
You don't.

627
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,660
I thought about that one move about talking to Wanda, but you can't do that.

628
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,940
I mean, the- and here's the thing about it is that like-

629
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,540
You're going to have to actively work to convince yourself that it's none of your business.

630
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,940
It's like a decision you're going to have to make and stick to actively.

631
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,700
You're not actually helping anybody.

632
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,300
I mean, that's the thing, right?

633
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:27,740
Like, if George knows he's been getting cuckolded, then that- that makes him feel bad about himself.

634
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,220
You don't actually win anything by George knowing the truth.

635
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:35,740
I mean, sure, maybe he can get himself out of the relationship, but maybe

636
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,820
she still really loves George. I mean, maybe they're a great fit.

637
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:47,100
And like, you are making the decision that that infidelity is the most important thing

638
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,380
about that relationship.

639
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,340
And I don't think that that, you know, like, I don't- I don't know.

640
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,420
Maybe there's other things that are more important to George, but you are making the decision to

641
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:01,260
introduce a distrust in this relationship that may not be there right now and

642
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,060
very possibly will never be removed. I really don't think it's- it's- it's your pl- besides

643
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,900
the obvious, like, self-preservation instinct, I just don't think it's your place to step in here.

644
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,020
Let me- let me give you the suggestion of something you can do.

645
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,660
It's innocuous, but effective, and that is to leave a note on their front door that just says,

646
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,160
I know.

647
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,500
That is actually a move I'd recommend to anybody.

648
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,780
That is actually a move I'd recommend to anybody in almost any scenario.

649
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,500
Because it's- it's not going to put you on blast.

650
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,060
If he- if George- if George sees it, he'll be like, oh, weird.

651
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,740
And if Wanda sees it, she'll be like-

652
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,780
Or George will feel guilty for everything he's ever done ever.

653
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:50,300
No, I'm sorry. If George finds it much like any man finding it,

654
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,180
he will assume someone has found that folder in his computer.

655
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,740
God damn it, I thought I had it- I had it hidden in a deep, deep, archived note or whatever.

656
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,860
Let's stop talking about this-

657
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,100
But I titled it, Please Do Not Look.

658
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,860
Let's stop talking about this question, because it's starting to go to a sad place,

659
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,620
and instead talk about our new business.

660
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Where we go to people's houses and leave notes on their front door that say, I know.

661
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,580
Because that's a fucking life-changing experience.

662
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,100
That's like- that's like The Game.

663
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,220
It's like that movie, The Game, because, like, you got some shit.

664
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,580
Even if you're, like, a good upstanding citizen, you got some shit

665
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,380
that you need to come face to face with, you need to come to terms with.

666
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,940
And you can either go to, you know, 10 therapy sessions,

667
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,460
or you can get a note on your front door that says, I know, and just all of a sudden be-

668
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,340
Come face to face with the fact that your kingdom is about to come toppling down on top of you.

669
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:43,340
Then make it actionable and put, like, I know, and you have three months.

670
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,380
Well, that seems- I wouldn't make it more threatening than I know.

671
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,660
But what it says is, it's like, hey, you have three months to turn it all around.

672
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,380
Or it says, in three months, you're going to die because I put a voodoo curse on you.

673
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,540
That's not what I know means.

674
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,300
And I mean, I know I put a voodoo curse on you.

675
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
And then on the back, it says, thinner.

676
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,580
And then under that, it says, like, the movie and book, Thinner, by Stephen King.

677
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,900
And thinner is printed there, the whole book.

678
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,540
And yeah, I'm sorry, the note is left as a bookmark in a copy of the book, Thinner.

679
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,460
What if we did a remake of Closer, and it was called Closer and Thinner?

680
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,780
And it was just the four people, and they were just fucking each other like they were

681
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,420
caught in a fucking sexy food processor.

682
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,660
And also, they were just perpetually getting skinnier until dead.

683
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,180
I'd watch it.

684
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,900
I would watch it, too.

685
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,860
I would watch that, though.

686
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,940
Poor Natalie Portman would not last very long.

687
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,780
Not that I'm saying Julia Roberts is fat.

688
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,580
I'm just cutting off the emails right here.

689
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,180
We're not interested in them, guys.

690
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,620
We don't care who you think is thinner, between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts.

691
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,820
Clearly Natalie Portman, no.

692
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,780
Want to go to the Money Town?

693
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,420
Yeah, absolutely.

694
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,340
Griffin, who's first on the docket?

695
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:08,140
First on the docket, first in the catalog, is a website called hugepop.com, who asks

696
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,980
our listeners to visit hugepop.com, where you'll-

697
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,860
Not hugepoop.com, which is what I first typed in.

698
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,940
Why would you do that, though?

699
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,220
It was an accident.

700
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,660
It wasn't an accident.

701
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,220
At hugepop.com, you'll find strange, funny, and unsettling stories written and read to

702
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,740
you by me, Adam Drent.

703
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,220
You can read them, stream them, or download them and listen to them on your mobile device.

704
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,180
There is also a series of comedy audio sketches called One Man's World, and you can download

705
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,740
or stream three hip-hop albums by the mispronouncer, who is also me, Adam Drent.

706
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,700
Everything is free.

707
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,300
That's all you need.

708
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,380
I like that.

709
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,980
You should have led with that last thing.

710
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,460
Yeah, everything is free.

711
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,140
Now, give me a moment of your time.

712
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,740
You could be going there right now to Huge Pop and getting something funny while you're

713
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,260
listening to our show.

714
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,300
You could be reading something, too, and just really expanding your horizons.

715
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,740
I've been thinking about getting into listening to hip-hop, because I saw Kanye West perform

716
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,940
yesterday on SNL, and it wasn't in any way terrifying.

717
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,500
That's how I feel about that Macklemore character.

718
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,940
He seems nice.

719
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,020
Kanye West's performance on SNL last night compared to Macklemore makes Macklemore seem

720
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,700
like my sweet little pussy bear.

721
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:24,860
Kanye West last night, he is the angriest of all the people who are in the 1%.

722
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,780
I think he is angriest at the 1%.

723
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,460
I worry that there is some self-loathing there, some heavy self-loathing.

724
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:33,740
I like that hook, though, on New Slaves.

725
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,220
Woof.

726
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:42,700
Man, that's a sentence that like 200 years ago would have meant some pretty bogus shit.

727
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,020
If you would like to be handcuffed, though, boy, do we have a great option for you.

728
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,420
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

729
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,500
Just tell me about it.

730
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,860
Come on, I'm on pins and needles.

731
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,540
Oh, you want ExtremeRestraints.

732
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,340
Yeah, thank you.

733
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,060
There it is.

734
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,940
Okay, great.

735
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,460
ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult superstore.

736
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,740
I'm at the edge of my seat, and also there's a dildo glued to it.

737
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,220
They would probably weld it.

738
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,900
It's all high quality stuff.

739
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,500
That's gonna fit OSHA standards.

740
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,060
Yeah, you don't want that dildo coming off inside your butt.

741
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,780
Or do you?

742
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,340
You do.

743
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:21,660
You did.

744
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,340
Oh, you did.

745
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,580
Guys, if you have not been to ExtremeRestraints.com,

746
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,540
I have something awesome for you.

747
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,980
There is a first time buyer special right now

748
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,900
where you can get a ton of sex toys for 99 cents or $2.

749
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:48,060
A small mini massager, some anal pleasure beads, Thai anal beads they are,

750
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,820
bondage tape.

751
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,300
No, I know what you're asking yourself.

752
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:58,460
Can I just use marbles and can I use scotch tape and can I just use a regular massager

753
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,380
to replace these three things?

754
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,220
I'm not sure that I want to go the extreme bargain route

755
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,460
with something I'm gonna put into my pussy.

756
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,020
Yeah.

757
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,620
But I do think that these are a great introduction to sexual play.

758
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,780
Have you guys ever seen that show Sexy MacGyver?

759
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,420
Don't try to make your sex toys at home.

760
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,780
Don't be like Griffin.

761
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,420
I'm a professional though.

762
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,220
I've been sweeting my own sex toys for a long time now.

763
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,540
Once you do 10,000 hours, you're an expert.

764
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,340
Exactly.

765
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,260
And once you shove 10,000 marbles in your butt, then you're dead.

766
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:35,820
You died.

767
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,460
He went for it.

768
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,740
He went for the record.

769
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,300
I did.

770
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,060
I shot for the stars.

771
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,340
You know that scene in Nick of Time where John Malkovich

772
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,540
puts together a gun out of plastic stuff that he smuggled in

773
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,100
and how I might be misremembering both leading characters

774
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,940
and plot points of Nick of Time?

775
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,540
Extremely strange.

776
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,740
Griffin's like that with sex toys.

777
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,140
Yeah, I make little guns and I shoot them up my butt.

778
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,780
It's the ultimate pleasure.

779
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,060
You don't have to do that though because the savings are very real.

780
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,100
With the coupon code...

781
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:09,820
If I shot a pistol up my butthole, do you think I could...

782
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,380
What's the coupon code?

783
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,660
Do you think I could survive?

784
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,060
Let's talk about something else.

785
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,540
You'd have to stand very straight and open your mouth really wide.

786
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,260
This is important.

787
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,620
Yeah, would I live through that?

788
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,680
Yeah.

789
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,820
The bullets would come out of your mouth.

790
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,860
I don't think I would.

791
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,380
I don't think I'd come out of that one okay.

792
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,860
I don't think so.

793
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,660
Let's not find out.

794
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,180
Let's instead go to ExtremeShades.com and use the coupon code...

795
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,220
Swordfish.

796
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:30,860
Swordfish.

797
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,500
It's unbelievable.

798
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,020
And you're gonna save 20% though.

799
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,780
So please don't hack that or anything

800
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,620
because that seems to be a problem for people.

801
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,660
They can't help themselves.

802
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,460
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

803
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,080
Please.

804
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,780
It's the only other one I have so let's make it count.

805
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,020
It's sent in by Emily Wall.

806
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,500
Thanks Emily.

807
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:51,100
It's by Yahoo Answers user Lunar Cure who asks...

808
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,900
Farmers have seen some awesome secrets of nature.

809
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,180
Tell us some, please.

810
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,660
Like sunflowers, bee dances, etc.

811
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm sorry, what was that second one?

812
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,660
Bee dances.

813
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:16,620
Somewhere a farmer just smiles knowingly and slowly shakes his head.

814
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,940
These secrets go to my grave.

815
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,820
These secrets go to my grave, kids.

816
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,100
I went to a murder mystery a few weeks ago at a castle in Ohio.

817
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,980
True story.

818
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,660
Not a goof setup.

819
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,540
Not a goof yet.

820
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,420
We're not at the goof.

821
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,380
There is no goof here.

822
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,660
There's just truth.

823
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,100
And while I was there, there was a man dressed up like some sort of battle monk

824
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,340
and he had a wife who was a nun

825
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:51,260
and they performed for us a dance that they learned from the owls behind their house

826
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,220
to the tune of Thriller.

827
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,420
I have a video on my phone.

828
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,140
If you ever catch me in real life, you say,

829
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,940
Justin, I gotta see that owl dance and I will hook you up.

830
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,440
Why?

831
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,540
Where the owl's like, all right, from the top.

832
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,220
I don't want to see...

833
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,660
You've been working on this for a while.

834
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,500
I want to see some snap.

835
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,460
Don't make it lazy.

836
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,500
One, two, three, four.

837
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,460
Jazz feathers.

838
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,420
Bee dances are apparently a real...

839
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,380
They don't have hands.

840
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:22,620
Sure.

841
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,260
Thank you, Travis.

842
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,940
I think bee dances are a real thing.

843
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:30,140
It's called a waggle dance, which describes literally every dance I'm also capable of doing.

844
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,980
Yahoo answer once responded, flowers are plant genitalia.

845
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,060
Uh, secret exposed, secret revealed.

846
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,460
Farmers probably know some shit though.

847
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,700
They probably know some fucking earth wisdom.

848
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,260
They're probably, well, not these days.

849
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:58,060
These days, farmers just flip the switch on the machine that yanks the milk out of the cow's tits.

850
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,540
Do you think, do you think that farmers still know how high the sycamore grows?

851
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,140
I don't think, no.

852
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,620
No, I think the only...

853
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,380
Why does the grinning bobcat grin?

854
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,620
They don't care about why the bad bobcat grins.

855
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,060
They just want to shower him in chemicals.

856
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,780
You know, I think...

857
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,460
Can we paint it with all the colors of the mountain?

858
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,980
Listen, Douglas, I think your farm is great.

859
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,980
I do think that if you did not have that giant sycamore in the middle of it,

860
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,420
just to see how tall it'll grow.

861
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,340
What if I cut it down?

862
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,140
I'll never know.

863
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,260
You won't live to see it.

864
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,220
No one will.

865
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,140
My children's children will.

866
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,940
Their children's children are going to turn it into magazines.

867
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,780
Man, that bobcat sure seems to like it though.

868
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,740
That bobcat seems pleased his punch.

869
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,700
How did he do that?

870
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,420
I don't know.

871
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,220
He's just that way.

872
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,740
That's just how he is.

873
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,500
Call him Henry.

874
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,940
Everything is shale colored.

875
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Yeah, dog, it's mountain colors, idiot.

876
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,740
Paint it with the color of the mountain.

877
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:54,380
That's what I do.

878
00:37:55,660 --> 00:38:01,340
Apparently, sunflowers fucking rotate to follow the sun across the sky.

879
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:03,420
Yeah.

880
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,780
It's called heliotropism.

881
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,500
Didn't know this.

882
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,220
I just learned about heliotropism from Yahoo Answers.

883
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:08,780
Is it real?

884
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,860
I don't want you to learn from Yahoo Answers ever.

885
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,060
This is the singularity.

886
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,540
Everybody out.

887
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,540
I don't want to learn anything from Yahoo Answers either,

888
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:18,380
but if it happens, then I'm willing to accept it

889
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,460
because I love knowledge and I love drinking it up.

890
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,620
And apparently, heliotropism is the thing.

891
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,820
Apparently, Wikipedia is telling me all about waggle dances now.

892
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,300
I'm going down a fucking rabbit hole right now.

893
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,700
Griffin to knowledge is like a sunflower to the sun.

894
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,300
Griffin just tilts his genitalia.

895
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,300
I tilt my plant genitalia towards it.

896
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,620
One of the Yahoo Answers responded, carrots.

897
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,140
Indeed.

898
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:44,860
Revealed.

899
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,580
I bet you guys, cows know.

900
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,220
I bet you cows also know some shit,

901
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,420
but mostly farmers know some shit about earth and the way things work

902
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,580
that they're not telling us.

903
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,780
About good dirt and bad dirt.

904
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I bet that's something they know a lot about.

905
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,780
You know what's funny is they know a lot about farming,

906
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,980
but they've never seen like a tall building or like a car.

907
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,700
Yeah, right.

908
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,220
They would be horrified.

909
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,500
It would be very scary.

910
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,420
But I bet they know all about what happened in Benghazi.

911
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,380
I bet they know the truth about Benghazi.

912
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,140
If you want to fucking suss that out, put a farmer on the stand.

913
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,900
There's two things farmers know about.

914
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,260
Like agricultural shit and foreign affairs.

915
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,620
And Benghazi specifically.

916
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,340
I've been trying to get into gardening.

917
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,980
Sydney and I have been trying to plan some stuff.

918
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,940
And speaking of secrets that farmers know,

919
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,340
one of those secrets that I don't know that I'm betting farmers do

920
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:48,780
is basically not knowing what plants will emerge from the ground

921
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,260
and which I will have to retrieve from there.

922
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,460
I literally had to ask Sydney about basically every plant.

923
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:00,300
Like will the pepper be in the ground or will it be above the ground?

924
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,340
And I bet that's a secret that farmers have on a lot pretty much.

925
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,820
Yeah, I bet that that's pretty important to just their general survival

926
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:13,500
and their fiscal stability is just knowing sort of like where the carrots are at any given time.

927
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,940
I can never remember.

928
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,540
Ah shit, I did it wrong again.

929
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,340
I dug up.

930
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,660
Is it a carrot tree?

931
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,380
Fuck.

932
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,260
I can't remember.

933
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,300
I did it bad.

934
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm the worst farmer.

935
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,420
I don't know any of the secrets of Mother Earth's beautiful womb

936
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,300
that I grow my carrot children inside.

937
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
I should never cut down that signal.

938
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,060
One of my neighbor farmers told me that if you feed a cow rocks,

939
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,900
then he'll poop out whole watermelons that you can sell at the country fair.

940
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,380
But they just killed them.

941
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,940
They died.

942
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,540
They're tricky farmers.

943
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,140
That's the secret about farm wisdom.

944
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,780
They're either telling you something that will enrich your life,

945
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,660
like heliotropism and bee dances, or they'll give you a little riddle.

946
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,460
They'll play a trick on you.

947
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,820
They're like bridge trolls.

948
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,660
They're actually descended from bridge trolls.

949
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,220
They are.

950
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,060
All farmers are descended from bridge trolls.

951
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,100
They only speak in riddles.

952
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
There's another secret for you.

953
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,220
You know that poem God Made a Farmer?

954
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,380
It's not true.

955
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,260
God made a bridge troll.

956
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:19,500
And then they just sort of naturally fell into another vacation.

957
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,100
They defied his teachings and they left the bridges.

958
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
And so they were cast out of Eden.

959
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,260
That's Genesis 1-1, baby.

960
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,540
Read a book.

961
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,420
Read a book.

962
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,100
Specifically the Bible.

963
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,180
Specifically our new version of the Bible.

964
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,460
The Bradley's Grimm presents the Bible.

965
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,180
I want to ask a real question and help someone to undo the damage.

966
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,100
If you know farm wisdom, will you email-

967
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,700
If you live on a farm, first of all,

968
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,260
that's dope that you're listening to a podcast on a farm.

969
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:49,660
Second of all, email us some farm wisdom

970
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,380
because I'm genuinely interested in farm wisdom now.

971
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,100
And a picture.

972
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,620
Can I have a picture of a cow, please?

973
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,700
Send us a telegram or something.

974
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,500
I mean, they're farmers.

975
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,460
They don't have internet.

976
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,220
They're getting this podcast delivered on a jump drive.

977
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,260
The milkman swings by every day.

978
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,380
I'm not sure why they would need a milkman because they live on a farm.

979
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,260
He's picking up.

980
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,060
He's picking up.

981
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, I see what I see.

982
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,820
I get you.

983
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,660
I see what I did.

984
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,100
They got to get it from somewhere, I guess.

985
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,940
Yeah, cow tits.

986
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,340
Recently, during the exam period at university, I grew an exam beard.

987
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:27,900
Recently, though, I noticed it's been drawing some nice attention from a few girls.

988
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,500
So it seems to be working for me.

989
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,180
This would be a problem if not for the fact that it's itchy as all fucking hell.

990
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,980
So do I keep the beard as well as the attention, which has been quite nice,

991
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,820
and suffer the discomfort or do I get rid of it?

992
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,540
That's from Beard and Loathing in St. Andrews.

993
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:53,260
Well, I think at least one of us on this call is qualified to answer this question.

994
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:55,980
Okay, I'm going to rock everyone's world for a minute.

995
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:00,780
Before we do that, though, can we talk about is an exam beard?

996
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,700
Is that just like when people like do a thing and so they feel like they have to have some

997
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,980
sort of physical changes?

998
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,660
No, I totally get it.

999
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,620
I totally get it because it happens to me too when I'm installing a show.

1000
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:19,100
And it's like you just get so caught up in the old rat race that you stop taking care

1001
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,980
of your physical self.

1002
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,100
It's not like he's squirreled away at TI-83 in there, right?

1003
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,660
It's not like it's not for cheating.

1004
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,940
He doesn't keep notes in there.

1005
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,700
Secret notes inside of his...

1006
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,540
I whisper the answers into my beard.

1007
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,220
I shake them out.

1008
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,900
It echoes endlessly.

1009
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,500
No, I think exam beard just means that he stopped like bathing and stuff for like...

1010
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,220
He gave it up.

1011
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,740
I bet he's got a pretty crazy exam bush too.

1012
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:49,340
My exam fingernails have gotten a lot of attention from the ladies.

1013
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,380
Travis, tell me, what's it like to have a beard?

1014
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,820
It's pretty great, Justin.

1015
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,900
People often touch it for no reason.

1016
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,780
And the ladies do love it.

1017
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,100
We're in an era where it's coming right on back.

1018
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,180
It's very manly and the people like it.

1019
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,860
And let me tell you how to keep it from being itchy is I'll fucking get out.

1020
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,020
Wildman Beard Conditioning Oil.

1021
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,180
Wildman is the brand.

1022
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,980
Okay.

1023
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,340
But there have to be other...

1024
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:20,860
I know you're probably...

1025
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,860
You can do normal conditioner.

1026
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,620
There's beard wash.

1027
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,580
Grow it out real long so it gets soft and then trim it back.

1028
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,080
Honey.

1029
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:29,840
Pure...

1030
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,380
Yes, sweetie?

1031
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:30,880
Pure...

1032
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,220
No, I'm saying pure honey.

1033
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,720
Okay.

1034
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,620
Massage a little bit of honey into your beard and it's great.

1035
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,220
You could do a beer wash.

1036
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,540
It's going to be sticky and you're going to hate it.

1037
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,900
But you know who's not going to hate it?

1038
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,340
Bees.

1039
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,380
Bees are going to love it.

1040
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,260
I've got an exam beard of bees that's gotten a lot of attention from the ladies.

1041
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,980
If you want to make a...

1042
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,940
I like your beard.

1043
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,140
I like the gnats in it.

1044
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:55,500
If you really want to watch a bee dance.

1045
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,580
If you really want to see a bee fucking twerk it,

1046
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,300
rub a little honey in that beard of yours and they will get so hyphy so quick.

1047
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:07,340
They'll just shake in front of you like, let me up into your beard.

1048
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,660
Why are you grinding on me?

1049
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,180
Luckily, I got this protected beard to protect me from your stinger.

1050
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,100
Protecting us both.

1051
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,100
So if that comes out, you're done.

1052
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:22,700
What if you saw someone with a giant beard in the middle of the exam,

1053
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,660
just stand up and throw their arms in the sky and just say,

1054
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,540
Bees!

1055
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,340
And the exam's over.

1056
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,420
Because bees just fly out of his beard.

1057
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,740
That's actually in the college law where everyone then gets a bee.

1058
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,620
That's your best option.

1059
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,900
And it's too hard for you.

1060
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:47,900
You say, well, I got to get out of this one.

1061
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,340
Bees!

1062
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,220
Bees!

1063
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:52,780
Oh, man.

1064
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,740
And then the professor just slowly puts down the pen he's been writing his dissertation with

1065
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,980
and walks out of the room and gives everybody a bee.

1066
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,580
And everybody gets a bee.

1067
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,500
Man, this is a pretty cool college, this guy goes.

1068
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,540
And then everyone turns and thanks you because they didn't have the courage to do it.

1069
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,540
They couldn't grow an exam beard to lodge bees in.

1070
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,220
That's how we got-

1071
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,700
That's the thing.

1072
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:13,820
You can't just say bees.

1073
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:15,180
You got to go like the full mile.

1074
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,780
That's farmer wisdom.

1075
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,420
I learned that from a farmer.

1076
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:18,220
That's what I'm saying.

1077
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,700
This is applicable, potent farm wisdom that I could be using in my everyday life.

1078
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,180
How do we know so much farm wisdom?

1079
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,780
We're from West Virginia.

1080
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,300
We got it by Appalachian Osmosis.

1081
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,900
Well, see that actually the original rule comes from whenever a farmer had to pay the

1082
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,820
bank to keep their land.

1083
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:41,260
If they grew a beard and yelled bees, the bank had to back off.

1084
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,140
Do bees actually come in in this scenario or is it just like the threat of bees is so-

1085
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,780
It's kind of like when you call like I have the power, you know?

1086
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,060
It's like that kind of thing where you're just summoning the courage of the bee.

1087
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:52,860
When I see a man with a big-

1088
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,020
The problem is you never know.

1089
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,420
Right.

1090
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,900
You look at someone and he says bees or maybe he just whispers and points at the beard.

1091
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,380
Bees.

1092
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,100
Are you going to call this bluff?

1093
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:10,300
Are there bees in the beard or are we to believe because of his crazy facial hair that he possesses

1094
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,660
bee channeling abilities?

1095
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,980
Little column A, little column B.

1096
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,660
It's all about the mystique and it's about really committing to the bit.

1097
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,380
That's the thing.

1098
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:22,060
Maybe just one bee pops out and says, I know others.

1099
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:29,660
And then you should actually, if you're going to sell this, I think you cannot appear in

1100
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:33,340
class for weeks before because it has to-

1101
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,940
They have to think you're dead.

1102
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,260
You have to fake your own death and come back with a bee that can emit bees.

1103
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,980
Or sorry, a bee that has a beard.

1104
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,480
Wait.

1105
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,220
Hey guys, what's up?

1106
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:47,740
Just tried something new.

1107
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,140
That's Paul and Greg.

1108
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,180
You're not fooling us.

1109
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:53,500
I know it's a little spotty in some places, but I'm a fucking bee.

1110
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,620
What are you going to do?

1111
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,260
It'll fill out.

1112
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:55,820
It'll fill out.

1113
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,540
Just keep growing.

1114
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,460
Are we getting that statement?

1115
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,100
Travis, are you going to shave your beard for your wedding?

1116
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,740
No, my fiance would kill me.

1117
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,780
I guess that's true.

1118
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,660
The only reason I have the beard is because Teresa insists.

1119
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,900
And the only reason he has a fiance is because he has a beard.

1120
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:12,460
That's true.

1121
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,780
It's a one in one thing, one in one out.

1122
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,540
Teresa has been living under the threat of bee attacks for two years.

1123
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,460
Travis, that must be a fucking Trump card.

1124
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,980
And you're like, will you please clean the pans?

1125
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,220
And she's like, it's your turn to clean the pans.

1126
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,940
And then you point to your beard and you say, I hate to play this card again, but

1127
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,420
you want me to just try to get stung?

1128
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,100
And then she says no.

1129
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,500
That would explain why the last time we all had dinner together,

1130
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,820
she was tapping in Morse code on the table.

1131
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,660
Please, oh God, please, his beard is filled with bees.

1132
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,300
Please help me escape.

1133
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:46,940
It all sucks.

1134
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,060
Give me safe harbor.

1135
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,940
It also explains why I couldn't hear anything anyone was saying the entire time

1136
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,980
because of the buzzing.

1137
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,340
Travis probably had an iPod in there that would just fake it.

1138
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,660
Where am I going to find an hour long MP3 of bees?

1139
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:18,620
I can, I will Google hour long bee MP3 and, nope.

1140
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,460
So that aren't my show, my brother, my brother, me.

1141
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,660
We sure hope you've had as much fun listening to it as we have had making it.

1142
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,140
I can get an MP3 of bees in the trap by Nicki Minaj.

1143
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,220
I'll listen to that.

1144
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:37,500
Thank you to people tweeting about the show using the MBMBAM hashtag.

1145
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:44,380
We've got Turk Rules, Kane, Taylor Wilson, Nicole, Mary Erickson, Mike Susek, Kim Belushi,

1146

Jeff Grubb, Christy Admiral, Justin Sullivan.

1148
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,780
Thank you so much to everybody sharing the program.

1149
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,140
If you tweet about us, why not include our sampler?

1150
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,340
It's bit.ly forward slash MBMBAM 2013.

1151
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:10,780
That's our brand new one just for you to help add people to the ever-growing

1152
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,220
my brother, my brother, me family.

1153
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,220
And two things real quick.

1154
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,780
One, we're coming to Max Fun Con pretty soon.

1155
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,460
So if you're going to be there, we want to know and we want to answer your questions

1156
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,260
at our live show.

1157
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:27,260
So email us your questions and make sure you put in the subject line Max Fun Con or something

1158
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,940
about Max Fun Con in there.

1159
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,660
And also, I have forgotten the second thing.

1160
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,540
I just want to make a plea real quick.

1161
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,300
Two pleas, actually.

1162
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:45,580
I just, Ira, Jacob, Krista, I don't know what I did, but please come back to me with your

1163
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,740
good, good Yahoo Answers submissions.

1164
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,300
Please, please, I need you back.

1165
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:56,380
Also, if you've never done a Yahoo submission, just send it to MBMBAM.

1166
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,820
To MBMBAM at gmail.com or a regular question.

1167
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,620
That's where those go.

1168
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,820
But hard up for those Yahoos.

1169
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:04,460
Need them.

1170
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,740
Please, nothing racist.

1171
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,580
Please, please, nothing poopy related to.

1172
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,220
I remember the second thing.

1173
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,340
The second thing was if you want to either get a shout out to your business like hugebop.com

1174
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,420
did or if you want to give a shout out to a loved one, just go to maximumfun.org forward

1175
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:24,300
slash Jumbotron and then get you all set up there.

1176
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,540
It's $100 for a personal message and $200 for a business message.

1177
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,660
So help support the show and we'll help support you.

1178
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,660
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's

1179
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,540
a Departure, which is on the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1180
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,500
I'd like to put this day to bed and go back to sleep.

1181
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,980
It's 10 o'clock in the morning.

1182
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,100
This is from a sleepy guy.

1183
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,460
I was up really late last night.

1184
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,180
I was up till like 1130 watching the Amazing Race finale.

1185
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:55,260
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo answer?

1186
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,460
Something to send us out on?

1187
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,740
I know your reserves been running low.

1188
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,060
I do.

1189
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:00,540
This one was sent in by Andrew Burns.

1190
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,100
Thank you, Andrew.

1191
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:05,340
It's by Yahoo Answers user Ihabgusaini who asks,

1192
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:10,460
I need every insult the rock Dwayne Johnson ever made.

1193
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,380
I'm Justin McElroy.

1194
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,340
I'm Travis McElroy.

1195
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,060
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1196
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,580
This has been my brother.

1197
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:18,860
My brother may kiss your dad.

1198
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:20,860
Square on the lips.
