1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here come the McElroys, we've got jokes and bits.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're gonna give advice and do funny sticks.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Laughter, it is in store.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come inside and see.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's time to start.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's my brother, my brother and me.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother and me?

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
An advice show of the modern era.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello, my children.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It is I, the ascended Travis McElroy.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just the name, Griffin is here.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello, I'm so glad that you, my brothers, could meet with me here.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Where are we?

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh shit.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're here with me in the ascended plane.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's the keto juice.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I told you, once he gets on that keto, he's gonna be different.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I have eaten 21 days of salad in a row.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh wait, it really is dietary, but your ascension really is based in the number-

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, Griffin.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yeah, okay.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You've had three weeks of salad straight, and it seems that that was all it took.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, let me just crack into your blockchain real quick, hold on.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Okay, let me just look at the cookie points.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh my god!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, Griffin.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Are you kidding me?

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I traded my cookie points in for one, a dune buggy, and two, the ability to communicate telepathically.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, so that's actually on here.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
There's a website where you trade them in.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's kind of like jump rope for heart, and you did enough cookie points.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I guess you got a dune buggy.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Damn, that's aspirational.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Nobody actually gets the dune buggy.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm right now, Griffin, coming to you.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm tooling around in the dunes.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I'm hearing your fucking mind, your brainwaves.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That is correct.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's so sick, dude.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, and I had enough left over to get this paddle ball.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, be straight with me now, though, psychic dune Travis.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How yucky was it to eat all of those salads?

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Here's the problem with salads.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sometimes you get a leafy bite.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, it's true.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There's no wet, and there's no crumble, and there's no beef.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And one of the three always has to be in there in order for me to have a good chewing experience.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Listen, yes, sometimes there was a leaf that snuck in betwixt my chompers.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And then those go straight to my brain.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The crumble bits and the beef bits and the wet bits, they go to Tummy Town.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And the green bits, well, they go up to Brainberg.

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And in Brainberg, they get turned into the ability to levitate objects.

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, you can do that, too?

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes, I can, Griffin.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Look down.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're not touching your chair anymore.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, you're right.

66
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've been floating.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I just didn't know that that was you.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm levitating your butt.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah, no, it feels weird.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I can actually, you know what's weird?

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're levitating me, but I feel two big hands.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And Griffin, I want you to know that was optional.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It didn't have to feel like two hands, but I made it that way.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Trav, I know how many salads you've started.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How many have you finished?

76
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I finished every one, Justin.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's never happened.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No one's ever gotten a salad.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, let me explain.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't complete them.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was finished.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, that's stupid.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now you're getting into semantics.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm saying everybody's ever gotten a salad.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Justin, eating so many salads has given me the power of semantics.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, it hasn't.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Everybody gets to a point in any salad ever where they're like, I'm done.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is it.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm done.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I would like to play in your salad game too, please.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You got it.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please let me play with your salad game too.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Here's my trick, Justin, and I recommend this to everybody.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And he just keeps going.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
God damn it, Travis.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's the power I have.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's the salad juice.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's in control.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We need to just let him.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, salad juice.

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Croats everywhere.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Justin, you must build your salad in a glass bowl so that when you finish, you can lift

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
it up, see through it, and say, I have the clarity of salad now.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
See, that was nothing.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, it was.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was actually something on this plane.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All right.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh my God.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's got me jealous.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm going to go open up my mini fridge I have in my office and eat the salad I've got here.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's gone.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's just a calling card here.

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It says, now it's mine, and it's from Professor Cabbage?

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Is that what you call yourself now?

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, wait.

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hold on.

122
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Professor Cabbage?

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Griffin, you have to get out of the house right now.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait, you're not Professor Cabbage?

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're not safe.

126
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, Griffin.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He is a salad eater slash serial killer.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll get out of...

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh no!

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My arch nemesis.

132
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, boy.

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have thrown a bottle of bacon bits at your brother so hard that he died.

134
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Luckily, so much salad has given me the ability to resurrect Griffin.

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, thanks, Travis.

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You really got...

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You should have killed me first.

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Okay, I recognize my mistake now.

140
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm going to try to kill you.

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to kill you first, right?

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I want to change the name of MBMBAM here in 2021.

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The subtitle is no longer an advice show from the modern era.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now it's MBMBAM characters welcome.

145
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This year, characters have been welcomed lovingly, and we're not a big character show.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But we've been lovingly welcoming characters in, and boys, I'm wild about it.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm wild about it.

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I love it.

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Professor Cabbage has got legs.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He does.

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Rabbit legs.

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No, it's rabbit legs, actually.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's a huge rabbit.

154
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, Travis.

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's a man with two long, big, sexy legs.

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, I'm thinking of a different Professor Cabbage.

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't tell me what my fucking Professor Cabbage HC is.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can be whatever I want.

159
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He's an audio character.

160
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is fair.

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Glad for you, Trav.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Thank you.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Glad for your salads, bud.

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hey, listen, folks.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is still an advice show, and we are so happy to be here with-

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is it?

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It is.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It is.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're so happy to be here with you, and we're so grateful that you've welcomed us back into your incredible lives.

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We love you, and we're ready to help.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We're here to help, and I think maybe with all the characters, we maybe lost sight of that a little bit, and I am so sorry about that.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's true.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We should say at the top of the show, some exciting developments vis-a-vis the theme song is,

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We've Been Terribly Sued by Klaski Supo, and this is our final episode because they said that it's not funny anymore,

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and that they worked very hard on the Rugrats song, and that I actually am now in jail,

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and I'll have to go there, and Klaski Supo is going to drive me there.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
People keep saying it's similar to Rugrats.

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't hear it.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I don't hear it.

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If anything, it's Hey Arnold.

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was also going to say Hey Arnold.

182
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Was that Hey Arnold?

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I forget.

184
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But we are partnering.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Partnering makes it sound like we're doing any work at all.

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
No, no, no.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We are relying fully upon.

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We are relying fully on a very talented artist who is working on a song for us that is very good.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We're very excited about it, and we'll have more news about that.

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
She sent us a demo recently, and it's going to be very good.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's going to blow your asses right off.

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, now you're getting a little crazy, Travis.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, it's going to put your asses back on.

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, the asses will be intact.

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Your ass won't move.

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Music doesn't do anything to your butt.

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Music doesn't do anything to your butt.

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It depends on how loud you play it.

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Dang, isn't this true?

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just got an email today.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just got an email that today my work is having a virtual team building.

202
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, you got me.

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Justin, you got me.

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Finally, to boost morale while we're all working remote.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The event is a virtual escape room over Zoom, not a video game.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They are having us attempt a real escape room.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The worst part is it will be done by shouting instructions at a stranger in California who has a phone strapped to his head.

208
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, boy.

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How do I get through this unbearably awkward meeting while still showing my manager I'm a team player?

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's from Sequestered in Seattle.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They legally can't make you go to an online meeting if you have diarrhea so bad you can't get off the toilet.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And this may be one of those times where you just got to rip the rip cord off.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Are you sure, Griffin?

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Because I think it would be easier to go to an online meeting if you had diarrhea so bad you couldn't get off the toilet.

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's not proper.

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's not proper.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's improper.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I hate to be that guy, but if you can get you some diarrhea, then they can't make you do it.

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And this is so bad.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Do you need real diarrhea there or you can't just say you have diarrhea?

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For me, Trav, you know it's not an issue because I can more or less at will change my stuff in there.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This sucks, dude.

223
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wow, that's rough.

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Everybody in your meeting is going to be talking to a real person who's explaining.

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You know, I once worked in haunted houses for very rich kids' birthday parties, amazingly.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or Halloween parties in LA for one October.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I remember when you accidentally murdered Jonathan Lipnicki.

229
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you remember that?

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And then you had to find a kid who looked like him to go out and play him and you swore you'd never tell?

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Of course I remember that, Griffin.

232
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I did one time scare Jonah Hill very, very solidly scared Jonah Hill.

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, that's nice.

234
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But I thought that that was maybe the most demeaning job that perhaps an adult person could do for a short period of time for like a very specialized like, I don't think this is a job, but I'll do it.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think having a phone strapped to your head while you are the homunculus for a bunch of people trying to do an escape.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're one person alone in an escape room while a legion of voices yell at you could break a human being in 15 minutes.

237
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We love an escape room, Jesus.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
We're all about that life.

239
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's just the idea of your workplace being the, this person being the conduit for all the sort of disparate voices in your workplace scenario.

240
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It doesn't sound great.

241
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So how do you get through it, I guess?

242
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, I guess maybe like most being the most supportive.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's something that every puzzle room needs, but it's rarely done like just sort of like a hype like, you've got this or like, good one.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you bleep, maybe it's magnets.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you say maybe it's magnets every few minutes, you're eventually going to hit on something.

246
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Oh yeah.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Just say, I bet that does something.

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Anytime anybody like if they picks up, oh, I bet that does something.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That looks like a pattern to me.

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And if anybody says that looks like a pattern to me, or I bet that does something, or I bet it's magnets, you just go, yeah, no, that's what I was going to say.

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Maybe you're this person who's like roping people back in.

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Like people who've like kind of checked out.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're the one who's like every few minutes, you're like, what do you think, Carol?

255
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hey, Dougie, where are you at on this right now?

256
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are you at on this?

257
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Get aggressive.

258
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Garrett hasn't said anything in a while, huh?

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Garrett's being suspiciously quiet.

260
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you part of the escape room, Derek?

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I know you've worked with the company for seven years, but have you been a plant this whole time?

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You moonlighting, Derek?

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Huh?

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You thief.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:47,000
God, I feel like there's the inverse solution to this, which may be better, which is that you get fucking down and dirty, hog wild as hard as you can solving this fucking puzzle room with the hopes that you can just get through it the fastest.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah, and if anybody else is like, I don't know, we can check the tree.

267
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We're not checking the tree, all right?

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The tree had nothing in it.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're done.

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mute yourself.

271
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I once did an escape room with our then one-year-old in the room with us.

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You want to talk about a fucking real-life escape room.

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Bring some pulse-pounding thrills.

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do it like that, a little time bomb in there.

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Diaper time bomb.

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's no changing tables in fucking Sherlock Holmes' office.

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
People rip him down, and they'd be like, Sherlock Holmes didn't have a baby.

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is a clue.

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And I just want to say, nobody actually knows that for sure.

280
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Sherlock Holmes might have had a baby.

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh.

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, I've been writing-

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And his name was Travis Patrick McElroy.

284
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you very much.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Son of Sherlock Holmes.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Son of Sherlock Holmes.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Well, see, I froze Sherlock Holmes in a cryogenic chamber, and then he woke up in 1990s San Francisco to solve crimes, and he's my dad.

288
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah, and you had to teach him a lot about how-

289
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I did. He didn't know about how phones work.

290
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What an idiot.

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The first time this dude had a Slurpee.

292
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Blew his mind.

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Blew his fucking cord.

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So I was thinking the other day, guys.

295
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I was thinking about Under the Table and Fishing.

296
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Oh my god.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And can we talk about the biggest problem with Under the Table and Fishing?

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It goes too long.

299
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm glad we're doing these sort of-

300
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Postmortems.

301
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Well, production, really.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We're talking production conversations on the dime of the listener.

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, here's the problem.

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Here's the problem with Under the Table and Fishing.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There's a problem with it?

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, it's often so obvious which one's Dave Matthews because it's so fucking horny.

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Right.

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And then it hit me.

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And now allow me to present to you.

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Under the Table and Fishing presents Your Body is a Satellite.

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Is it Dave Matthews or John Mayer?

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Fuck!

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Ooh, that's something, huh?

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's something.

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's something.

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Here's the thing.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I know four of his songs.

318
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

319
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So-

320
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's me, Dave Matthews.

321
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No, do John Mayer.

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, be John Mayer.

323
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Your Body is a Satellite.

324
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, that's not what he-

325
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's just singing.

326
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He doesn't just walk around singing these fucking songs.

327
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's me.

328
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You may as well be.

329
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's me, John Mayer.

330
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There he is.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He's kind of pretty.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you for playing the game with me and my friend, Dave Matthews Man.

333
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Dave Matthews.

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm the Dave Matthews Man from the Dave Matthews Band doing my court-appointed community service.

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Kind of turning to Tim Curry there.

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's a lot of people in the studio and we only brought so many chips.

337
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Okay.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Now-

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm here too.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's me, James Blunt.

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're beautiful.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Get out of here, James Blunt.

343
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's not room.

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You'll never guess which song is mine.

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll start.

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're beautiful.

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All right, James.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
James, you didn't make the cut.

349
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We talked about this.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
My life is brilliant.

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, hey, you can grab something off of the table to eat and we have some t-shirts on

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
your way out if you want one of those.

353
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hello, hello, hello.

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's me, Ed Sheeran.

355
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, boy.

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hello, hello.

357
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hello.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, look at me.

359
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Look at me ketchup.

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, man.

361
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ed Sheeran and James Blunt are making out.

362
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hello, hello.

363
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I love to kiss him.

364
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're beautiful, Ed Sheeran.

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I love to fill my mouth with ketchup and do a kiss.

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, man.

367
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's really romantic, actually.

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
A lot of fucking characters, though.

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Let's do this game.

370
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay.

371
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Round one.

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Now, here's what I'm going to do.

373
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm going to give you one set of lyrics from both and I want you guys to tell me which

374
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
one's which.

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
All right?

376
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is going to be confusing.

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So it's like head to head.

378
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You ready?

379
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm going to give you four of your kiss, your words, your lips, your flesh, your bones.

381
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,500
Exactly what you need.

382
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Option two.

383
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,980
Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?

384
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,460
Is he the one who turns the ladies on?

385
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,760
Will I keep shining till my light is gone?

386
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,000
Who did you think I was?

387
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,360
Oh, so you're complicating things even more.

388
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,620
We have to pair them.

389
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
One is Dave.

390
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
One is Mayor.

391
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
Correct.

392
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
Number one is Dave.

393
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,620
Number two is Mayor.

394
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Two is Mayor.

395
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,620
Yes.

396
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
Correct.

397
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Yes.

398
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
Round two.

399
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,620
I will beg my way into your garden.

400
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,560
I like that we don't pause to make any jokes or observations about the quiz show.

401
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,600
This is a straight up and down real test.

402
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Okay.

403
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,840
I will beg my way into your garden.

404
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,280
I will break my way out when it rains just to get back to the place where I started.

405
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
That's John Mayer.

406
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,220
So I can want you back all over again.

407
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,480
This one's John Mayer because I've heard this song before and the other one is Dave Matthews,

408
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,480
man.

409
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Damn it.

410
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Let me drink you please.

411
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
I won't spill a drop.

412
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
I promise you.

413
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,320
Lying under this spell you cast on me each moment the more I love you.

414
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,920
Now this one is where it's going to get tough.

415
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Well that was Dave.

416
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
You were right.

417
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Yeah.

418
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,920
This one's where it's going to get tough.

419
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Okay.

420
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,460
Don't hold your love over my head.

421
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,960
Don't hold your love over my head, yeah.

422
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,240
Don't hold your love over my head.

423
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,200
Don't hold your love over my head.

424
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Come on.

425
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,500
Come back to bed.

426
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
And then-

427
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,360
That's John Mayer's come back to bed.

428
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,840
This isn't that hard actually.

429
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,560
John Mayer's always in bed and he just wants you to come back to bed.

430
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,200
How do you know so many fucking John Mayer songs, Griffin?

431
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
It's a five, isn't it?

432
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,000
He's a major fucking recording artist and I liked to make out in the early aughts.

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,820
I was feeling- Okay, just listen to this actual factual Dave Matthews lyric that Dave Matthews

434
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,880
man wrote and said, this is a fine thing to project out into the world that I Dave Matthews

435
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
thought of with my brain.

436
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,180
I was feeling like a creep as I watched you asleep, face down in the grass, in the park,

437
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,120
in the middle of hot afternoon.

438
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,400
Your top was untied and I thought how nice it'd be to follow the sweat down your spine.

439
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,560
And then I killed you.

440
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,520
And then I killed- The reason you were face down is I'd stabbed you 10 minutes prior.

441
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,640
It's because I'm the Zodiac killer Dave Matthews man.

442
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,120
Me and old Ted Cruz did a two-hander on Zodiac.

443
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
That was us.

444
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Okay.

445
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Final round.

446
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
All right.

447
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
All right.

448
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,020
Option one, you can't get too much love.

449
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,360
Don't you feel it in your belly?

450
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Go get some.

451
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,260
Go get you some, excuse me.

452
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,000
You can't get too much love.

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,640
The time is right for loving.

454
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,680
So come on, come on.

455
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,320
Option two, had a little love, but I spread it thin, falling in her arms and out again,

456
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,320
made a bad name for my game around town, tore up my heart and shut it down.

457
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Dave and Mayor.

458
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Dave first, Mayor second.

459
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Same.

460
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Correct.

461
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Damn.

462
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Okay.

463
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I thought that'd be harder, Griffin.

464
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I didn't expect you to be such a Mayo.

465
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Yeah.

466
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
I mean, I don't really know his new shit.

467
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,320
I used to be so tender.

468
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Griffin, what happened?

469
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Yeah, where'd it go wrong?

470
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
9-11.

471
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

472
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,320
A lot of people sent this one in.

473
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,400
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Amelia, who asks, can you live in a restaurant, but not

474
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,080
sell food?

475
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,680
I was wondering if you can buy a restaurant, for example, a Taco Bell.

476
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,160
If the Taco Bell shut down for any reason, could I buy the property and turn it into

477
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,640
a house, just like your average living space, keep the logos and signs up that advertise

478
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,840
it as a Taco Bell, but it won't actually sell food, and I technically won't be a Taco

479
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Bell anymore.

480
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,320
Why would you do that, though?

481
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Funny.

482
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,400
I think that they wouldn't want you to keep up the logos and signs.

483
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
You might be able to get away with it for a while.

484
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,800
I don't think they're going to send Papa King to your house, and by your house, I mean

485
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,080
the former Taco Bell building.

486
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,680
They're not going to send him in to tear your shit down or anything, but they aren't going

487
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
to like it.

488
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
They aren't going to like that.

489
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:20,480
Yeah, but you're just opening yourself up to people coming in your house unbidden and

490
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,160
being like, hey, can I get, and you're like, oh, it's not actually, I don't serve food,

491
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,960
and they're like, then why do you have all the signage and everything you left the light

492
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
on for me?

493
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Why wouldn't I?

494
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Now, here's what's a way more interesting thing.

495
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Yeah.

496
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,040
There are some McDonald's that are open 24-7.

497
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Could I live in that McDonald's?

498
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
What do you-

499
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,920
You know, like in the movie Terminal, where he just lives in the terminal?

500
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Correct.

501
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,640
Yeah, I'm just like, living in McDonald's.

502
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,600
So you're saying because it's open 24-7, then you could live in it?

503
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,440
As opposed to a normal, like a regular business hours McDonald's?

504
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,320
This point doesn't make much sense, Trav.

505
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
That's fair.

506
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
But could you buy that McDonald's after it goes under and live in McDonald's?

507
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,560
Hell, this is my house, McDonald's.

508
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,600
I don't think I'd want to buffet.

509
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,000
If I was going to do this, I'd want to get a restaurant that had a buffet in it.

510
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Right?

511
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Because that's just fun.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,120
But if you have friends over, it's already halfway done.

513
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
True, yourself.

514
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
But okay, wait, wait, wait.

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,600
I need you to understand something.

516
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,480
If a Taco Bell goes under and I move in, I buy the building and I move in, and I refuse

517
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:35,240
to take down the Taco Bell signage, the beef that's in there is one day going to rot.

518
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,040
You don't think they took the beef?

519
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,360
Okay, but you suggesting, I want a buffet so when friends come over, we can have a buffet.

520
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
You realize you're going to have to-

521
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
No, I don't mean the food is there.

522
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,240
I mean all the equipment, Griffin.

523
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,280
So you just want to have fun with buffet equipment.

524
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm saying that the locations are there.

525
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,920
I can make, you know, big things of say, spaghetti or salad or yogurt or whatever and just dump

526
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
them in.

527
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
It's already there.

528
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
I could do that in my house.

529
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
I could do that in my house with big bowls.

530
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,360
Yeah, but you have to put it on a table, Griffin.

531
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,920
When you shop around for houses, do you look and pay attention to, well, here's a cold

532
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,720
hole that I can put pudding in.

533
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,120
This is why I'll buy this one.

534
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
That doesn't mean-

535
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
You don't see the pudding.

536
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,720
You don't see the pudding hole at buffets much anymore.

537
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,840
I don't think my kids have ever seen a pudding hole in a buffet.

538
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
That's true.

539
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Especially not in the, oh, in the current days?

540
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Oh, God.

541
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
That was-

542
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,800
To close down our Golden Corral here in Huntington, guys, I don't know if you knew.

543
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,720
If Golden Corral can't make it into Huntington, I don't know what to tell them, although

544
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:48,200
I guess this unpleasant time, this challenging year, was rough on buffet restaurants, I think.

545
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Yeah, probably.

546
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,220
You know, I think I would rather, and I know this wasn't the question, but that's never

547
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,400
stopped me before, I think I'd rather live on a putt-putt course than I would-

548
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,480
Wow, that really has nothing to do with what we're talking about.

549
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,640
No, I mean, just a restaurant feels so restrictive.

550
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,420
I think with the putt-putt course, you can have, I live in the windmill, and this water

551
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,420
trap is my pool.

552
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,180
I just feel like it's more flexible as far as the things you could do with it, and more

553
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
fun over time.

554
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,160
Because after a while, I think living in a Taco Bell, it would wear off pretty quickly,

555
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,360
where then you're just in a Taco Bell, and you're like, well, there's no rooms and no

556
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:34,840
real place for a bed, whereas I think with a putt-putt course, there's a lot more options

557
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,840
as far as designing it goes.

558
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,280
There's a lot more options as far as dying of exposure, because it's an outdoor venue

559
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
you chose.

560
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
It's so, so insane what you just said, Travis.

561
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,720
It's maybe the, can I say, you've got a checkered past, and I think we would all be lying to

562
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
ourselves.

563
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,760
It may be the dumbest thing you've ever said on the show.

564
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,160
It's so wild to say, to go into a Taco Bell building and be like, no room for a bed in

565
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,280
this one.

566
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,760
It's got two bathrooms in it, the Taco Bell does already, and a break room, and a kitchen,

567
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,760
and a living space.

568
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,240
When was the last time you guys went putt-putting?

569
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,760
There's almost always a cave you walk through or some shit.

570
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,280
There's always at least one interior part of the putt-putt course.

571
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
There's a little waterfall.

572
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
That's cool.

573
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
It's so exposed to the elements, you monster.

574
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,280
It's so wild.

575
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Fuck, man.

576
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,240
Ah, you guys are being so close-minded right now.

577
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,760
You're telling me you would rather live in an old, stinky Taco Bell than in a fresh air.

578
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,040
What you just said is fucking hateful, first of all.

579
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,400
You don't think that the fucking smell of beef is so baked in.

580
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Pleasant and good?

581
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Yeah, no, for sure, dude.

582
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,400
For sure, for sure.

583
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,240
Maybe pleasant for like 10 minutes when you're in the Taco Bell, but if it was all the time,

584
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,520
I'm telling you right now, hey, any Taco Bell employee listening to this, you tell us right

585
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,520
now.

586
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,560
You tweet at Griffin McElroy, at Justin McElroy.

587
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,480
Tell them about how your clothes smell when you come home from Taco Bell, and I'm not

588
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,900
even going to lead the witness.

589
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,080
You just tell them how they smell.

590
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,480
When the family comes up to you after you get home from a shift and gives you big hugs.

591
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,680
You're chased by dogs down the street.

592
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,600
Ooh, what is that spicy beef smell?

593
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,560
All the neighborhood straight dogs are trying to kill you and eat your shirt.

594
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,080
Everyone grab Dennis and huff him quick before the smoke, before the scent goes away.

595
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,640
I don't need those tweets, by the way.

596
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,320
I worked at Olive Garden where we always came home coated in something called OG water.

597
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Oh, yeah.

598
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
We've talked about OG water, I believe.

599
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,280
So, yeah, I don't need a lesson in that.

600
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,320
My man, Tommy Redd, used to give me a ride to school every day, and he would have his

601
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,360
Fizzoli's clothes in the back seat.

602
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:37,560
And God, every time I got into his car, it was like an assassin was trying to suffocate

603
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
me with garlic bread.

604
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
It was the worst.

605
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:47,180
I'm just saying, a Taco Bell establishment is one bed away from being a home.

606
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
That's it.

607
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
That's beautiful.

608
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,700
You could actually cross stitch that into a sampler.

609
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,260
Every Taco Bell staff is a family.

610
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,160
That's what I've been trying to get you guys to realize.

611
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,160
We're a family here.

612
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,400
We look out for each other.

613
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,360
Is that why you keep giving me those applications?

614
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,040
I'm just saying it's a family, Travis.

615
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,080
You could finally have a family of your own.

616
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Imagine it.

617
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,920
Blood is thicker than the bun.

618
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,320
That doesn't make sense.

619
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,480
Think outside the blood.

620
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Inside the blood.

621
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,560
I recently quit my job at a certain fast food place.

622
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
Wow.

623
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,160
We didn't part on the best terms.

624
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,360
I told them I was quitting in the middle of a mandatory quarantine.

625
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:31,160
While I'm happy to never make the food again, their salads were once a regular lunch for

626
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
me.

627
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
My question is this.

628
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,880
Was the appropriate amount of time to wait before I can head back to the drive-thru window

629
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,560
I used to clean?

630
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:41,800
That's from Wendy's Widow in West Virginia.

631
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Right away.

632
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:51,040
A weird conflux of talking points in this episode already here.

633
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,040
You left the familia, and there's a price to pay with that, I feel like.

634
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,120
I would say zero amount of time.

635
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,480
I think the best thing you could do is walk out, get in your car, drive through the drive-thru,

636
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
and get a salad.

637
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,920
Yeah, I mean, I completely agree.

638
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,760
I feel like you quit, you get in your car, you pull up to the window, one Southwest avocado

639
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,260
chicken for me to go.

640
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,640
Because the best part about that is possibly you do that before the other person realizes

641
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,360
you don't get an employee discount anymore.

642
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,080
If you time it right, it might be the only way to guarantee you've got the most sumptuous

643
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,160
foods is if you prep the chicken and all the salad ingredients.

644
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,160
Like, I quit.

645
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,400
Hey, could you hand me that salad I just made?

646
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
I already made it.

647
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,040
I made it perfectly.

648
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,520
Don't fucking touch it.

649
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,800
I put the two giant ice cream scoops of guacamole on top, just like I like.

650
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Don't mess it up.

651
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:58,840
The taco salad at Wendy's, if I may, the taco salad at Wendy's has chips and it's got chili,

652
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,840
right?

653
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,480
Because it's a taco salad.

654
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,640
There's two things I'd like to address here.

655
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,960
One, the chili on top is the same chili that they serve if you buy chili.

656
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,680
The chili at Wendy's is chock full of big chunks of ground beef that are just cut up

657
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,280
hamburgers.

658
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:22,360
So when you get a taco salad, you're eating twice repurposed beef, which I don't love.

659
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,480
The thing I do love, though, is the bag of chips that Wendy's gives you says it's crunch

660
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
time on it.

661
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,980
And what I like about that is they're branding the chips that I have had no part.

662
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,800
You cannot order these chips.

663
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
You do not need to sell me on the chips.

664
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm going to enjoy.

665
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,960
They might as well just say chips and crayon chips with a question mark.

666
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,520
You're still going to fucking eat them.

667
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,680
You're going to eat them because these are the chips.

668
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
But no, it says it's crunch time.

669
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,720
So you get even more excited.

670
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Oh, yeah.

671
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,520
You could say fucking poison on them.

672
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,360
And you would still open them and be like, oh, no, these are the chips that go with the

673
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,260
salad that I put on there.

674
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,560
I'm not examining the packaging.

675
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,080
I'm not looking for a best consumed by date.

676
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,320
You can't take that back to the register and be like, give me different chips.

677
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,440
What a refund for these poison chips.

678
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
No, sir.

679
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
They're not poison.

680
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,280
They're just to scare away the fair weather fans of our chips.

681
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,720
These are for the real windows.

682
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,960
We've I mean, we've had jobs in food service before.

683
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,200
I think not counting the concession stand at the movie theater that I believe we all

684
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,320
worked at or maybe just me and Travis, because I did definitely haunted that.

685
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,240
I did haunt that particular theater after I quit there.

686
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,480
But like the TCBY where I cut my teeth, I didn't fucking darken the doorstep of that

687
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,120
particular that it does.

688
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,000
We can talk a big game here, but it does feel, I don't know, wrong to me in a way.

689
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
I never went back.

690
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Let me.

691
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,400
Did you ever go back to the Justin, the Olive Garden?

692
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,640
Did you ever return to it extracurricularly?

693
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
Oh, constantly.

694
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Yeah.

695
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Okay.

696
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Of course.

697
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,640
It is the only OG in town, Griffin.

698
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,640
That's true.

699
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
I guess so.

700
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,640
I never went back.

701
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
It's OG OG.

702
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
I never went back to the Jimothy Johns that I worked out.

703
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,840
Oh, right.

704
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,560
I never went back to the hotel breakfast restaurant that I worked out.

705
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,560
But I think aside from the Shakespeare Company, I have not returned to any job I have ever

706
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
worked at.

707
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
Yeah.

708
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,900
I hardly ever leave them on what one might call a warm regards.

709
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't have, I mean, I don't have a lot of options here.

710
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,000
So I kind of have to, I can't burn any bridges.

711
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:35,760
Like if I burn a bridge with the Chipotle in town, I just don't ever get to eat Chipotle

712
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
again.

713
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
Yes, you no longer get burritos.

714
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I take that back.

715
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,720
I did return to the Best Buy I had worked at after I quit.

716
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,080
And even though it was six months later, many of the people I encountered were surprised

717
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,440
to learn I didn't work there anymore.

718
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,720
So like just maybe just take that in if you're worried about going back, chances are none

719
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,180
of them care.

720
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,500
So that's something.

721
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,520
It's called Best Buy, not Best Friends.

722
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,520
That's true, Griffin.

723
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,480
But fucking I bled blue for that place.

724
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
You know I did.

725
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Yeah.

726
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,360
He was always like 573 on top.

727
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,360
That's right.

728
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,080
He was always like repping the store.

729
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,840
This is a fun thing because Huntington's not that big of a place.

730
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,320
There's an overlap of jobs Justin and Griffin and I have worked at different times.

731
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,520
It's a fun Venn diagram that I think we have six degrees of separation connected every

732
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,920
business in Huntington.

733
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,200
I don't think we've had the same, except for Cowabunga, the WTCR mascot, a job we worked

734
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,640
very illegally at very young ages.

735
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,640
Indeed.

736
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,520
In fairness, we weren't paid in money, but rather in company trades.

737
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,960
Yes, we were paid in skrit.

738
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
Yeah.

739
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
Radio skrit.

740
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,000
I traded it in on a freaking couch for my parents who gave me a hundred dollars.

741
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:56,280
Hey, listen, this has been so fun and I'm loving it, but let's take a quick break and

742
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:08,920
go to the Money Zone.

743
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:18,920
What's wrong, Trav?

744
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,920
What's wrong?

745
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
It is I, Beep Blork.

746
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,440
I'm not.

747
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,440
Actually, I am so sick.

748
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,440
You have to handle Beep Blork.

749
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

750
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
Okay, Griff.

751
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,440
Love you, bud.

752
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,440
But I don't want to have to do it.

753
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,080
See, Griffin, this is what I'm talking about.

754
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,280
I came to this planet to get what you humans call love.

755
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah.

756
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,200
Perhaps it is Beep Blork's bad breath.

757
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Let's start.

758
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Can we do something else?

759
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Hey, Griffin.

760
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Yeah.

761
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
Gum.

762
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
What is it?

763
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,000
Nobody's really sure.

764
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,560
Quip.

765
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,960
It's the good habits company.

766
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,240
You've heard us say that a thousand times.

767
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
What does that mean?

768
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Flossing.

769
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
Yes.

770
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,480
What about the rest of the time, right?

771
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,800
We all like to eat some candy, maybe even chew some gum.

772
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,040
Are those good habits?

773
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:07,240
Well, they can be now because gum from Quip, it's new.

774
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,860
It's there, and it's good for your oral health.

775
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,800
It comes in a really cool dispenser that'll make you look like some kind of, I would say,

776
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,920
cool spy with a cool spy gadget.

777
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Do I hear it?

778
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Do I hear the dispenser?

779
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Yes, please.

780
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Yes.

781
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Isn't that cool?

782
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Yeah.

783
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,920
That's pretty good.

784
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,240
I would warn you on the directions to not do it into your mouth because the gum does

785
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:34,680
come out with, I will say this, Quip, a not inconsiderable amount of velocity.

786
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,320
More stink than you needed to put on there.

787
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
Yeah.

788
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,920
Just do that into your hand and then eat the gum.

789
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
No.

790
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
I think it's the exact right amount of stink.

791
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Okay.

792
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,640
Quip gum can help prevent cavities and freshen breath when chewed for 20 minutes after eating.

793
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,760
It's sugar-free and has tooth-friendly xylitol with zero calories.

794
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,760
Now, let's be clear.

795
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,560
It's not a substitute for brushing and flossing, but it is a great support for your oral health

796
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,960
and you can go ahead and pair that with your Quip electric toothbrush and refillable floss.

797
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,080
And if you go to getquip.com slash my brother right now, you can get a free plastic dispenser

798
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,640
with any refill plan.

799
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:12,240
That's a free dispenser at getquip.com slash my brother, spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P.com slash

800
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
my brother.

801
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,640
Quip, the good habits company.

802
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,000
It says in here, we have to say it's not a substitute for brushing and flossing.

803
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,880
Folks, if somebody made a gum that was a substitute for brushing and flossing, I don't think they'd

804
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
need to run ads.

805
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,440
I think you'd probably hear about it, right?

806
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,320
It'd be all over the place.

807
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,200
You'd go to CVS and they'd be like, uh-oh, looks like you can only have COVID vaccine

808
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,360
or toothbrush gum.

809
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
You'd go with toothbrush gum.

810
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,400
Now, listen, it still gets you nice and clean.

811
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,020
I like to pop one in there after lunch.

812
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
You know what I like to do?

813
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,020
Brush my teeth.

814
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,120
And then after I drink my coffee, chew some gum.

815
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,120
Chew some gum.

816
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,120
That's over, guys.

817
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
You don't have to keep chilling gum.

818
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,640
You know, the seasons are changing.

819
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
Yes.

820
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,640
Right.

821
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,720
God, we're like right in the middle of it.

822
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,600
It's the least applicable that could possibly be, but things are cold here.

823
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,640
And I realized that I don't have a lot of cold weather clothes, right?

824
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,920
But twist, I don't go outside.

825
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,500
So I've got all of these cold weather clothes and they're all ill fitting and also like,

826
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,400
I don't want to wear them.

827
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,600
And so I need to stock up on all kinds of different looks and there's only one place

828
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,400
I have returned to for that.

829
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,640
And that is Stitch Fix.

830
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,340
It's not like online shopping.

831
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,400
That's such a stretch, man.

832
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,120
You get the clothes, you don't know what size they're going to be.

833
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,040
You don't know any of that, but Stitch Fix does all the hard work and just makes it fun.

834
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,760
You talk to one of their stylists about your style, your budget, what the size of your

835
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,200
different body segments are, and they're going to mail you some clothes to try on.

836
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,760
You keep the stuff you like, you send back the rest.

837
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,280
Stitch Fix has free shipping, easy returns to exchanges, and a prepaid envelope is included.

838
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:56,040
And there's no subscription required.

839
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Half my clothes I own probably around that came from Stitch Fix and the other half are

840
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,000
Jimmy Buffett t-shirts.

841
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,240
We really believe in this company and we love the fashion that they're able to extend to

842
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,040
us and anybody who's willing to join up.

843
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,480
So you can get started today at stitchfix.com slash my brother, and you'll get 25% off when

844
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,920

845
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,280
That's stitchfix.com slash my brother for 25% off when you keep everything in your fix.

846
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,320
Stitchfix.com slash my brother.

847
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm going first.

848
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
It's me, Jackie Cashin.

849
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Man, she's always this bossy.

850
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm Lori Kilgarten.

851
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:44,320
We're a bunch of stand-up comics and we've been doing comedy like 60 years total, both

852
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
of us, but we look amazing.

853
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,480
We drop every Monday on MaxFun and it's called The Jackie and Lori Show and you could listen

854
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,280
to it and learn about comedy and learn about anchor management and all the things.

855
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,880
And Jackie is married but childless and I'm unmarried but childful.

856
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,120
So together we make One Complete Woman.

857
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,960
Is that just what that one's going to end?

858
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,080
And we try to make Kyle laugh just like that and say, oh my God, every episode.

859
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,080
It's a good job.

860
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:20,280
The Jackie and Lori Show, Mondays only on Maximum Fun.

861
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,440
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

862
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,840
I'm not cutting anybody off today.

863
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm done with that.

864
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

865
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:38,000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

866
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Here I am.

867
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,240
Munch me like a squatter cane.

868
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:49,440
Hello, welcome to Munch Squad, this podcast is a podcast focusing on the lazy and grace

869
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:57,080
in brand eating and this is a subseries of this podcast called Letters from the Poultry

870
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Front.

871
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,920
Can I give you a quick note?

872
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Yeah, please.

873
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,520
Munch me is not something I ever want to hear you say again.

874
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
It's too late.

875
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
It's in your hippocampus.

876
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,040
It's got to live there.

877
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,680
Rent free is the TikTok kids say.

878
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,840
Oh, damn it.

879
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,360
Guys, this is intense out there and I don't know if you've seen some of the bodies lining

880
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:25,740
the streets, but the war is bloodier and more brutal than ever and it is not showing any

881
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,080
signs of slowing.

882
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,960
Hey, what the fuck are you talking about?

883
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,000
I am going to read today, not in their entirety, but I'm going to give you a sampling of five

884
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,920
press releases, all released within a no bullshit two week window.

885
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Understand?

886
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
Yeah.

887
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Yeah.

888
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,920
Okay.

889
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,240
Let's check in on checkers and rallies.

890
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
We'll start there.

891
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
Okay.

892
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Okay.

893
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,760
So these are going to speed up turnaround.

894
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,400
You go into checkers and rallies and you're going to get out quicker, which is good because

895
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,440
the ambiance isn't what you go to checkers and rallies for.

896
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,780
You go so you can get your wings and your best fries in the fast food biz and you move

897
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
on with your life.

898
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:18,240
And this press release from January 14th proudly announces that they have, and this is the

899
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,080
wording that they use.

900
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,520
They've launched a new chicken sandwich platform.

901
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,200
The mother cruncher chicken sandwich platform.

902
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,240
It's not a literal platform.

903
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,440
It's just a place to bounce your ideas off of, but it's the mother cruncher.

904
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,440
Okay.

905
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,400
And they think that you're going to love it.

906
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:45,960
Let's go over to a Boston market where they are, you just said a thing.

907
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,080
You just said a thing and you need to explain what a chicken sandwich platform is.

908
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,960
The platform to bounce your ideas off?

909
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,760
What the fuck are you talking about?

910
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
I don't know.

911
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,360
This is in the press release.

912
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,360
What am I an interpreter?

913
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Okay.

914
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,360
I'm just telling you what it says.

915
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Okay.

916
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
All right.

917
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
McDonald's.

918
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,520
Let's, I'm actually going to go over to McDonald's.

919
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Okay.

920
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,960
The McDonald's January 4th, the chicken sandwich wars aren't slowing down.

921
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,140
Oh, they're going to roll out new chicken sandwiches in February.

922
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,360
We've heard our customers loud and clear.

923
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,080
We know they're craving more chicken options.

924
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:22,700
We're confident all chicken fans from traditionalists to spice.

925
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,240
That is a fucking hell of a clause.

926
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,080
We'll discover a new menu favorite.

927
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,120
They'll come back for time and time again.

928
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,480
And this is all in service.

929
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,800
They want to be the best in the biz, in the chicken wars.

930
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,680
And they got three new sandwiches to prove it.

931
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,400
And Erlinger, who's the president of McDonald's US.

932
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,480
Of course, says developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest

933
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,280
aspirations.

934
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,040
We want customers to choose McDonald's for chicken because of the unique, craveable flavor

935
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,280
that they can only get under the arches.

936
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,680
To get started, we listened to customers to understand our current barriers and potential.

937
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,640
The only barrier there could be is people don't like your chicken.

938
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,400
So they're trying something different.

939
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,800
Here at KFC, they've launched, this is from January 7th, KFC has launched the best chicken

940
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
sandwich ever.

941
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
So fuck you.

942
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,760
They weren't going to sit out the latest round of the quick service chicken sandwich wars.

943
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,760
What?

944
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,280
The chain introduced its best chicken sandwich ever Thursday in select markets.

945
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,040
It's simply labeled the KFC chicken sandwich, bold.

946
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,280
It's got a buttery brioche bun topped with crispier, thicker pickles and the perfect

947
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,400
amount of the Colonel's real Mayo.

948
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,400
And no chicken.

949
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
No, sorry.

950
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,600
I want to just isolate one for everybody.

951
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,200
The Colonel's real Mayo.

952
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:02,440
I did see a commercial with one of these sandwiches in it and fellas, they are not kidding about

953
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,680
the size of these pickles.

954
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
It's obscene.

955
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:13,000
The size of the depth of these pickles is obscene.

956
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Fuck I want a chicken sandwich.

957
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Okay, go on.

958
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,920
Zaxby's is offering General Tso's.

959
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Okay.

960
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,920
Okay.

961
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Zaxby's.

962
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,920
Now you have me.

963
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,960
Now you have me Zaxby's.

964
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,360
Zaxby's is doing General Tso's chicken wings for a limited time.

965
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,360
Oh, not chicken sandwich.

966
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,800
Oh, but even that, I think when it's like, we're all doing sandwiches and Zaxby's is

967
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,080
like, we're over here fucking partying.

968
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,640
Zaxby's has got Texas toast and napkins.

969
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,560
You can make a fucking General Tso's sandwich if you want to get nasty.

970
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,880
Zaxby's has an alternative to fast food.

971
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,440
All right, bud.

972
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,040
Zaxby's serves fresh prepared at order, hand breaded chicken fingers with Z and wings toss

973
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,160
a variety of sauces.

974
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:57,760
Zaxby's recently introduced a new signature sandwich in test markets with a choice of

975
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,100
Zax's sauce or new spicy Zax sauce.

976
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,840
The company has plans for a nationwide rollout because the chicken sandwich war ain't over

977
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
yet.

978
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Oh boy.

979
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
I have one more.

980
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,640
Boston market, the January 19th, okay, Boston market boldly launches Nashville hot crispy

981
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:25,880
chicken sandwich declaring the chicken sandwich wars are over, which was recently declared.

982
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,760
You can't just declare that you have to kill everyone else.

983
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,920
This is, I think this is what they are claiming they have done.

984
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:42,520
Zaxby's just reassured us on this exact same day that the chicken sandwich wars are not

985
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
over.

986
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,800
Boston market leads it eventually.

987
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,600
They are over, but it's not January 19th.

988
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:58,200
Actually they're not, they're not over and Boston market says they actually are.

989
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,640
We've entered the fray with our own take, the Nashville hot crispy chicken sandwich.

990
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,640
It's the first crispy chicken sandwich in the company's 30 year history and it's been

991
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:12,880
available for a limited time, which if you're telling me this is the sandwich to bring peace

992
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,320
to the galaxy, you should probably keep it on the menu for a while just to limit the

993
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,040
number of mothers and sons being separated by the grim reaper.

994
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,820
Alongside launch, Boston market will introduce new crispy chicken BLT sandwich and crispy

995
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,200
chicken and white gravy.

996
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,200
That's it.

997
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Here's, here's what's up.

998
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
Here's what I appreciate.

999
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,820
McDonald's, they done took the damn grilled chicken sandwich off the menu.

1000
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:42,100
They said, if we're going to get, if we're going to get, if we're going to join voluntarily

1001
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:47,880
this chicken sandwich war, we're going to put all of our fucking resources behind it.

1002
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,680
The grilled chicken sandwich is a distraction.

1003
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,240
Everybody else is like, yeah, we also are kicking ass with our crispy chicken sandwich,

1004
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,080
but also check out this one.

1005
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,400
This one's got a zesty Italian flavors like, no, that's not the war though.

1006
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,600
Can I tell you guys what's really fucking me up right now?

1007
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
What's that?

1008
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:06,600
What?

1009
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:10,240
Is that we've heard from these five companies and it's like, there's been so much carnage

1010
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,680
already in the chicken wars, but we haven't heard from fucking Popeye's yet.

1011
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,400
And Popeye's launched, no, no, no, no.

1012
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
They launched the first shot across the galaxy.

1013
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
It was opening salvo.

1014
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,480
No, but this is what I'm saying is like, they launched it and if anyone's going to finish

1015
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:32,400
it, I have this feeling that Popeye's might actually, factually kill KFC and or, I mean,

1016
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,240
Boston market seems like they'd be the first to go, right?

1017
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Then Zaxby's?

1018
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Yeah.

1019
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,760
Zaxby's is going to make it pretty far, I think.

1020
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,760
I don't know.

1021
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,760
Yeah, you think?

1022
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,240
I could see them being like the, like we have these like, you know, swamp fighter techniques

1023
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,360
where it's just like, you know, like how we won the revolutionary war, right?

1024
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,360
I see Boston market is out there like, oh, we're fighting the chicken wars in like

1025
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,720
perfect, you know, formation, and Zaxby's is like, we dropped down from trees to Hansard

1026
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
sandwich.

1027
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
Zaxby's is down here in his fucking ghillie suit.

1028
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,040
Listen, Boston market is not fucking around because I want to bring you my new favorite

1029
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,080
CEO in the biz.

1030
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,280
Okay, last week we learned about a sentient potato king, so let's be careful about the

1031
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,280
words we use.

1032
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,760
Okay, let's check it out.

1033
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,760
Actually not CEO.

1034
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,480
He's president Randy Miller.

1035
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,200
It's me, Randy Miller, the president of Boston market.

1036
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,840
If you leave the market off, it's a man announcing I'm Randy Miller, the president of Boston.

1037
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
Deal with it.

1038
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,800
2020 is behind us and so are the chicken sandwich wars.

1039
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,280
We've been bringing the heat in our rotisserie ovens for more than 30 years and our new Nashville

1040
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:41,680
hot crispy chicken sandwich proves there's only room for one chicken expert in this country.

1041
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,680
Really?

1042
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,440
Boston market will always be king.

1043
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,200
Jesus God.

1044
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,580
With this new menu, we wanted to introduce music city's legendary hot sauce flavor to

1045
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,800
all our guests across the country.

1046
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,200
I brief, uh, if I may interrupt Randy, you may not to please.

1047
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,200
It's my show.

1048
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:06,120
I just want to say it's wild that, um, if you want to bring another city's flavor, you

1049
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,960
should probably not name your restaurant after a city.

1050
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,200
People are going to start to wonder where your allegiances lie.

1051
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,400
There's no better way to do that than alongside our legendary rotisserie chicken and a crispy

1052
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,920
chicken sandwich that will quickly become the best thing our guests and probably our

1053
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,360
competitors will have ever tasted.

1054
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,840
Our Nashville hot crispy chicken sandwich is no doubt the best sandwich out there today.

1055
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
There you have it.

1056
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,920
And we challenge everyone to put it to the taste.

1057
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,400
Oh, a taste test, of course.

1058
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Okay.

1059
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,640
You fucking fell apart in the end Randy, I got to get so sick Randy.

1060
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
You have it.

1061
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,280
You were doing so good Randy.

1062
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,160
Everyone put it to the taste.

1063
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,160
A taste taste.

1064
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,160
A taste taste.

1065
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,160
Taste taste.

1066
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:00,240
You got to taste, taste it to waste it.

1067
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,240
Fuck.

1068
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,960
Tea in the wind.

1069
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Taste taste.

1070
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,460
Hey, I'm here for my taste taste of the best music city sandwich on earth.

1071
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,600
Seems like we might need to scrap whatever we were planning for next week's episode and

1072
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,960
just like get into these crispy boys.

1073
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,360
I just want everybody to realign their focus on like why we're doing this in the first

1074
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:28,000
place and that is because it is unethical to eat Chick-fil-A, but nobody's really doing

1075
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,300
their weird wet flat pickle mess that I haven't eaten in many years now just from a principal

1076
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,300
standpoint.

1077
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,620
But hey, I've tried some of the other ones.

1078
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:43,000
I remember there was one week for a second where we all maybe got tricked for just a

1079
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,440
second into thinking Chick-fil-A had turned a corner and then like four days later they're

1080
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:50,680
like, hi, I'm just kidding, here's a million dollars.

1081
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,180
Just listen.

1082
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,120
I didn't eat during that period is what I'm saying.

1083
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,960
What I'm saying is I was like, oh man, this weekend I might cook.

1084
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:57,960
That's hope.

1085
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,880
Hope we missed the weird wet pickle mess, but like it's a principal thing, but nobody's

1086
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,280
really going for that weird wet pickle mess aesthetic.

1087
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
And that's kind of-

1088
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,880
It would be great if they could all get together to crush Chick-fil-A.

1089
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,080
That's what I'm saying, team up.

1090
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,080
Just yeah.

1091
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,040
That's, I will continue to bring everyone updates-

1092
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,880
From the front please.

1093
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:19,720
If I can just mention one more thing.

1094
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,600
This is the last one before and I just want to, Tropical Smoothie sees increased demand

1095
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,800
in Cajun shrimp menu offerings, okay?

1096
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,280
I just want to, this is the name of the press release.

1097
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:37,520
And then you're reading through, sounds all very reasonable.

1098
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,640
And then the first line of this story is many of its largest competitors continue to fight

1099
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,660
the long raging chicken sandwich war.

1100
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:52,120
And then the end of it is a quote that says, we provided a fresher flavorful alternative

1101
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,720
and it's outperforming any new food I'm in our history.

1102
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,780
Maybe 2021 will mark the end of the chicken sandwich wars.

1103
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:02,800
This is from January 19th also guys.

1104
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,480
I don't know what's fucking happening, but three different places say, on this exact

1105
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:17,360
same date, okay, Zaxby's is like, the chicken sandwich wars are really continuing.

1106
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,600
They're not over yet.

1107
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,180
And then Boston Market said, they actually are over.

1108
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,780
And Tropical Smoothie said, I don't know, maybe they are, maybe they aren't.

1109
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,360
These are not the same company.

1110
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,880
They're different companies.

1111
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,960
How the fuck did everybody just decide like, the war is on.

1112
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,320
We're calling it a war.

1113
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,720
Yes, it's a war.

1114
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,840
We're all doing a chicken sandwich war right now.

1115
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,560
And it's not over until we all agree that it's over.

1116
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,640
Is there maybe some kind of like shadowy organization that is like, actually all of these chicken

1117
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,040
places are owned by the exact same like company.

1118
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,720
And like we drum up the war just to like, I don't know, I don't know.

1119
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,000
Big Tysons.

1120
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,480
We drum up the war to get more ASMR people to do taste tests and compare the sandwiches.

1121
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,480
Mm-hmm.

1122
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,840
Hey, I have a Yahoo here that was sent in by Graham Robot, thanks Graham.

1123
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,440
It's Yahoo Answers user, they're anonymous.

1124
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:16,080
Their name is gonna be, for this one, their name is gonna be Trey asks, family safe Scrabble

1125
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,560
game modifications.

1126
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,720
My Nana won't play the game Scrabble with us anymore because she doesn't want to feel

1127
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:28,400
pressured to use an unpleasant or dirty word out of desperation slash lack of other options.

1128
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,120
Just to keep the game moving along.

1129
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:33,520
I understand her concerns completely.

1130
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,280
Is there a way to modify Scrabble to make it safe for her to play so she doesn't have

1131
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,480
to spell a word she doesn't want to?

1132
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,460
I was thinking of either removing the P, F, V, B, T, C and D tiles or adding in a lot

1133
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,340
of the other letters from other sets of the game.

1134
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,000
Does anyone have any other suggestions?

1135
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,520
Updated two weeks ago.

1136
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,200
We don't allow dirty words, but if it is the only option left, Nana feels like she is forced

1137
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,280
to and it upsets her.

1138
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
Oh.

1139
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:08,560
Updated six hours ago, the tile swap rule is akin to gambling, so we refuse to use that

1140
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,560
rule.

1141
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Oh, yeah.

1142
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,480
A lot happening here.

1143
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,840
I was jokingly going to suggest removing the F tiles, and they just done went ahead and

1144
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,600
said, hey, I'll see your joke and raise you a scary suggestion.

1145
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,640
Okay, but here's the thing, F, you remove that, what do you get rid of?

1146
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,640
You know, the big one.

1147
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:31,640
Fucking fart.

1148
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:32,640
The F bomb.

1149
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,640
F fart?

1150
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,360
If we could stop, if we could try and be very careful not to just George Carlin it up on

1151
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,300
this segment because I want us to be sort of clinical about this.

1152
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:48,120
If you take out the U, I feel like that's going to cover a lot more cuss words per letter.

1153
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
What about the K?

1154
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,880
No, the C. The C's in a lot of them.

1155
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
C's in a lot.

1156
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,880
C's do a lot of work.

1157
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah.

1158
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,520
Because you got the B word, the F word, I mean the C word.

1159
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,600
The B word being butt?

1160
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:03,120
No, Griffin, the five letter B word.

1161
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,800
Oh, yeah, that one.

1162
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,400
You got the D word in there.

1163
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,920
I feel like C covers a lot.

1164
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:13,080
C would cover a lot actually.

1165
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,000
So we've figured out that C is the nasty letter.

1166
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,660
Now bad news, that does also remove cat.

1167
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,120
So that's a problem right there.

1168
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
You can't use cat.

1169
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,520
You know what the fucking problem is?

1170
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,280
Is that because it's Scrabble, you would have to get the blank tiles out too because some

1171
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,840
fucking naughty boy could use those tiles and put down blank, blank, blank, K and people

1172
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
are like, what is that?

1173
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:48,040
And he'd be like, grandma, it's fuck.

1174
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,560
That right there you're looking at grandma, despite appearances, is a fuck.

1175
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,520
Or even worse, grandma's the one that plays that because it's the only legal move she

1176
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
has.

1177
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,200
And then she just bursts into tears.

1178
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,720
That's that one question.

1179
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,720
We don't allow dirty words.

1180
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:10,120
But if they're the only option, grandma feels like she has, I would argue they're not an

1181
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
option.

1182
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,080
If it's against the rules, that's all these games are.

1183
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,080
It's just not an option.

1184
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,320
Is it possible that secretly grandma's dying to play them dirty words?

1185
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:23,120
And she knows that you all are very controlling and you'll judge her.

1186
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,400
And so that's why she's gonna be like, oh, I'm so uncomfortable.

1187
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,200
Oh my God, I can't believe this is the only option, but okay, but I'm just gonna go ahead

1188
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,360
and put it down.

1189
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:39,480
But now grandma, you've just played nine letters all at once to make three different words.

1190
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,400
Yes, no, I know I feel terrible.

1191
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,200
But where did you get, there's like two extra letters there.

1192
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,080
I just found them under my leg.

1193
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
I can't believe I saw them there.

1194
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:55,560
I think a really great house rule for your game should be that your grandma can play

1195
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:04,040
cuss words, but whenever she does, nobody's allowed to say them or acknowledge that they

1196
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,800
are a dirty word.

1197
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:10,680
So grandma just spells out fuck on the board and everybody just kind of looks at it and

1198
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,160
then looks at each other and then quietly writes down however many points it's worth.

1199
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:17,160
And they just don't.

1200
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,160
Man, that's the worst part.

1201
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,160
Fuck is not worth a lot of letters.

1202
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,640
I mean, a lot of points really, when you think about it.

1203
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,640
There's not any big.

1204
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:26,240
Now, if you can spell it F-U-Q-U-E, now we're talking.

1205
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,440
Which is how they do it in Montreal.

1206
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,720
Oh, the French Canadian style.

1207
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,360
It sounds like maybe just, you need Scrabble, but with numbers, but then even then you can

1208
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,360
do 69.

1209
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh, what about graph paper and pens?

1210
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,720
And you just write down whatever letters you want, but then, oh, what if the letters

1211
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,800
accidentally line up and you're doing it and you're like, well, shit.

1212
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,240
You could also have a nasty cousin.

1213
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,840
And then she calls in the nasty cousin and the nasty cousin's like, what's up, grandma?

1214
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,960
And she just gestures down to her tiles and the cousin's like, oh, say no more.

1215
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,680
I understand what needs to be done and I have the will to do it.

1216
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,280
A pinch cusser, if you will.

1217
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,240
A pinch cusser, yeah.

1218
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,320
What if it was just, hey, this no joke sounds like a pretty restrictive household.

1219
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,200
What about just one day a month?

1220
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,280
It's like the fucking purge when it comes to cussing.

1221
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,400
And it's just like that day, that's when we get out the nasty Scrabble set that's all

1222
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
only F-U-C-K.

1223
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
Yeah.

1224
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,400
But then everybody's so wild for it, it's like, grandma, you just played fnk.

1225
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,400
Yeah, I know, but I'd use your imagination and pretend.

1226
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
Does this say cuff?

1227
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,160
Does this say cuff, grandma?

1228
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,160
What the fuck?

1229
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,280
What does that mean?

1230
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,280
You wrote BAFTAd.

1231
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,280
BAFTAd?

1232
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,600
This just says BAFTA, like the award?

1233
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Is that what you were doing?

1234
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,040
Like the British Animation and Film Award?

1235
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,240
I don't think that's what BAFTA stands for.

1236
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:55,320
I don't think it is either, but...

1237
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,320
No.

1238
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,160
British and Film Television Award.

1239
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,360
British and Film Televisions.

1240
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,160
It's an award for both film, television, and being British.

1241
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,880
Maybe you're like, oh man, you did some good British-ing this year.

1242
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,880
Here you go.

1243
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,880
Oh, and also-

1244
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,880
Extremely British.

1245
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,520
I enjoyed you on that television show.

1246
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,960
Baking and film and television.

1247
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,960
The BAFTAd.

1248
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,960
The BAFTAs.

1249
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
Wait, you think that's a lid?

1250
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,960
Is that a lid?

1251
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,960
It's a lid.

1252
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,960
Let's put a lid on it.

1253
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,080
That's a lid.

1254
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:24,360
Thanks so much for joining us on this episode.

1255
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,360
We hope you had fun.

1256
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,520
We hope you're hanging in there and doing well.

1257
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,260
We care about you a great deal.

1258
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,260
The chicken wars are-

1259
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,260
It's tough out there.

1260
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,260
It's tough out there.

1261
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,260
I'm going to check right now.

1262
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,960
I'm going to say, I'm going to make a ruling on this, that they're not over currently.

1263
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
No.

1264
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:38,960
So please let me know how.

1265
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,760
Try as many as you can and just let me know how they are.

1266
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,400
Listen, this is a big week for us, many, many months in the making.

1267
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,640
This week, our how-to podcast book, everybody has a podcast except you.

1268
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:51,640
Years in the making.

1269
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,640
Years in the making.

1270
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,640
I would argue.

1271
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,640
Yeah, that's fair.

1272
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:58,380
It is the culmination of all of our knowledge on podcasting up to this point.

1273
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:04,120
That book comes out this week, comes out January 26th, and then on January 26th at 9pm, we're

1274
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,920
going to have a free virtual event to celebrate the launch of everybody has a podcast except

1275
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
you.

1276
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,920
We've partnered with six independent bookstores.

1277
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,500
If you pre-order from them, you'll get an exclusively designed book plate signed by

1278
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,560
one of the three of us with your copy as long as supplies last.

1279
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,320
You can go to bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event for bookstore links and more event

1280
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,320
info.

1281
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,320
We're really, really proud of this book.

1282
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,560
I really think you're going to like it.

1283
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,700
There's an audiobook version of it too that we did, that we narrated.

1284
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,000
If you have anyone in your life that is thinking about starting a podcast or is just a fan

1285
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,520
of podcasts, I really think they'd like this book.

1286
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,680
So one more time, bit.ly slash McElroy podcast book event.

1287

1288
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,360
We've got that Cerebus Pin of the Month benefiting the NARAL designed by Zach Sterling.

1289
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:57,420
The NARAL fights for access to abortion care, birth control, paid parental leave, and protections

1290
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,040
from pregnancy discrimination.

1291
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:02,440
We've also got that Knights Templar II sticker designed by Tyler Reed over there and a whole

1292
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,800
lot more.

1294
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,800

00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,880

I think that's it.

1303
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,280
You want the final?

1304
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,280
Yes.

1305
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
Absolutely.

1306
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,280
This final Yahoo was sent in by the wizard Ben Cant.

1307
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:39,280
Thank you, Ben.

1308
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:46,360
The answer's user, Nadia, who asks, are you still considered a Frankenstein if all the

1309
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:49,520
body parts came from the same body?

1310
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Oh shit.

1311
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Shit.

1312
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,520
My name is Justin McElroy.

1313
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Fuck.

1314
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
I don't.

1315
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,520
Oh man.

1316
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1317
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,520
Oh man.

1318
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,280
This has been my brother, my brother, may kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1319
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,280
My bean.

1320
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:13,560
Okay, that was the show, hope you had some fun.

1321
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:17,600
Talked for an hour and now our job is done.

1322
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:21,600
Go back into the world, face the day ahead.

1323
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:32,120
Please don't tell our grandparents all the cuss words we said.
