1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:45,120
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say, hey I wanna.

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,520
Whatever happened, nope, nope, whatever, nope, to the nope, nope,

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:01:01,920
no, you miss your old familiar friends, waiting just around the bend, step by step, family matters,

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,880
it's what matters with your family, family matters, well there must be some magic Jews behind these

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,960
temple walls. We've talked about that right? Now we do the dance of joy.

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,640
Hi everybody, welcome to our Fuller House special. Fullest house. Fullest house. We're

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:35,600
gonna be recapping every episode of the show as we enjoy it. And we're gonna smoke a million

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,040
cigarettes while we do it apparently. Yeah, Justin ate a bunch of lit cigars. I'm your

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,720
DJ Tanner, Justin McElroy. I'm your Stephanie Tanner, Travis McElroy. I'm your sweet baby

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,520
brother, Griffin McElroy. I do wanna say that- Hey, can you fucking like just get-

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, I'm gonna- You know what, we're gonna do it again and we're gonna pretend like Griffin

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,320
listens to the show when we record it. I'm your DJ Tanner, Justin McElroy. I'm Stephanie's

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,440
cleavage, Travis McElroy. No, I'm not gonna follow that because that's fucking gross. I'm

18
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:12,720
your Stephanie Tanner, Travis McElroy. And I'm Lil Richie from Family Matters.

19
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,400
And Michelle, like Michelle. I don't wanna do that because she's not apparently still

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,560
a friend of the fam. She's in the extended universe now. Fuller House, let's get some

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,520
quick reactions. Travis, what was the best- I watched the first 15 minutes of the first

22
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,800
episode. So just to give some context of how much I'm able to speak on it, go. Okay, it's

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,760
27 minutes long, so I really just couldn't stick in there. It's when Steve reentered

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,080
the world that I had to step away. Oh no, that's he's the best part, so you're a fool.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,280
I'm gonna go ahead and say Uncle Jesse when he sang Forever. Griffin used dig and just

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,600
fucking disappeared from the room. I burrowed through our nice new hardwood floors and I

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:07,200
disappeared from the room. There was a moment in which Stephanie picks up DJ's baby and

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,880
makes a comment about her breasts that I had to walk away from the computer on which I

29
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,960
was walking and be like, I don't know what this is, but I'm very upset. I don't like

30
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,800
what's going on. If I could just make a humble suggestion to you two, hang in there. Because

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,560
um, later on, okay, in literally like the third episode, um, Stephanie is running the

32
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:41,760
veterinary clinic that DJ runs and she gets herself sprayed by a skunk and her children,

33
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,200
DJ's children, get sprayed by skunks too. There's a shot where DJ walks in, opens the

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:57,040
door to a room where Stephanie is taking a naked bath in tomato juice with DJ's baby

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,240
and her nephew is in another cistern full of tomato juice because it gets the skunk smell

36
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:12,400
out and they're just two cisterns full of tomato juice and there is no, no physical

37
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,960
way that her six year old nephew did not see her naked. It just couldn't happen.

38
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,960
Here's what I love. What this, it reminds me a lot of Girl Meets World, which was the

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,520
Boy Meets World spinoff many decades later. Or Fuller Boys. Fuller Boys was the original

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,520
name of that show. Fuller Boys. Or Family Anti-Matters, which is where the negative

41
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,240
versions of all of them, that's where the Stephane Kael came from. I'm parallaxer Kael.

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,040
Yeah, like that, it reminds me a lot of those spinoffs. I mean like, I just really, you

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:53,600
guys should hang in there. There's a scene later in the season where DJ's son Max, his

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,000
dad died fighting fires and he lied to his classmates about his ability to get a fire

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,080
truck to show up at a kid's birthday party. So Danny Tanner decides to try to right this

46
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:18,160
wrong. There's a scene in Fuller House where a fire chief doesn't let the, a fire truck

47
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,960
attend the birthday party of a little boy whose dad died fighting fires because Danny

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:33,440
Tanner didn't let the fire chief sing on local television 28 years ago. Like, just hang in

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,800
there. Is that canon though? Is there an episode of Full House in which there's a fire chief

50
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,640
who wants to sing on Wake Up in San Francisco and Danny's like, fuck you, this will never

51
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,960
come back to bite me in the ass. And then they were planting that seed. That would be,

52
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,200
okay, Travis, that would literally be like incredible if Fuller House is about them like

53
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,760
reaping what they had sown. Like the count of, in the all too tidy storytelling of the first

54
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,400
eight seasons of Full House. That would be the most incredible show. I just, all I care

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,040
about is Steve's whole fucking style of literally walking into a house being like, yo, I know

56
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,760
your husband just got all burnt up. That's a bummer. But whenever you're ready, I'm ready

57
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,320
to hit that. By the way, let me get some, let me get some pudding. And I don't mean that

58
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,840
sexually. I'm not talking about that widow pudding, unless that is what you call the

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
snack packs that you got in the refrigerator. But I will take both. There's a moment in which

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,760
a gentleman describes Kim and Gibbler as being just amazing at sex. That's her husband, Travis.

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,480
Well, her estranged husband. I'm just saying that the picture of Kim and Gibbler just dominating

62
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,480
in the bedroom made me laugh so hard. Makes perfect sense. Yeah. We got that locked in.

63
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,960
I'm just saying I get it. When I think about Kim and Gibbler, I think raw, pure animal sexuality.

64
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay. By the way-

65
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm just saying that I think Kim and Gibbler is sex. Is sex. Like when I think sex, I'm just-

66
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,040
I feel like you guys don't get it.

67
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,760
Aphroditic spiritual manifestation of sex.

68
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:15,200
You know those like the statue goddesses that represent fertility and sex? That's

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:22,160
Kim and Gibbler to me. And not in a weird way, not in a weird way, but in a very pure-

70
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
You're saying if you ended up in the Gibbler shed,

71
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,760
you would not complain about what happens in there.

72
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah. That's basically it. Thank you for summing that up so clearly.

73
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:39,600
The Gibbler shed is like there's a hole in the back of it that she then crawls through

74
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,360
and then walks 20 feet and then, hey, tannerinos. Kimmy, what's that fucking smell? Don't worry

75
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:53,840
about the smell. Hey, it's impolite to ask about the Gibbler smell. Oh, gross. Don't put your feet

76
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,600
up on the table. Oh, if you only fucking knew. Where do these feet have been?

77
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,440
If you only fucking knew. I turned two men into basically house slippers.

78
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,400
You wouldn't believe what goes on in the Gibbler shed.

79
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,240
Gibble gobble. I gotta go.

80
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,800
We got cisterns full of tomato juice in there.

81
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,080
An important update. When DJ walked in on her naked sister with her kids and a cistern

82
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:28,800
of tomato juice, DJ's response was, oh my lanta. And she has said, oh my lanta an average of eight

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,560
times per episode. Her little son, Max, his hot catchphrase. And I'm going to start working this

84
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,360
in the art show because that's how this stuff becomes memetic. I'm not going to tell you what

85
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
it is. I'm just going to work it in at some point. Excellent. And you tell me if you feel like we've

86
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,640
come up against it, okay? Okay. Does that sound like a deal? Yeah. So everybody is just like on

87
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,760
the lookout. Now, should we identify it or should it be like the listeners right in and the first

88
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,400
person to identify it? I think if you guys are just seeing Quad City DJs, there it is. When you

89
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,240
think that you've heard it, then I think that'll be perfect. You got it. Hey, let's do some advice.

90
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,000
Yeah. Hell yeah. Is that it? Before we start, can we talk about- Wait, is that the catchphrase?

91
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,520
What did you think of CRJ's intro, Griff? I don't love it. I didn't want to talk about it on the

92
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,400
show because I didn't want to betray my girl. It's not her fault. Obviously, I don't think she

93
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,880
arranged the fucking thing, but just the verses are just a mess. She is the greatest pop performer in

94
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,120
the world right now. And those choruses show exactly what she's capable of bringing to the

95
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,040
table. And then the verses are just her singing over that fucking skanky blues riff from the

96
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,440
original. Like, squank, squa-ding-a-ding-dink. Hey, sing for me. Squink-a-dink-a-dunk. No,

97
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
that's not her shit. Don't make her do not her shit. Just let her do the whole thing.

98
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,480
Let her star in it. I wanted to talk about real quick, the Max Fun Drive's coming up. We're all

99
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,480
very, very excited for the Max Fun Drive. We're going to talk more about it. It's a fun time of

100
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,560
year. We have fun stuff planned. We're doing for our bonus episode for donors. Can we talk about

101
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,080
it? Because it's, fellas, it's bananas. We're doing My Brother, My Brother, Me's Second Chances,

102
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,440
where we go back to questions from the first 10 episodes of the show and we try them again,

103
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,840
just to see if our advice game has gotten any better. At least our audio game has. Our audio

104
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,400
game definitely has. Hey gang, I don't know if you've gone back and... First of all, if you're

105
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,240
a listener and not a creator of the show, don't go back and listen to those episodes because we

106
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:36,560
used to be... I'm going to go ahead and call us man ghouls. We used to do questions and we would

107
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:46,080
spend literally a minute and 15 seconds on each one. Yeah. The Yahoo questions used to be the least

108
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,120
interesting question. It used to be like, this question comes from Yahoo. I had a bad date.

109
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,440
And I was like, wait, that was what we chose for Yahoo answers back then? Yeah. Man, it's a... Wow.

110
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
A different show. Anyway, the next one drives coming up soon. We'll talk more about it later.

111
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,200
Great. Are you feeling up to this, Justin? Because you do sound like you ate a bottle.

112
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,040
You sound like Ursula stole your voice. And you're just through sheer force of will,

113
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
just trying to get it back. You're kind of making the sounds even though Ursula stole your voice,

114
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,920
just by slapping your face and moving your lips up and down. You sound like how Fuller House makes

115
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:30,000
me feel. All right. Well, does somebody else want to read? No, I want you to do it. It's your fucking,

116
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,640
it's your job. Yeah. I mean, it is my job. Okay. But now you're just luxuriating in it.

117
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,360
I'm luxuriating you in it, actually. Oh, good. Me now and me editing me,

118
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,600
future edit Griffin, who man, he is a big fan of Justin. Yeah. Really? Do you like that?

119
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
Yeah. He likes all the sniffs and the secret chewing that you do.

120
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,280
I want to make one last note about Fuller House. It made me laugh the hardest of anything. Todd

121
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,760
Vanderwerf, who works for Vox.com, the same company as us, but he said, Fuller House made

122
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,760
me feel like I was an empty burlap sack shaped like a man and I was full of bugs and the bugs

123
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:20,080
move me around. He made him feel like Oogie Boogie. Basically, yes. Here we go, babies.

124
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,400
Listen, I recently met a lovely girl and we hit it off. Now you do sound like Oogie Boogie.

125
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,520
She seems to be attracted to me and I definitely have a thing for her as well.

126
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,320
But things get a little difficult sometimes because she's 19 and I am 24. How do I go about

127
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,240
wooing a younger lady as from an older man, the oldest superhero? Now, Griffin, when you go back

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,880
and edit that, I want you to change the pitch of that up 50%. No, I love it. I love it because

129
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,520
first of all, there is no better question for him to exercise that particular voice for.

130
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,600
For me to put a little soul in your bowl. Yeah. Well, soul is one way of putting it. I would put

131
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,600
it like it sounds like your vocal cords are just two big hands just slapping together and I can

132
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,280
hear each individual slap of them. Tell that. It sounds like the eruption of a volcano is

133
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,240
asking this question. Tell that to all the confused young ladies and dudes out there who

134
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:25,440
just got a little moist. Oh, no. How is a dude- If only your throat was a little moist. I mean,

135
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,080
I know I talk about how often I flood my basement, but physiologically, what is that?

136
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,080
He peed his pants. All the confused young gentlemen whose Justin's voice made him

137
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,040
pee his pants. Yeah. I mean, fuck, we have to talk about this at some point throughout the show,

138
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,160
but the older you get, age is not a thing. When there's a one as the first digit,

139
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
that time gap is harder than say if there was a two in the first digit.

140
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,720
Well, what it is, Griffin, is it's not a problem of age really. There's two other bigger factors,

141
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,480
and that is one, if she is still in college and you are out, you are existing in two different

142
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,480
worlds. Two, it's also a question of amount of responsibility you've had to face and the amount

143
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,000
of maturity you have to actively use on a day to day basis. That's not to say that there aren't

144
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
super mature 19 year olds, but it's a muscle. I don't know if you guys are being willfully

145
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:28,880
obtuse here, but the problem is not the gap. The problem is 19 because it's not 21 and 24

146
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,760
is above 21. Where do you take them? One of you can party. What are you doing? Do you want to

147
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,400
meet my friends? Where are they at? Well, let's see. It's a night, so they're at a bar right now.

148
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:51,200
They're at a bar. Unless this is super special and you're investing and this is like, I can't do shit

149
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,160
with you now, but you're awesome and I love you and I really care about you. In two years, we'll

150
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,880
be able to hang out with everybody and it's worth it, but that's such a big investment. A time,

151
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,080
especially if this person is like studying and going to class and doing stuff, their time is not

152
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:17,840
their own. Don't screw up their future. Counter unless. Is this unprecedented? I don't think you

153
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:27,520
can unless and unless. Combo breaker. Reless. What if it's love? Wait, that was mine though.

154
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,760
Hold on. That was my unless. You can't reless my unless when I literally. You didn't say it. You

155
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:41,120
weren't explicit enough, Travis. So this is like a super less. Yeah. I've underlessed you. Hey,

156
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,240
I got a Yahoo and this one here is from Zoe Kinski climbing that ladder. Thank you, Zoe.

157
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,880
Did you guys know that on the Mabim Bam Wiki, there is a fucking scoreboard of people who've

158
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,240
gotten Yahoo's on the show? Well, that helps us determine. Is the Mabim Bam Wiki still a

159
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,320
going concern? Yeah, it's popping off. Nice. I used it to get our second chances questions.

160
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,000
Anyway, thank you, Zoe. It's by Yahoo Answers user Karasu, who asks, if I am talking on the

161
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,800
phone in my underwear, can people tell by my voice that I am in my underwear? I would say

162
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,040
if it sounds like Justin sounds right now, yes. Yeah, 100%. Justin, you just got that underwear

163
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,200
voice right now. What will it sound like if you're in your underwear? How will it sound different?

164
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,720
I think it sounds okay. Does it sound relaxed or does it sound like someone who hopes you don't

165
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,200
notice they're just in their underwear? I've had dreams where I've been in my underwear in public

166
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:38,720
and I don't remember feeling super chill about it. Yeah. Can we try and experiment real quick?

167
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,560
Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hey, everybody, this is Griffin McElroy. Thank you for listening to

168
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,080
My Brother, My Brother and Me. It's a comedy advice podcast that I do with my two brothers,

169
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:53,360
Justin and Travis. Hey, everybody. This is Griffin McElroy from My Brother,

170
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
My Brother and Me, a podcast I do with my brothers.

171
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
So I think it sounded basically like exactly the same to me.

172
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,480
Was the first one in underwear and the second one was in clothes?

173
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,840
They're both clothes. So that's what you've just said is a synonym.

174
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,520
Oh, I thought that that was like one of those trick questions where it's like a taste test,

175
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,680
but they're both Pepsi and you hadn't actually changed anything at all except the tone of your

176
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,040
voice. Did you just say one of those trick questions where they're both Pepsi?

177
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,840
You know. You know when they do a taste test. They're like jokes on you. Which one do you

178
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,240
like better? The one on the right is Pepsi, but they tasted very... No, no, no. You got it. You

179
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,600
won. You won. You won. In the commercial. Shut the company. Stop filming. In the commercial.

180
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,080
You know. Because we couldn't stomach giving you any brand. We just want to give you delicious

181
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,640
Pepsi. Wouldn't that be a great taste test if it's just like which Pepsi tastes better?

182
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,840
Well, that one's very old and we poured it five hours ago and it's very warm.

183
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,960
That's a barrel aged Pepsi. That's midday sun aged Pepsi.

184
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Do you guys ever think about just your physical state of being when you're

185
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,560
talking on the phone with somebody? Because I actually do feel very self-conscious right now.

186
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Um, my main thing is I don't get, I try not to get too physically comfortable because I

187
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:17,280
don't want to be on the phone for a second longer than I have to. So I'm probably like

188
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,000
pacing around like, uh, is this still happening? Am I still on the phone? It will, they have,

189
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
my body language is saying this, like, are they going to hang up soon? Can I just hang up and

190
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,320
pretend I lost service? If you get a phone call from somebody then,

191
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,880
would you put pants on? Cause I know like sort of your usual state doesn't involve

192
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,800
the wearing of trousers. Um, I, no, I don't. I would leave the room

193
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,960
because it drives me fucking crazy to be on the phone with people, with other people in the room

194
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
or vice versa. There's something that, can I say something? Cause I used to just, I've been doing

195
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,280
this for a couple of minutes now, uh, and now it's, it is starting to get kind of exciting.

196
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
Being in your underpants? Yeah.

197
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,280
Talking to your two brothers? Yeah.

198
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,600
Is it exciting to talk to your brothers in your underwear?

199
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,720
In your underpants? No, no, no. You don't understand. And it's not sexual.

200
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Clearly. I hope I don't understand.

201
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,880
It's not a sexual thing. It's not gibbler. You're not gibblering.

202
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,680
No, no, no, no. God, no. God, I would need, I don't have the harness, but I'm saying that,

203
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,840
and by harness, I mean just full body. It's like a saran, it's like a sexual saran, right?

204
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,920
Um, uh, yeah, like, yeah, it's, it's weird. What does this mean?

205
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:37,200
Do you feel free? Griffin, let me ask you this. Do you feel free? Do you feel good?

206
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,480
Do you feel, is it like the thrill is what's making you feel alive?

207
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,800
No, it's like, it's like challenging.

208
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,280
Like how long will you do it?

209
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,680
Yeah. I'm probably actually going to go ahead and slap those shorts back on.

210
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's go ahead and get those shorts back on.

211
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,680
Let's get those shorts back on, but let's understand that there's still shorts. You know

212
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,080
what I mean? Like what's up with America's hangups?

213
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,320
Holy chalupas.

214
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:01,840
What?

215
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,600
Wait, whoomp, there it is.

216
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,880
Yeah, Trev's got it first.

217
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,380
Yeah.

218
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,160
What? What? No.

219
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,280
Hey, Griffin, hear it one more time. Holy chalupas.

220
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,520
What is that? Wait, what is chalupas replacing there?

221
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,440
Dog shit.

222
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:26,720
I, you're on Netflix. What? They should have made it fucking hard R.

223
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,240
NC17 Fuller House would have been so, just to hear a little eight-year-old be like,

224
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,400
holy shit. What the fuck? Why are we in fucking vats of-

225
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,080
What if they called the show fucker house?

226
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,280
Um, there's a scene where-

227
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,480
Oh my God.

228
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:42,720
Okay.

229
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
No, please.

230
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:51,600
There's, the best joke in Fuller House is that Stephanie Tanner became a DJ named DJ,

231
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,360
and called herself DJ Tanner. It's a really fucking good joke.

232
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,960
It's actually pretty solid.

233
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,840
It's like a solid, it's like really funny. And there's a scene where she's playing Coachella

234
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,600
because DJ Unbreakable broke his arm. And she gets a video call from her nephew Max,

235
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,880
who's nervous about playing a school concert. And to, to help his nerves, she fucking flips

236
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,360
the switch on her iPhone and live streams him playing Old MacDonald Had a Farm.

237
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
To the Coachella audience?

238
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,560
On his trombone.

239
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,280
And that's supposed to make him feel less nervous?

240
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,960
Well, the idea is like, you just played Coachella, right? But like,

241
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,680
like he's playing Old MacDonald Had a Farm on his trombone. And when he finishes,

242
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680
the reaction he gets is nothing.

243
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,120
The audience is fucking deadpan. Like, are you serious? Is this the new sound? Are we old now?

244
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,320
Like that's what being old is when you go to Coachella and everything sounds like

245
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,120
eight year olds playing trombones. Like, oh gosh, I guess I don't get the sound anymore.

246
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,200
Yeah. Kendrick, uh, he's got a tight opener. He's, uh, he's called Trombone Boy

247
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,120
and he's sick as fuck. What's his set? Like, what's he do? Well, you know,

248
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,840
Chill Wave? Yeah. It's nothing like that. It's a horn with like a slidey bit on it.

249
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
Can I read another question?

250
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Hey, can we just fucking cancel this episode and just release like the audio from a 28 minute

251
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,040
episode of Fuller House?

252
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,240
That'll be the second half. That's after the money's done. It's just going to be all Fuller

253
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,040
House.

254
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,160
Yeah. I would like to do something like that just to see like what happens.

255
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,320
Like what is, what happens?

256
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
How litigious are their lawyers?

257
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,360
Like what? No, but here's what I'm asking. What happens? Like if we make the second half

258
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,000
of an episode, not a second half, I would just want to pin it to the end of a full length

259
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,280
episode, right? Cause I don't want people to get cheated. But like what happens?

260
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,760
What happens to-

261
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,040
And we just put all the audio from a Fuller House episode at the end of our episode.

262
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,760
What happens?

263
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,360
If we edit in fart sounds, is that fair use? Is that how fair use works?

264
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,880
You know, yeah. Cause that would be a criticism.

265
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:03,920
Okay.

266
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah.

267
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,440
I've just figured out fair use.

268
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,000
I mean, how, how it's, it's all about, it's all about economies of scale, right? Cause

269
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,120
Justin, you, you said you've already, we've already stepped, put our foot into the ocean

270
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,160
by saying Holy Chalupas and Oh My Lanta and talking about Kimmy Gibbler's Sex Dungeon

271
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,200
and Gibbler Sex Rap, which is now a product you can buy on Extreme Restraints.

272
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,360
There's a whole Gibbler line of, of, you can get a Gibbler, Gibbler Sex Rap.

273
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,640
You can get Gibbler, the Gibbler Harness. You can get the Gibbler Gobbler, which is a-

274
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
You can get, um, Nipple Gibblers.

275
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,720
You can get, um, a Gildo.

276
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,480
Uh-huh.

277
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,480
That's actually, I think, a monster from Zelda. Anyway, um-

278
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
That's the one that eats your shield, right?

279
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Yeah. And this thing, this product will also eat your shield, if you know what I'm talking about.

280
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,920
I don't.

281
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,880
Yeah, please explain that to me.

282
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,320
What would your shield relate to in a sexual manner? Like, the condom?

283
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:13,200
Yes. It's a, it's a female condom that eats and negates both. It's a bad product. It's a bad

284
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
product. You shouldn't use the, the Gildo.

285
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,560
Don't use the Gildo. They're being recalled.

286
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,320
Uh, because it'll also take your rupees away. I forgot what I was talking about.

287
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,680
I'm going to read a question.

288
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,720
Please.

289
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,760
It's my birthday.

290
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,480
Cool!

291
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,760
Yeah, nice. Some people at the office put up a small banner and a couple of signs at my desk.

292
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,640
I appreciate this.

293
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
What are the, what are the signs? It is your birthday.

294
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,280
Birthday here.

295
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Have it.

296
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,640
What?

297
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,520
I appreciate this and thank everyone for the well wishes. Problem is, I'm a pretty neat person. I

298
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,400
feel like I enjoyed the decorations enough and want to take them down. How long do I have to leave

299
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,720
these up? Can I take them down at lunch or is it an all day affair? Tidy and Tulsa. That was a way

300
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,800
shorter timeframe than I thought you were going to say.

301
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,600
Oh boy. Howdy. I get it. This is an office. We're doing business here.

302
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm trying to keep my-

303
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
Nice, nice. Thanks for these. And then you immediately start pulling them down.

304
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,720
I'm trying to keep my fucking job, but I can't, I can't reach the hole puncher.

305
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,040
Cause you put a sign up over it that said-

306
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,960
Holy chalupa, it's your birthday.

307
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Holy chalupa, it's your birthday.

308
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,000
I get it. I get it. I don't want that shit around. I mean, I work at home and I mean,

309
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,800
you guys have forgotten the past few birthdays I've had, which is fine. Like whatever.

310
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,000
So like I, I would, I would absolutely tear that shit down.

311
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,240
But when Griffin, but when, not if, when.

312
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,240
Yeah. You can't do it as they're like, like show like, and like, Oh great. Trash, trash, trash.

313
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,960
Thank you. This is so thoughtful. Trash can, trash can, trash can.

314
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,280
I'm going to, I'm no, no, no, no. I'm not undecorating. I just want to

315
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,800
save all of them. So I'm going to put them here in my memory bin.

316
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,280
Cut the middleman out. Just show him a trash can full of decorations. Say,

317
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,960
Hey, we're going to put these up. And then we didn't. So we kind of saved you the work.

318
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,640
Here's what you have to do. You have to wait until everyone leaves at the end of the day.

319
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,360
Like you're the last person there. And then you take them all down.

320
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,160
And then when you come back in the morning, walk in and scream, who took down all my decorations

321
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,840
and get really upset about it. So you can prove to them how much you cared about it.

322
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,040
All right, cool. But you realize this is an annual event. And so like,

323
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:26,080
you realize people have birthdays every year. Well, so then the next year you have to loudly

324
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,160
announce, I'm going to keep an eye on these. So nobody takes them down this time.

325
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,440
And then when they come in, you fall asleep at your desk, still dressed in the clothes you

326
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,240
were from last night and all the decorations are down and you're like, Oh no, not again.

327
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Greg Bacchitis Academy.

328
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,200
Maybe you print out a bunch of signs and banners that say thanks for the birthday stuff.

329
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,600
And you put that, but that's like twice as much. And you put them all up over everybody's stuff.

330
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,640
Like while they're working, like while they're like doing a webcam meeting,

331
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,480
you like paste a big sign over it that says thanks for being so thoughtful.

332
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,800
And you put like six of them up there with like rubber cement. And it's like, Oh, I just,

333
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,960
I just was just returning the favor, but maybe think about like how your actions have consequences.

334
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,840
Also, we just raised our office supply expenses by 5% because of these fucking signs,

335
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
but no, great, whatever.

336
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Office supplies. People give a lot of static to dot matrix printers, but one thing that you can

337
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,800
say about them is that they did make it a lot easier to print out sick banners.

338
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,720
They were just inherent banner makers.

339
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
They were just like way better doing like sick fucking sick banners.

340
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
Now, what am I going to do now?

341
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,480
Staple it together, tape it together like some kind of monster.

342
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,440
Yeah. Yeah.

343
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,640
It's like, no, but like, those were like the banners and like,

344
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,120
it's all about whether or not you took the dots off or not.

345
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
That's how much you like the person.

346
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,520
It's like, if you didn't care about it, if it was just Glenn's birthday,

347
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,200
then you leave the dots on.

348
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,600
But for Stephanie's birthday, yeah, take them off.

349
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,520
And you might throw some clipboard on there.

350
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,760
Maybe like throw a birthday cake on there.

351
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm, I have a better idea.

352
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,640
And what if in addition to the happy birthday well wishes,

353
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,160
you also printed on these banners and birthday signs,

354
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,840
and fucking practical, useful business information.

355
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,040
And then all of a sudden,

356
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,360
these aren't just like little pieces of useless, messy decoration.

357
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,440
You got a fucking Excel spreadsheet on there,

358
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,360
showing you the dividends from today's profits.

359
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,000
And then on another one-

360
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
Wait, how did you do that?

361
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,480
You looked into the future?

362
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,160
Well, yesterday-

363
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
You gotta do the dividends from yesterday's profits.

364
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
This is my, this is, you've gotten ahead of me,

365
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
but this is my remake of early edition.

366
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:35,040
And it's called, it's called birthday business future, man.

367
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,600
Maybe on TBS.

368
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,480
But on the banner,

369
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,560
it could have like everybody's schedules for the day.

370
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,120
You know what I mean?

371
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
Practical, useful information.

372
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
Then maybe you won't feel like this is a mess.

373
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,720
Bless this mess.

374
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
It'd be like, this is a good, this is a useful mess.

375
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,080
I got a pretty good scam.

376
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,320
Why don't you, when you finally encounter these decorations,

377
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,680
just start like sneezing and rubbing your eyes.

378
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,240
And like, oh great, thanks guys.

379
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
And act like you're allergic.

380
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:02,880
To what?

381
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,280
To what?

382
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,160
To decorations?

383
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,360
To decorations.

384
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
And then when you pull them down, it's like, yeah.

385
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
And you make such like a big deal about it

386
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,240
that like when you finally do tear it down,

387
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,040
they're relieved.

388
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,120
Like, oh fuck, thank you God.

389
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
But in order to continue selling it,

390
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,040
like if they put up like fucking Christmas decorations,

391
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,080
when you walk into the office,

392
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,200
you just have to be like, hey guys,

393
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,640
I was like, I'm gonna have to take the leak.

394
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,760
Just start fucking convulsing.

395
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,160
Like get the tree out of here.

396
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,120
Maybe it's just birthday decorations you're allergic to.

397
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,160
Okay.

398
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,280
That's specific.

399
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
It is a little specific.

400
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,520
Here's, let me be even more specific, Travis.

401
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,800
Let's go to the money zone.

402
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:56,800
We mentioned MeUndies earlier, what is that?

403
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,600
Do I have to do it?

404
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,720
My throat hurts.

405
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,680
Oh, I'll do it.

406
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,160
Okay, Griffin, what is, why is MeUndies?

407
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,920
Let me tell you what MeUndies is.

408
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,160
Please.

409
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:10,480
They are, you know, clouds in the sky?

410
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:10,720
Yeah.

411
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, and how they look all puffy and comfortable

412
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,160
and you just think like, God, I wish I was a giant man

413
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
who could like clothe myself in those.

414
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,520
Definitely.

415
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,440
Or a giant woman.

416
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:21,680
Yep.

417
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,360
You know-

418
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,480
You got me so far now.

419
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
Imagine a giant woman.

420
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,640
Uh-huh.

421
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,440
Or a giant person.

422
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,720
Can we just say giant person?

423
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,440
Well, no, I'm a giant woman that is wearing clouds.

424
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,120
But then she reaches down and picks me up and swallows me.

425
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,080
Is she Kimmy Gibbler?

426
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:38,960
I've gotta go.

427
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
Okay, well, I'm gonna tell you about MeUndies.

428
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,680
No, I'm gonna tell you about MeUndies

429
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,480
because here's what's up.

430
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,240
They are soft as clouds and twice as good looking,

431
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
but they don't produce as much moisture, eh?

432
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,440
See, I had a point to all this.

433
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,640
They are, whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

434
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,320
you spend 24 hours a day in your underwear.

435
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
Sometimes you wear them only when you're podcasting.

436
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
Maybe you still are, despite the fact that you told your brothers

437
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
you were gonna put pants back on.

438
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,240
Maybe you sewed them to your chair

439
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,120
so you just had to slip into them every time you sit down to work.

440
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,760
That's great.

441
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,880
Maybe they're part of the chair.

442
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,400
MeUndies is the most comfortable way to wear underwear.

443
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
They're made of a sustainably sourced modal,

444
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,280
which is a fabric.

445
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,440
Am I saying it right?

446
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,600
They even pronounce a fucking pronunciation key here,

447
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,480
but I'm having trouble reading the key.

448
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:22,980
Motol!

449
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,600
They're made of a sustainably sourced modoc,

450
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,160
the killer human and living being,

451
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,200
a fabric that is twice as soft as cotton.

452
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,680
Nothing can describe the fit and feel of MeUndies,

453
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,560
but MeUndies is dedicated to providing the world's most comfortable underwear.

454
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,120
I love them.

455
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,520
I have like almost a dozen pairs now.

456
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,640
I wear them all the time.

457
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,920
They're soft as hell.

458
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,960
They feel super good.

459
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,320

With cloud fabric.

477
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,720
I also want to tell you about NatureBox.

478
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,240
Then we've talked about NatureBox before,

479
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
but maybe you haven't tried it.

480
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
If so, I'm sorry.

481
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
Have we actually talked about NatureBox before?

482
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,640
I think we might be the first podcast to ever mention NatureBox.

483
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,600
Because I know we've talked about Crunchums2Go,

484
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,680
which was the other platform.

485
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,680
Crunchums2Go is that old shit, Griffin.

486
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:36,720
Okay.

487
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,600
Well, tell me about-

488
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,960
It's 2016.

489
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,560
Tell me about this hip new competitor.

490
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,400
Well, NatureBox is new on the scene,

491
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,240
but basically how it works is you get a box of snacks,

492
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,400
and you get to choose from over 100 tasty options

493
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,480
like sriracha roasted cashews and French toast granola,

494
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,960
or you can fill out your snack profile

495
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,920
and then get like surprise things based on your preferences.

496
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,480
I just got some-

497
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,280
This actually sounds like yum yum fun pouches.

498
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,920
No, yum yum fun pouches is full of MSG and arsenic.

499
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,880
And MGS.

500
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,840
And MGS.

501
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,440
It's full of Metal Gear Solid discs.

502
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,880
It's all broken up.

503
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,360
I hate it.

504
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:19,200
But NatureBox, it's full of good stuff that you'll like.

505
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,920
Right, okay.

506
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,480
Yeah, like I don't want to oversell it,

507
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,040
but it's full of good stuff that you'll like.

508
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,520
Like what?

509
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,960
Tell me what kind of snacks I can get.

510
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,120
Well, I just got some mini Belgium waffles.

511
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,960
I got some guacamole bites.

512
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,920
What are those?

513
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,600
Guacamole bites, they were like corn chip,

514
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,680
but like guacamole flavored and amazing.

515
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Threw some in a tomato soup.

516
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,640
It was incredible.

517
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
Yeah, that's what's great about them

518
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,320
is because they're not full of all of that bad stuff

519
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,440
that's bad for you,

520
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,680
you can eat them and still feel good about yourself.

521
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,640
Guaranteed no broken up PlayStation discs

522
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,520
in these pouches.

523
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
That's the NatureBox guarantee.

524
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,280
And they're constantly coming up with new recipes

525
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,400

00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,840

Salt and pepper lentil loops.

Yeah, incredible.

532
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,800
They're the best.

533
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,520
They're my favorite.

534
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,560
Like if you like good things.

535
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,800
I really like their holy chalupas

536
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,520
and it's just a full fucking chalupa

537
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,280
that they send it to you in a bag.

538
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,240
But you eat and it cures you of all your sins.

539
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,320
No, it's literally been sanctified

540
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,120
and they just send it to you

541
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
in a big old plastic grocery bag.

542
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,640
It's a papal chalupa.

543
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,680
Just a big garbage bag full of chalupas.

544
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,520
Just a loose chalupa.

545
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,240
A big garbage bag full of loose chalupas.

546
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,640
These are all yesterday's chalupas that didn't sell.

547
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,520
That's actually the other subscription service

548
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,640
yesterday's chalupas,

549
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,800
which we don't do that one anymore for obvious reasons

550
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,760
because they stopped paying us.

551
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,960
We also have a message for Sean from Jess.

552
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,240
Happy belated birthday, my dearest fella.

553
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I wanted to do something unique this year

554
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
as a thank you for being such a loving

555
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,360
and supportive boyfriend.

556
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,880
So I thought getting the brothers,

557
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,080
especially your fave one.

558
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,760
Oh, Griff, okay.

559
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
To wish you a good one.

560
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,120
Eat my butt.

561
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Hey Travis, hey Justin, eat my butt.

562
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,160
Crotch chop, crotch.

563
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm doing the crotch chop.

564
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
I knew you couldn't hear it.

565
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,960
Well, let me try it.

566
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
Hey, hey, stop, wait, shut up.

567
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,640
Wait, stop.

568
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,760
Tell me if you can hear me doing a crotch chop.

569
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,800
Could you tell what that was?

570
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:29,920
No.

571
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,080
I think it sounded like a crotch chop to me.

572
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,600
Here's to many more together.

573
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,120
Love you so much.

574
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,560
Yeah.

575
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,120
Sorry you had to listen to me do it.

576
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,240
You're golden child Griffin.

577
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,360
Good, yeah.

578
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,280
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna slay my beer.

579
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,780
Yeah.

580
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,040
This next message is very confusing.

581
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,240
Yeah, I don't know, this is our dad, right?

582
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
No, I think this is a different person.

583
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,560
It's from, it's for Poppy and CJ McElroy.

584
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,000
And it's from Cliff and Caitlin McElroy.

585
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,360
Hold the fucking phone.

586
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,420
I know.

587
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,920
Is this an AR, is this an ARG?

588
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
What the fuck?

589
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,280
It's an ARG, we're being activated.

590
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,720
It says, happy second birthday you cool former babies.

591
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,840
Your second year has been an adventure,

592
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,280
just like your first and still,

593
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,520
everyone who meets you falls in love.

594
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,120
You learned to walk and talk,

595
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,040
conquered your third continent,

596
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,720
and moved around the world.

597
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,040
Not too shabby for just one year.

598
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,280
Here's to another great year kiddos.

599
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,400
We love you.

600
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:34,900
What?

601
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,960
Is this for babies or is this all like coded language?

602
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,520
It's one of the two.

603
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,040
Do they let their, okay.

604
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
One, are your babies listening?

605
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
Two, do you know that's our last name?

606
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,160
Where do you think you're going?

607
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,200
Three, is this your backdoor pitch for babies year out,

608
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,640
the sequel to babies day out?

609
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,400
Three, our dad is a grandfather

610
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,160
and one of his granddaughters calls him Poppy.

611
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,640
So this is like even more confusing.

612
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,680
Also Poppy is not strikingly a child's name

613
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,360
unless it's Poppy like the flower

614
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,880
instead of Poppy like the nickname.

615
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,040
I think that's what we're dealing with here.

616
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
And Travis, just so I'm clear,

617
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,280
child's names.

618
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,160
So basically the idea what this is,

619
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
and this is my new idea,

620
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,480
is that you have a child's name

621
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
and then maybe when he gets older you get a different one.

622
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
Well, have you ever been like my two names to grandpa?

623
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,680
He's two years old.

624
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,240
Please kickstart my new deal.

625
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,840
It's two names for everybody.

626
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,040
Yeah, you do that where you're like you're Benny

627
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,880
and then you're Bernard when you're an adult,

628
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,720
but then you're Benny again when you're an old man.

629
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,920
No, that's close by to Travis.

630
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm saying like, I didn't pick this fucking name.

631
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,240
I didn't pick this fucking name.

632
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,080
And I have to go through life with this fucking name?

633
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,720
Like obviously you can change your name, whatever.

634
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,200
I'm saying it should be like custom.

635
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,360
Well, not mandatory, but like customary.

636
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,680
You know what I mean?

637
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,960
At what age are you responding?

638
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,080
Cause it's not like 10.

639
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,400
If it was 10, everybody wouldn't be named like Thunder.

640
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,440
Oh, let's do it at 20.

641
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,200
Cause 20 is like a nothing birthday.

642
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,160
Nothing happens at 20.

643
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,760
You're just like waiting for that sweet, sweet,

644
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,000
you know, booze taste to come in a year.

645
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,280
I think at 20 you get to pick your own name

646
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,040
and then you have something to look forward to.

647
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
But then again, actually you're a what?

648
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,240
A junior in college at that point.

649
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,920
That might not be the time to be making

650
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,120
a permanent decision like that.

651
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,000
Why don't zero to two, it's just a number, okay?

652
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,280
Well, can I actually zero to two?

653
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Well, it should be a word describing your baby form.

654
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,960
So something like precious.

655
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,480
How about like your baby form plus the day you were born.

656
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,800
So like the day of the week.

657
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,640
Sweet pea, October 3rd.

658
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,280
Yeah.

659
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,600
Okay.

660
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,320
So you got that.

661
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,600
And then at two, you get to pick a funny name

662
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,760
cause I think that would be really funny to like,

663
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,320
like my daughter would be named

664
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,800
like happy snowman from frozen McElroy.

665
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,880
Like that would be her or like probably mommy McElroy.

666
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
If I finally had to let her pick.

667
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,360
That would get confusing though.

668
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,640
That would be very confusing.

669
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:04,880
Yes.

670
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,320
You say mommy and then Sydney comes in and you're like,

671
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,640
no, sorry, I meant the other mommy.

672
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,520
The other mommy.

673
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:11,760
Yeah.

674
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
No, I'm sorry, I was singing along with the song.

675
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,360
Hey mommy.

676
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,240
And you, I can understand how this is confusing.

677
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,360
But if we, if we let her name herself now

678
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,120
by the things she's obsessed with today,

679
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,280
she would either name herself Pikachu videos

680
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,640
or things I bought at Sheets

681
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,560
cause that's where she's at right now.

682
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,240
She's a big fan of things I bought at Sheets, huh?

683
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,400
Yeah.

684
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a confusing time in her life.

685
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,280
She down with that Pikachu though.

686
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,240
She knows what's up.

687
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,080
She does love videos of adults in Pikachu costumes.

688
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,160
That's not what I thought it would be.

689
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,320
No, that's not where the zeitgeist began.

690
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,520
Sydney said she loves videos.

691
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,560
She, she keeps harping on the fact that she loves videos

692
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,520
of adults wearing Pikachu costumes in public.

693
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,000
That is it.

694
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,920
I said, sweetheart, you keep highlighting the fact

695
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,160
that they're adults in Pikachu costumes

696
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,760
as if it would be in any way humane

697
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,320
or even possible to put children into Pikachu costumes

698
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,000
and not expect them to get like horrid heatstroke

699
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,760
or like blackout instantly.

700
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,240
That is a poor way to onboard somebody

701
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,640
to this beloved franchise though, Justin.

702
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,760
You're just gonna confuse her

703
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,600
cause she's not learning the fucking essentials.

704
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,240
She's not learning that this thing evolves from Pichu

705
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
and when you use the Thunderstone turns into Raichu

706
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,640
but hold up on that cause Pikachu learns better moves.

707
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,120
You know what I mean?

708
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,200
Like you start with the, I mean, ideally you start with the games

709
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,240
and then you move on to the anime

710
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,840
cause even the anime has some,

711
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,480
let's just say loose interpretations of the game mechanics.

712
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,400
And also some pretty adult themes.

713
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,320
Also some adult themes.

714
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,800
Her favorite video that Sydney showed her

715
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,320
is the like climactic scene from Pokemon, the Pokemon movie.

716
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,400
Where Pikachu, where Ash dies.

717
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,200
Spoilers!

718
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,240
Dies and Pikachu brings her back to life

719
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,040
and Sydney's just showing her this like, isn't this cute?

720
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm like, this is a fucking whole arc.

721
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,880
There's a whole film.

722
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,280
She doesn't understand the implications.

723
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,040
She cannot even appreciate the bond

724
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
that's been established the rest of the film.

725
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,160
When those sad Pikachu's are just slapping the shit out of each other.

726
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,520
Oh, and just crying.

727
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,640
It would be like if you showed the one scene in Godfather

728
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,640
where Marlon Brando puts a orange slice in his mouth

729
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
that has a heart attack to a child.

730
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,080
Like this is Godfather.

731
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,440
Like you can't have any,

732
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,080
it's just a sad old man with an orange in his mouth.

733
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,440
She can't appreciate that.

734
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,320
This is my daughter dead old Marlon Brando.

735
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,880
She picked it, I don't know.

736
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
She's got another 18 years before she can change it again.

737
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,040
Hi, I'm Brian Safi.

738
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,840
And I'm Erin Gibson.

739
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,080
And we host the Throwing Shade podcast.

740
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,320
On Throwing Shade, we look at an issue important to ladies

741
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,920
and an issue important to gay people.

742
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,360
And then we basically make fun of it.

743
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,120
Yeah, and just to answer your question,

744
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,480
no, we don't have a marriage pact.

745
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,960
But if we don't get married by the time we're 30,

746
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,840
we're gonna do that for each other.

747
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,720
No, that's true.

748
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,240
Although we have each been divorced three times.

749
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,080
This Yahoo was sent in by Eric Rudkin.

750
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Thank you, Eric.

751
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Janet, who asks,

752
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,400
I got kicked out of a CC's pizza for eating too much.

753
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,240
Bullshit.

754
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,120
There's a question mark.

755
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,120
I got kicked out of a CC's pizza for eating too much.

756
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,840
I'm currently a 17 year old male.

757
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,320
And I'm 5'11 and 125 pounds.

758
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,280
Holy shit.

759
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,680
And my doctor recommended that I literally,

760
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,960
quote unquote, go all out and eat a bunch of food.

761
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,520
Because my BMI, my BMI, just go fucking hog wild.

762
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,360
Just fucking let loose.

763
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,480
Just dive into Scylla's lasagna and get deep in the pain.

764
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
You've been too restrained.

765
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,360
Listen, I've been telling you this for years, J-Dog.

766
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,720
You been holding back.

767
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,640
Go to that CC's and fucking slam some za.

768
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,160
Fire up that pain train.

769
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,120
Now take some of these xannies and get out there and go fucking hog wild.

770
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,320
Do a couple of fucking whippets and go eat some za.

771
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,200
Take these pergocets and go crazy.

772
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,160
Go to the fucking golden corral and bring a fucking sleeping bag.

773
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,000
Don't leave till they kick you out.

774
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,480
I'm a 17 year old male, 5'11, 125 pounds.

775
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,120
My doctor told me to go fucking hog wild and eat a bunch of food

776
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,960
because my BMI is frighteningly low.

777
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,640
I decided to go to the local CC's Pizza because they offer an all-you-can-eat buffet.

778
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,880
I stayed for around 45 minutes, around 4.15 to 5 o'clock p.m.

779
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
and ate 22 slices of pizza.

780
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,120
Now we're talking about CC slices, which are not gigantic.

781
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,760
That's also not the, like, that's high.

782
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Don't get me wrong.

783
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Wait, hold on.

784
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,360
What are you about to say?

785
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:43,920
No, no, no.

786
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,360
If the premise of this, my point was going to be,

787
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,680
if the premise of this is that CC's would kick him out for eating too much,

788
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,160
I do not believe that 22 slices is the most someone has ever eaten at CC's.

789
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,160
That's a fair point that Travis is making,

790
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,440
but what if he only got one slice at a time?

791
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,120
First off, very annoying.

792
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,040
And secondly, as he ate every one, he went,

793
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,240
yummy, yummy, yummy.

794
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:08,480
One?

795
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,880
I'm very much liking this pizza.

796
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:11,520
Very good.

797
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,520
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

798
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,640
Like with every slice.

799
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,940
Yeah.

800
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,200
Travis, I just want to congratulate you on being very cautious with your wording

801
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,760
and not saying what your mind and your heart thought,

802
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,160
which is, I don't think that's that much pizza.

803
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,600
I mean, but it's just, okay.

804
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,360
One, I'm not saying I could or would eat 22 slices of pizza.

805
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,680
I'm an adult, but I'm saying that when you propose,

806
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,920
I'm about to say an astronomically high number

807
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,840
that would get someone kicked out of CC's.

808
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:46,720
I mean, granted, that's like two slices or it's a slice every two minutes.

809
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,160
We're going to have 45.

810
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,200
Yeah, that's okay.

811
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,920
Yes, when you put it that way, Travis, for 22.

812
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,640
No, no, no.

813
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,080
That's a lot of fucking pizza.

814
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,960
That sounds like fucking no face from Spirited Away,

815
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,280
just like shoveling like a whole carton of za into his fucking face

816
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,120
and like barfing up gold to lure the CC's pizza employees nearby.

817
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,080
Just demanding they,

818
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,200
he's not going to stop eating until they bring sin out to him.

819
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,160
Yeah, fuck.

820
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,080
Like that's a lot of za, my dude.

821
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,400
That's a shit ton of sweet pie.

822
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,440
I'm, I guess I wasn't thinking of the timeframe.

823
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,920
Did they kick him out because they were worried about him?

824
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,480
Like, listen, this isn't about the amount of pizza, J-Dog.

825
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,280
You got to go.

826
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
Like, I don't know what dog here told you to do this, but-

827
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,400
I think they kicked him out because he ate,

828
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,840
this person ate Dave while they were like bussing a table.

829
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,640
You slimer Dave.

830
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,480
As I was about to, I haven't even finished the fucking question.

831
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,280
I was about to finish some pineapple ham pizza that they just set out.

832
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,240
Okay, again.

833
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:45,920
Hey, careful.

834
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:46,800
God, he got a finger.

835
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,520
That was just pineapple pizza.

836
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,320
The manager ran up to me and ran up to me.

837
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,960
You got to get the fuck out of here, man.

838
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,440
That I had exceeded the max amount that you can eat at the buffet.

839
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,240
What the hell?

840
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,400
It's literally called an all you can eat buffet.

841
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,160
I've heard of no such thing in my life.

842
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,040
Maybe they shouldn't charge such a low price if they're going to get pissed off.

843
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,840
Has anyone experienced something similar or should I make a complaint?

844
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,640
Thanks.

845
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:18,000
Fucking, let's kick things off with this divisive answer from anonymous who said,

846
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,160
yes, you can get kicked out because you took advantage.

847
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,240
You should only be allowed to eat for 30 minutes.

848
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,280
Plus, if it was a busy day, they might feel you stayed too long and need the table.

849
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:26,720
What?

850
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,440
No, hold on.

851
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,080
No CeCe's has ever been like, hey man, we need that four top back.

852
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,760
We need that four top back.

853
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,240
Listen, we got a reservation for CeCe's pizza.

854
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,280
The president might stop by.

855
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,360
We need to keep that corner booth clear.

856
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,480
That's false advertising.

857
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,600
It's a pretty easy lawsuit.

858
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,320
My client.

859
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,480
What I intend to show by the end of the day is that he had not eaten all he could.

860
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,000
Watch this motherfucker eat 23 slices of pizza.

861
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,840
And then it's all of a sudden it's that scene from Matilda.

862
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:03,840
Oh my Jesus.

863
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,760
It all stems back to the terrible doctor.

864
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,200
Sue them.

865
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,120
It happened, I'm just going down these comments because this is fucking banana cake.

866
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,200
Sue them.

867
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,520
It happened to this one guy I knew who loved going to all you can eat buffets.

868
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,600
One time he got kicked out for eating too much and sued them.

869
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,960
He received over 50,000 American dollars because of it.

870
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,200
As for you, I would contact the corporation online or report to them what happened.

871
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,840
They will most likely give you a discount coupons the next time you go.

872
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,720
What's up motherfuckers?

873
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,520
You need a discount coupon to go to the CeCe's?

874
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,560
What's up motherfuckers?

875
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:40,240
I'm back and this time I'm not paying my six dollars.

876
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,640
My, listen, no, you should sue them.

877
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:51,760
My friend Fat Dead Greg would sue them for his overeating there at CeCe's and he got a great deal.

878
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,200
Great deal out of it.

879
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,000
You have a much better case against the doctor.

880
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,560
I remember, I don't remember much from the episodes of Man vs Food I've watched.

881
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,400
Because I find it distasteful.

882
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,040
But I do remember an episode where he's like, this episode I'm gonna try to eat a 10 pound pizza.

883
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,080
And I'm gonna be like, Adam, Adam, Adam.

884
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,920
No one's making you do this, Adam.

885
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:12,800
You don't, Adam, listen.

886
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,160
Everybody said I couldn't do it.

887
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,560
Nobody, Adam, they said you shouldn't do that.

888
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,400
When you were like, I'm gonna eat 100 oysters.

889
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,800
I was like, that seems like a bad way to eat oysters, Adam, but you do you, I think you go for it.

890
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,480
But Adam, understand, please, it's 10 pounds of material.

891
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,960
You can't, you just can't do this.

892
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,560
Alexa warns, don't overeat pizza, it will catch up to you.

893
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,960
Oompa loompa, doompa dee doo, 20 suit slices will kill you.

894
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,240
How is the response to Alexa's comment, not Janet going?

895
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,960
That's not the fucking question, Janet or Alexa, whoever we're talking about.

896
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,640
I wanna, I don't understand how this question asker had such a low BMI.

897
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,400
And then this doctor like awakened the animal within.

898
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,440
And all of a sudden they go from like zero to 22, right?

899
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,640
Like they're just like found something deep inside of them.

900
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,080
Like found their calling or something.

901
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:12,160
The CC's pizza in Barbersville at the mall closed.

902
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,400
The CC's all you can eat pizza in the city so fat that Jamie Oliver

903
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,400
came to make a TV show to beg them to stop eating so much.

904
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,080
There's a CC's pizza there and it closed down.

905
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:34,000
His show, please salad, please salad, exasperatingly.

906
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,240
This is a town that plays host to an annual hot dog festival,

907
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,680
beer festival, chili fest, rib fest, and probably some other one.

908
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,560
There's the pumpkin.

909
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,840
Pumpkin festival.

910
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,960
Well, but that's not just unhinging our jaws and eating pumpkins whole.

911
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,280
It's mostly just worshiping the pumpkin.

912
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,000
There's a lot of pumpkin consumption that happens.

913
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,520
Let's not get it twisted.

914
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,760
We're celebrating the pumpkin harvest.

915
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,360
So that the gods continue to be gracious.

916
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:09,600
This is the town where CC's couldn't keep the doors open.

917
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,240
It was, as you've almost certainly guessed, replaced by a Christian bookstore.

918
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,800
The natural successor.

919
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,640
The natural successor to that.

920
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,840
Yeah, it's when you turn your life away for your life of eating pizza all the time.

921
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,960
How much do you guys think you could eat in 45 minutes?

922
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,480
In terms of like pizzas?

923
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:28,880
Yeah.

924
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,600
Well, no, yeah.

925
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,200
Not just like sheer poundage.

926
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:38,960
The secret is to know when to flip the switch to dessert pizzas.

927
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,880
Because, and if that counts, because you could eat

928
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,680
all the pizza in Pizza Hut, okay?

929
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,000
All of it.

930
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,440
And then if someone brought out a cinnamon pizza, you'd be like, I don't know.

931
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:55,840
Maybe.

932
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,960
Let me see.

933
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,640
Maybe, let me check that out.

934
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,160
My, our local Pizza Hut, you know, they got on their buffet that I

935
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,200
always used to really get a kick out of, pudding.

936
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,760
Just a container of pudding.

937
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,200
You could just get like three slizzies and one scoopa.

938
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,920
And they, and I think it's a really good way to keep it balanced, you know?

939
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,120
Because if you have the scoopa there with the slizzies.

940
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:24,800
Well, if you have the slizzies and you send them down with a scoopa,

941
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,440
that's going to keep everything moving real good down there.

942
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,120
Justin, I would like to thank you.

943
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,400
I don't, I don't know why I started talking like a tertiary character

944
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,200
from an Indiana Jones movie, but I'm just going to keep that.

945
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,360
I want to say a sincere thank you because honestly, God, never before this moment has

946
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:43,520
it struck me how crazy it is that most salad bars that I grew up going to,

947
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,320
or like that I've been to in my life, also just had a big fat of pudding.

948
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,160
Okay, but I think Justin's cracked it.

949
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:57,040
And that pudding is just like a sort of material sludge that you put in-

950
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,520
Like a silicon kind of-

951
00:51:59,520 --> 00:51:59,920
Yeah.

952
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,760
You put it in your, you put it in your body as if to tell your intestine like,

953
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,600
let's get this thing going.

954
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:06,560
It's just a scoopa.

955
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:13,440
Hey, if you've ever gotten a scoopa and thought it was pudding,

956
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,960
but also, but really it was salad dressing-

957
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,400
Or butter.

958
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,240
Then retweet this.

959
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:32,720
Wait, okay, if the dressing consistency even vaguely resembles that of a scoopa,

960
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,240
then it's the fucking restaurant's fault, I would say.

961
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,640
Okay.

962
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,960
Hey, listen, are you retweeting or not?

963
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,320
I'm a busy man.

964
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,080
He makes an excellent point, Griffin.

965
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:42,480
Choose.

966
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,320
I'm faving it, which means-

967
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,720
Hey, listen, guys, listen.

968
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,200
Oh, okay.

969
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,040
About 20 minutes, I took some dayquil.

970
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,720
So like things are gonna start getting a little loose from here on out.

971
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,680
Oh, should we keep going?

972
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,920
There's a man who can't hold his dayquil.

973
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,200
I have another question for you.

974
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:02,080
I wanna bounce this Yahoo off because I think it'll be really good.

975
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,920
I feel like Travis, you're really gonna enjoy it.

976
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,160
Okay.

977
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,800
Okay, well, I'm sold.

978
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,960
This Yahoo was sent in by Courtney Bergman.

979
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,520
Thank you, Courtney.

980
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,840
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Lady Ellie, who asks,

981
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,160
the swing era is slowly dying away?

982
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,440
What's the date on this question?

983
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
Well, let's not worry about it.

984
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,960
Let's make believe that it was asked today and not nine years ago.

985
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,880
Okay, okay.

986
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,280
You don't, a little less funny, I think.

987
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,400
A little more tragic.

988
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,880
You don't hear many swing dances anymore.

989
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,240
I mean, you do hear of one.

990
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,040
Only senior citizens and a few younger people go.

991
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,200
The only ones that really dance are the senior citizens

992
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,120
and the younger people don't really try.

993
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,360
It is obvious that the swing era is dying away.

994
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,400
But my real question is,

995
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,840
is anybody in more recent generations going to miss the swing era?

996
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,920
Does anyone appreciate Ya's music and the swing era enough

997
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,880
to want to learn more about it and to try and keep it alive?

998
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,240
Oh my Jesus.

999
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:04,880
Do you remember?

1000
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,360
Do you guys remember that period where like Brian Setzer

1001
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,400
and like Trey Pop and Daddies and Squirrel Nut Zippers-

1002
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,320
All died in a single plane crash?

1003
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,000
Yeah, it was fucking horrible.

1004
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,760
And it was the day the swinging swung,

1005
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,920
the day the wallet chains died.

1006
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,800
The pants were just too big to keep going.

1007
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,120
Yeah.

1008
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,080
Fuck.

1009
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,400
So is this a show, is this a podcast

1010
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,600
where we just talk about Cherry Pop and Daddies every couple weeks?

1011
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,720
Is that kind of our thing?

1012
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,200
This is our Cherry Pop and check-in.

1013
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,920
If we don't tell the story, who does, Justin?

1014
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,000
I mean, holy tulips, guys.

1015
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,160
I guess we're talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies again.

1016
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:42,960
Who lives-

1017
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,880
That was the craziest fucking time in pop culture

1018
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,480
that I can remember in my entire life.

1019
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,360
Because it was li-

1020
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:55,520
Like you could like draw such a clear line around that like two years of time

1021
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,120
from like when Swingers came out to when like,

1022
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:02,080
I think Brian said to have played New Year's Rockin' Eve

1023
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,600
and everyone went, nah.

1024
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,880
Nah, it's not for me, I think.

1025
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,120
Thank you, Brian, but no.

1026
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,720
And that was the end.

1027
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,800
That was the end of like that two years

1028
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,280
where like you couldn't swing enough.

1029
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,640
I remember dancing to swing music at college parties.

1030
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,040
Yeah, absolutely.

1031
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,160
Like cool college parties.

1032
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,520
I want to, I don't want to talk about the past

1033
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,560
because it's just gonna make me sad.

1034
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,680
I want to talk about the future.

1035
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,960
I'm gonna talk about like a,

1036
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:26,480
you know how Pitch Perfect has kind of like

1037
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,560
breathed new life into the acapella scene, right?

1038
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,640
And then we got the fucking, what are they called?

1039
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,440
Hypnotronics.

1040
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,480
Yep, got it.

1041
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,720
Like all this shit.

1042
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:37,680
Pentagrams, pentagrams.

1043
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,560
The pentagrams?

1044
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,240
The pentagrams.

1045
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,240
It's all acapella chants.

1046
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,520
It's beautiful.

1047
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,840
It's all, it's very monastic and Gregorian.

1048
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,640
I want to, how can we bring swing back?

1049
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,680
Obviously like Swingers, I don't think Swingers 2 could do it.

1050
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,840
I don't think Favreau's got it in him anymore.

1051
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:57,440
Well, you need, you need some kind of celebrity driven.

1052
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,280
Oh, you know who Swings.

1053
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,640
To clarify, I think Favreau is doing some great work,

1054
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,320
but I'm saying, I don't think he's got the,

1055
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,880
I don't think he can bring an entire fucking genre

1056
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,400
of music back to life like he did.

1057
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,040
Who can't?

1058
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,600
Who has the gravitas that it's not,

1059
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,240
it's not just like kitschy and weird.

1060
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,800
It's also cool and kitschy and weird.

1061
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,560
Like if this person does it, it's now a thing again.

1062
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:21,840
Or this group of people.

1063
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,040
How can, yeah, how can we bring it back though?

1064
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,560
Oh, how can we bring it back?

1065
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah, that's what I'm curious about.

1066
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:30,000
Like I, there's, I see a huge opportunity here

1067
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,480
because it's, it is, it's everything that you need

1068
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,080
for a pop culture zeitgeist.

1069
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,200
And it doesn't have to be very long.

1070
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,840
Like however long we need to like get our millions

1071
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,080
and bounce and dip from it and let it die again.

1072
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,920
Just like the Cherry Pop and Daddies did.

1073
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,440
Yeah, they cashed in, they cashed out.

1074
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,360
As much shit as we give those, that crew,

1075
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,200
they knew what they were doing.

1076
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,920
They got their money.

1077
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,360
Now they're Cherry Popping granddaddies

1078
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,320
and they don't do it anymore.

1079
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,800
Yeah, I think they're all pretty still young and vital.

1080
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,160
Anyway, how can we bring swing music back?

1081
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,760
Because can we do it with our podcast?

1082
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,080
Because that feels like maybe not gonna happen.

1083
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,480
Well, I would not rather, I would rather not like cash in

1084
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,640
the cultural cache that we spent all these years building

1085
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:13,680
on like a last ditch attempt to bring swing music back.

1086
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,440
No, what we need to do is we need to look to the future

1087
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,040
and see what the next big dance cra,

1088
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,920
like maybe we bring Charleston back into vogue.

1089
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,920
Maybe we bring back the 23 Skadoo.

1090
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:22,880
What's the next thing?

1091
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
You gotta look forward to look back.

1092
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,440
That's true.

1093
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,800
I mean, isn't Drake already doing that?

1094
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,640
Is Drake doing the Charleston?

1095
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,960
Is Drake doing the 23 Skadoo?

1096
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,720
He does a lot of old man dancing.

1097
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,760
He Skadid it.

1098
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,040
He Skadun it.

1099
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,920
He Skadid it.

1100
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:38,800
He Skadrake.

1101
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
What's the next, what's another big thing?

1102
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,720
Maybe the, what about the Foxtrot?

1103
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,240
It's got a cool name.

1104
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,000
You could have like a sexy CGI Fox doing it.

1105
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:50,880
With Paula Abdul?

1106
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,000
With Paula Abdul.

1107
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,400
You know she's an ether work.

1108
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,520
I was singing a-

1109
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,280
You can have a CGI Paula Abdul.

1110
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,200
I was singing a song-

1111
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,240
Singing with a real cat, but the cat is real.

1112
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh shit.

1113
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,680
I was singing that song to my wife this morning

1114
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,200
and trying to do both parts at once.

1115
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,320
And I realized that that is gonna be my karaoke white whale.

1116
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,480
Like if we find out a fucking meteor is about to hit

1117
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,120
the earth tomorrow, tonight I'm going out

1118
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:21,120
and I'm gonna sing both parts of opposites attract.

1119
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,880
Who did the cat part in that?

1120
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,680
Why don't I know that?

1121
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,960
MC Skat Kat, Travis, yes.

1122
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,360
Because we were watching RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars

1123
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,640
and they had the fucking lip sync for their life

1124
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,240
and it credited MC Skat Kat.

1125
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,760
That cartoon got a fucking credit.

1126
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,260
What?

1127
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,360
Was there, okay, wait, hold on.

1128
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:37,680
Yeah.

1129
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,160
Was there a performer named MC Skat Kat

1130
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,520
that the cat was raised on?

1131
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,440
That somebody said, wait, who did it?

1132
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,600
MC Skat Kat, I have the best idea.

1133
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,320
Or we are to believe that Paula Abdul

1134
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,560
somehow got cool-worlded, which God,

1135
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,240
it happens to so many people.

1136
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,680
It happens, you don't see enough,

1137
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,000
there's so much awareness that needs to be brought

1138
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,480
to the cool-worlding of America's youth.

1139
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,640
Right, and so she got cool-worlded

1140
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,920
and it produced it in there.

1141
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,320
But no, that man was just a cartoon in there.

1142
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,120
There was, there is no flash MC Skat Kat.

1143
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,280
There was, I mean, there was a person

1144
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,960
who did the voice of MC Skat Kat,

1145
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,880
but he doesn't get the fucking credit.

1146
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,120
Like, how do you agree to that?

1147
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,800
It was Taylor Steele, Skat Kat.

1148
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,760
Well, okay, who is that?

1149
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,040
I mean, the person who did the voice of Skat Kat.

1150
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,680
Do you want Taylor Steele to be the voice of Skat Kat

1151
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,840
and also achieve something else in his life?

1152
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,120
Like, I think he's done pretty good.

1153
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,400
No, I just feel like shit, like I know who Paula Abdul is

1154
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,240
and we credit her with that song.

1155
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:39,840
And here's another dude who's like 50% of the song.

1156
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:43,520
Hi, like my name is Walt Disney.

1157
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,440
I did the whole Disney thing

1158
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,520
and also like, I'm great at fishing.

1159
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,600
No, Taylor Steele is the Ub Iwerks

1160
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:53,920
to Paula Abdul's Walt Disney.

1161
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,920
Okay, I just realized something though.

1162
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,200
And that is if you take the letters

1163
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,120
in the words Taylor Steele and rearrange them,

1164
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,640
it's just MC Skat Kat.

1165
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,520
I think that this is a, I think it's a pseudonym.

1166
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,960
Why don't you want to believe in my living cartoon world?

1167
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,600
Well, actually, now that I've moved to Los Angeles,

1168
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,280
there's a big wall that runs through Hollywood

1169
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,680
and on the other side, it's just cartoons.

1170
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,500
Yeah.

1171
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,320
We're not allowed over there.

1172
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,120
I would like to close this conversation

1173
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,480
by reading the personality section

1174
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,960
from the Wikipedia page on MC Skat Kat.

1175
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,960
There's somebody who wrote a thesis on like his behaviors.

1176
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:32,320
According to the press kit

1177
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,560
from Virgin Records media information.

1178
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:37,200
No, fuck it, I want to read that.

1179
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,880
I want it straight from the source.

1180
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,880
I don't want this peer reviewed bullshit.

1181
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,280
I'm giving you straight from the source

1182
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,320
because there's quotes.

1183
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:45,600
According to the press kit

1184
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,000
from Virgin Records media information.

1185
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,880
And Griffin, please stop laughing

1186
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,640
because you're going to mess up the ringtone

1187
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,520
that someone is making.

1188
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,840
According to the press kit

1189
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:58,000
from Virgin Records media information,

1190
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,280
Skat Kat is a street philosopher with an alley cat.

1191
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,880
Skat Kat is a street philosopher with an alley cat.

1192
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,040
He enjoys rapping and dancing

1193
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,080
and has quote, gotten high for the ladies.

1194
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,600
Oh my God in heaven.

1195
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,160
Please fucking just hold on, okay?

1196
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:20,080
Quote, remains on the smooth tip

1197
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,440
with an old school rap influence

1198
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:29,440
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

1199
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,600
I can't breathe.

1200
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:32,320
Okay, hold on.

1201
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,480
That's all amazing.

1202
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,040
Skat Kat's a street philosopher.

1203
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,600
Oh, fuck me.

1204
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,160
Alley cat, point of view.

1205
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,600
He's on the smooth tip.

1206
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,840
No, Travis, he remains on the smooth tip.

1207
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,320
Yes.

1208
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,440
Direct quote.

1209
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,840
With an old school rap influence

1210
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,600
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

1211
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,400
Fuck, oh my God, oh my God.

1212
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,920
Fucking, dude, it sounds like,

1213
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,680
it sounds like a binder from 1992 having a stroke.

1214
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,320
Okay, but listen.

1215
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:02,880
It's amazing.

1216
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,040
The words you've said are amazing.

1217
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,120
But the more amazing thing

1218
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,320
is that this record company's PR outfit said,

1219
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,280
listen to me, music journalists,

1220
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,000
if you're gonna write about fucking MC Skat Kat,

1221
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,560
inform yourself and be responsible with your reporting.

1222
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,320
All I can picture is that in the press conference,

1223
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,120
there was someone standing behind the PR representative

1224
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,880
leaning in every time there was a question

1225
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,560
about MC Skat Kat being like,

1226
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:31,760
that's not something we can cover.

1227
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,120
Just read the fucking packet.

1228
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
How would you, hi, hello.

1229
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:38,560
This is Greg Donaldson from Rolling Stone.

1230
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,320
How would you characterize his like,

1231
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,000
I don't know, his street behavior?

1232
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,560
Well, if you'd read the fucking packet,

1233
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,480
you would know he's a street philosopher

1234
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:47,520
who remains on the-

1235
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,720
I'm glad you asked, Greg.

1236
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,040
Listen, he remains on the smooth tip.

1237
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,720
With an old school rap influence

1238
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,280
which adds the street to his new school hip hop.

1239
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,480
Was MC Skat Kat built to be a spinoff humanity?

1240
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,880
Was he the next level of like AI?

1241
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,240
The next evolutionist.

1242
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,040
Yeah, sure.

1243
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,840
Do you think, and no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.

1244
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,360
I love my furry buddies.

1245
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,600
But do you think that there were people who that was,

1246
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:12,800
like, I think for a lot of folks,

1247
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,720
it was probably Lola from Space Jam.

1248
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,320
But do you think that there was a slightly older crowd

1249
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,280
who saw MC Skat Kat was like, yep, cool.

1250
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,920
Yes, please.

1251
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,000
He remains on the smooth tip.

1252
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,600
I like him because he's on the smooth tip

1253
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:26,960
and I like his whole aesthetic.

1254
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,800
I enjoy his street philosophy.

1255
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,120
Now that we have hologram technology,

1256
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,960
MC Skat Kat could perform live.

1257
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,000
Holy shit.

1258
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,480
He could headline Coachella.

1259
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,600
He could perform live.

1260
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,480
MC Skat Kat feat Trombone Boy.

1261
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,960
What if the fucking last shot of the revival of Fuller House

1262
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:49,280
is they open a door on a closet

1263
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,520
and MC Skat Kat is like, oh, oh, oh, thank God.

1264
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,440
Gibbler put me in there.

1265
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,160
And I loved every fucking second of it.

1266
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,280
I was Gibbler's sex prisoner and I loved it.

1267
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,480
I loved that.

1268
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,200
Close the door.

1269
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,560
Close the door.

1270
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,320
Put me back in Gibbler's sex cage.

1271
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:07,600
Put me back.

1272
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,200
You gotta contain the stink.

1273
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,920
Put me back in.

1274
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,400
Holy chalupas, this has been a lot of fun.

1275
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,920
My name is Justin McElroy.

1276
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:22,000
This has been our podcast, my brother, my brother and me.

1277
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,040
Listen, there's a Bunker Buddies live show

1278
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,240
coming up April 2nd.

1279
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,920
And that's bit.ly forward slash BB live show.

1280
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,720
It's Travis and his partner Andy talking about

1281
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,840
how you can survive the apocalypse with,

1282
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,760
I believe there's another podcast on there.

1283
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,320
That's correct.

1284
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:44,640
It's gonna be us and spilled milk in Los Angeles on April 2nd.

1285
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,520
Go to bit.ly forward slash BBB BB live show for all the details.

1286
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,000
We also wanna let you know, as we mentioned

1287
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,720
at the top of the show, the 2016 Max Fun Drive

1288
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,080
is just around the corner.

1289
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,920
This isn't our first time.

1290
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:00,080
We've rodeoed before, my friends.

1291
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:03,040
But if you're new to my brother, my brother, me

1292
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:06,160
and you're new to Max Fun, Max Fun is very, very special

1293
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,200
because it is donor supported, which means that we exist

1294
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,440
because you like the shows that we make.

1295
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,720
And once a year for two weeks, we have the Max Fun Drive,

1296
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,200
which is your chance to not only support the shows

1297
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,320
that you love, but also get some pretty awesome swag

1298
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,120
out of the deal.

1299
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:24,320
There's gonna be different levels of donation

1300
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,560
and different rewards for those levels.

1301
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,040
But most importantly, the best thing that you get out of it

1302
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,920
is there is so much donor only bonus content.

1303
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,240
And not only do you get the content that will be new

1304
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,520
this year, including special episodes of my brother,

1305

01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,440
It's a Departure, off of the album,

1338
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,880
Putting the Days to Bed.

1339
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,080
It's an incredible album and I love it very much.

1340
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,080
You sound disappointed at how incredible it is.

1341
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,920
I'm so moved by it that just in that moment

1342
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,000
I got moved describing it.

1343
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,400
I saw a picture of him and Hodgman on,

1344
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,600
they just got back from John and Colton cruise.

1345
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,000
I'd really, hey, listen, I'm just putting this out

1346
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,520
in the universe, the secret.

1347
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,880
We'd really like to get on that cruise.

1348
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,400
I would like to do that cruise, please.

1349
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,080
Let us get us on that cruise.

1350
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,520
I think it would be worth the getting that norovirus,

1351
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,360
which I wouldn't even need an outbreak.

1352
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,040
I think me just getting on a boat,

1353
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,360
my body would just be like, you have norovirus now.

1354
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,920
There's a new environment.

1355
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,200
There'd be a little card left on your bed,

1356
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,040
like, hey, good news, the gym is open at 10 a.m. tomorrow

1357
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,400
and also you have norovirus.

1358
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,720
It's my body's natural offense mechanism against that.

1359
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,040
I've gone camping once in the past decade

1360
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,480
and when I went, my body was like,

1361
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,920
where are we, trees, grass, tents?

1362
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,760
Oh, okay, you have diarrhea now.

1363
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:53,200
Bippity, boppity, boop, you have diarrhea.

1364
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,280
I'm almost certain, where are we at?

1365
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,240
Let's see, let's see.

1366
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,640
Oh, the Atlantic Ocean, cool, diarrhea.

1367
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,520
You now have it.

1368
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,000
Okay, we're done.

1369
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,200
Griffin, give us the last question.

1370
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,400
Yeah, this last one was also sent in

1371
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,400
by Zoe Kinski climbing that fucking ladder,

1372
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,160
getting up the leaderboard rankings.

1373
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

1374
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,600
More than 32 characters who says,

1375
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,840
is there one quote from John Malkovich

1376
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,040

Are you troubled by a lack of astute

1387
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:56,400
yet dick joke filled analysis of bad movies?

1388
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,160
Do you experience feelings of laughter

1389
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,840
and enjoyment when you hear three friends

1390
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,600
go off on stupid tangents?

1391
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,200
Have you or any of your family

1392
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,360
ever seen a spook, specter, ghost,

1393
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,680
or totally rad party dude house cat

1394
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,080
who really only exists as a sound effect?

1395
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,320
