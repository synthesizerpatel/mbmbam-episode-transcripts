1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,520
I also request Mbem Bambly Reunion. I'll do anything to avoid that name.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,680
Oh, look at that. It's Uncle Stewart. Hi, Stu. Hey, it's good to be here. You gonna play some

7
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,440
baggos? Why are you doing this hilarious joke? What are baggos, Uncle Stewart? What are baggos,

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,760
you know? Is this a show? We're in it. You might call a cornhole. Oh man, Uncle Stu,

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,280
I don't know about that. Yeah, that's not good. It won't be a good joke. Have a bud lime. That

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,840
does sound like little Stewie. I'm his brother, Brewer. Guys, wait. Instead of Mbem Bambly Reunion,

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:32,880
we could do Mbem Bamb Family Guy, and then like, oh yes, I'm Stewie. Hi, it's me, Brian.

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:44,960
I am the one they call Cragmire. I will kill you, Stu. Hi, welcome to my brother, my brother,

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,080
me Family Guy Reunion. What's your favorite Family Guy? We're bringing back all our favorite.

14
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,880
We're gonna bring, okay, since Max Fund Drive, we're gonna bring, I don't know where to start.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
I'm so excited. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest brother. Let's start there.

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm, oh my God, I'm Stewie, quote unquote, Griffin.

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,440
No, wait, the Stewie should be, I'm Griffin McElroy, the baby brother. And the baby on the

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,360
show is, although the baby on the show is also named Stewie. It's maxfundrive, maximumfund.org.

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:28,080
Go donate some money. Oh, not convinced? Check this impression out. Hey, it's me, Lois. I love

20
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,880
you, Peena. I'm the one known as Meg. Please donate to maximumfund.org. Can you not try?

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,480
Let me try. I'm Mila Kunis. That's actually pretty good, I thought. It's everybody's favorite joke

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,960
from Family Guy. Mine's the one where he fights the chicken. Hey, this sucks. Should we start over?

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,880
No. What? Are you kidding me? This has all been hilarious. You're gonna leave this gold on the

24
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,640
cutting room floor? Yeah. You're gonna leave the part where you said we should cut it on the

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,520
cutting room floor? How did we even get here? How did we even get to this point? Well, let's pull

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,800
back the curtain and talk about the evolution of a bit. This is Goofbusters 2, right? So we wanted

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,840
to bring back our old bits, but we didn't have that many funny bits to start with, and we kind

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,960
of burned them all last week. So we thought, hey, we should bring back some of our beloved characters

29
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480
and Travis insisted on calling it a Mabim family reunion. And I said, I would rather die.

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,680
And then we started talking. The Family Guy. And then off mic, we had a good, maybe, what do you

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,160
think, guys? Like 45 minutes discussion on how important Family Guy was to us in our lives?

32
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,680
Yep. Yeah. How it changed everything, changed the game. And then when we came back from break,

33
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,440
or like not doing the show, Griffin wasn't earnest in his love for Family Guy anymore.

34
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,960
Now it's all about jokey, jokey, ha ha. Some snidely whiplash stuff he's throwing out at

35
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:06,080
Seth Farlin. Seth McFarlane. I don't know what to say. I guess I'm more of an anime guy now.

36
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,640
Let's talk about the Max Fun Drive, which is a pledge drive for money that we haven't earned

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,600
yet. We're going to get there. I knew Justin was going to say that. So I tried, I don't know if

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,800
this is good yet. We'll get there though. You know what? We'll get good. Polish this, turd.

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,760
That should be the slogan of this show, shouldn't it? It'll get good. Hang in there. You know,

40
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,840
so often you just see the funny parts of a show. You don't see the parts where they're trying to

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
make it funny. They're trying to will it into comedy. Anyway, it's Max Fun Drive time. This

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,200
is the last week, your final chance to get on board, by which I mean you can, you could donate

43
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,440
to the Max Fun community anytime you want. But this is the time where we want you to do it.

44
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,600
And what we want, this is our way or the highway. We're the presidents of this podcast listening

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,880
experience. Anyway, what we do here is we're a donor supported network at Max Fun. We are part

46
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,960
of a family of podcasts. Something like what? There's like 24 to a couple dozen podcasts on

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,040
the Max Fun network. They're all great. They're all free. You can go to MaxFun.org to listen to

48
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,920
them. But if you like what we do and you want to support us just based on like past episodes,

49
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,280
maybe not this one, then you know, think about kicking in a few bucks a month. You can go to

50
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,640
MaxFun.org slash donate and find out all the pledge gifts that you can get for donating just

51
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,400
by joining in at the $5 a month lowest level that there is. You can get exclusive episodes of our

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
podcasts and every other podcast on the network. That means extra episodes of Sawbones, extra

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,800
episodes of the Adventure Zone, extra episodes of Schmaners and Bunker Buddies. So yeah, we're

54
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
going to be talking about it all throughout the show, but let's just get into a question.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,960
Griffin, did you say that $5 a month was the lowest level?

56
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Yeah.

57
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,280
Like Lois Griffin tied it back.

58
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,440
That's good. No, it's very organic.

59
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
It's natural.

60
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
We've really fallen into a quagmire fairly early.

61
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,040
Fuck off. Read a question. I hate this show. I hate being a part of this show and as soon

62
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,160
as the fun drive is over-

63
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
You're sounding pretty stewy, Griffin.

64
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
That doesn't even fucking mean anything.

65
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,680
I can't wait until this pleasure drive is over so I can quit this fucking podcast of good

66
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,160
conscience.

67
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,000
Family guy, wouldn't it be funny?

68
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
That's fucking good, Griffin.

69
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,600
Guess what city our first question is from? Cleveland.

70
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,760
It's not, though.

71
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,280
Guys, the Skype call dropped off.

72
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,960
I can't hear you laughing. The Skype call dropped off.

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
And it looks like it's actually from Seattle.

74
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
Can we do Frazier instead, please?

75
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,960
Run it back, run it back, run it back.

76
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,800
It's my friend, family, Frazier for union.

77
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
Rewind the podcast to the beginning and then it'll be about Frazier this time.

78
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,600
Listener.

79
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,280
Choose your own shitty adventure. Both adventures are going to be

80
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
completely devoid of comedic value.

81
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,800
But if you listen to them at the same time, maybe they'll sync up.

82
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,440
I'm a pedestrian in a very populated city.

83
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
Fairly not very populated. This isn't fucking Fern Gully. Read good, read better.

84
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,120
We need to earn this. We need to holler for these dollars because right now we are mumbling for them.

85
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,480
We're mumbling for these jumblings and we need to holler for these dollars.

86
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,440
All right. Got it.

87
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,600
I'm a pedestrian in a fairly populated city and I recently encountered a new phenomenon.

88
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,560
It's fairies.

89
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,560
It's fairies everywhere. It's crazy. Tim Curry's a bat. It's bonkers.

90
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
When cars are waiting to pull into garages or parking lots,

91
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I like to wait and gesture to let them by since it's faster and safer for general traffic.

92
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
Recently, however, cars have been honking at me

93
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
and angrily waving their hands to get me to cross my section of sidewalk.

94
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,040
That's from Nancy Sinatra in Seattle.

95
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,360
Whoa.

96
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,760
Not so much a-

97
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,120
Big hit, first off.

98
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,440
Yeah.

99
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
Not so much a question in the traditional sense.

100
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah, not really.

101
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,120
Travis, did you edit out the question part of that question?

102
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,640
I don't think so.

103
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,360
I think there's just an implied, what should I do?

104
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,840
I mean, this is the same phenomenon of like you're walking down a hallway

105
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,240
and another person's walking towards you and you go left and they go left

106
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,200
and you go right and they go right,

107
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,680
except if the other person weighed like one and a half metric tons

108
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
and was made of steel and combustible fluid and-

109
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
Have you ever did that with Robocop?

110
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
I think the problem here is that cars are equipped with a horn and humans are not.

112
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,520
That is, yeah.

113
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,360
Well, I mean, but I take away from this that we need human horns.

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Don't even get me started on fucking my whole great job theory again,

115
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,160
but I would argue that humans are-

116
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
Goofbusters, it's back.

117
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,240
It's back.

118
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
There's one friend of the family.

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,840
I would argue that humans are actually equipped with an infinite number of horns,

120
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,560
which is to say our brains and our voices and stuff.

121
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,440
Right.

122
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,160
You know what I mean?

123
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,840
Well, so there must have more than one.

124
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,040
When somebody honks at you to like cross the sidewalk quicker.

125
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,880
Okay, I would go, no, you go.

126
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
And if I yell loud enough, then it's kind of like a car horn.

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,400
I feel like the car should have the right of way.

128
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,680
They're big and I'm little.

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,360
Well, no, pedestrians almost always have the right of way,

130
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
but I totally feel what you're saying, Travis.

131
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,840
I think an easier law to sort of comprehend,

132
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,360
a more universal law would be the heavier thing gets to go first.

133
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,720
Because if we go at the same time, they are having a lot of damage to me.

134
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,640
I am not doing a lot of damage to them.

135
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,760
I'm at a much higher risk.

136
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
Whichever thing could kick the other thing's ass.

137
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,040
You win.

138
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,600
Like you win.

139
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,840
If you're in a big old fucking Ford truck,

140
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,920
fucking Hemi engine, big old chrome tires and-

141
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
With like the truck nuts hanging off the back.

142
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,760
Oh, it's fucking too big.

143
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,520
Like custom made truck nuts,

144
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,120
because the ones they sold at AutoZone weren't big and fucking nutty enough for you.

145
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,840
You need your own fucking custom made huge old-

146
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,040
Maybe you got two on the back, two on the front, and two on each side.

147
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,440
Oh, you got a basically a little, like a Ben Hur chariot of truck nuts.

148
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,200
You just octo nutting everywhere you go.

149
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,600
Just octoing all over the spot.

150
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,880
I forgot what we were talking about,

151
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,840
because I started getting boned up for his cool old truck.

152
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,360
I had a driver's ed teacher I've talked about before.

153
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,800
He was the dude that showed us Mr. Holland's Opus,

154
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,640
because he kind of looked like Richard Dreyfuss.

155
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,480
What, that was his metric for educational content?

156
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,440
Yeah, he said like,

157
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
you have to check, like this is what this dude is so great at teaching.

158
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
You say, you have to check this out.

159
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
I look just like this fool.

160
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,080
Did he?

161
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
And he didn't fast forward to that part.

162
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,960
He's like, yeah, you won't appreciate it.

163
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's just watch the whole film.

164
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Which is pretty great, like pretty cool.

165
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,240
But he, the driver's ed lesson that I remember most from that class,

166
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,960
is he said, you pull up to a four-way intersection,

167
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,880
and you and a semi truck get to the intersection at roughly the same time.

168
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
And that truck is on your left who has the right-of-way.

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
And I started to think about it.

170
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,120
He said, you thought too long.

171
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,080
It's a semi truck.

172
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,440
If you go and he hits you, you die and his day is ruined.

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
You go ahead and let him go.

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,400
And I was like, yeah, that's true.

175
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,960
Just like always let the big thing go ahead.

176
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,680
I don't like that that implies that he would only be haunted

177
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
by causing your death for one day.

178
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,680
The next day he'd wake up and be like,

179
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,280
you know what, I'm not worried about it anymore.

180
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,680
Truck drivers are, they're an immoral lot.

181
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
I mean, most of them.

182
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,280
And I don't want to cast this person

183
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,960
because I'm sure we have a bunch of fucking highwaymen.

184
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,840
Our trucker listeners, there's got to be some out there, right?

185
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
That should be our new thing.

186
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,360
Like let's get into that life.

187
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
They're long hauling across this great country of ours.

188
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
A bunch of highwaymen and women listening to this show.

189
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,400
I don't want to throw shade on them,

190
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,040
but most of them are in a sort of hitcher situation.

191
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
I mean, most of them are.

192
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
Yeah, because you're just constantly crossing the straight lines.

193
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
You're in international waters basically all the time.

194
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Anyway, we just didn't do this at all

195
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,280
because this person does try to give cars the right way,

196
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,960
but cars are like fighting back.

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,280
Maybe they're thinking they're getting catfished.

198
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,160
So the car's like, no, I've been in this insurance scam before.

199
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,760
You tell me to go, I go, you go out, I hit you.

200
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,280
Oops-a-daisy, you just made $35,000 off of me.

201
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm not doing it.

202
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,280
I love that the cars jump to anger.

203
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,440
Like, I tried to let you go and you didn't do it.

204
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
And now I hate you.

205
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,480
That's so funny to me.

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,640
Instead of just that play, like, no, I insist, you go.

207
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,120
Yeah, but you have to have, but think about it.

208
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,200
Like if you're inside a car,

209
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
you do have to have a somewhat like heightened response

210
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,280
because otherwise it's like, what is that guy doing?

211
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,200
Is he talking to someone on his Bluetooth?

212
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,240
I don't understand.

213
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,240
This is why you just need a series of like Wile E. Coyote signs

214
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,480
that are like, I insist that you go, please.

215
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,840
I'm letting you go.

216
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,600
Let's bust a goof in this Yahoo.

217
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Okay.

218
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,760
And it was-

219
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
Just bust a goof.

220
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,760
It was sent in.

221
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
It was sent in.

222
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,160
You got it.

223
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay, it was sent in.

224
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,520
You want it, baby.

225
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,720
Just bust a goof.

226
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,520
Okay, now go.

227
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,240
On a mission, guys like this.

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,760
Thank you, Marina Baker, who sent this in.

229
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Monica is the best.

230
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,200
Nice.

231
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,800
Nice.

232
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,240
Monica is the best.

233
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
I feel like, a quick sidebar about Monica.

234
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,000
I feel like she maybe is dealing

235
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
with some inaccuracy issues.

236
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,680
Like she has to reinforce her bestness everywhere even

237
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,720
and including like her Yahoo Answers profile.

238
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, her answer game is strong though

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,280
because her question is this.

240
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,320
How do you politely refuse to let someone ride your horse?

241
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
Let's tap into that horse vein, brothers.

242
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,520
Well, we got to take that long ass data needle

243
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,760
from the matrix, lie back in our cool ass recliners

244
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,440
and have Samuel Fishburne.

245
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,280
That's not his name, but let's have him jack us in.

246
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,080
We're in.

247
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
All the horses are-

248
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,280
Come with me, Joey Pants.

249
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,480
Let's ride this horse together.

250
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,440
There is no horse.

251
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,680
Whoa, that's sad.

252
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,200
No, there's millions of horses.

253
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,680
Wait, so there's either no horse or too many horses.

254
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,760
This is the scene where there's like fucking

255
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,960
an infinite library of like gun racks comes flying at us

256
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
but they're all full of horses.

257
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
And these horses are freaking the fuck out.

258
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,800
Can you even imagine?

259
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Imagine the noise.

260
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,440
Everybody stop and imagine the noise.

261
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,800
Now imagine the smell.

262
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
Bring in the noise, bring in the smell.

263
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,760
How do you politely refuse to let someone ride your horse?

264
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,440
You blame it on the aura, baby.

265
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
I have a friend-

266
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,280
Wait, hold on, Travis.

267
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,400
Sit on that.

268
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,920
Say it as soon as Griffin's done

269
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,760
because I don't want that to get passed by.

270
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
It's amazing.

271
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Griffin, finish the question.

272
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,360
I have a quote unquote friend from school

273
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,960
who is extremely full of herself

274
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
and thinks she is a wonderful rider.

275
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,560
She took lessons for a month, fell off on the second week

276
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,920
and is generally a bloody awful rider.

277
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,880
She claims, sorry, a bloody awful rider.

278
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,720
She claims to know everything and do everything

279
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,960
and has asked to ride my horse.

280
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,520
How do I politely refuse to let her ride?

281
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
I don't want to make an enemies

282
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,640
and I've let other more responsible friends ride

283
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,840
with me lunging them.

284
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
No idea what the fuck that means.

285
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,400
Update, edit.

286
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,200
It's not even so much that she doesn't know how to ride

287
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,560
that she is so irresponsible

288
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
and does not treat the horse as well.

289
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,200
She blames everything on them, flops and hits

290
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,480
and is not trustworthy.

291
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,720
You gotta blame it on the aura, baby.

292
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
Okay, so there's the aura line

293
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,360
that we're all waiting for on pins and needles.

294
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
And what does that mean, Travis?

295
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,360
Well, you say like Mr. Floppington spoke to me in a dream

296
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,840
and said that his energy and your energy were mixed well.

297
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm sorry, I just can't do this to him.

298
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
He's like a son to me.

299
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,120
The moon is in a waxing phase and Mr. Butterballs.

300
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
No, that's a terrible-

301
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,440
Mr. Truck Nuts.

302
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,360
Holy shit.

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,920
I'm just Truck Nuts.

304
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
He went to medical school for seven years.

305
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,200
Please use his correct honorific.

306
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
I'm sorry, you have lupus.

307
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:21,840
Damn it.

308
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,880
Oh, it's kind of better now though.

309
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you think that the word honorific

310
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,000
was created by the first person to get one?

311
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,960
Like the first person to put doctor at the front of their name

312
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
like this is really good.

313
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,280
You know what?

314
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,760
It's honorific.

315
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm so proud of me.

316
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,760
What a great job I did at being the first doctor.

317
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
I'm hippogrates.

318
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,600
Wait until halfway on and then push them off.

319
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
And be like, I guess today's not your day.

320
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,840
But don't let them know that you did.

321
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,160
Ooh, you train the horse to do that thing

322
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,440
where you usually see it with people being a jerk in a car.

323
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,800
But as the person is about to get on,

324
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,080
the horse takes one step forward and just keeps doing that

325
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,840
until the person gets frustrated and gives up.

326
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,440
That's another good thing.

327
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,200
Yeah, anything you can do to sort of put the social blame on the horse

328
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,320
and not you is gonna be good.

329
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,920
It's just gonna be, how do you tell your horse

330
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,040
to only do that to this horrible person and not to say you?

331
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,040
You gotta blame it on the aura.

332
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,240
Okay, that doesn't, horses don't understand what an aura is.

333
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,680
Well, fuck you they don't.

334
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,480
Yeah, you're right.

335
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
I said it and then I immediately knew I was wrong.

336
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,160
I got it.

337
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,160
I got it.

338
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,800
Oh boy, I know where this is going immediately.

339
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,000
Wait a minute.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
Let me put some jam up in it.

341
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,400
Just put some jelly on your horse.

342
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,280
No, hold on, because you definitely said in.

343
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,560
And I don't think Dr. Tratton.

344
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,000
Like in the saddle area.

345
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,960
Oh, okay, okay.

346
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,280
Right, so yeah, you just put some jelly on a horse's saddle

347
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,360
and on like, you know, they call it a saddle Narbon.

348
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,200
It's the front thing that's on the front of the saddle.

349
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
Is that really what it's called?

350
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,720
Yeah, it's a saddle Narbon.

351
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
Narbon or Narbon?

352
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
It depends on what area you're in of the country.

353
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,240
Yeah, it's a regional thing like soda pop or Coca-Cola.

354
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,440
Or proboscis.

355
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Or proboscis or proboscis.

356
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,000
It's different strokes for different horses.

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,840
And you put some jelly on that

358
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,680
and just put some jelly on the saddle.

359
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,480
And then when the person goes to hop up on your horse,

360
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,600
they're gonna put one hand on that

361
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,280
and think the horse has some secretions

362
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,200
that need to be dealt with emergently.

363
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,600
Saddle word, secretions.

364
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,480
His saddle is bleeding.

365
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,240
It's oozing exclusively from the saddle.

366
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,840
See, I wanna actually backpedal a little bit.

367
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,600
And I do wanna talk about the possibility

368
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,280
of putting some jam up in it.

369
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,800
I'm talking about creating some sort of equine Jaffa cake

370
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,360
situation because that is going to make the horse very sick.

371
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
And that horse is just not gonna feel like

372
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,920
riding that particular day.

373
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,120
So every time that, you know,

374
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,760
Marcy comes over and is like, let me get up on that.

375
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,480
You're like, yeah, sure.

376
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,520
Let me just take them in the stable.

377
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,320
It's oats time.

378
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,040
It's oats o'clock.

379
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,600
But then it's actually, it's fucking like jam o'clock.

380
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
What about an elaborate like ocean to like,

381
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
you bring Marcy to just like an empty stable

382
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,960
and you're like, what?

383
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,560
Oh no, someone's stolen Dr. Truck nuts.

384
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,360
And then you put what they do find,

385
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,880
he's got jelly on him when you find him.

386
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
Okay, it sounds like you kinda-

387
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
We have plans on plans on plans.

388
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
What if you try to put so much jelly into your horse,

389
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,080
but instead of making it really sick,

390
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,440
he just fucking loves it.

391
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
And then you're left with like one of the most terrifying

392
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,560
things in nature,

393
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,320
which is a horse addicted to a bobble

394
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,520
from the world of man.

395
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,160
What if the fucking jam makes him super fast?

396
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,440
Yeah, it makes him so fast,

397
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
but he's like, bring me the gelatinous ambrosia.

398
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,240
Somebody put jelly on the sea biscuit

399
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,600
and now he's super fast.

400
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
We all have an ethical responsibility

401
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
to make sure that horses don't get too comfortable

402
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,400
in the man world.

403
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,480
Cause once they do like they're,

404
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,280
it's kind of like a Skynet situation, right?

405
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,720
Like in our studies with AI,

406
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
frankly, Google, you're toeing a fucking fine line.

407
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,680
You're on thin ice with your go bot.

408
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,880
I'm worried that we could get that with a horse though.

409
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,120
Like really easily, it would just tip over

410
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
and then like, that's it, we're all horses now.

411
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,960
I'm like, I'm sorry,

412
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,160
but you have already just described Orb.

413
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,440
Basically that's all.

414
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
Yeah, that's not true.

415
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,960
Orb got too interested in the things of man

416
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,200
and can no longer return to the equestral plane.

417
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,160
That's right, somebody wins the triple crown.

418
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,480
And by somebody, I mean a horse.

419
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,080
And they immediately, immediately like,

420
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
congratulations, you got three trophies.

421
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,880
Blam!

422
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Like you can't, you can't.

423
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,040
You're too big, too strong.

424
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,080
You must be destroyed.

425
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,640
Too big, too strong, too beloved.

426
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,360
Are you kidding me?

427
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,680
Fucking American Pharaoh like walks down

428
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,640
that victory lane with a wreath around its neck

429
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,400
and just like everybody's just handing it

430
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,160
big fucking fistfuls of jam.

431
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,920
Like that's it.

432
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,400
That's it.

433
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,360
That's it.

434
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
He's gonna evolve into like rapidash

435
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,760
and then that's it.

436
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,320
We're done.

437
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,040
I bet your horses are very petty.

438
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,280
By which I mean, I bet if you win a big horse race-

439
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
Justin, you said pretty wrong.

440
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,920
Oh, sorry.

441
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
No, I literally mean petty.

442
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,680
I bet like if a horse wins a huge race,

443
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,160
like the Kentucky one,

444
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,760
then they spend the rest of the day

445
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,680
following their jockey around

446
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,880
waiting to hear him say,

447
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,000
hey, I won.

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
Cause then it's like, did you?

449
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,680
Did you win?

450
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,640
Cause I remember running very fast,

451
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,120
faster than all the other horses in a circle.

452
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,360
And I remember you fucking chilling

453
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,920
and flipping through your iPod Nano

454
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,800
looking for a Jodeci track you haven't heard in a while.

455
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,640
We could figure this thing out right now

456
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,480
if you just want to do a quick foot race.

457
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,360
Let's get to the bottom of this,

458
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
which is a quick friendly foot race.

459
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,360
What do you say?

460
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
Do you know, side note,

461
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,240
I just found this out the other day,

462
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,440
when a horse studs,

463
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,920
like when there's like a champion racehorse dude

464
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,520
and he goes to a farm to stud,

465
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,280
it can be like $75,000 for like one mating.

466
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,160
For one nut.

467
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,760
For one nut.

468
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
What if the nut don't take?

469
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
Well, for Dr. Truck nuts, it always takes.

470
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,080
That's no problemo for me, my man.

471
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,040
Let's just leave it at that.

472
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,040
How do you think he got his name?

473
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,080
I mean, you got to imagine, Travis,

474
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,080
like you're talking about

475
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
they are paying for one night

476
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,560
with the world's best horse.

477
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
That's like,

478
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,800
that seems like actually 75k

479
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,880
actually seems like pretty low.

480
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,480
Like yeah, you're getting that good seed,

481
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,040
whatever.

482
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,400
You're going to get that good coat.

483
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,680
We're bleeding a little bit into farm wisdom here.

484
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,360
But we're also like talking about like one night

485
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,880
with the best, biggest, most badass,

486
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,960
most perfect, most like popular,

487
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,200
most famous, most successful horse.

488
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,800
I think there are plenty of people

489
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,640
that would pay 75 large

490
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
to bone down with like, what?

491
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Like Clooney?

492
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,320
That's actually 75 Gs.

493
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,680
That's like nothing.

494
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,200
Like Robert Redford paid,

495
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
offered Woody Harrelson a milo.

496
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,040
To sleep with Woody Harrelson.

497
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,720
To sleep with Woody Harrelson.

498
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,360
In real life.

499
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,560
Then they were like,

500
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,640
we should make a film together.

501
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,600
Or they were like, and cut.

502
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,960
And then Redford was like,

503
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
so what do you think?

504
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
Oh man, I thought that was just play acting.

505
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
I thought that we were just doing a play acting thing.

506
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,040
No, I want to squish that.

507
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:38,880
Robert.

508
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,760
Justin.

509
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,240
Yeah.

510
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,840
Would you give me a farm wisdom theme song, please?

511
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,280
I have something I'd like to share with the folks.

512
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, I have one too.

513
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay, we'll do both.

514
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,120
Farm wisdom.

515
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,960
Farm wisdom.

516
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,520
Plant some seeds to grow some weeds.

517
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
Farm wisdom.

518
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:53,760
I liked it.

519
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:58,000
But when horses are like being prepared for mating,

520
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
they bring out like a prepper dude horse

521
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,680
and they like put his wiener in a bag

522
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,440
and tie it up to his stomach

523
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,560
and let him get the female like all raring to go

524
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,400
with like all the foreplay and stuff.

525
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,240
And then they bring the stud horse in.

526
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
They've covered his hooves with silken gloves

527
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,120
so he does not damage the female horse.

528
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,960
He comes in at the last minute,

529
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,560
does the thing and then leaves.

530
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
So he just comes in for the last part

531
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
and someone paid $75,000 for that.

532
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,720
That was a gross farm wisdom.

533
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,560
We try to foster like sort of an environment of,

534
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,800
you know, learning and just growth, I guess.

535
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,240
And to me, Travis, that felt like

536
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
you were just kind of click baiting,

537
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,640
like just kind of getting some salacious-

538
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,160
The idea of a dude horse's wiener

539
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,600
being strapped down to his tummy

540
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,880
is that interesting, Griffin?

541
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
I think, no, I think you were mostly going

542
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,280
for that like raw sex SEO.

543
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,440
I mean, sometimes.

544
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,240
It's Max Fun Drive.

545
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,680
We talk about horse wieners.

546
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,120
I have another farm wisdom here

547
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
and this one is not yucky.

548
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,640
Let's just call it what it is.

549
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,160
I found Travis's interesting.

550
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,800
Where did the first horse come from, Travis?

551
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,960
He's just like, I think he's just like at the farm.

552
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,200
Is it the same horse every time?

553
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Like, does he have like one horse

554
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,360
like that's just romance-centric?

555
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
What they do is they get him all charged up

556
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,640
with the mare horse and then they take him

557
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,120
to like some like not famous race horse,

558
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
mare horse, and let him go to town there

559
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,960
so that he doesn't get all upset

560
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,760
and go crazy on everybody.

561
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,760
How does that interaction work?

562
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,080
Like, listen, Dr. Trust Nuts,

563
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,640
you gots to trust me on this one.

564
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,880
No, are you sure?

565
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,040
I'm having like a lot of fun in it.

566
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,560
No, trust me, trust me.

567
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,800
Dr. Trust Nuts, that's your new name.

568
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
Listen, Dr. Trust Nuts,

569
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
I need you to be Dr. Trust Nuts right now.

570
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm gonna, bro, bro, bro, have I ever let you down?

571
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm gonna fucking hollow you out, son.

572
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,080
That's what they should make him race.

573
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,040
Like they should try to clock a time on him then.

574
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,600
I bet he'd be like performing really very well.

575
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,320
I know in college whenever I had a big audition,

576
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
I would always wait to pee until afterwards.

577
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,400
So it's probably the same thing.

578
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,040
Just have some sort of barn intern

579
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,000
standing right behind a finish line

580
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,720
with a glossy JPEG of a horse vagina.

581
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,680
Come on.

582
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,640
I have another one here and it's not horse related.

583
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
Are llamas horses?

584
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,000
Has anyone ever gotten to the bottom of this?

585
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,960
Space horses.

586
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,360
All right.

587
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,040
Here's some farm wisdom sent in by Tom Harriman.

588
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,600
Thank you, Tom.

589
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,640
If you want to protect your livestock

590
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,960
such as sheep and goats against predators,

591
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,960
add a llama to the herd.

592
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,360
The llama will act as a guard for the animals

593
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
going so far as to fight off attacks by coyotes,

594
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,600
wolves, and dogs.

595
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,480
If you go this route,

596
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
it's important that you only get one llama

597
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,880
because you want it to bond with the herd it's protecting.

598
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,400
It's true if you get two llamas in there,

599
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
they're just gonna talk to each other.

600
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,560
It's like me at a party with like one other person I know.

601
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,160
I'm not making new friends at that party.

602
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
I love this idea because I've actually seen this happen.

603
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,800
Not this exact thing, but very similar thing in practice

604
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,760
because Buttercup, my dog, hates pigeons.

605
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,680
The other day I was walking around a park

606
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,000
where there were pigeons and swans mixed together.

607
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,320
Yeah.

608
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,600
Or maybe it was geese.

609
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,560
It was geese.

610
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,920
Geese and pigeons mixed together.

611
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,400
And she started to chase a pigeon

612
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,560
and then saw a giant goose and she was like,

613
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,960
oh shit, it's the pigeon's mom.

614
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
And she immediately hid behind my legs.

615
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,200
Yeah, animals are like wicked dumb

616
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
and if they see a bunch of animals together,

617
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,760
they will assume anything.

618
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,400
Like if there was a bunch of rats

619
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,840
fighting over a bag of Doritos,

620
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,600
an animal might look at that and be like,

621
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
how come that one rat is orange and plasticky

622
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,400
and it says Doritos on him?

623
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,560
Well, he's Doritos rat.

624
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,920
Get that shit up on BuzzFeed.

625
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,840
But if you see a bunch of sheep and add a llama to it,

626
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
I mean, they're both wool producing creatures.

627
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,480
It's not that much of a stretch.

628
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,680
It's just this one sheep is like super duper duper fucked up.

629
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,640
I don't wanna mess with that.

630
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,040
I don't know what that one sheep's capable of.

631
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,960
Don't you think that's messed up for the llama though?

632
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
It's like an ugly duckling situation.

633
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,000
We're like, why am I so big?

634
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,160
I mean, they're probably like down as fuck

635
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,200
because they're like super tall

636
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,240
and they probably feel like in charge

637
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,920
and they could have any one of those sheep that they want.

638
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,440
If you stud out a llama,

639
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,360
it's important to do it with a sheep

640
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,480
because then you get double wool.

641
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
And like a medium sized llama.

642
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah.

643
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,400
I wouldn't it be a bummer to be a llama

644
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,240
and they're like, hey, we got a new home for you

645
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
and they pull up and you just see a bunch of sheep

646
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,480
and you're like, I know what this is.

647
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know anybody here.

648
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,400
Okay, I see what we're doing.

649
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,400
Okay, all right, I get it.

650
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,360
Okay, yep.

651
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,560
Give me the over under.

652
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
I'm trying to wrap my mind around this farm wisdom

653
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,720
that Tom Harriman sent in.

654
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,280
Thank you, Tom.

655
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,640
Because I'm trying to like, what's the over under?

656
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's put them both in a ring.

657
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,920
Coyote V. Llama.

658
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,800
Llama has reach, I suppose, spit.

659
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,200
If you want to take it to fucking Pokemon attack levels,

660
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,760
you can spit in the coyote's eyes, maybe.

661
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,480
It seems that would require a lot of accuracy.

662
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't think that's a llama's strongest statistic.

663
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,160
I'm pretty sure a llama can leap all four feet off the ground.

664
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
They are very prancy.

665
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,760
What are you basing that on?

666
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,280
Nothing.

667
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,480
Okay.

668
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,880
There was that one Spike Lee commercial

669
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,040
when he was staring at a bunch of jumping llamas

670
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
and he was like, it's gotta be the shoes.

671
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,200
And the llamas are like, we don't wear shoes.

672
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,320
Mostly I'm basing it on picturing a llama

673
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,560
jumping up and down on a coyote.

674
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
Okay, but a coyote can jump.

675
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
I do want to just get that out there.

676
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,480
They have feet and like leg strength and shit.

677
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,160
But which one do you think could jump better?

678
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,920
Let me ask you a question, Travis.

679
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,440
What would be your least favorite place to be bitten by a coyote?

680
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,400
On the balls.

681
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,200
Don't say the hog.

682
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,960
Well, too late.

683
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Wait, the butt?

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,160
I'll let it to make it sound like I said,

685
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,720
don't say the hog before you mentioned the crass thing.

686
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,200
The butt.

687
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,280
Really, your butt?

688
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,680
If a coyote bit me directly on the butthole.

689
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,080
Okay.

690
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,640
I would absolutely much prefer that I got bitten on the butt

691
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,160
than pretty much anywhere else.

692
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,920
Yeah, because you got a lot of butt.

693
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,000
Yeah, I could like that, let that go.

694
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
Travis is the bony butt boy though.

695
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,800
So if his butt gets bitten, it's like, oof.

696
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,080
He's breaking that thing off.

697
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,600
Yeah, I have lots of, which might be a little trap, right?

698
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Like when a bird tries to get a lizard, gets that tail,

699
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,920
lizard's like, snip, no tail, fuck you, bye.

700
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,160
My butt will grow back.

701
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
That's true.

702
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240
Okay, my point was this.

703
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,240
It's my favorite Celine Dion song, by the way.

704
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,000
My point is if you get a good one on the neck, boy, that's just it.

705
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,840
If you get, oh boy, the neck, that's just it, isn't it?

706
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,840
And a llama, what does a llama have a lot of?

707
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,120
What did God, when he was sketching them out,

708
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,960
when he was whiteboarding the old llama,

709
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,200
he was like, let's give him like 10 times as much neck

710
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,320
as anything would ever need.

711
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,320
That would be a bad matchup, I think.

712
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,800
Because again, to go back to the Pokemon terminology,

713
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,160
biting type is very, very super effective against neck type.

714
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you think if you're trying to protect your flock of llamas,

715
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,120
you put a giraffe in there?

716
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,440
That would fuck me up, are you kidding?

717
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,680
That would fuck me, human, like I don't go around

718
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,120
murdering sheep all the time.

719
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,800
That would still fuck me up.

720
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,880
I would still see that, I would see that site and be like,

721
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,880
I am not fucking with those sheep today.

722
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,240
And that would be like, why would I?

723
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,840
But definitely not gonna do it now.

724
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,280
Could I take a sheep in a fair fight?

725
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,200
Okay, we're done here.

726
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,760
Well, not done, but we do need to stop for a second

727
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,480
to talk about the Maximum Fun Network.

728
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Travis, you're in Los Angeles right now, right?

729
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,920
That is correct.

730
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,680
Do you just feel the excitement?

731
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,920
Do you feel the energy of this pulsating

732
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,160
towards the MacArthur Park area right now?

733
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,680
I can say I've been to Max Fun HQ twice in the past week.

734
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,880
I've recorded with three different Max Fun hosts this week.

735
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,840
And the energy is palpable, Justin.

736
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,080
The magic is air present.

737
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,560
Yesterday, I was just doing my jumps to practice.

738
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,880
Mm-hmm, full of fights.

739
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,920
And I jumped eight feet straight up into the air.

740
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,080
And it wasn't even like the hardest I could jump.

741
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,040
I got scared after I did it,

742
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,800
because when I fell, I actually did hurt myself.

743
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,320
But like, I think I could have even gone

744
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,600
a little bit higher up.

745
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,960
My dream, thank you for asking,

746
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,120
is to be able to just jump on top of my house.

747
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,960
Is that eight feet from ground to the bottom of your feet?

748
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,440
Yeah.

749
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,120
Or eight feet from ground to the top of your head?

750
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,920
Sea level.

751
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,720
Oh, okay.

752
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm saying the Maximum Fun Drive gave me jumping energy.

753
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,000
Thank you.

754
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,600
Oh, okay, great, great, great.

755
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,480
I knew that little digression would have a point.

756
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,760
I thought it would.

757
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,920
Also, if we're getting stuff off our chest,

758
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
I wanted to brag about a good jump I had.

759
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,120
I appreciate that.

760
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,040
I appreciate that brag formation.

761
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,960
The Maximum Fun is a podcast network

762
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,760
we've been very proud to be a part of since 2011.

763
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,040
That's about a year after we started doing this show

764
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,920
way, way back, almost six years ago, in April of 2010.

765
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,760
But Maximum Fun has a ton of great shows that we don't make.

766
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,120
In fact, those are the good ones

767
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,120
that you should be listening to right now.

768
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,680
Like The Flophouse, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye,

769
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,640
Judge John Hodgman, Stop Podcasting Yourself,

770
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,560
Throwing Shade.

771
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,120
I could go on.

772
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,720
There's a ton of great programs.

773
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,120
And your donation is what helps keep the doors open.

774
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,720
We ask people who listen to the show and like the show.

775
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,680
We don't charge for them.

776
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,120
Instead, we just say, hey, if you like this,

777
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,080
could you help us make it?

778
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,960
That's what we're really saying.

779
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,600
So we ask you to pledge a certain amount of money per month

780
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,560
that you can afford and that you feel is right

781
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,760
for the amount of shows that you enjoy.

782
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,560
So just to like break things down

783
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,080
before we get into the gifts and levels.

784
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,440
Just to break things down, since we've been on the network,

785
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
the support that we've gotten from you all

786
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000
has allowed us to buy all new recording equipment,

787
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,200
upgrading from the rock band microphones

788
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,080
that we started out with.

789
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,840
It has funded some tours that we've done,

790
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,920
the travel and booking of those places.

791
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,400
It's helped out with that.

792
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,880
We did what, like 15 live shows

793
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,840
or something like that last year?

794
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,800
That wouldn't have been possible

795
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
without Max Fund Drive and donor support.

796
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,160
We've launched a ton of new podcasts.

797
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
Travis, this is his full-time job now

798
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,920
because of the support that we get.

799
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,960
So things like the Adventure Zone would not exist

800
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,120
if it was not for the support we get from donors.

801
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,600
So there's an absolutely like a tangible,

802
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,360
I guess if you wanna think about it,

803
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,000
like return on your investment if you like the stuff we do.

804
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
Why don't we talk a little bit about gifts?

805
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,200
Because you're not buying stuff.

806
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,880
Justin, it's pronounced jiff.

807
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,480
It's pronounced jifts.

808
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,320
Let's talk about the jifts.

809
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
If you can pledge five bucks a month,

810
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:03,040
which is the price of a very cheap cup of coffee every day

811
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,800
or one decently priced cup of coffee once a month,

812
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,120
if you get like a lot of additives

813
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,160
and it's a large size.

814
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,440
Like an 18 cent cup of dirty fucking shit.

815
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,800
Well, they always say that like

816
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
for the price of a cup of coffee,

817
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,760
you can feel like you can't.

818
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,280
Like I don't know where you're getting this very,

819
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,960
this 18 cent coffee, but anyway.

820
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,720
You're going to like a greasy spoon.

821
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,280
You're sitting along some other Depression era folks.

822
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,480
And you're just like scooping like water out of a toilet

823
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,120
and like pouring it on grounds that were thrown away yesterday.

824
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,560
It's about 18 cents.

825
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,840
If you can pledge $5 a month,

826
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,000
you're going to get the access code

827
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,920
to a veritable treasure trove of bonus material.

828
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,800
You're gonna get like just my brother and my brother and me.

829
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,680
There's tons of shows on there

830
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,240
that have put up bonus episodes for years

831
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,760
and you're gonna get all of it.

832
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,320
There's literally days of content on there.

833
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
But just if we're just talking about

834
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,440
my brother, my brother and me,

835
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,760
just to give you an example of what we're talking about,

836
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,920
you're going to get one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

837
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,640
eight episodes of the show you've never heard before.

838
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,520
Bonus episodes, all of which have like weird.

839
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,800
What are those?

840
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,080
I can't even remember what we've done.

841
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,040
Like this year we did.

842
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,160
The one with our dad.

843
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,000
We did, there's a, not counted in that total,

844
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,080
but my sister, my sister and me,

845
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,560
which is our wives recorded a podcast together.

846
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,280
That's on there.

847
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,040
Big Gulp Live, the one and only episode

848
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,640
of Griffin's Vore podcast.

849
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,800
Big Gulp is there.

850
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,920
Holy shit.

851
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah, that's there.

852
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,440
Our friend, Lin-Manuel Miranda, the guy,

853
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,040
he's been on TV a couple of times.

854
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm not sure what for,

855
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,000
but he seems to be making a name for himself.

856
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,680
He's got a demo of a song called Ghost Horse

857
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,680
that he wrote for us.

858
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,320
And the demo of him recording it is on there.

859
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,240
The Ghost Horse demo.

860
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
Fugue for Brother Horns is the subtitle of that.

861
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,120
But that's on there.

862
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,360
Like there's a ton of crap on there.

863
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,800
Including some video stuff.

864
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,440
Some videos.

865
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah, we riffed some old training.

866
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,720
Not training, but educational films.

867
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,080
Short films.

868
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,320
We did some jokes about those.

869
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,160
And that's on there.

870
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,280
And that's like just our show.

871
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,120
There's tons and tons and tons of crap.

872
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,320
We did a show about ASMR for my medical history podcast,

873
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,640
Sawbones, which ends in a binaural holophonic

874
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
virtual doctor's office visit

875
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
that demonstrates the idea of ASMR.

876
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,960
And that's on there.

877
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,920
There's so much on there that you can be enjoying

878
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,200
if you just donate $5 a month.

879
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,720
That's just five bucks a month

880
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,520
if you go to maximumfun.org slash donate right now.

881
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,320
For $10 a month, you get all that bonus content

882
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
and you get your pick of one of, I believe, 22,

883
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,240
maybe 24, somewhere in there, bandanas.

884
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,400
Each one styled for a specific show on the network.

885
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,840
The My Brother, My Brother and Me one

886
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,440
features Torsey the Torso Horse

887
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,280
along with a lot of other awesome stuff.

888
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,880
You can find them at maximumfun.org forward slash bandanas.

889
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,400
And that's just $10 a month.

890
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,040
It's a really awesome deal.

891
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,800
And you're gonna look super cool in that bandana.

892
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,920
You're gonna look like a tough bike man or woman.

893
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
Like a biker mouse from Mars.

894
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,680
Now at $20 a month,

895
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,880
you are going to get the Max Fun Adventure Necessity Collection.

896
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,760
This is, hey, what?

897
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,880
You go camping, what?

898
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,640
You get lost, just you get lost

899
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,920
and you wander into the woods sometimes

900
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,360
and you have to survive a night out there.

901
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,600
The Max Fun Adventure Necessity Collection's got you.

902
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,400
It's got a multi-tool with the Max Fun Rocket logo on it.

903
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,080
It's got a hot chocolate packet.

904
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,840
Actually, if you're like surviving out in the wilderness,

905
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,440
that probably would be low on the,

906
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,080
although I don't know,

907
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
that sugar would probably give you the burst of energy

908
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,240
and you need to like fashion a hut out of a tree.

909
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,440
A paracord bracelet you can use,

910
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,120
I think turns into a rope or something.

911
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,400
There's camping toilet paper,

912
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,800
which would absolutely be my number one necessity.

913
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,560
I poop a lot.

914
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Anyway, you can get that at $20 a month,

915
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
but you also get the stuff before.

916
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,960
Like the bandana and the bonus episodes.

917
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,520
Not like, that's specifically the stuff you'll get.

918
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,160
But what you also get is the smug satisfaction

919
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,360
of knowing that you donated

920
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,800
to support the things that you love.

921
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,600
And we also understand that not everybody can do that.

922
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,040
Sometimes you find yourself in a position

923
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,120
where you can't afford to give money every month.

924
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,000
And we totally get that.

925
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,840
If that's the case, make sure you go on Twitter,

926
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,560
you go on Facebook,

927
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960
you tell your friends that Max Fun Drive is going on.

928
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,000
You share that link, maximumfun.org forward slash donate

929
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,360
and you say like, I can't,

930
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,680
but you should support the things you love,

931
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,600
maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

932
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,520
We'll talk more about what else you can get

933
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,800
in the Max Fun Drive and how you can help support us.

934
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,240
But I think we should get back into the fucking flow.

935
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
Yeah, dive in.

936
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,160
All right, here's another question.

937
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,800
This one comes to us from Gmail.

938
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,120
It says, one of my closest friends

939
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,840
has recently gone a bit off the deep end.

940
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,120
The past few years, he's spent a lot of time on the internet

941
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,720
watching conspiracy theory videos

942
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,240
and YouTube documentaries.

943
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,560
Usually when he starts into some weird Illuminati talk,

944
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,240
I could change the subject to something more normal,

945
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:04,880
but not today.

946
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,680
We're stuck in a car together for a solid half hour

947
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
during which he expounded upon a variety

948
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,360
of crazy government slash occult theories.

949
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,160
I realized that he was spending way more time on this stuff

950
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,880
than I thought he even got pretty worked up

951
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
at a couple of points.

952
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,760
How can I talk to him about toning it way, way down?

953
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,360
My fear is there's a point of no return.

954
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,480
He may be fast approaching.

955
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,000
What should I do?

956
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,280
It says Gmail here, but it sounds to me

957
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,360
like this is actually from the G-man.

958
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,960
The G-man?

959
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,320
Yeah, open your eyes.

960
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,920
Back in the old, the fucking data vault,

961
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,440
the old black crypt and put it back buried underground

962
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,720
for the lizard men to feast.

963
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,400
Lizard men feast on truth.

964
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,080
And if you bury truth underground,

965
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,400
that's how the lizard men get to it and they can eat it.

966
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,200
That's true.

967
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
There's one way, Griffin, Griffin, how do I stop?

968
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,880
How do I fight the lizard men?

969
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,480
I'm glad you asked.

970
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,800
Gold, you need it, you need it, you need it.

971
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,920
You need it, go get it.

972
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,200
Oh, go get that gold.

973
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,040
Oh my God, you need the gold.

974
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,560
It's so very important.

975
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,120
Also, if you put a llama in with your sheeple,

976
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,960
it'll protect them from the lizard men.

977
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,320
That's a hundred percent true,

978
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,040
but not everybody's gonna have that luxury

979
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,200
because llamas are a rarity.

980
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,680
You gotta get a llama and a human being to bone down

981
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,520
and then that's a tough-

982
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,680
That's how Lorenzo Lamas was born.

983
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,440
Jesus, that's a good joke, Travis.

984
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,240
Thank you, Griffin.

985
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,240
I literally got sweaty from how good the joke was.

986
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,520
I got chills like for days.

987
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,680
A lot of people laugh when they hear a good joke.

988
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,360
For me, it was like instant sweat.

989
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,560
The laughs came through your pores.

990
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Yeah, in the form of perspiration.

991
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,520
Anyway, gold, oh my God, you need it.

992
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,640
Lizard men are afraid of it.

993
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,960
It's the worst thing about conspiracy theorists

994
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,120
is that they've made pirates seem like conspiracy theorists themselves.

995
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,280
Because every time they open up a chest full of gold,

996
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,560
they're like, oh, thank goodness.

997
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,120
It's like-

998
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,760
Oh, fuck yeah.

999
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,080
Yeah, we're safe.

1000
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,840
Come take this, Obama.

1001
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,160
Just kidding.

1002
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,400
Hey guys, can we encrypt this somehow?

1003
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,840
I don't know what that means because I'm a pirate,

1004
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,280
but we'll figure it out.

1005
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,960
Like a pirate who's a big fan of national treasure.

1006
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,040
I mean, for a pirate, if you bury treasure,

1007
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,800
that's encrypting it, technically.

1008
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,000
I mean, that's true.

1009
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,600
It's hard to hack a treasure chest.

1010
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Yeah.

1011
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,520
I got another question.

1012
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,360
Well, no, well, we didn't even help that person.

1013
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,160
Yeah, so what?

1014
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:26,720
I got another question.

1015
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,320
Okay, open your eyes.

1016
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,520
Your friend is right.

1017
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,080
Open your eyes.

1018
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,520
Your friend is not right.

1019
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,400
Obviously, this is the way that their anxiety manifests.

1020
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,120
You should ask, you should talk.

1021
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,320
They should, don't try to, here's your real advice, okay?

1022
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,360
Your real advice.

1023
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,880
Don't try to talk a person like this out of conspiracy theories

1024
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,200
that is reinforcing their conspiracy theory.

1025
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,400
Trust me on this one.

1026
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
This is beyond both our and their pay grade.

1027
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,320
And if you want to help them out,

1028
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,520
then get them to talk to somebody who it is their pay grade.

1029
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,600
Yeah, that ain't ours.

1030
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,600
My best friend treats me like I'm her baby daddy.

1031
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,800
Now we're talking.

1032
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,480
She even went as far as to tell some of the people

1033
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,600
who asked who the father was while she was pregnant

1034
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,480
that it was me.

1035
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:06,720
Wait, what?

1036
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,240
This is biologically impossible

1037
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,040
as we have never slept together and I, like her, am a woman.

1038
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
It stopped being cute and funny around the fifth time

1039
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,760
she said it.

1040
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,440
I don't even want kids my own.

1041
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,120
How do I get her to stop stamping my name on that belly button?

1042
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,320
And that's from Jenna.

1043
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,280
Like Jenna.

1044
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:21,780
What?

1045
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:22,660
Jenna.

1046
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:23,780
What?

1047
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,660
Jenna.

1048
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,040
Just tell her to stop.

1049
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,840
Jenna, this is a grounder.

1050
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,760
Tell her to quit doing that.

1051
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,520
But now, is there anybody who honestly thinks that this is-

1052
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:38,480
Oh, that are fooled?

1053
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,020
Yeah.

1054
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,180
Huh.

1055
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,160
I'm actually sitting here thinking, two women?

1056
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,080
I mean, we are-

1057
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,680
They're actually working on that technology.

1058
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,440
Yeah, like we're getting close to that technology.

1059
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,280
No, I know, but we're not there yet.

1060
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,760
Yeah.

1061
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,120
But I tell you what though, I'm not so plugged in

1062
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,480
that if someone told me that like I'm so embarrassed,

1063
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,760
I'm so like terrified.

1064
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,640
Oh, yes.

1065
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,760
Seeming like out of it.

1066
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,400
I'd be like, yeah, I've heard a lot about that lately.

1067
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,200
That tracks.

1068
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,160
That tracks with me.

1069
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:08,880
They would say that.

1070
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,040
The nightmare scenario that Justin's proposing is

1071
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,720
they would say that to, let's just use us as an example.

1072
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,280
And I would say, I would go, good one.

1073
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,880
And they'd be like, no, they took my stem cells

1074
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,600
and her stem cells and just like did the hokey pokey.

1075
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,040
And then like, wow, this is meet Marcia.

1076
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,720
And like, oh fuck, I fucked up.

1077
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,360
I'm so sorry.

1078
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,160
Your love is beautiful.

1079
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:28,800
I didn't mean to laugh.

1080
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,960
It's just like, I thought it was, oh, I'm so sorry.

1081
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,400
And then they double back on the goof and they're like,

1082
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,040
no, I'm just kidding.

1083
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,240
We don't have that tech yet.

1084
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,120
And I'm like, oh fuck, I'm really sweating over here.

1085
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,040
The whole time I knew it.

1086
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,400
But you know what, here's what it is.

1087
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,240
This is what I think this is a matter of.

1088
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,560
Your friend probably did this goof once

1089
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,600
and like people laughed and maybe you kind of laughed too.

1090
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,200
And then she was like, oh, okay.

1091
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,200
This is a good response joke.

1092
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:55,600
When someone asks like, who's the, you know,

1093
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,400
like who's the father?

1094
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,040
Which is also a weird thing to ask anybody.

1095
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,200
That's a weird thing to ask anybody.

1096
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,920
Oh yeah, who's the father?

1097
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,360
Why, what the fuck?

1098
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:05,840
Fuck you.

1099
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,320
Hey, who'd you bone?

1100
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,640
Who put that in you?

1101
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
Hey, who'd you bone today?

1102
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,440
That's a weird thing.

1103
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,720
I think that's the bigger problem.

1104
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,160
How often is this coming up?

1105
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,480
Or is she volunteering this?

1106
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
Like she walks into a party and she's like,

1107
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
my friend Jenna put this baby in me.

1108
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,920
That's also weird.

1109
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,880
It's a weird opener.

1110
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,680
It's not as bad as mine.

1111
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,680
I just walk in with my phone up like,

1112
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,440
have you guys seen this damn Daniel kid?

1113
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,160
What's up with that?

1114
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,840
That's good.

1115
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,800
It's pretty good, I think,

1116
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,960
because it connects with everybody, you know?

1117
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
And it'll never not be topical.

1118
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,200
Can I read a Yahoo?

1119
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,960
Yeah, sure.

1120
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,760
Kind of a classic bit.

1121
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,400
This one's sent in by riding high Zoe Kinski.

1122
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:48,880
Thank you, Zoe.

1123
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user shall cat who asks.

1124
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,800
Taller wife is blessing or curse.

1125
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,760
You know how they have like,

1126
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,920
like quotation marks is and then,

1127
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,840
but they also have like single quotation marks

1128
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,640
and describing height.

1129
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,280
Which one's foot?

1130
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,000
Which one's inch?

1131
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,560
One is foot, two is inch.

1132
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,040
Okay.

1133
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
My wife is three is meters.

1134
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:15,280
Okay.

1135
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,120
My wife is three feet taller than me.

1136
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,480
I've become a divided man in privacy.

1137
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,600
I am a staunch admirer and lover of my taller wife.

1138
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,600
I love, let me fucking finish.

1139
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,480
I enjoy her height,

1140
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,600
dominance of her physique and her overall supremacy.

1141
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
While in public, I am a scared man,

1142
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,440
feeling myself overwhelmed and pressurized.

1143
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Please provide me some genuine solution.

1144
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,400
Being pressurized is great.

1145
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,600
Cause if it starts raining on you,

1146
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,960
like you don't even have to worry about it.

1147
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,480
The difference is in the answer to this question.

1148
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,640
Dependent on whether he meant to type one apostrophe mark

1149
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,520
or two are an ocean.

1150
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,960
They are a vast ocean.

1151
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,080
It's a gulf.

1152
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,680
Separating two continents.

1153
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,280
Let's assume, how can we, how can we talk about the,

1154
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,480
are we talking like a Danny DeVito, Rhea Perlman situation?

1155
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:18,960
Or-

1156
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,360
You mean Danny DeVito with two Rhea Perlman's

1157
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,760
standing on top of each other's shoulders situation.

1158
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,960
The average male American height is five foot 10 inches tall.

1159
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,360
Okay.

1160
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,960
I say we start there.

1161
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,520
The average person-

1162
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,440
All right, let's take a foot and a half off that, four, four.

1163
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,000
We'll say four, four, and then we'll do,

1164
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,320
we'll add the three feet on the other end.

1165
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:40,960
For what are women?

1166
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
Like five, six?

1167
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,360
So a good six, 10.

1168
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,800
Four, four and six, 10.

1169
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,880
That doesn't add, does that track?

1170
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,120
No.

1171
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,080
Doesn't track do it.

1172
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,400
Four, four and seven, four.

1173
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,720
The tallest woman held the,

1174
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,840
according to Guinness Book of World Records, seven foot five.

1175
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,400
Okay.

1176
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,840
All right, so he's not a record,

1177
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,440
he's not a record breaking or like record encroaching.

1178
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,160
No, that's what I'm saying.

1179
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,760
Seven, four and four, four.

1180
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,120
That's what we're talking about.

1181
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,160
Run her up for my very tall wife.

1182
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,240
Oh wait, sorry.

1183
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,480
The actual, the tallest is eight foot one and three quarters inches.

1184
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:20,800
All right, so let's-

1185
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,360
She's not even really that tall at seven, four.

1186
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah.

1187
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,120
All right, seven, four and four, four.

1188
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:25,840
That's what we're talking about.

1189
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,520
I enjoy my tall wife.

1190
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,200
I enjoy my very big spouse so much.

1191
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,600
I love my big wife, guys.

1192
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,040
I don't know what to tell you.

1193
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,000
I'm not ashamed of it,

1194
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,080
except when we're in public, I feel like a scared man.

1195
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,240
I feel pressurized.

1196
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,720
But Danny DeVito is five feet tall.

1197
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:45,440
Correct.

1198
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,160
So you're four, four.

1199
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
And Rhea Perlman's five feet tall.

1200
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,080
That's amazing.

1201
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,280
I love these two.

1202
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,560
That makes me so happy.

1203
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,000
My wife is three feet tall.

1204
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,040
I love my big wife.

1205
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:55,840
Please, what do I do?

1206
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,000
In public, I get so scared and pressurized and overwhelmed.

1207
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,840
I mean, she's so much taller than him is the only thing about it.

1208
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,640
Should we assume, would we be more easily equipped to handle this

1209
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,480
if she was three inches taller?

1210
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,960
Because God, that seems just like so much more likely.

1211
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,040
That doesn't seem like worth writing into your answer about that, does it?

1212
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,600
That's like not that impressive.

1213
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,280
I mean, do they feel like they have to explain

1214
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,880
to people, to passersby, I love my very big wife.

1215
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,560
And I like her.

1216
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,720
If people are like, wow, is it hard having that three foot divide?

1217
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,640
And you would have to explain like every time,

1218
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,040
like I enjoy the dominance of her physique.

1219
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,040
But I do not like being pressurized.

1220
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,800
Well, that's just a public thing.

1221
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,520
That's just like, he's worried what the public thinks about them.

1222
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,240
Maybe he's less worried about what the public thinks

1223
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,320
and more worried about those two eyes he has glowering down on him

1224
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,520
from above every time someone gives them dirt looks.

1225
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,720
It's like, oh, listen, I see what you're thinking there.

1226
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,800
And I love my tall wife.

1227
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,920
I love my very big wife.

1228
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,320
I don't know what-

1229
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,280
It's gonna be really embarrassing when he finds out his wife

1230
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,720
is just two wives stacked on top of each other in a big trench coat.

1231
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:12,960
Yeah.

1232
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,200
And when she finds out that he's actually, he's actually eight rabbits.

1233
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,880
The whole time he's been one Tim Conway on his knees

1234
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,320
with fake shoes in front of his knees.

1235
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:24,960
Absolutely.

1236
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,880
I love my big wife.

1237
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,720
I don't think there's any grounds for discussion,

1238
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,680
further discussion here.

1239
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,240
I'm happy to put this one to rest.

1240
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,200
It's just guys.

1241
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,000
My wife is tall and I love that in her.

1242
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,920
I love my big wife.

1243
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm a man divided.

1244
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,080
At the end of each workday,

1245
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,800
my husband and I arrive at the entrance of our apartment complex

1246
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,360
to check out our mailbox before heading back in.

1247
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,480
For the past three weeks,

1248
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,280
light clockwork at white haired elderly gentleman

1249
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,320
around the age 75 to 80 exits the mailroom

1250
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,640
and literally walks backwards towards his own apartment.

1251
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,800
A good five to seven minute walk.

1252
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,920
Damn Daniel, it's a very surreal thing to watch.

1253
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,200
He always has a grimace on his face and worse,

1254
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,280
he stares right at us as he's doing it.

1255
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,360
We've been trying to figure out why he would do this.

1256
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,440
Is this a new exercise for the elderly?

1257
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,280
Are we in an episode of Twin Peaks?

1258
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,840
And most of all, why in God's name must he stare at us

1259
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,800
when he does it?

1260
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,880
Is there any chance you might be able to shed some light on this?

1261
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,320
We'd love to hear your thoughts and conclusions on this matter.

1262
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,200
That's from Alexis.

1263
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:29,840
He's definitely a ghost.

1264
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,000
Like a hundred percent, definitely, definitely a ghost.

1265
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,440
Like that's not even a question,

1266
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
which is another one of our bits that we're bringing back

1267
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,400
for Goofbusters.

1268
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,600
But just cause he's a ghost

1269
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,200
doesn't mean he's not gaslighting you.

1270
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,640
That's true.

1271
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,480
That's sometimes ghosts just need something to keep them going.

1272
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:44,960
For all you know,

1273
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,720
he's walked the ghostly plane for like 400 years

1274
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,320
and he's just like, I need something to keep me going.

1275
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,600
And it's messing with Alexis and her husband.

1276
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:59,120
The strongest argument for gaslighting, in my opinion,

1277
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,800
is the repetition.

1278
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,320
If you had seen this once and you had thought,

1279
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,520
oh, that's weird.

1280
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,120
And then you never saw it again,

1281
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,240
that could have been one of life's many coincidences.

1282
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,320
Since it has happened multiple times,

1283
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,520
he is trying to get you to question his sanity.

1284
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,120
If it happens more than once,

1285
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,040
it's you're being gaslit.

1286
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Yeah, he's definitely has some sort of lizard man

1287
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,920
like surveillance situation on you.

1288
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,840
Like guaranteed if you went up to him and said,

1289
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,240
hey, didn't you just do this?

1290
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,200
He would say, no, I don't think so.

1291
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,680
I think this is the first time I've ever, ever done this.

1292
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,180
Yeah.

1293
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Another possibility, can I put this forward?

1294
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,080
Hit me.

1295
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,400
What if he just has a great ass

1296
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,880
and he just always wants you to-

1297
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,040
Does he have truck nuts hanging from his belt?

1298
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,800
No, we're putting truck nuts away.

1299
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,600
Put it back in the drawer.

1300
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,320
No, I will never.

1301
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,960
I'm the teacher.

1302
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,400
I'm gonna take your fucking prank,

1303
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,760
prank you, whoopee cushions.

1304
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,640
I'm gonna take your truck nuts.

1305
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,880
I'm gonna put them in my drawer.

1306
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,320
And then later on, the principal is gonna find him

1307
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,360
and be like, Michelle, what the fuck?

1308
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,400
You can't have nuts at work.

1309
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,120
This is not your band.

1310
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,000
Anyway, maybe he's got a great,

1311
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,920
oh, just a juicy little rump.

1312
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,920
Oh, a juicy little old man bottom.

1313
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,200
And he just wants you to greet,

1314
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,000
he wants to greet you.

1315
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,800
Hello, good day.

1316
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,280
This is me.

1317
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,400
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

1318
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,240
He just wants you to see it with your eyes, first thing.

1319
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,800
Maybe learn to moonwalk is on his bucket list.

1320
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,040
It's possible.

1321
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,400
He's made it through a lot, huh?

1322
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,920
He must have turned through the first few pages already.

1323
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,360
He started way too early.

1324
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,440
He started doing his bucket list at 40,

1325
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,840
but now at 80, he's like, I'm down to the dregs.

1326
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:41,120
I've got eat crackers hanging from a pole

1327
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,800
and walk backwards.

1328
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,840
Do that thing with a dollar bill on a rope

1329
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,680
tied to a stick to a little kid

1330
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,960
to make him run around the block.

1331
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,160
Gaslight, gaslight some 20 somethings.

1332
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,800
Next time you see him moonwalking,

1333
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,880
just see if he's carrying like a coffee can

1334
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,800
full of the ashes of his best friend

1335
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,800
who he was knocking that list out with.

1336
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,400
Because that's a telltale sign.

1337
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,080
We didn't get this,

1338
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,080
we didn't get to this one together, Peter,

1339
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,000
but you got there.

1340
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
You're moonwalking with Jesus now.

1341
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,360
You see that one pair of backwards footprints?

1342
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,240
That's where I carried you backwards.

1343
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,240
I'm gonna throw your ass down on the floor

1344
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,000
now to reduce the friction.

1345
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,080
Thank you, Peter.

1346
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,640
Peter, your burned up body helps me dance again.

1347
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,320
Shuffle flop, shuffle step.

1348
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,000
Peter, with your dusty permission,

1349
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm gonna try to do the lean over thing.

1350
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,640
Nope, dad.

1351
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,280
Someone come burn me

1352
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,600
so I can lubricate your moonwalk.

1353
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,800
And then you can carry this burden backwards

1354
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,080
for all of time.

1355
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,760
That's what the circle of life was about.

1356
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:00,240
Peter, I want our bodies to do sand art together.

1357
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,480
I want a bored teenager on a boardwalk somewhere

1358
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,320
to pour us both in a jar

1359
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,560
and then poke a straw through us

1360
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,040
to make weird angular shapes, Peter.

1361
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:13,920
Set me free.

1362
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,760
What do we got?

1363
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,560
Another Yahoo?

1364
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,560
Or maybe we should talk about the Max Fun Drive again.

1365
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,480
I think let's talk about the Max Fun Drive one more time

1366
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,440
and then do a couple more and then bounce.

1367
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,640
Maximumfun.org relies on your donations

1368
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:33,760
to keep the network going

1369
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,640
and it also allows us to do other shows.

1370
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,320
When we started Maximum Fun,

1371
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,600
it was just my brother, my brother, and me.

1372
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,520
Well, we didn't start Maximum Fun.

1373
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,040
When we started with Maximum Fun,

1374
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,120
thank you, Griffin, that preposition was essential.

1375
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,480
We started with Maximum Fun,

1376
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,000
it was just my brother, my brother, and me.

1377
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,040
And then when we decided like,

1378
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,440
hey, we could take time away from other things

1379
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,680
to do this podcast thing

1380
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,240
because folks seemed to like it

1381
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,320
and we're making a little bit of money off of it.

1382
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,560
So why don't we do more?

1383
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,840
So that's why we did The Adventure Zone

1384
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
and we did Big Gulp

1385
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,880
and we did Schmanners and Sawbones and-

1386
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,840
Bunker Buddies.

1387
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,560
Bunker Buddies.

1388
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,680
Trends like these.

1389
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,120
Can I Pet Your Dog?

1390
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,320
Yeah, that's when we started Bullseye.

1391
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,440
Still Buffering.

1392
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,640
Yeah, and we did all those podcasts

1393
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,400
because you fine folks supported us

1394
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,960
and it allows us to do less.

1395
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,880
Like we said, Travis made this his full-time job.

1396
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,320
I work less at my day job now

1397
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,560
because I need more time to make shows for folks.

1398
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:38,240
I also wanna say like, I love Max Fun

1399
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,840
and I love the Max Fun Drive

1400
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,920
because basically it's a two-week period

1401
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,960
of people talking about how special Maximum Fun is.

1402
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,960
And I agree because sometimes the internet

1403
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,000
can get really bogged down with really terrible people

1404
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,920
who just complain about the things they love,

1405
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,160
which is such a weird thing to do.

1406
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,920
But everyone, like they love something so much

1407
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,600
that all they can do is complain about it

1408
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,880
when it disappoints them.

1409
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,480
It is the most supportive and inclusive community

1410
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,280
basically ever.

1411
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,520
Every time we get out to a Max Fun Con,

1412
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,560
it's like just the best time ever

1413
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,480
hanging out with the best folks ever.

1414
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,160
Speaking of, if you want to hang out

1415
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,840
with other members of the Max Fun community.

1416
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,440
Oh God, Rachel's spraying off the window of my office.

1417
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,280
She just scared the shit out of me.

1418
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:22,800
Rachel did?

1419
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:23,680
Yeah.

1420
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:24,880
I mean, she's not-

1421
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,680
Spraying off the window.

1422
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,240
I think you said sprang off the window.

1423
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,360
Yeah, Rachel's doing some fucking-

1424
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,720
What kind of cat woman shed is she pulling?

1425
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,920
Yeah, well, she's training for the Ninja Warrior.

1426
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,400
Anyway, I've told her not to do it on the glass.

1427
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,280
You know what I mean?

1428
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,720
Like the course is not gonna be made out of glass.

1429
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,480
Anyway, forgot completely what I was talking about.

1430
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,400
Oh, there's meetups next week.

1431
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,760
Next Tuesday, if you go to-

1432
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,040
Or this Tuesday, tomorrow.

1433
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,320
This Tuesday, that's right.

1434
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
Go to maximumfun.org slash meetups

1435
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,720
and you can see where everything's popping off

1436
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:57,760
in different cities across these United States of America.

1437
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,760
Is there something happening in LA that you're going to, Trav?

1438
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,240
Yeah, Teresa and I and basically all of my co-hosts that live here

1439
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,000
are going to Club TG, T-E-E-G-E-E.

1440
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,760
So yeah, go hang out.

1441
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
Seriously, everybody I've ever met through these shows

1442
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,960
has been fucking radical.

1443
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,960
There's also a special promotion going away

1444
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,200
where Max Fun is giving away a Breville product,

1445
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,680
a kitchen appliance and favorite of John Hodgman.

1446
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,200
If you tweet a link to the donate page,

1447
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,960
which is maximumfun.org slash donate,

1448
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,360
along with a statement of why you love Maximum Fun

1449
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,720
or why people should support it,

1450
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,200
and you use the hashtag toast to Max Fun,

1451
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,360
they will pick the one they like the best

1452
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,320
and they will get Hodgman's favorite Breville product.

1453
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,680
I'm assuming it is a toaster just based on the hashtag.

1454
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,640
Anyway, let's talk about what other GIFs people can expect

1455
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,840
at the higher donation levels.

1456
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,720
Well, we talked about the bonus content for $5,

1457
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,120
the bandana for $10 and the adventure kit for $20.

1458
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,840
For $35, you get all that stuff

1459
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,480
and you get a really beautiful Max Fun emblazoned vacuum thermos.

1460
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,760
Keeps your hot drinks hot, your cold drinks cold,

1461
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,360
your medium drinks medium.

1462
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,880
Hides your gold from the lizard men

1463
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,320
who can't see inside of vacuums.

1464
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,000
And can I tell you a secret folks?

1465
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,640
What's that?

1466
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,560
Maybe you are already a donor.

1467
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,800
That's awesome, thank you so much.

1468
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,720
Surprise, that's the secret.

1469
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,400
You're a donor already and you didn't know it.

1470
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,600
We've been hacking your account

1471
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,480
and you are a $35 a month donor

1472
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,400
and you're looking at that $100 a month level

1473
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,440
and you're like, I don't know.

1474
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,840
There's a secret $50 a month level

1475
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,560
for upgrading donors that you can move up to

1476
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,720
if you're not quite ready to make that jump to 100.

1477
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,640
So don't worry.

1478
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,240
If you're not already a donor

1479
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,440
and you just listened to that

1480
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,200
and processed it with your brain,

1481
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,120
you're a criminal technically.

1482
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,640
Now you have to become a donor.

1483
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,920
But above that, there is a $100 per month level

1484
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,920
if you maybe you're flush

1485
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,600
and you really, really like our shows

1486
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,480
and you want to help support us,

1487
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,680
there is a what's called The Inner Circle,

1488
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,880
which is our monthly culture club.

1489
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,600
You get all the other stuff,

1490
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,520
bonus episodes, the thermos, all that.

1491
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,680
But you also get to be a member of The Inner Circle

1492
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,240
and every month, a host of a max fun show

1493
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,600
picks some cultural thing.

1494
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,720
Maybe it's a book, maybe it's a movie,

1495
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:09,760
maybe it's an album.

1496
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:12,080
And you will get a copy of that

1497
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,960
as well as a sort of written explanation

1498
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,640
as to why it is so special to those people.

1499
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,360
For us, last year we selected the album Music Evolution

1500
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,080
by the hip hop, jazz, funk band Buckshot Le Funk,

1501
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,800
which is like literally one of my favorite albums

1502
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,520
basically ever.

1503
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,040
It was very formative when I was a child.

1504
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:32,480
Thank you to the Men in Black soundtrack

1505
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,520
for pointing me their way.

1506
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,560
If you really want to go hog wild,

1507
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,440
we have a little record.

1508
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,600
If you really want to go hog wild

1509
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,880
for $200 per month,

1510
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,320
you can get free registration for Max Fun Con 2017,

1511
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,000
which again, like I just said, is a blast.

1512
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,600
It's full of the coolest people ever.

1513
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,040
Get to eat a bunch of dope ass food

1514
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,160
on top of a mountain.

1515
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,560
Get drunk with your favorite podcasters.

1516
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
So yeah, we don't expect that people are gonna,

1517
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,000
like a lot of folks are gonna come in at those levels.

1518
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,120
That's kind of a big ask.

1519
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,200
But if you have, you know,

1520
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,480
if you really enjoy our shows,

1521
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,640
if you enjoy My Bim Bam and The Adventure Zone

1522
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,640
and Sawbones and Bunker Buddies

1523
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,880
and the rest of the shows that we do

1524
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,760
and you want to support us,

1525
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,400
just go to maximumfund.org slash donate.

1526
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,440
There's a questionnaire about like

1527
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,120
which podcasts you listen to, just fill that out.

1528
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,680
And we really appreciate your support.

1529
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,240
It helps us out immeasurably.

1530
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,600
And what's really special about that

1531
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,520
is the shows that you say you listen to

1532
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,960
are the shows that get funded by your donation.

1533
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:32,480
So it's a very direct one-in-one kind of support.

1534
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,800
So it's not just like spread throughout Max Fun

1535
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,880
and you don't know where your dollars are going.

1536
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,920
The shows that you say you listen to are supported by you.

1537
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,680
We are recording this a little bit early.

1538
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,520
But at last check, we were about halfway

1539
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,040
to our 5,000 member goal.

1540
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,440
And obviously like we want to smash that goal

1541
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,440
and keep going higher and higher.

1542
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,000
So I don't know where we're going to be out on Monday,

1543
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,080
but please, you know, help us meet that goal.

1544
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,680
Help us crush and destroy that goal.

1545
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,960
Help us embarrass that goal.

1546
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,720
Help us humiliate that goal.

1547
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,480
And that goal is new and upgrading.

1548
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,640
So if you've been a donor for a long time

1549
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,640
and now you went from listening to like one show to 12,

1550
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,560
maybe consider up in that donation

1551
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,760
and supporting even more shows.

1552
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,000
Because if you don't update the shows that you listen to,

1553
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,600
they're not getting supported by you.

1554
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:21,280
And if you want fucking more reason to donate.

1555
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,720
Oh God, I hate doing these.

1556
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,320
Let me think.

1557
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:43,520
Sometimes in life you want to buy a boat.

1558
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:54,400
But you don't have the money that salesmen require for boats.

1559
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:07,840
But that sea is calling to me.

1560
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:16,720
You've got to give to the Maximum Fun Drive.

1561
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:26,720
Maximum Fun Drive.

1562
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
Maximum Fun Drive.

1563
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:34,720
What I liked about that was that I want a boat

1564
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,400
and I don't have the money needed for the boat.

1565
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,680
I'm going to take another stab at it.

1566
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,200
I'm going to focus on this boat because gang,

1567
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,040
we didn't mention this in the notes, but I really...

1568
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,840
You could do more with the boat thing.

1569
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,080
Okay.

1570
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,200
What was that?

1571
01:03:53,200 --> 01:04:10,080
That was a weird mid bar key change.

1572
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:19,520
What do you do when you've got a little boat?

1573
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,080
And your friends at the marina, they all make fun of your little boat.

1574
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:38,000
Well, the answer is clear.

1575
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:43,120
Give me boat money this year.

1576
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,680
It's time for the Maximum Fun Drive.

1577
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,800
Maximum Fun Drive.

1578
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:58,080
The Maximum Fun Drive.

1579
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,080
The boat was an allegory for my penis.

1580
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:11,120
Beautiful.

1581
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,800
I'm talking about penis enlargement surgery.

1582
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:24,560
The men at the docks make fun of my dick.

1583
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,040
I wish that the boat men would stop looking at me in the bathroom.

1584
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,640
It's supposed to be private place.

1585
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:48,880
Hey, Griffin, what's the number of donors we need to hit to bring back

1586
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,200
jingles permanently?

1587
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,480
What's the number of them?

1588
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:55,600
A million donors.

1589
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:57,520
Wait, hold on.

1590
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,200
If we hit 5,000 donors, I'm getting an Adventure Zone tattoo,

1591
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,000
but it takes you a million donors to do jingles.

1592
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,600
Birthing these creations.

1593
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,680
John Coulson wrote a song a day.

1594
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,400
That's Joko.

1595
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,640
That ain't me.

1596
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:13,520
A song a day.

1597
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,280
Go to MaximumFun.org, forward slash donate now while you're thinking about it.

1598
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,960
I don't play this acoustic guitar anymore.

1599
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,000
It stinks.

1600
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,880
I don't know what's going on.

1601
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,160
The strings actually stink.

1602
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:23,680
They actually smell very bad.

1603
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,280
I don't want to be touching it anymore.

1604
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,080
That's what I was saying.

1605
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,360
Like, I'd love to read it back.

1606
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,040
A, I like listen to them.

1607
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,800
B, it's a nice sort of like halftime for me and Scraps.

1608
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:33,120
Yeah.

1609
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:36,560
Like play Galaxy of Heroes on our iPhones and fucking chill for a second.

1610
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,520
I did three Hearthstone matches in there.

1611
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,560
Yeah, that's awesome.

1612
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,120
Cool.

1613
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:45,280
A coworker of mine brought some delicious bone-in chicken wings to work for lunch

1614
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:46,400
and offered me one.

1615
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,560
I gladly accepted, but fumbled the hand off and dropped the wing.

1616
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,040
Rather than let said wing go to waste,

1617
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,040
I removed the skin from the side that touched the carpet and ate the wing.

1618
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,160
Now everyone in the office thinks I'm a dirty floor eater.

1619
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,280
Am I good?

1620
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,400
Germs can't make it through the protective skin instantly, right?

1621
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,760
What was I supposed to do?

1622
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,040
Let the wing go to waste?

1623
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:10,000
And that's from Five Second Faux Pas in Dallas.

1624
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:10,880
This is horrible.

1625
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,960
You can't, it's not about, everyone's so worried about germs, right?

1626
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:19,760
And germs are bad.

1627
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,120
Don't get me wrong, germs are very bad.

1628
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,240
I've watched Contagion, okay?

1629
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,840
They took Gwyneth Paltrow from us, I hate it.

1630
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,480
Germs aren't great.

1631
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,400
I really want to make my position known on germs.

1632
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:29,360
I think they stink.

1633
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:34,320
But there's a sort of social germ that is invisible and intangible

1634
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,160
and it won't make you sick, but it'll make me sick

1635
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,080
if I let you eat a wing off the floor.

1636
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,720
Especially a sloppy, sloppy wing.

1637
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:44,560
A wing is the worst possible, it's like you engineered,

1638
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,280
gotta have meat on it, gotta be very sticky.

1639
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,880
The only thing worse is if you dump soup on the ground

1640
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,800
and vacuum it out through a straw.

1641
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,120
Yeah, no, I think wing's actually worse than that.

1642
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,000
Than carpet soup?

1643
01:07:59,520 --> 01:07:59,920
Yes.

1644
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,720
I tell you who's really at fault here.

1645
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,360
Who's that, Travis?

1646
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,560
It's the coworker.

1647
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:06,720
The coworker who saw you drop your wing

1648
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,080
and did not instantly say,

1649
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:10,720
I will give you another, please throw that wing away.

1650
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:15,120
This was not your one and only wing opportunity.

1651
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,840
I will present you with another wing, please do not do this.

1652
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,160
That's what I, I think that's a bigger problem

1653
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,480
than like the germ aspect.

1654
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,840
It's just like the steez that you immediately have

1655
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,280
is like person who doesn't know

1656
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,440
where people are buying wings all the time.

1657
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,120
Like, where did you find this?

1658
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,880
This is the only crack I have at this.

1659
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,640
I just, I'll just, yeah, whatever.

1660
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,840
I may never wing again.

1661
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:37,600
This is a barefoot office.

1662
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,960
God, wait, what?

1663
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:42,960
What is that?

1664
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,320
Like Google or Pixar

1665
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,800
where everybody's like on razor scooters at bare feet.

1666
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,280
Or just the beach because you're a surf instructor.

1667
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,160
The whole world's my office, man.

1668
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,400
As long as it's a beach.

1669
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,440
As long as it's specifically a beach.

1670
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:00,080
I cannot work in like a suburban area.

1671
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,120
Yeah, and honestly,

1672
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,280
if we could try to keep it in the,

1673
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,800
just sort of the Malibu area.

1674
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:06,800
I have lost my license.

1675
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:08,880
Yeah, this, more like this.

1676
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,800
If I go a hundred feet that way,

1677
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,640
that's sort of a surfberg's territory

1678
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,080
and a hundred feet the other way,

1679
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,040
sort of like surfing Dan's surfing class territory.

1680
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,400
So like, if we actually,

1681
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,240
my office is actually this office.

1682
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,200
Now that I think about it,

1683
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,800
this is pretty much the only place

1684
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:25,840
that I could teach surfing.

1685
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,640
It's amazing to me how contentious

1686
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,120
and territorial surf instructors get.

1687
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:31,680
Yeah.

1688
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:34,480
Man, we've lost too many people too young

1689
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:35,920
to surf instructor beefs.

1690
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,040
This is my beach.

1691
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,400
Like this isn't Arby's.

1692
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:43,200
There's a small fishing pond three and a half miles away.

1693
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,760
This is not, this ain't your beach.

1694
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,120
This ain't your beach.

1695
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,880
I thought you said this is our beach

1696
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,760
and then I put it together and you said Arby's.

1697
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,640
You know, another funny thing you could say about this.

1698
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:58,400
Oh no.

1699
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:58,960
Oh no.

1700
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,160
Just back to back.

1701
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,800
Back to back.

1702
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,160
Are you positive?

1703
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,360
Yeah, I'm positive.

1704
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,960
Is a haunted doll watch folks

1705
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,920
and it's coming to you live from eBay,

1706
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,280
the electronic bay.

1707
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,800
It's bringing word of haunted dolls

1708
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,760
from all over the world.

1709
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,120
This one is a haunted vintage doll,

1710
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,400
paranormal spirit vessel,

1711
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:17,440
active EMF.

1712
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,320
A lot of SEO,

1713
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,520
not so much a name.

1714
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,320
Do we need a vintage modifier on that?

1715
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,160
Is anybody like bringing home a fucking like,

1716
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,960
oh, this is Susan.

1717
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,080
She's a new American girl.

1718
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,560
Ah, fuck.

1719
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,120
She's haunted.

1720
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,440
Damn it.

1721
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,720
I just spent $300 on this.

1722
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,920
I can't believe it got ghosts all up in it.

1723
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,320
Yeah.

1724
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,240
Haunted dolls found in the storage

1725
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,920
after grandma passed away.

1726
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,760
I'm having paranormal activity

1727
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,440
after bringing these dolls home.

1728
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,120
At first I was very scared,

1729
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,520
but now I'm spending more time with each doll

1730
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,240
in order to get a sense of their energy

1731
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,120
and give the buyer as much information as possible.

1732
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:51,680
That's nice.

1733
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:53,760
You gotta really spend some time with your dolls

1734
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,880
to get to know them.

1735
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:55,040
Yeah.

1736
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,720
They're really filling in the blanks.

1737
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,280
The next sentence of this eBay listing is,

1738
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,520
I am what they call a sensitive.

1739
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:03,520
Oh my God.

1740
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,080
You know, I'm not sure if karma is real

1741
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,360
or Kisnet or what have you,

1742
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,640
whatever, whatever, you know,

1743
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,520
sort of higher power you believe in.

1744
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:17,120
But boy, isn't it lucky how people

1745
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:20,080
who are sensitive to the spiritual comings

1746
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,280
and goings often inherit large doll collections

1747
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,960
from their dead grandmothers.

1748
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,160
It's funny how those,

1749
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,440
you don't find a lot of guy,

1750
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,760
like just like dudes named Carl

1751
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,160
inheriting a bunch of dolls from their dead grandma.

1752
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,040
My sensitive friend told me that these dolls were haunted,

1753
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:36,880
but I swear to God, I get nothing.

1754
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:40,480
Why are you cursing with this lack of sensitivity?

1755
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,880
Damn, I wish I could commune with you beautiful babies.

1756
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:44,080
I love it.

1757
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:45,680
Damn, I could tell,

1758
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,320
I could tell it behind each of your dead porcelain eyes.

1759
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,760
You each got a story to tell,

1760
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,840
but I just can't hear it with my dumb,

1761
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,080
non-sensitive ears, damn it, Carl.

1762
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,760
Therefore, I'm able to use all my senses

1763
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:58,880
and feel spirits.

1764
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,120
My grandma was a kind, loving spirit.

1765
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,520
My Aunt Angelica was a healer

1766
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,120
and that baby from Rugrats

1767
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,400
and a psychic in her account.

1768
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,760
I was taken care of by my aunt.

1769
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,040
So I learned how to perceive

1770
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,360
and work with energy from an early age.

1771
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,280
Fuck, you are such a good pick

1772
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,520
for a huge old doll collection.

1773
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,760
I cannot believe how lucky we are

1774
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,440
that these two things lined up.

1775
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,080
Justin, you don't hear about the 100,000 other times

1776
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:26,880
that people like,

1777
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,640
those people aren't gonna get on eBay and say,

1778
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,000
I've got a shitload of dolls possibly haunted.

1779
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,440
I have no fucking clue.

1780
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,640
History is written by the sensitives.

1781
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,200
Yeah, and also I liked it.

1782
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,040
At first, this person was scared.

1783
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,120
It's like, hey, hey,

1784
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,600
you spent your whole life training for this moment.

1785
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,280
Are you sure you're scared?

1786
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:48,400
This is like the best.

1787
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,760
Well, maybe it was like, you know,

1788
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:51,280
moving up to the big show scared.

1789
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,320
Like the first time,

1790
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:54,160
like, you know, you're the backup quarterback.

1791
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:57,200
The starting quarterback goes down with like a broken hammy

1792
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,040
and you're called in and he's like,

1793
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,000
now you're a quarterback now.

1794
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,600
And you're like, I'm scared, but I'm ready.

1795
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:02,320
So maybe that was it.

1796
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,360
Like he inherited the dolls.

1797
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:05,280
He threw open the storage room door,

1798
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,400
like on Storage Wars.

1799
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,200
He just saw a bunch of dead black eyes

1800
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,160
staring back at him.

1801
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,400
And he was like, I'm ready.

1802
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,480
I'm scared, but I'm ready.

1803
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,600
Don't you guys wanna know at all about this doll?

1804
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,720
Don't you wanna know about it?

1805
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,880
Yeah, I mean, typically this is the part

1806
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,640
that is kind of sad.

1807
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,080
I perceive a very spoiled rich girl

1808
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,600
who grew up without her mother.

1809
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,040
Her father was a businessman

1810
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:30,880
who traveled all out of the country

1811
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,560
and left her alone with her nanny

1812
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,880
and hired help to care for her.

1813
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,520
She was homeschooled and didn't develop good social skills.

1814
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,080
Therefore she grew up resentful and untrusting of others.

1815
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:42,800
She does not respond when I ask her name,

1816
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,800
but I keep getting Gretchen in my head.

1817
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,480
I keep getting Gretchen in my head

1818
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,000
as my favorite Johnny Cash song.

1819
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,880
And it's a sad, slow ballad, and I love it.

1820
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,960
She has a stubborn and very determined strong personality

1821
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,400
that I'm not comfortable with.

1822
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,200
Wow.

1823
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:59,360
Okay, shit.

1824
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,440
The lights have flickered on and off,

1825
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:03,680
and I feel a pulling sensation from her

1826
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:05,520
as if she wants to draw me in.

1827
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,520
I would advise caution in establishing boundaries with her.

1828
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,120
How stubborn can she be if she's trying to pull you in, dawg?

1829
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,680
She's trying to pull you in, dawg, she wants to engage.

1830
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,520
This sounds like a frustrated parent

1831
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,840
giving their child up for adoption.

1832
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,360
This is like, it's not my fault

1833
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,320
you didn't break this puppet spirit.

1834
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,200
I'm bothered by the fact that this judgmental turd

1835
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,960
who is making this starts off by saying she's very spoiled.

1836
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,640
She grew up without a mother.

1837
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,080
Like right there, like you know what's up

1838
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,920
and you're still being a turd about it.

1839
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,640
This is the ending.

1840
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,280
I have left her and gone to bed

1841
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,360
and have felt her hovering over me.

1842
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,560
It's just what I feel, very disturbing energy.

1843
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,800
Her face, arms, and feet are porcelain with a soft body.

1844
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,320
She measures 16 inches tall.

1845
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,440
Oh, see, don't breeze over that.

1846
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:56,560
That's what I, as a collector, that's the stuff I want to know.

1847
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,720
I mean, the spirit, the living spirit that lives inside her.

1848
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,520
That's great and everything, but I've got like a,

1849
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,200
I've got like a dollhouse thing going on

1850
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,480
and I don't want some big ass doll.

1851
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:06,960
It's like too big for the tea set I have set up.

1852
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,440
I'll say that this seller is not really good

1853
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,120
at selling.

1854
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,760
I got this doll, she's creepy as shit.

1855
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,280
She's going to hover over you.

1856
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,400
I do not like it.

1857
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:19,360
Please take this creepy doll and give me money for it.

1858
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,960
Holy fucking shit.

1859
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,720
You guys are not going to believe me,

1860
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,040
but this listing actually ends with,

1861
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:26,880
and I just said it to you so you believe me,

1862
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,200
her face, arms, and feet are porcelain with a soft body.

1863
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,320
She measures 16 feet tall.

1864
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,920
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1865
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,600
No, it can't, it can't be.

1866
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,200
She measures 16 feet tall.

1867
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,160
No, no.

1868
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:37,840
Yes, I love my tall doll wife.

1869
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,400
I love my tall doll.

1870
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,840
I am 13 feet tall.

1871
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,160
My haunted doll wife is 16 feet tall.

1872
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:44,800
I love how big.

1873
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,760
I felt her hover over me,

1874
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,520
but it does not match up one and one

1875
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:49,440
because she is three feet taller than I am.

1876
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,840
She's 16 feet tall.

1877
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,640
I love how my tall haunted wife physically dominates me.

1878
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:59,760
I feel so pressurized by my tall doll wife.

1879
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,040
I love her haunted physique.

1880
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:03,920
She does not feel private.

1881
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,040
I feel such judgment.

1882
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,400
This is a full blown like,

1883
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,760
Yes.

1884
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,520
80s horror movie.

1885
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,080
Like, hello, daddy.

1886
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,960
Like, oh, fuck, no.

1887
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,440
Yeah, the last line is,

1888
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,640
also, this is viral marketing for the new Ghostbusters movie.

1889
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,840
Check it out in theaters.

1890
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,720
It's coming soon.

1891
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,480
Leslie Jones is in it.

1892
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,680
She's hysterical.

1893
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:28,560
This is actually viral marketing for Goofbusters 2,

1894
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,080
this episode of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1895
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,400
This has been so much fun to revisit some of our old classics.

1896
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,560
Maybe not as many as we thought there was gonna be.

1897
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,880
So if you're about to tweet us and ask,

1898
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,800
whatever happened to blank?

1899
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,000
This is your answer.

1900
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,200
It died here.

1901
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:46,400
See you again next year.

1902
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,000
Hopefully not.

1903
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,120
I also wanna remind you, maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

1904
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,080
You know, even if $5 is the most you can do,

1905
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,040
if you can carve out $5,

1906
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,200
that's great.

1907
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,400
That means the world to us.

1908
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:07,600
Every bit you could donate really does help a lot,

1909
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,440
and it helps to show that this is a thing that you love,

1910
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,360

1920
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,680
and a bunch of my co-hosts here in LA are gonna be there,

It's a wonderful, wonderful album, a great song.

Nope.

1957
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:45,840
My face in the rain asks, why are calzones called calzones

1958
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,960
and not pizza sandwiches?

1959
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:50,720

Kiss your dad.

1964
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,400

Each week, we welcome a kick-ass lady guest.

We talk about our lives, our dreams,

1975
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,040
and the terrible decisions we've made that still haunt us.

1976
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,480
We've had on great comedians like Aisha Tyler and Margaret

1977
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,880
Troe, plus screenwriters, doctors, authors,

1978
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:39,280
you know, anyone who's willing to be as open as we are.

1979
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,320
It's all a lot of fun.

1980
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,760
That's us, Lady to Lady.

1981
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:42,800
Can you keep a secret?

1982
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:52,800
Neither.
