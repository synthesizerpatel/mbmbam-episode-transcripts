1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,840
Ladies and gentlemen, you've found my brother, my brother, and we had an advice show for the

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:56,080
modern era, and we have Emmy fever. Tonight, I'm gonna sit down with a box of popcorn and a bottle

7
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:05,280
of Pinot Gris and watch Miss Jane Lynch do her thing tonight on the Emmy stage to honor some

8
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,160
of my favorite programs of the year. Who do you like, Justin? Who do you favor this year?

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,520
Glee, obviously. Like across the board? I got Glee fever over here. Glee-ver. I've got it.

10
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
Who's taking home that tiny golden angel? That little golden angel is going in the hands of the

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:33,760
talented Miss Lea Michele for her portrayal of a role of Sing Girl from Glee. Jessica Singstar.

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Jessica Singstar, the talented upstart, half Jewish, half singer, talent powerhouse

13
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,680
known as Glee-a Michele. Now, Justin, let me ask you this. Yes? Who's your pick for

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,360
outstanding sound mixing for nonfictioning and programming? That is going to go to the one and

15
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,000
only Ken Burns for his documentary on Glee. Ah, I see. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm your oldest

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,480
brother, and I have Glee-ver. I'm Travis McElroy, and I think that that Ken Burns documentary would

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:18,080
be called The Gay the Earth Stood Still. I'm Griffin. How's your Glee-ver right now?

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:28,560
That's low. I took a pretty intense regimen of antibiotics that really, really dried me up

19
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,320
inside and out, but I've finally beaten the Glee. You kicked it? I kicked the Glee. It was tough

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,160
tough stuff for a while, but now I'm just hooked on Modern Family. Oh, so the scenarios that they

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,840
get into on that show. Which one on that show is the robot? I always forget. The little child,

22
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,600
the child. The child is... Small Wonders 2. Yeah, they had to replace her because her robot batteries

23
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,960
ran out. She died. Really? Yeah, she died from it. Don't you think that Modern Family, if you're

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,040
gonna use a name like that, you gotta have one of the kids as an android. And maybe one's like a

25
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,200
mutant, like a nuclear, you know, kind of thing. Yeah. Oh, and then you call it Nuclear Family.

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,160
There you go. Hey, ABC, you're welcome. Hey, TM. TMC with a circle. This is, of course, an advice

27
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,480
show for the modern era, so let's dip into the questions that we've been sent by you,

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,880
the listening public. This morning I woke up from a fun-filled Friday night and realized I felt like

29
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,240
garbage since I forgot to take care of the ibuprofen before bed and the too-early-in-the-morning trick.

30
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,240
You're welcome, by the way, everybody. So my question is this. When I wake up feeling nauseous

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,880
and a bit dizzy, not that hangover headache style, which, question without a question,

32
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,120
is a splitting headache required for it to be considered a hangover? No. But just feeling

33
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,840
disoriented and poopy, am I still technically drunk? And that's from oh god, I hope I don't

34
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,160
blow a.08, which says to me this caller was drunk driving, which, of course, we do not endorse.

35
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,560
No, because when you wake up in the morning, there's no way you're still drunk. Like,

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,440
if you were still drunk, you wouldn't feel poopy and terrible. You'd feel awesome. You'd feel great.

37
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,640
Yeah, right. Exactly. Exactly. It's fading fast.

38
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,560
I think it's one of those things like a crazy person never, like, if you think you might be

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,240
crazy, you're not crazy. Like, if you have the coherence to go, oh, I feel bad and crappy, maybe

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,840
I'm drunk, then you're not drunk. Yeah, what you have is, it's called a loss of sense of well-being.

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,360
It's one of the symptoms of hangovers, which, no, don't require headaches. It can manifest in

42
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,720
lots of people different ways. Some people get, you know, headaches. Some people get nauseous.

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,400
Some people get cranky. Some people get just really randy. Yeah. Yeah. Some people get like

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,880
horny. Just real horny. Just horned out. The very first time I got drunk on Mountain Dew, Code Red,

45
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,800
and vodka, I woke up the next morning just happy to be alive. Are you fucking kidding me? What?

46
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
That's the first thing you got drunk on was Code Red and vodka? Yeah, that was a fun puke.

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,720
Did you throw some combos into that cocktail? It was spicy tortilla and salsa. What kind of cheesy

48
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
snack cracker were you pounding? You know what's funny about that that time? The very next night,

49
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,640
I ate a pound hamburger at Fuddruckers, and I puked then too. Oh god. I puked two nights in a row,

50
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,120
neither from illness. That weekend is your Everest. How's your lifestyle? Not good? Sounds

51
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,840
pretty bad. Did this person ask for advice and I missed it? No, he's asking the question, is he

52
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,080
still technically drunk? I think what he's asking is, is he capable to function the next morning and

53
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,320
do things like drive to the store and drive home from the party? No. I was watching the Stateline

54
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,600
where they said if you're mega sleepy, if you're the sleepiest, it's the same as being drunk.

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,320
Here's the thing, people. Being drunk isn't the only thing that stops you from being a good driver.

56
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't stress that enough. If you're super tired or meat drunk or you're watching Netflix on your

57
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,680
laptop or pot high, don't drive pot high. I can't stress that enough. No, because you'll get giggles.

58
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,320
Oh yeah. Rely on your pot chauffeur. Always arrange for a pot chauffeur before. Never forget.

59
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:32,320
Giles. Giles, I need you. Giles. Giles, take me to the Taco Bell.

60
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,680
No. I think that what you should plan on is if you pass out at the party,

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,520
general MO should be you wake up in the morning and you watch some kind of bro movie or terrible

62
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,480
movie and have some eggs and just kind of lay on the couch for hours. Eggs are good. They have

63
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,160
selenium in them. Your body is craving that. And also bacon if you got queasy tummy. Can you give

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,560
us a bro movie? Just an example of a bro movie or a bad movie? Hangover. Okay, a little on the nose.

65
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,680
But it's perfect. You can watch Short Circuit. Anything with Steve Guttenberg is going to be

66
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,200
great. Anything with Tim Robbins from the 80s. Guttenberg has plenty of selenium in them and

67
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,000
that's good. That's what your body craves. Your body craves the goot at that point.

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,040
Idiocracy is a great movie to watch when you're hungover. My body craves Guttenberg. Gotta get

69
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,160
the goot. This is Gatorade G3. The first two G's are Gatorade. The third one is Guttenberg.

70
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Can we jump back to the 80s when he was real popular so I can use the phrase get the goot

71
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,200
more? Yeah, get that goot. Get the goot. You guys saw him in Veronica Mars. He was great. He still

72
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,480
got all the old old pizzazz. Oh, his episode of Party Down is one of the funniest things I've ever

73
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,120
seen. He's great. He's a talent. So I guess if you're, I don't know if you were still drunk when

74
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,960
you wrote this email, but if you're still drunk, you have a serious problem. You're a mailman,

75
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:12,160
probably. I mean, I'm pretty sure he was drunk. I'm looking at the, I'm looking at his grammar

76
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,680
here. I'm looking at his, he's got parentheses inside of brackets, inside of those like curly

77
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
brackets. I don't know what those are actually called. There's a lot of things, a lot of things

78
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,480
happening in the typography here. What you can do is if you wake up and you're still drunk,

79
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,440
you can do what my friend Dan did in college, which is decide it's not safe to drive home

80
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,640
and walk home and take a nap under a tree. Hey, that's what trees are for you dummy. Yeah,

81
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,280
they're right there. Shields you from the moonlight. They're like, hey, temporary houses

82
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,920
for drunk people. My girlfriend elves and drunk elf. My girlfriend and I broke up about eight

83
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:54,080
weeks ago. And even though I instigated it, it was still a very tough breakup. I'm feeling better

84
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,000
now. Good. But I'm not quite back to my normal self. Last week, a cute girl gave me her number

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and we'll be going on a date soon. However, I'm feeling nervous about the date. I'm not sure I'm

86
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,520
fully over my ex and ready to go on a date with a new girl. How will I know when I'm ready? And

87
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,240
is there anything wrong with going on a date when I'm not sure I'm ready? That's from ready or

88
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,760
rebounding. I think that's how you, isn't that how you find out? Yeah. Yeah. You've come to the right

89
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,160
place. That's, that is how you find out. Like you can't, you're so inside your own head right now.

90
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,720
I I'm assuming that this was a long relationship that he was in. Um, if he's still having a tough

91
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,840
time with it eight weeks later. At the very least, it sounds like it was important. Yeah. You know,

92
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,720
um, so you may be ready, you may not be ready, but the only way to really tell is to, is to go

93
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,080
on a date and there's nothing wrong with that. Um, you, you should probably be kind of upfront

94
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,240
about the fact that you just got out of a, a long relationship, depending on how comfortable. Yeah.

95
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't like bring it, like, don't, that's not an open, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I should tell

96
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
you. Uh, and then you also don't want to linger on that point. You want to like drop that knowledge

97
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and then move on. Yeah. I wouldn't stress too much about odd date. You know what I mean? Like,

98
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,120
I think you could debate whether or not you're ready to get back into a longterm relationship

99
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,920
or what have you, but you know, it's a date. Just go on it. And you know, when I was, uh,

100
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,280
when I was young, a young man and I, and I still do this to a certain extent. When you're sick,

101
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:27,200
you spend whole days in bed, you know, eating your ramen or your noodles or what have you.

102
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,440
Yeah. And when you think you're starting to feel better, I always used to do, I would call

103
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,080
puttering around, you know, you put on some sweatpants, you just kind of move around the

104
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,120
house a little bit. Get your bearings. If you stay there in bed, even when you're not sick,

105
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,160
you're going to feel like it and loneliness and being single and getting over a breakup is a lot

106
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,840
the same way until you kind of kick that in gear and force your body and mind into that. Like,

107
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,480
like it's not going to happen to you. You've got to bring a little bit of momentum to that,

108
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,240
to that change. And that's a really great analogy because while you're puttering around

109
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,480
in the, the, the, the love sphere, you're going to still be wearing your sweat pants and you're

110
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
not going to be super good at pretty much anything, but you'll, one of these days you'll

111
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
shake off your contagion, you'll shake off the bonds of your plague and you'll leave your house

112
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
and you'll fall in love again. You let the sunshine on your skin, feel the rain on your skin.

113
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,320
Maybe this girl is that big bite of the recovery sandwich that you need to take.

114
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
Right. Yeah. Big chomp of it. Have we used that term on this show before? That term was so

115
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
important to me in my formative years. I don't think we've ever mentioned the recovery sandwich.

116
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,840
How did the recovery, can you, can you explain to me the recovery sandwich a little bit, Griffin?

117
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,480
Uh, I mean, anytime one of us would get hurt by a woman kind, which was frequent, uh, the others

118
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,640
would sort of rally around. I'm pretty sure you incepted the phrase, Justin. And, uh,

119
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
you know what? I actually think my dear friend, Tommy Red, incepted the recovery sandwich. He sent

120
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,160
me the first one, I believe. Um, but you just take a big bite of that recovery sandwich. Just get on,

121
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,760
just get on with it. You got to take measures. Yep. Just take some measures. Don't be afraid.

122
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,880
Don't be afraid. Let love in again. Kiss her. Just, just kiss her on the cheeks. Just propose.

123
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Now I will say the one caveat I will have is that sometimes, uh, in that reboundy phase coming out

124
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,280
of a serious breakup, uh, if it was a long-term serious relationship he came out of, you're going

125
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,840
to want to rush things to get back to that feeling. Yeah. Oh shit. Pump those breaks pocket. Yeah,

126
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,160
please. Cause you're not going to get back to that, you know, spending all day, cuddling in bed,

127
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:42,000
watching movies phase on the first date, you know? Yeah. Just be cool. Low pressure situation. Uh,

128
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,280
just be your awesome self. This is that part of relationship. You got to learn how to be totally

129
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:55,520
cash. Yep. But not sweat pant cash. Yeah. That part of relationship is your reward for doing all

130
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:02,560
this dumb shit for a year or so, but you got to get there. You both got to earn it. Um, and ladies,

131
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,080
by the way, I wanted to make this clear. You too can have your own recovery sandwich. I got,

132
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,920
you probably want to put weirder things on it. Cause I think girls like weirder things on their

133
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,840
sandwiches. Like beans sprouts. Like alfalfa sprouts. Yeah. Oh God. Yes. Like alfalfa sprouts

134
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,600
and avocado. Yucky. This sandwich is gross. But I mean, what would that, for, for, for men,

135
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,880
we're so, man, we're so easy. We're so easy. We're so easy to pin down. Like my recovery

136
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,560
sandwich could literally be a sandwich. I've eaten a sandwich that was so good that it,

137
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
it helped heal my broken heart. He has pulled you right out of the doldrums. Yeah. Just like Paul

138
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,880
Bart fills in the cracks in his heart with pie. Yeah. With a sandwich. Uh, mine is goofy movie.

139
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,520
Yeah. Goofy movies. Great. I mean, for, for guys, it's, you know, going out and meeting

140
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,720
another lady and having a good, good low-pressure cash time with her. Maybe it's something as

141
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,640
simple as buying a whore. Yeah. Maybe go rent a whore from the rent-a-center. Well, rent to own.

142
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,440
And then after a while, if you decide to keep it, it's yours. With no interest. It's wonderful. Hey,

143
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,840
everybody. Travis just casually endorsed slavery. How's your Monday? Pretty good. Griffin, do you

144
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:30,880
have a Yahoo answer to dig us out of this hole? This one was sent in by Emily Bartelt. Thank you,

145
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,520
Emily Bartelt. It's by Yahoo answers user Derek Muller or Mueller who asks,

146
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,520
would you ever date a bounty hunter?

147
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,120
This question is for women. The bounty hunter is a guy. I think we can ignore that. That addendum.

148
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,000
It's tough stuff. Are there female bounty hunters? Oh, I, oh, I hope so. I hope they,

149
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,720
I can still find my dreams. I can actually prove that there aren't. Okay. Cause there's no

150
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,400
series on the discovery channel about him. Fair enough. Yeah. Right. Statistically speaking.

151
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,920
I mean dog, the bounty hunter's wife does so much sort of, um, ancillary work for him. I think she,

152
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,400
she qualifies as a bounty hunter, right? Like she's a fucking tough. I think she's an apprentice

153
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,560
bounty hunter. I don't think she, she's no, I don't like that. I don't like, I don't like,

154
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,400
think of her as less of a bounty hunter just because she's in the Ferris acts. I think that

155
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,200
she is. No, no, no. It's not that. I think she just hasn't started her own franchise yet. Yeah.

156
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,600
The show's not called, you know, Glinda, the bounty hunter or whatever. Exactly. That would

157
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,960
be an awesome show though. You just the bounty hunter. I don't know. I like the idea of that

158
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,080
though. There has to, there has to be one. There has to be one. There has to be one. Yeah. Because

159
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,360
they have so many wilds and they could use those wilds to just entrap and snare a fellow. Oh,

160
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:00,960
they're feminine wilds. Yeah. Yeah. Um, uh, and also like, like, like maybe she's like a super tough

161
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,640
feminine wild woman who collects bounties on heads. Okay.

162
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,440
You know what sucks? You know what job sucks? Tell me. The bounty hunter. You know why?

163
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:22,880
Why? Cause it's, it's so, so glamorous at first, I bet. Like you see Boba, Boba Fett,

164
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,600
you know, like I wanted that life. I want to be that guy, but it's not all Boba Fett,

165
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,520
but it's not all Boba Fett and slave ones, which was the name of his ship and not a second

166
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,240
endorsement of slavery on our show. Uh, it's all about, you know, jet packs and grappling hooks

167
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,800
and blasters. Yeah. You know, under that Mandalorian armor, nine to five, you know,

168
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:57,680
just punching the clock. It's all about, yeah. Um, but I like in the real practice of it,

169
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,440
it's just a lot of paper pushing. It's just a lot of, you know, knocking on doors and sternly talking

170
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,640
to a gentleman. Like, and, and if I've learned anything from dog to bunny hunter, then you offer

171
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,680
him a cigarette and then tell him about Jesus. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, I'm going to take you in,

172
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,240
like you are going to the big house, but you can also go to the big house in the sky. When you,

173
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,240
when I kill you, I have good notes. I have good news for you. Well, the bad news is you're going

174
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,880
to jail. The good news is everlasting life. What's up? The question is though, could you ever date

175
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:40,080
one? Oh no, no. Well, you, what if you committed a crime around them? The bounty. Oh, then it

176
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,160
becomes a Harrison Ford movie. Actually, there's a Gerard Butler, Jennifer Aniston feature. Oh,

177
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,800
gross. Oh no. I pulled that out. Put that away, Griffin. Now what's the name of that hit film?

178
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:01,840
Uh, it's called a bounty for love. No, it's not. It's called it's really creative. Oh,

179
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,760
it was called friends with bounties, friends with bounties. Um, I think it's called the price on

180
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:18,560
your head is love. Can you hold my helmet? It's called slave one. It's actually called the bounty

181
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:27,840
hugger. Yes, we will allow it. Yes. Oh God. Right at the wire. Yeah. Got it in and underneath there.

182
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,480
It's called Jennifer Aniston's done. Everybody wave goodbye to her. She had a good run.

183
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:44,080
It's called the emasculation of Gerard Butler. The movie in movie form. I think I could love

184
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,400
a bounty hunter. You think you could? I think of course you'd love them. It's about the relationship.

185
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,080
You know what I mean? Could you put up with the long hours and the sitting up at nights wondering

186
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,720
if they've hunted their bounty or not? Yeah. I think I would love her so much that none of that

187
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,800
other stuff would matter. You know, Griffin, I want to say that normally there's a comedy show,

188
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:12,080
but you've really inspired me today. I want to thank you for that to become a bounty hunter.

189
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,800
You'd be great at it, Justin. You would be phenomenal. You would be. You are insatiable.

190
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,600
You would just tenacious. Yeah. Yeah. You're unswerving. Once you have a mark, you just

191
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,680
chase them down until you get your prize and you send them to heaven. Like when I get my mind's

192
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:36,160
head on something, I can't be stopped. Yeah. Yeah. And you look damn fine in a bulletproof vest. Like

193
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,400
for instance, right now I really need to use the bathroom and even though we're recording a show,

194
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,240
I'm just going to put my headphones on my mic and go do it and then come right back.

195
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,600
See? No big deal. Unswerving.

196
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,520
Justin? No, he's, he's for real using the bathroom. He's really gone, huh?

197
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:04,160
Uh, so here's another question. Hey brothers, my friend won't stop spitting. He'll do it wherever

198
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,600
me and my other friends go and it's an extremely annoying and disgusting habit. So I was wondering,

199
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,000
is there any way to stop the spit for good? And that's from Adrian.

200
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:25,120
I need to talk to everybody. If you, okay, listen, I want to address a specific branch of spitting,

201
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,960
even though I don't know this is what they're specifically talking about, but it is in the

202
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,920
family. I don't endorse the use of any tobacco products except the ones that I myself use.

203
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:44,320
Mm hmm. Snus. Snuff and pipe. No, no, no. I'm sorry. Snus. Snus? Snus. Hey, everybody stop

204
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,920
dipping. Oh my God. It's the grossest thing. It's the worst thing that ever happened to anybody

205
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,800
when they see you do it. Everybody wants to die and they hate you for doing it. Please stop it.

206
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,440
Sometimes I like to picture like the smartest people in the world, great philosophers and great

207
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,240
scientists, like in the middle of a speech, just reaching down and grabbing their empty Coke bottle

208
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,960
and like just letting some brown spittle dribble out of their mouths. Do you know what a fucking

209
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,560
monster you look like? I'm not joking with you right now. Stop it. There's my anti-dipping

210
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:23,600
message for the, ugh. If you're going to do it, practice, practice safe chawing. If you're going

211
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,400
to chaw, if you're going to scowl it, like at least be safe and smart about it. I worked in

212
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:35,120
a movie theater for a while and where, where I was, uh, I was a, uh, not a nusher. What's the,

213
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
who are the dudes who like cleaned out? I was one of the dudes who like cleaned the theater out

214
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,240
afterwards. And you were a janitor. I was a janitor basically. Um, but like a custodian,

215
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,120
I was a custodian for the movie theater and I would go in after John Cena's the Marine. I would

216
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,000
go in after that showing. And, uh, this was, this was deep in the heart of West Virginia and there

217
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:04,960
would be cups, just like those Dixie cups and people would just have them sitting on the floor

218
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,800
and I would come up like sweeping like, oh, let me get this half drunk Dixie cup of Coke out.

219
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:18,880
Oh no. It's human expectorate. It's fucking, it's, it came from your mouth after you swashed

220
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,920
it around with chaw and scowl. You're fucking gross. Like put the, you couldn't pick that up

221
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
and throw it in the garbage can. You couldn't because you don't want people to see you carrying

222
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,400
around a cup of your own spit. Your own warm human spit. Your own warmth. That came from your body

223
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,240
dog. Like I don't come to your house and like fucking jerk off in a, in a, some sort of container

224
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,040
and just like, I'm going to leave this on the floor. We cool. We are not cool. Everyone who

225
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:51,280
has ever made the argument that smoking looks cool. It's like a million times the opposite

226
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,000
for, for dipping. Like I don't understand the appeal of it. There is no appeal. I would rather

227
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,280
eat a cigar. I'd rather feed a cigar to a baby than have anyone ever dip again. But I think this

228
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,000
person is talking about spit. Just like normal spit. You look when you have it in your lip, even

229
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,680
you look like, you look like you have a tumor. You look like you have a tumor in your face.

230
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,400
You started eating a grape and then you stopped. You just gave up on it. And you said, I'll say

231
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,800
this later. This is mine now. You look like a fucking hamster, only a gross hamster with brown

232
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:30,160
lips. Go home. Okay. So, but spitting. Here's the thing. I don't even understand why someone would,

233
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,400
I, as much as I don't understand dipping and spitting, why would a human being just spit

234
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,040
for no reason? Like what is stopping them from holding their saliva in their mouth?

235
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,440
Just swallow it. Like we're all walking around swallowing it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's set some

236
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,800
ground rules. Cause we're in some pretty gross territory in this question. I don't want to tread.

237
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,960
Don't say that. No, you do it every day. You just don't think about it. Just regulate your own,

238
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,320
just regulate your fluids without like, without showing him that just don't let things that are

239
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,040
in your body out of your body. Can that be a rule? Just like, I don't want to see, I don't get to

240
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,080
watch. And by get, I mean, have, I don't have to watch you pee or make bathroom. Like I don't have

241
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,560
to make you watch you make bathroom or, or you don't have to watch you pee.

242
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:22,000
It's a privilege not a right. Yeah. I am not forced to watch you make jerksies, but like,

243
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't see anything. If you have a fluid in your body, fucking leave it there. Don't spit in front

244
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,400
of me. Don't pee or, or two in front of me. Don't, don't cry in front of me either. I don't even want

245
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:40,400
to see you sweat. Okay. But hold on guys. I'm going to turn it around. Unless you're rocking the mic.

246
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:49,520
I want to turn it around. Okay. I want to bring back spittoons. Oh no, even worse. That's not

247
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:56,480
science's grossest invention. I think is the spittoon. Cause it gives you an outlet, a receptacle.

248
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:05,520
Yeah. A community hodgepodge of human spit, a hodge, a miasma of, of human fluid that is mixed

249
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,680
together like a broth, like a rolling broth. It would make daring people to drink stuff more

250
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,200
convenient. Yeah. Cause a lot of times you can just go to the spittoon. A lot of times I want

251
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,000
to dare someone to drink something and I don't have anything really good there. And if I try to

252
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,480
do something weird, Pepsi's probably already made a soda based on it. Like there's not a lot of

253
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,320
options anymore. People like so many weird things. Can we, can we, let's, let's build off of this.

254
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,960
Can we make a private spittoon? Like a secret spittoon? If you do absolutely need to spit.

255
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,840
You mean like a mask? Like, like it hangs on your face?

256
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,280
No. Cause I don't, then people would still have to see it. I'm talking about like a flask,

257
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,720
like a secret flask that you spit into very discreetly. Even that's going to be kind of

258
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,440
gross though. I was thinking more like a gas mask where it was like a full face thing.

259
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,280
And so then the receptacle is right below your mouth and no one could see it or you.

260
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,800
That would be pretty good. What about like a, well, you know how we have, you know,

261
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,200
you have a St. Bernard with the barrel of hot cocoa, um, on, around his neck. You could just

262
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,560
have something like that, but it would be a spittoon. Like a cask, like a spit pendant?

263
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,920
Are you saying like a dog that follows you around and you spit on the dog?

264
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,480
Has anybody ever seen a dog? No! What? What? No!

265
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Like my spittle, St. Bernard, spit, spit, spit. That's the saddest dog life.

266
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,200
Your dog looks really sad. All the time. Really sad and moist.

267
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,920
Yeah. I spit on my dog all the time.

268
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Um, it's a living. It's a living though.

269
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:46,080
It's like you're spitting on your dog. Tell your friend to stop spitting on their dog.

270
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
And every time they spit, I want them to imagine a St. Bernard's there,

271
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,880
you know, with the cask and what all. Like they're spitting on him.

272
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,200
Um, just remember Jesus is all around us. So every time you spit, you're spitting on him,

273
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,320
technically. Yep.

274
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,040
And if you believe your grandparents are all around us watching you,

275
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,560
after they pass away, you're spitting on everyone's dead grandparents.

276
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,120
Oh, wouldn't that be dope if you spit and like it just sort of hung in the air and you're like,

277
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,240
what? They'd be like, oh, you spit on grandpa. He's like, you found me.

278
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Darn you kids. I was going to watch the Marine with you.

279
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,320
But now I'm caught and have to go to hell. Um, listen, let's move on.

280
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,760
Yep.

281
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,800
Don't fucking spit. What you do is if your friend spits, you go to where you go and you

282
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,240
pick up his leavings and you rub it on his nose and you say no.

283
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,400
I think it's a justifiable experience. I think it's justifiable to just smack him in the face.

284
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Every time he does, it's just so uncalled for to just spit on the ground wherever you happen to be.

285
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,560
When he does it, you smack him just like every time. I guarantee that will stop so fast.

286
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,760
Push his nose into his leavings. That's the only thing you can do.

287
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,120
No, no, no.

288
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,520
Shake the no-no can at him also.

289
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,080
Yeah.

290
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,440
Um, well, I don't have a good transition for this, but money's out.

291
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,160
Hey, Joe Willans called us.

292
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,920
He wanted us to wish his friend James Bannon a very, very happy birthday.

293
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,160
Hey.

294
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,600
Yeah.

295
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Hey, Jim, James.

296
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,480
I'll go with James. James studied math and English lit at Swarthmore College.

297
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
Plays guitar.

298
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,240
It's Big 21, and he's the one who got Joe into our show.

299
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
So thanks, James, for spreading the word.

300
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Can we suggest Joe a kickoff drink into this new world that he's entering into?

301
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,000
And Justin, if you say Code Red and Vodka, I am going to quit the show.

302
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,280
Okay.

303
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,760
Well, let me suggest maybe Mountain Dew and a little bit of grenadine and vodka.

304
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,800
Yeah. Okay, what you just described is some sort of home-brewed Code Red.

305
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,360
Your own blend.

306
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,840
You're talking about DIY nerd beverages.

307
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,040
Yeah, DIY, your own blend.

308
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,680
I actually just invented a new drink that I would suggest called the Southern Gentleman.

309
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,440
No, it's delicious.

310
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,520
It's a Bombay Sapphire Gin and a sweet tea and a little bit of lemon.

311
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,040
Oh, I've had one of those.

312
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,480
You mean a Frat House Blackout?

313
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
No, it's delicious and it goes down smooth,

314
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,920
and you drink it on your back porch while you appreciate having land.

315
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,400
When do you put mustard and salt and cheese on it and jalapenos?

316
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,360
That's the third one.

317
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
And then you pour the drink on a bagel and you just party down.

318
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,680
Yep.

319
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
And I puke on you.

320
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,200
By the way, the one time it's permissible to spit is when Travis makes you some food

321
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,560
and feeds it to you.

322
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,640
When you take a bite of Travis's lunch, you will biologically need to spit that out.

323
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,640
I imagine the sandwiches I make are like the sweet embrace of death,

324
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,600
where you're just so happy to go, but you know it's the end.

325
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,520
What's the opposite of a recovery sandwich?

326
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,400
The punishment sandwich.

327
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,680
A de-habilitation sandwich is what Travis crashed.

328
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,280
I feel lonelier.

329
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,080
I feel lonelier from reading this.

330
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,160
This is a backwards concoction I made.

331
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,320
So thank you to Joe.

332
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,960
So if you'd like to wish someone a happy birthday or promote your business or what have you,

333
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,000
get in touch with us.

334
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,840
It's maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron.

335
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,360
Get an ad of your very own.

336
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,960
Hey, how about Yahoo?

337
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,460
What?

338
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,680
Oh yeah, that would go down smooth.

339
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,720
This one was sent in by Brussels Sprout.

340
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,800
Probably not a real Christian name, but we'll roll with it.

341
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,680
Thank you, Brussels Sprout.

342
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

343
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,400
Here, mycollegefund1988 asks,

344
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
can I sneak my cat on a plane?

345
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,320
She is a kitten, about a month old,

346
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,880
and I was thinking of putting her in my pocket while I went through security.

347
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,080
My pocket is loose, and since she'll be on me,

348
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,680
she won't be on my stuff that's being x-rayed.

349
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,240
All I have to do is walk through a metal detector.

350
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,000
Do you think this is possible?

351
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,400
What the fuck?

352
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,520
What the fuck?

353
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,400
What the fuck?

354
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,120
What life are you living?

355
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,520
How much do you love that kitty?

356
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,920
How much do you simultaneously love-hate your cat

357
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
that you want it to be with you,

358
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
but you also want it in your pocket for x hours?

359
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Yeah.

360
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,680
Oh god.

361
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,680
This is like a baby with a cup full of bleach.

362
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,760
I just want to smack it away from it and be like,

363
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,440
no, you can't have that cat.

364
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,880
Don't you see the Mr. Yuck sticker?

365
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,400
You will die.

366
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,960
Oh god.

367
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,120
Oh, Jesus.

368
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
So how can we make this happen?

369
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,240
How can we-

370
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
Clearly, it's the cat hat.

371
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,880
It's a big cowboy hat, and the cat sits underneath the hat.

372
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Yeah.

373
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm pretty sure you have to take those off.

374
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,360
I like that.

375
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,280
Let's take it off.

376
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:03,840
As charming as that would be-

377
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,640
No, you tell him it's-

378
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Sir, you have to take off that 10 gallon hat.

379
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,320
Well, first of all, it's illegal.

380
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,280
Second of all, it's ridiculous.

381
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,400
Tell him it's prescription.

382
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,880
And you say, sure thing, madam, and you take it off,

383
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,040
and your cat is standing perfectly on your head.

384
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,540
Oh.

385
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,860
No, the cat's doing that thing where it's holding its arms

386
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,700
and legs up against the sides of the hat,

387
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,220
and keeping itself inside the hat.

388
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,740
And it's like, well, this looks okay.

389
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,580
And you put the hat back on, and that's how the cat-

390
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,540
And it has its own smaller cowboy hat on it.

391
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,300
Yee-haw.

392
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,060
I'm not even helping anymore,

393
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,060
but I'm just making beautiful tableaus.

394
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,060
These tableaus are pretty beautiful.

395
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:42,660
There is, of course, a pretty obvious problem with this plan

396
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,100
that we're not making.

397
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,300
Problem with this plan that we're not dealing with here,

398
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,220
and that's cats have metal skeletons.

399
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,340
You see a cat jump off of something high,

400
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,380
you don't hear the snapping of bones,

401
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,540
you hear the clanging of metal on metal.

402
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,620
That's how they're able to survive falls from great distances,

403
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,940
is cats have metal skeletons.

404
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,340
You're gonna have to get those bones out of that cat.

405
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:12,820
Can you put the cat's bones in your checked luggage?

406
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,620
Mm-hmm.

407
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,060
Oh, who are we fucking kidding?

408
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,580
This guy's not gonna get a cat carrier,

409
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,100
but he's gonna spring the checker bag.

410
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,380
No, he's going full carry-on.

411
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:19,860
But the problem is-

412
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,900
Let me suggest-

413
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,820
It's not the transporting the cat.

414
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,940
He cannot go.

415
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,340
He is flying from fucking Denver to Seattle,

416
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,940
and he needs to have that cat with him

417
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,980
for that three-hour journey.

418
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah.

419
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,580
Okay, I've got it.

420
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,500
Tell the airline it's a service animal.

421
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,020
Okay, how can we do this?

422
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,740
What is this cat doing?

423
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,020
This is my service kitten.

424
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:42,260
I- I have a severe nuzzle deficiency.

425
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,260
And sometimes I need to get snuggled out mid-flight.

426
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,500
Is anybody on this plane capable of snuggling?

427
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,700
Is there a snuggler on the plane?

428
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
This man took the bones out of his cat.

429
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,780
It is no longer capable of anything.

430
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,620
It is a cat bag.

431
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,580
Boy, how- how much is he going to regret-

432
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,540
regret wearing his My Kitty's the Bomb t-shirt?

433
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,340
Oh, no.

434
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,620
Why did you even pick that one?

435
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,220
That's going to make for some awkward conversation with the- with the guy.

436
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,180
And cats are weapons, by the way.

437
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:18,740
Duh.

438
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,220
Yeah.

439
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,220
I feel like this person isn't really thinking through the end game of this question.

440
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,020
Like-

441
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,380
Oh, you mean a cat funeral?

442
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,820
For your baby kitten?

443
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,940
Because you had it in your pocket?

444
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:32,100
And its brains exploded when the cabin was pressurized?

445
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,420
Yeah.

446
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,300
Oh, God.

447
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,740
I hate this person.

448
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:36,980
Like-

449
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,700
I hate him, too.

450
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,700
What if your pilot is allergic to cats?

451
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,340
Didn't think about that one, did you?

452
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,860
What are you going to do when- when mewing starts coming from your pockets?

453
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,220
What are you going to do?

454
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,860
He's going to know.

455
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,860
Although it does make for the cutest sequel to Snakes on a Plane.

456
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,100
Yeah.

457
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,260
Single kitten on a plane?

458
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,660
I gotta get this motherfucking adorable ass kitten off this motherfucking plane.

459
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,020
I need to get this fucking adorable single kitten.

460
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,620
Just the one.

461
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,500
Just the one salt-and-pepper fur.

462
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,340
This sweet, precious tabby pussy.

463
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,420
Get him off the plane.

464
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,380
Open that door.

465
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,980
Ladies and gentlemen, Cobra Starship.

466
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,460
Play us out.

467
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:25,380
Can you- can you- can you drug-mule this cat?

468
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,340
Are you saying put the cat up your butt?

469
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:30,900
No.

470
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:37,860
Can you put the cat in a shampoo bottle in your butt?

471
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,820
Is that what you're saying?

472
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,540
I- it doesn't have to- you guys are not- you guys are not aware of the recent developments

473
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,380
in drug-mule technology.

474
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,460
Oh, okay, put the cat in your urethra.

475
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,580
Yeah, put it right in your wiener.

476
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,140
Oh, oh, oh, it's in my- oh, the picture!

477
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,460
Oh, the picture's in there.

478
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,180
Just do like I do at the buffet and put it in a sandwich bag.

479
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,660
And in your cargo pants.

480
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,100
And put it in your cargo pants.

481
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,780
That's what cargo pants are for.

482
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,740
Is this a tiny kitty?

483
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,780
Can you keep them in your mouth?

484
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,700
Sir, you're being very quiet.

485
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,300
Sir, can I get you anything to drink?

486
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:13,700
Milk.

487
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,620
Cat formula.

488
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,420
And sardines.

489
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,700
Sardines, if you have them.

490
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,380
What about buying him an extra ticket and then dressing him like a tiny human being?

491
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,380
Ah, I love it.

492
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,420
This is gonna be great.

493
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,700
Especially if it's a Garfield.

494
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,700
Especially if it's a bipedal cat.

495
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,700
With human features.

496
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,140
Oh, and he's wearing a tiny suit and you make him look like a foreigner.

497
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,380
And that's why he doesn't speak any English and you translate for him.

498
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:43,700
Okay.

499
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:44,660
Okay.

500
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,100
I think that this person doesn't want to buy an extra ticket

501
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,780
because they could probably just put the goddamn cat in a box and buy it a ticket.

502
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,420
Yeah.

503
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,740
Right?

504
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,580
Isn't that the way these things work?

505
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,060
Cats are- cats are so low maintenance you could just fucking FedEx them to your- to your final

506
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,780
destination.

507
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,580
Just do what the cat wants and let it go.

508
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,980
Just open your front door and let the cat be free.

509
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,500
That's what the cat wants to do.

510
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,780
If he loves you, he will find you at your final destination.

511
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,060
Fucking homeward bound style.

512
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,660
Fuck yes.

513
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,500
That would be way harder.

514
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,540
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

515
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,300
Why are you even flying with the cat?

516
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,300
Just homeward bound it.

517
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,140
It's gonna be- it'll leave the door open, it will homeward bound it to you.

518
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,580
Let it get- And then on your return trip, it'll homeward bound back.

519
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,300
Let him get a real good whiff of your musk and then just let him trace you through the sky.

520
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:34,740
Yeah.

521
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,060
Just pray to God he doesn't Milo and Otis it.

522
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,620
Oh no.

523
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,460
Oh no.

524
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,020
That's a bad scene.

525
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,260
You really don't want this cat to Marley and me it.

526
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,060
Air Bud would be cool though.

527
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,300
Let your cat play some sports.

528
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:55,460
Hey, what are a few not incredibly obvious ways of finding out if a girl you like has a boyfriend

529
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:55,960
or not?

530
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,220
I'm currently in university and don't really know how to bring up that topic without the girl

531
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,820
realizing that I'm into her.

532
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,980
That's from Con Fuzzled in Cincinnati.

533
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,980
You goofster.

534
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,060
Why- I have a theory.

535
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:10,900
Let's hear it.

536
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:17,860
That I would like you guys to- to refute or agree with and that is that if the girl has a boyfriend

537
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:24,180
and she is not into you, she will mention it awkwardly like in the first four sentences.

538
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,540
Am I wrong?

539
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,460
But she'll be like, talk, talk, talk.

540
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,100
Well, I guess I better go meet my boyfriend.

541
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,620
No, no, I don't think that.

542
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,780
Well, it depends on what kind of girl are we talking about?

543
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,740
Because if she's- if she's the kind of person who thinks that everybody is into them,

544
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,500
then first off, you shouldn't be- you shouldn't be pursuing her.

545
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,420
Because that's not an attractive trait.

546
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,100
I don't know.

547
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,300
That seems like it would put like more people off than it would-

548
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,020
I don't know, Trav.

549
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,980
I don't think that's true.

550
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,860
I have a really- I have a really cool move.

551
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,360
Okay.

552
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,740
Ask her out.

553
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,940
Yeah, that's- you gotta- why are you afraid of letting her realize that you're into her?

554
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,340
Like that's-

555
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,860
Can I- can I make a metaphor here?

556
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,740
Like- but that's like rather than asking someone if they're allergic to peanuts,

557
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
just shoving some peanuts in their face.

558
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,020
No, it's not like that.

559
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,220
It's like asking them out.

560
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,540
And then think about this move, okay?

561
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,180
You ask her out.

562
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
She says, yes, you're on a date, get married, have kids.

563
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,060
It's wonderful.

564
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,620
You ask her out.

565
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,420
She has a boyfriend.

566
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,660
Yeah, later.

567
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,700
No, you ask her out.

568
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,820
She says, I got a boyfriend.

569
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,700
You look her dead in the eye and you say, the question stands.

570
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,260
Oh my god.

571
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,220
Oh, that is kind of badass.

572
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,580
How smooth would that be?

573
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,220
That is pretty awesome.

574
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,660
You won't sell it.

575
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,300
No, no, no.

576
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,420
I'm reading your question.

577
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:44,820
You're not-

578
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Yeah, it's not going to work for you.

579
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,180
And then she'll be like, okay.

580
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,380
And you'll be like, oh, I can't.

581
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,740
I can't be party to cheating.

582
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,780
And then you walk away.

583
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,380
How's your double power play?

584
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,140
Oh, you just convinced her to sin and then threw the sin back in her face.

585
00:39:59,140 --> 00:39:59,700
That move is going to be so-

586
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,180
You're going to be alone tonight, but it's a moral victory.

587
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,220
Move is going to be so dope.

588
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,380
You're going to need a hype man to like walk behind you like, what, what, what?

589
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:15,540
Get parts, pick up your face.

590
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,420
Have you guys ever been in a conversation with a member of the opposite sex and they

591
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,540
will work into the conversation that they have a boyfriend or a girlfriend, I guess,

592
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:31,140
if you were a girl and you know that they're saying that so you won't ask them out, but

593
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,820
you weren't that interested in the first place.

594
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,380
Yeah.

595
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,100
You guys ever had that?

596
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,660
I love that.

597
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,700
But then I get, I get affronted at that point.

598
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,020
It's like-

599
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,020
I wasn't going to, but now I can't.

600
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,100
Well, now I'm just mad.

601
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:47,060
And then I ask them out, like, I'm like, uh, so do you want to get coffee?

602
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,780
And they're like, I just mentioned I had a boyfriend.

603
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,740
I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,140
I get that.

605
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:51,540
I get that.

606
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,620
So you like a movie or dinner?

607
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,500
Do you know what is fucking horse apples?

608
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:05,540
Do you know what is fucking horse apples is that we had to deal with that shit.

609
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,260
Like me, probably all the way up through high school.

610
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:15,380
But now that Facebook's up and it's like, you know who is fucking who and who's kissing

611
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,620
and who's necking who's smooching.

612
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:20,340
Like there's not a questioning.

613
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,940
It's so unambiguous.

614
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,020
Everybody knows what is up with everybody else's business.

615
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:27,300
Unless, unless it's complicated.

616
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,940
We've already talked about that before.

617
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,780
That just means that they're, they're, they're still fucking, but they want that drama.

618
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,820
They love that drama.

619
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:36,100
Yeah.

620
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,860
Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.

621
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,060
This is not a problem anymore.

622
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,420
I think this guy's telling tales.

623
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:43,860
Okay.

624
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,100
So you think get on Facebook, check her status.

625
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:46,260
Yeah.

626
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,300
Here's an easy way to do it.

627
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,220
Get on Facebook and check the part where it says whether or not she's dating anybody.

628
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,900
And if it says she doesn't, then you ask her out and she says she is.

629
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,460
And so you should be like, well, you should update your Facebook better.

630
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,900
And you turn and walk away.

631
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,980
And I'm going to throw this out.

632
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:06,260
If you don't know if she has a boyfriend or not, which is like a pretty serious thing.

633
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,660
You don't know her well enough to say that you like her.

634
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,460
Well, I don't think that's true.

635
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,180
I do.

636
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:17,220
It only takes a moment.

637
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:25,620
But I think it's the parlor if he said a girl I'm attracted to, but not a girl that he likes.

638
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,500
Like, he doesn't know.

639
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,780
He's not into her.

640
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,820
He's attracted to her.

641
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,180
This bitch can't get on Facebook and you think that you're going to fix his vocab.

642
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,700
Like, come on, cut him some slack.

643
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,820
He's trying to get his shit together.

644
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:38,580
Fair enough.

645
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,100
Hey, listen, I'm sorry Confuzzled.

646
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,980
I'm sorry about that.

647
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,420
I'm sorry things got heated in here.

648
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,500
Just get on Facebook.

649
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,540
Tweet at her.

650
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,260
Tweet at her and find out her status, her Twitter status.

651
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,900
Get on Facebook.

652
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,060
Look at every picture of her that's ever been taken and look for fucking common dudes.

653
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,380
Like a dude who, a repeated dude.

654
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,900
Like, oh, that dude's in a lot of pictures.

655
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,780
They're probably-

656
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,020
Which is also my favorite mathematic principle.

657
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,780
Yeah, the lowest common dude.

658
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,820
The repeating dude.

659
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,060
Yeah.

660
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,180
You know, you can also say, hey, my girlfriend and I want to know if you and your boyfriend

661
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,220
want to go on a double date.

662
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,420
And then when she says you don't have a boyfriend, say, I made mine up too.

663
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,220
Let's go out.

664
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,740
We have so much in common.

665
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,260
This is- I'm going to go.

666
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,140
My girlfriend and I want to know if you want to come to a couple's ministry with me and

667
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:32,260
her because she's real and you and your boyfriend.

668
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,100
Oh, and then it becomes an Adam Sandler movie.

669
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,220
Yeah, then you have to pay somebody.

670
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,220
But you already own a whore, right Travis?

671
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:39,540
Yep.

672
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,980
What's- hey, perfect.

673
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,820
Well, I'm still paying it off.

674
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,380
Yeah, right.

675
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,580
Yeah, I'm a senior in college and this semester I've nabbed one of the much coveted single

676
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,080
rooms.

677
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,820
Issue is, this is my first time in my life I've ever lived alone.

678
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,140
I'm five days in and I can already feel my mental health slipping away.

679
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,100
Any tips on surviving the lonely times?

680
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,060
That's from Nick.

681
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,100
I've got a great tip.

682
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,980
Go find a roommate before you hang yourself.

683
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,900
I've never tried this.

684
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,900
I don't know how well I would adjust to it.

685
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,180
This is not a joke.

686
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:19,300
I did it for about three months and it was so miserable that one of my friends moved

687
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,100
in with me.

688
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,220
I did it for about three months and lost my mind to the point where I was just walking

689
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,660
around talking to myself out loud all the time.

690
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,620
Your best bet is gonna be- and like I have some experience with this.

691
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:38,500
I don't live alone, but like I work at my house and pretty much all my, you know, day

692
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,540
to day is like here.

693
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,220
You know, day to day is like here.

694
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,820
I find that you got to get out as much as humanly possible.

695
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,660
Like go to Starbucks.

696
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,420
Don't sit at home and watch a movie.

697
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,700
Like go to the theater.

698
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,060
Like just be around people.

699
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:55,700
But my folly.

700
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,300
I mean, we're not reinventing the wheel here.

701
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,260
You ever see old men by themselves and they look happy?

702
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,180
No, they don't.

703
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:02,900
They're alone.

704
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,940
They're lonely.

705
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,700
Like when you live alone, you get lonely.

706
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,900
That's that's sort of like the operative word there.

707
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,020
Yep. Yeah, right.

708
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,460
I feel that living alone is like one of those like for me it's like going to the pool where

709
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:19,540
it seems like such a good idea and then you do it and like five minutes in you're like,

710
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,060
oh, yeah, this is boring.

711
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,260
Oh, oh, I don't know why I was so excited about this in the first place.

712
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:24,980
Quick anecdote.

713
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,900
Have you guys ever gone to the pool by yourself?

714
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,060
It is super hard to do that and not feel like a total pedophile.

715
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:34,980
Oh, yeah.

716
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,860
I think if you're alone at a pool, I think people are looking at you like, oh, that's

717
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,620
a there's a pedophile confirmed.

718
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,060
You know, I feel the same way about going to magic quest by myself.

719
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:48,900
Well, yeah, that that probably is a little more sustainable.

720
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,940
I think that's a supportable theory there.

721
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:01,220
Here's the here's this was my folly is that by going out by leaving your house, a good

722
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:08,580
substitution for that is not going out into the magical world of Azeroth to go on and

723
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,900
online adventures with your with your e-buddies.

724
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:18,500
That is not that was not a good substitution, not a good supplement for the real deal.

725
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:18,740
Right.

726
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,180
So don't do that.

727
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:20,900
This is key.

728
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,580
Don't do that.

729
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,460
This is so lose yourself in the world of computer games.

730
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,460
You got to leave the house.

731
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,900
You got to take up a hobby.

732
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,660
You got to find a roommate.

733
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,540
Go quick.

734
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,100
Yep.

735
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,740
Quick before the semester is it gets too deep in.

736
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:35,940
Stop and stop.

737
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,780
What happened to me in that three months I live by myself is I was constantly contacting

738
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:42,500
everyone I knew.

739
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,700
Be like, do you guys want to come over?

740
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:44,820
I can come over there.

741
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,900
We go grab some pizza, get a beer, whatever.

742
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,060
And eventually I burned out everyone.

743
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,820
Do you want to come here?

744
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,420
Just come sit with me, please.

745
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,220
Just sit here.

746
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,380
Be another living person in the same 10 feet square as me, please.

747
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,380
Travis, are you trying to hold my hand right now?

748
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,580
When, uh, when you guys are done swimming, you kids want to come by.

749
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,100
I got some like cheese balls.

750
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,300
We could watch a movie or whatever.

751
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,180
See what's on TBS.

752
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,500
Got some code red Mountain Dew.

753
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,780
Just see what happens.

754
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,740
It's a Mountain Dew ingredient.

755
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:11,380
Just make your own.

756
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,100
It's no big deal.

757
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,140
You know what you should do, actually?

758
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,420
What?

759
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,340
Just get super lonely this year.

760
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:22,020
Just take it always seem to go that you don't know what you got till it's gone.

761
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,660
Here's the problem.

762
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,660
The only problem is it is your senior year of college and you're supposed to be making

763
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,420
memories and stuff doing all that shit.

764
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,220
But, um, so it's unfortunate that these two stars have aligned in this manner, but you

765
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,340
gotta have a lonely year.

766
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,060
I think we all have a lonely year and that that lonely year is so important to your,

767
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:43,300
to your formation as a human being, as a man.

768
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,700
Do you know who I bet has a lot of strong memories?

769
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,100
Who's that?

770
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,060
Uh, Tom Hanks character in Castaway.

771
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,620
Yeah, sure.

772
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:55,300
Tom Hanks character in Castaway knows exactly who Tom Hanks character in Castaway is, even

773
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,340
though we cannot recall his name.

774
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,380
It's Wilson.

775
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,020
Yeah.

776
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,540
That was yes.

777
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,820
Wilson and Wilson Jr.

778
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,380
I think that the two main characters of that movie.

779
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:11,380
God, that movie would have been so much better if he thought the volleyball was his son.

780
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,580
Is it too early to do a remake of that movie?

781
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:16,980
Nope.

782
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,100
Where he thinks that his son starred in Jonah Hill.

783
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:22,820
How does she convince me to come to this movie?

784
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:23,780
This is terrible.

785
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:26,740
Oh, get lonely, Nick.

786
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,780
Really live in it.

787
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,060
Just live in that loneliness.

788
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,620
It'll get better.

789
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,100
Wallow.

790
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
Just have a lonely year.

791
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,700
Have a lonely year, even though both of my brothers just said they managed the last three

792
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,200
months.

793
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,140
You gotta push yourself.

794
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,980
Push yourself to the brink.

795
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,300
Do as we do, not as we something.

796
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:43,860
I don't know.

797
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,220
Yeah, something along those lines.

798
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,980
Griffin.

799
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:47,940
I have a Yahoo for us.

800
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,780
Who better?

801
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,620
This one was sent in by Alex Siegler.

802
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,140
It's by, oh, thank you, Alex.

803
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,700
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Crest, who asks, is it okay for guys to skinny dip together?

804
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:04,580
My friends and I are about to go swim, and we were curious if it was weird if we all

805
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:05,460
went skinny dipping.

806
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,460
It's from four weeks ago, so hopefully they found the answer by now.

807
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,700
I'll tell you what's weirder is like having a discussion like, so you guys ready to skinny

808
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,340
dip or what?

809
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,700
And one person going, well, let's ask the internet first.

810
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,200
Yeah.

811
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,100
That's what's not okay.

812
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:31,060
Okay, if you're a bunch of gay friends and you want to just go feast your eyes on some

813
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:36,580
man candy and you're young, all fit, virile, I say go for it.

814
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,060
Oh, fuck yeah.

815
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,660
That sounds pretty great.

816
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,700
That's not the question.

817
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:40,900
Of course that's okay.

818
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,580
What are you even doing on the internet?

819
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,380
Just go for it.

820
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,340
They're gonna leave.

821
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,780
They're all piled into one car.

822
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,100
And it smells amazing.

823
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,540
Like, they're all going to the skinny dip.

824
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,740
What is that smell?

825
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:57,700
I don't think you pile into the car naked and arrive naked and get in the water naked

826
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,100
and get out of the water naked and get back in the car naked and drive home naked.

827
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,740
You guys want to go skinny driving?

828
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:08,500
All the world's most tasteful colognes and just that smell melding into like one gay

829
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,220
ambrosia.

830
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,100
Like, yeah, I think you should probably get off Yahoo Answers and go-

831
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:14,660
Can we say man-brosia?

832
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,500
Man-brosia.

833
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:24,740
But like, okay, I'm assuming by okay, this writer, this question asker, does not mean

834
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:32,020
is it cool for me and all my other gay male friends to have a crazy bacchanal.

835
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,500
This question is almost a little offensive because he's asking if it fits into sort of

836
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,740
the heterosexual social norms.

837
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,140
Is it okay-

838
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,740
It doesn't fit into any social norms.

839
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:45,060
Is it okay for a bunch of heterosexual friends to get naked and get in a lake together?

840
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,420
And the answer is yes, yes, a thousand times yes.

841
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,700
This is my question because I might be missing something here.

842
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,780
I'm under the impression that skinny dipping serves two and only two purposes.

843
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:00,180
One is nobody has a swimsuit, but we all want to swim.

844
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:00,420
Yeah.

845
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:01,860
Right?

846
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,460
Second is we want it to lead to some sexy times.

847
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,420
Is that it?

848
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,260
I mean, this is the thing about- No, I think it has to do with perspective.

849
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:15,620
I think if you're a woman, then you skinny dip because it's something wild.

850
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,340
Like you're living this Natasha Bedingfield song.

851
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,580
Like you are, you know what I mean?

852
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:26,260
But for guys, when guys skinny dip, it is so they can see some juggums.

853
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:26,980
That's right.

854
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,340
Like that's just how guys, that's how the sexes are different.

855
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,700
Like no guy gets in a pool naked with a bunch of his other friends.

856
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:34,740
Like this is so wild.

857
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:35,780
I can't believe we're doing this.

858
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,100
Yeah, the balls are out and everything.

859
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:47,300
And Justin, Travis, there is no freedom more free than just feeling cool, cool lake water

860
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,380
right on your, whatchamacallit, like right on it.

861
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:52,580
Like no mesh.

862
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:58,180
I am willing to bet that out of these, what, 13 guys, like they said, hey, we're going to

863
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,140
go swimming and like, well, let's say 12 of them were cool.

864
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,740
And then the other one was like, I don't know that I want my Zagnuts out.

865
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:04,980
Yeah.

866
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,500
And when I show them off to everybody-

867
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,420
Right on my, right on my mounds.

868
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:10,660
Check the internet.

869
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:10,980
Yeah.

870
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,300
Hey, Swedish, does Yahoo have any answers?

871
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:20,180
Yahoo, the best answer as chosen by voters, it's Yahoo answers user Harg who says,

872
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,740
it would be weird if you have never been skinny dipping with mates at some point in your lifetime.

873
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,500
It's pretty normal life experience.

874
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,140
So there you go.

875
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

876
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:33,380
So he's saying if you are a novice at it, if you don't know how to do it right, it could be weird.

877
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,340
I don't know.

878
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,780
I don't think that's what he's saying at all.

879
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:41,540
I think he's saying if you've never had interest in a nude moonlight swim with your bros with 15

880
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,940
year closest bros, by the way, I don't think it's that many bros because once you get that many bros

881
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:49,300
agreeing on something, it is like, it's a, it's a lifestyle.

882
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,820
Once you get 15 bros all in a room, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

883
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:56,340
Now you're all living in some kind of weird cult compound thing.

884
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,060
Let's do it.

885
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:57,380
Yeah.

886
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,020
Don't ever tell.

887
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:58,820
Yeah.

888
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,420
Then you, it's a decision that you've made and not like just three bros like, oh man,

889
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:05,620
let's get in the water.

890
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,260
You know what I mean?

891
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,780
I think it's a harmless thing.

892
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,220
I think that you got to, I think you got to get some moonlight and you've got to get some cool,

893
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,900
cool lake water and maybe a duck will swim by and be like, hey duck, I'm naked.

894
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:21,700
Don't ever tell.

895
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,260
Don't ever tell.

896
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:22,740
Don't ever tell.

897
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:23,700
I'll get you, duck.

898
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,020
Duck, I swear if you breathe a word of this, I will find you.

899
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,300
Duck, don't you ever tell.

900
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,300
Don't bite my, it's down there.

901
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:34,100
Don't bite my thing.

902
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:35,460
Don't bite my down there zone.

903
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,940
We were on a nice kick for naming our dick after candy bars.

904
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:40,660
Is there any other?

905
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,300
Don't nibble on my fifth Avenue down there.

906
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:48,580
Hey baby, are you ready to take five?

907
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,980
Oh, your name is Henry.

908
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,100
You might, I say just, oh, Henry.

909
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,820
Oh my.

910
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,380
Oh, Hank.

911
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,940
Hey, I want to hear Griffin's.

912
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,900
Toblerone.

913
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:59,140
Yeah.

914
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,820
This is my baby roof.

915
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,580
It looks funky, but it feels fine.

916
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,220
This is my chocolate boner.

917
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,260
This is my Twix.

918
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:11,060
I've got two of them.

919
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,740
Don't tell, ducks.

920
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:18,100
You actually get chocolate boners in the adults only section of Honeydukes.

921
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,860
A lot of people don't know that.

922
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,460
It's behind a magical curtain.

923
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,700
We'll take the lot.

924
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,820
Even the chocolate boners.

925
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:28,740
I don't know if that's.

926
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,220
Is it weird for me and my 12 friends to sit in a circle and eat chocolate boners

927
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,260
or always stare at each other?

928
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,380
That's fine.

929
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,500
Don't worry about it.

930
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:37,860
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

931
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,220
First quick housekeeping things.

932
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,740
This is my brother, my brother and me.

933
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,220

Thank you, Travis.

940
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:15,860
That's not real.

941
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,380
We also, you know, we want to do.

942
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,460
I really, really, really want to do like a dating ad for somebody.

943
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:22,900
So bad.

944
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,860
So, so bad.

945
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,180
Please, please, please get in touch with us so that we can do that on the Jumbotron.

946
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:28,900
Please.

947
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,620
I need to.

948
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,980
And that's not a corporate thing.

949
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:35,940
That's a, that's a personal message for $100 and you'll have a girlfriend.

950
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,780
The love of your life.

951
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,420
I really also want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of their theme

952
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,780
song for our show.

953
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:48,500
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed, which I bought again today.

954
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,460
Thank you so much for all of our Twitter friends that, that tweet about the show with the

955
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,820
NB&BM hashtag.

956
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:03,940
Thank you to Harley Grant, Little Froggy, Mary Beth, Jeff Bergkamp, everybody on the

957
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:09,300
Parsipzilla, also Mariko, Joano11, everybody.

958
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,020
Thank you so much.

959
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:16,020
And a special thank you to Tracy V. Wilson, who Griffin and I met at PAX.

960
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,700
And also there's been a lot of activity on the NB&BM wiki thing.

961
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:29,540
And I want to appreciate, I want to say I appreciate everybody who's added stuff to

962
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,060
that so new people can reference stuff.

963
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,660
But I want to throw out real quick.

964
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:38,740
My favorite sentence in the entire thing is I asked people to add some stuff to my profile

965
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:43,140
and my favorite sentence is, for as long as he can remember, Travis has been played by

966
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:43,860
Albert Brooks.

967
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,980
And it makes me so incredibly happy.

968
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,380
Thank you to Karen D for getting that going again.

969
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,820
And if you want to hop on there and add to that, we would love that.

970
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:58,740
How the fuck are we not on Wikipedia proper yet?

971
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,500
Like our wiki is great and I love it, but why are we not on Wikipedia yet?

972
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,820
Does anybody know the owner of Wikipedia?

973
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,100
Yeah, we actually, we had a page once we got deleted.

974
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:10,740
Did we really?

975
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,580
Yeah.

976
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,180
What a stern webmaster.

977
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,100
Then we had a page on WikiLeaks and then it was like a huge thing.

978
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,460
Yeah, leaked all of our documents.

979
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,380
They revealed what the secret beeped word was.

980
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:27,300
So thank you.

981
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,940
Keep tweeting.

982
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:31,220
When you tell people about the show, please include a link to our sampler.

983
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,620
It's bit.ly forward slash it's bim bam.

984
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,540
That's the best way to get people involved.

985
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:38,340
Uh, Griffin, you know what I need.

986
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,820
It's the final Yahoo answer sent in by Jacob blocker.

987
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:41,460
Thank you, Jacob.

988
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,140
It's by Yahoo answers user Tom's daughter.

989
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:52,420
Who asks apart from the well-known book ghost cats, human encounters with

990
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:54,340
feline spirits by dusty rainbow.

991
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,460
What other evidence is there for the existence of an afterlife for cats?

992
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,940
I'm Justin McElroy.

993
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,820
I'm Travis McElroy.

994
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:07,140
I'm dusty rainbow, my brother, my brother, me.

995
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:07,780
He's your dad.

996
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,300
Wear on the lips.

997
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:14,420
Keep your heart.

998
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,300
Three stacks.

999
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,260
Keep your heart.

1000
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,540
Hey, keep your heart.

1001
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,420
Three stacks.

1002
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,460
Keep your heart.

1003
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:19,780
Man.

1004
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,740
These girls are smart.

1005
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:21,460
Three stacks.

1006
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:22,580
These girls are smart.

1007
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:32,980
Play your part, play your part.
