1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:53,520
Justice will be served, and the battle will rage. This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage,

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,920
and you'll be sorry that you messed with the US of A,

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,160
cause we'll put a boot in your ass. It's the American Way.

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,680
Welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era,

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,880
but specifically Toby Keith fans. What most people don't know is he's quitting Shakespeare there.

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,880
Travis works in Shakespeare. He's in the Shakespeare biz, and that is true,

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,480
what Travis is saying right now. Hey.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,720
Hey, we got him. What?

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list, and the Statue of Liberty started shaking her

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,040
fist, and the eagle will fly. Man, it's gonna be hell when you hear Mother Freedom start ringing

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
her bell. Ring the bell, Mother Freedom. You know, we haven't said in a while, but

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
good work, Tristan. Yeah.

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,560
Hey, you got him, man. I attribute this success wholly and entirely to him.

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,600
Yes. I know he may have just been in boot camp, and before that, a baby, but I think that he

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,240
probably did this all on his own. But now that Osama is dead-

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
You have to say that after every time you acknowledge his death.

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,040
I do. Don't worry, I do. Who's next for us? Who's enemy number one,

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
enemy number uno right now? Who's the new- who's the new hotness?

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,200
Space aliens.

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,320
Space aliens? I think that that's gonna be- that's sort of a longer play,

27
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,160
but I think certainly that they are-

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,000
It took us 10 years to take out a dude on Earth. I think we got time.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
I know. I agree with you.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,920
It has to be- it can't be anything ambiguous. It has to be one space alien.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
That's the thing. I can't get off- I can't finish

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,680
knowing that we are at war with an entire country, but when I think about the full

33
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,280
might of the big bad American military coming after just one dude.

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,840
Yeah.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,560
Oh, that's the- that's the good stuff.

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,240
I'd like it to be whoever is making the scary movies still.

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,240
Wes Craven, your ass is grass.

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,840
No, not scary movies.

39
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,280
It's the scary movie series, not just like generally-

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Justin hates getting spooked.

41
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,360
Oh, I've been spooked. Nukem.

42
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,800
Nukem.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,560
You got- you got me. Let's get this- let's drop a daisy cutter in there.

44
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
Just really murder everybody who made that film.

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
What if Jamie Lee Curtis got caught in the crossfire, you monster?

46
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,400
Didn't even think about that. This is an advice show- as you've gathered,

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,760
this is an advice show for the modern era. I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

48
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,320
I am your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

49
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,000
And I'm Griffin McElroy.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,680
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. So let's get to the advice. So there's this girl I'm really-

51
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,400
Is it- hold on.

52
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,720
Whoa.

53
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,760
Is it weird that I am super against the death penalty, like in every way imaginable,

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:59,840
but I would be okay with, like, putting makeup on Osama Bin Laden's dead-ass assassinated corpse

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,240
and, like, letting people, like, pay ten bucks to get, like, a funny picture taken with it?

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,880
Yeah, it's- it's- that's fine. It just means you're, like, a huge hypocrite. That's the only thing-

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,200
No, here's what it is. I've been thinking about it. I think it's, like, the difference between,

58
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,200
you know, you don't want to see anyone die, but when someone elevates themselves to the level of,

59
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
like, super villain-

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,200
Like mega dick. Like, yeah, like, I'm like-

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah, like, I want a mega dick on a punch through his face, you know what I mean?

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah.

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,960
Like, when you're on a super villain level, you get- you get what's coming.

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,200
Yeah, courtesy of the red, white, and blue.

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,600
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. I would have preferred the Phantom Zone, but that's just-

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:43,200
that's just me. So, anyway, real actual ass advice for real people who are still alive.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,680
Okay.

68
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,080
Courtesy of the red, white, and blue. So there's this girl I'm really into right now. I can tell-

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,040
Oh, sorry. I misread that. He's not into her right now with an expectation to be less into her later.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,840
Let me try again. So there's this girl I'm really into. Right now, I can tell she sees us as friends,

71
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,840
but I really think that if I have patience and work at it, something could possibly materialize

72
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,320
between us. Here's where the complications arise. I cannot tell my friends I like her,

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,360
as keep it a secret doesn't seem to register with them. So they don't know I'm really into this girl

74
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,560
and are fully intent on setting me up with another girl who we know is into me. She's a nice girl,

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
but not the one I really want. I've tried to slow down their setup plan as much as possible,

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,160
but it's fast approaching. Shit, this is exciting!

77
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
I know!

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Should I break a girl's heart for a chance to be with the girl I really love? Have you any tips

79
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,720
for slowing down the oncoming setup from those who wait? Oh, shit.

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
There's so much going on in this question.

81
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,600
It's thrilling! God damn, I miss being a teenager. Do you know the biggest, like,

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
the biggest thing like this is, like, for me is, like, I really wanted to go to Fazoli's,

83
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,800
but Arby's is right there. Ah, fuck it. I'll get some beef.

84
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,640
That's poignant in its own way.

85
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,360
Yeah, and it has its own implications in the real world.

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,120
So it sounds like this question is threefold. One, there's, he likes this girl that doesn't like him.

87
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
Two, his friends can't keep a secret. Three, they're trying to set him up

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,920
with a girl he doesn't dig, right? Those are, like, the three main points of this question.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,720
Right.

90
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay.

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,080
Good. Thanks. Thank you for that stuff.

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,680
There's a lot going on in that question.

93
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,760
That cliff's notes on that 30-second-long question.

94
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a recap show for the modern era. We take your questions and boil them down.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,760
Can I get an index card with some bullet points on it?

96
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,720
Yeah.

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Well, my next turn was to answer those questions in turn, but...

98
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,880
Oh, you're doing a, oh, a setup.

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeah, I was, I was...

100
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
All right. Well, you bumped it, we set it, now spike it to the advice.

101
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
All right. One.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
You didn't have anything!

103
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,680
You touched the net.

104
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,600
No, I do. I do. I swear. God, I do.

105
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,720
My question is, and this is for you guys, Justin, Griffin, and everyone else.

106
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
What is the possibility?

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,640
I, I, whenever I hear someone say, I really like this girl, she just sees us as friends,

108
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,880
but I think with some hard work and dedication, I can change her mind.

109
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I know what you're thinking.

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,360
And I think that that's a fool's game.

111
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
That is a fool's game.

112
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,600
Uh, where no good, no, there's no cute meat that starts with wearing her down.

113
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,640
Like that is not, you never see that part in a romantic comedy.

114
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,560
Well, we met each other and then I broke her will like a stallion.

115
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,840
Maybe he just needs some time to get a sexy, right?

116
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Whoa.

117
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,360
You think, oh, you were thinking some Patrick Dempsey and can't buy me love shit.

118
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,480
That is specifically and exactly what I'm talking about.

119
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,840
That is the exact shit you were thinking just now in the second.

120
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,640
I was furiously looking up YouTube clips from that movie just now while talking.

121
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,400
That's just part of his routine.

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,560
Oh yeah, my early morning routine.

123
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,520
Um, yeah, I, I think that, I think that, uh, uh, if you have to,

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
Travis has a great point.

125
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,800
If you have to work at it, it's probably not meant to be.

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,480
Cause that's like, that's how you end up being the guy who like she'll break up with somebody

127
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,680
and you'll, you're like, I'm going to slip in there, but no, no dice.

128
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,400
Cause she's, she's just not that into you.

129
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,240
And you run the risk of just completely like debasing yourself.

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,280
Like the harder you work and say you spend six months convincing this girl to date you

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
and then you actually get together.

132
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
You are going to be so unhappy in this relationship because everything that happens, you're like,

133
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,200
oh shit, I hope I didn't piss her off.

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
I don't want her to break up with me.

135
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,560
Like it will not be an even relationship.

136
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,120
So you're, you're saying go with, go with the adequate lover.

137
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,760
No, I'm saying like, I don't, I don't think he's giving this second girl a chance because

138
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,480
he's so hung up on the first girl.

139
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,840
She's my adequate lover.

140
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
Your backup lover.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,720
Look at her.

142
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,720
She's, she's beautiful in her, her way, her way.

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,040
She, I tell you what, get rid of those glasses, dust those funyuns, combs off her shirt.

144
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,480
You might have a prize there.

145
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
A hidden treasure.

146
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,640
Yeah, put a blue ribbon on that sweet baby.

147
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,920
Hey, and as Travis points out that it's also not a very attractive quality to be on the

148
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,440
hot, to be like working really hard to wear somebody down.

149
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,520
Here's, here's a classic movie line you never heard.

150
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,160
Frankly, my dear, if you need me or whatever or something opens up, just call me.

151
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
Like you got my cell and Twitter and stuff.

152
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
So like whatever.

153
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,880
I keep my phone turned on while I sleep.

154
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,000
So if you have like a bad dream or something, I don't want to talk about it.

155
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,200
Yeah, or just frankly, my dear, come on, frankly, my dear.

156
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
I don't think you're going to do better.

157
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
That was very frank of me.

158
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,760
So that was, that was linguistically accurate.

159
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,280
Frankly, my dear, I give so many dams.

160
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,240
Yeah, I've give like many dams about a hundred billion dams.

161
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,080
I say, I think that if you're okay, you got someone who's into you right now.

162
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,320
You got someone who's not into you right now.

163
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
Go with the one who is into you right now.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
Cause it's not like a, it's not like a one or the other.

165
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,080
Like one of these paths does not close down.

166
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,320
Maybe other girls, maybe she is your forever love and she's just not ready for that yet.

167
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Maybe the two of you aren't ready in a destiny sense.

168
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,960
Here's a simple direct thing for them trying to set you up.

169
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,080
If you do decide that you don't want to go up and you don't want to go with this set

170
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,160
up date, just tell your friends no.

171
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Yeah, that's a good point too.

172
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,280
Just be directed if they're like, Hey, so just get, you know, I'm not really down with this.

173
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,280
Hey guys, the end.

174
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,080
Thanks.

175
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,640
But no, thanks.

176
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,440
Griffin.

177
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,160
Yeah, I got it.

178
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,720
What I need.

179
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,880
This one was sent in by, uh, I am.

180
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,400
Oh, start a on Twitter.

181
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:00,720
Thank you.

182
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,080
Timely.

183
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Um, Yahoo answers user Diego asks.

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,000
Thanks. Why does my girlfriend feel weird having sex with me because of the posters on my wall?

185
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,920
They are of JFK Gandhi and Benjamin Franklin.

186
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,040
Additional details.

187
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,000
They are on my wall because I strive to be like them.

188
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,040
Okay.

189
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,720
In the sack.

190
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah.

191
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,840
In bed.

192
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,000
Is that what we're, is that what we're presupposing?

193
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,280
Because, uh, I'm sure I can do for you, but what you can do for me.

194
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,840
Yeah.

195
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,160
Yeah.

196
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
What you can do for my, my, my Dick.

197
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
I'm the president.

198
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,800
Mr.

199
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
Kennedy president.

200
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,920
President Kennedy was, uh, probably pretty proficient.

201
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,240
Yeah.

202
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,480
Oh yeah.

203
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,840
Now, now president Gandhi, on the other hand, president Gandhi.

204
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know if you like, if you like those, if you like them stringy, I guess.

205
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,840
I think definite bottom, we have to assume.

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,240
Right.

207
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,440
I mean, why are you, you're saying he's, you're saying Gandhi was gay.

208
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,280
No, I'm just saying like in a, it could be in a people use a bottom.

209
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,840
Justin.

210
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,120
No.

211
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,640
Why can we put this in the show?

212
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
God, if he was gay, that would be so much fun.

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
All right.

214
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,000
Can we, okay.

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,160
Can we agree for the, this question for the fixture of this question

216
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,880
that we are going to answer it in an alternate universe in which Gandhi was gay?

217
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,360
So I can make that joke about it being a bottom.

218
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:44,720
No.

219
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:44,960
Yes.

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm saying a one question.

221
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
Just give me a break on reality for this one question.

222
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,800
So I can make this gag.

223
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
It will be in an alternate reality in the sense that I'll delete it from the show and

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,080
send it to the fucking phantom zone.

225
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Osama and my hilarious Gandhi spoof.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
To be fair Griffin, you don't know what was in Gandhi's heart.

227
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah.

228
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,040
Or in his butt.

229
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
He has a very quiet heart, but.

230
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Okay.

231
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
All right.

232
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,600
All right.

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:15,840
Bye.

234
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,600
This is my final offer.

235
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,120
Vicarious.

236
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,760
Vicarious, we are in an alternate reality for the duration of this question

237
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,240
in which Gandhi was vicarious.

238
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,600
Now hold on.

239
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, I do want to take a second.

240
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
What was the goof?

241
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,480
What was even the spoof that started this?

242
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
A quick time out.

243
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,720
Welcome our new listeners.

244
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,080
Gandhi, the spoof was he would be a bottom because he was into like,

245
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,600
he was into non-aggression and passive.

246
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,160
You know what I mean?

247
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,400
Like.

248
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
And also really weak from the not eating.

249
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,960
And a giant butthole.

250
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,520
Okay.

251
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,400
All right.

252
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,560
So I will agree to.

253
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,680
All right.

254
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,960
I will drop my gag.

255
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,160
I will drop my spoof.

256
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,840
Yeah, it didn't make a whole lot of sense.

257
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Okay.

258
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,160
But yeah, but if you had given me the leeway to make him gay,

259
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,200
I just want our show to like appeal to everybody.

260
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,560
And we had a bunch of.

261
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
Even fiction writers.

262
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
I want it to appeal that people writing alternate histories.

263
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,280
Um, I bet Ben Franklin got down.

264
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
Oh, yeah.

265
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
Like, oh, my God.

266
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,080
Are you kidding me?

267
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,560
Back in the 18th century, it was just a constant Bacchanalian.

268
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
Just Buckfest.

269
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,560
Yeah.

270
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,200
All the time.

271
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,400
All the time.

272
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,440
All the time.

273
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,200
The First Continental Congress.

274
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Close the windows.

275
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,480
We don't want the secrets to get out or the stink.

276
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,840
Reopen those windows.

277
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,320
John Hancock just blacked out.

278
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:45,840
Wow.

279
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,960
So I don't think it's weird that you have those posters on your wall.

280
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,760
I do know.

281
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,200
I did want to know your supplier for Benjamin Franklin posters.

282
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,800
I do want to know where do you pick those up at?

283
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,160
Because I would like to get one.

284
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
He was basically the best dude ever.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,080
Like, I can understand.

286
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,000
Yeah, he was like the coolest guy.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,680
He was like the fucking coolest guy.

288
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,400
He's sitting there flying a kite with a key on it while boning down on a lady.

289
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,920
Check out this key thing I did.

290
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,960
Now get on it.

291
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,520
Get on it.

292
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,000
That's just history.

293
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,280
That's basic history.

294
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,920
That's a quote.

295
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,400
That's a basic quote from a history book.

296
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,720
An old classic.

297
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,200
Now, JFK was a known philanderer.

298
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,160
Philanderer, right?

299
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,760
Maybe the girl, maybe his girl is like, is put off by the vibe.

300
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:42,800
The sort of no rules, fire island, swinger vibe that JFK is putting off.

301
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,920
No rules, no fear.

302
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,320
Just bounce on the tip on the person.

303
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,040
Is it possible that during their lovemaking, he's referencing the posters?

304
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,120
See, that's what I'm worried about.

305
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
Oh, okay.

306
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,280
Like he's like pointing at them and going, this one's for you, Ben.

307
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Or not even.

308
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
I think speaking would alleviate the tension in this situation I'm talking about.

309
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,720
Like she catches him just staring into the eyes of Benjamin Franklin

310
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
while crushing them guts.

311
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,680
Maybe he's reflecting on some of their other accomplishments.

312
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,000
Maybe he's crushing them guts while he's thinking about

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
how cool it was to invent the first fire station or something.

314
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
Yeah, I do love bifocals.

315
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,120
I don't think it's weird.

316
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,960
I think that it's, you know, that's why a lot of people don't have posters.

317
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,280
No, you're saying that.

318
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,920
You are saying that people who don't have posters don't have those posters

319
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,400
because they're uncomfortable having posters in their room during coitus?

320
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,040
Yes, I'm saying that if you don't, yeah.

321
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,640
Okay, I think 99% of bedroom decoration decisions are,

322
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,680
would this be weird if I was boning in here?

323
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
Like, would this be weird?

324
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,320
That's why you don't put like pictures of your meemaw in your bedroom

325
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
because like, what if you catch a glimpse?

326
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
Although I do have that poster where the cat's hanging from the tree branch

327
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,520
and it says, hang in there.

328
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,280
Well, yeah, because that's helpful advice.

329
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,880
Like, yeah, yeah.

330
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,200
I'm worried about the way that you guys are looking at your bedroom

331
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,840
because for me, it's a peaceful place where I can go and energize

332
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,920
like a robot for my next day of work.

333
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:24,880
And to you, it's like some sort of like, it's like the seedy sex room.

334
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,160
Now, why do you think that might be?

335
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,160
Why, because I like robots and you guys like sex.

336
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
You are mutually exclusive.

337
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:48,080
I only, I have enough attention to really dedicate myself to one concentration

338
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,640
and you guys, and by you guys, I mean everybody else.

339
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
To put it in tarot's group, I can understand.

340
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,520
He only has enough RAM to think about robots.

341
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,000
He doesn't have enough RAM to RAM is what he's saying.

342
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
That's what I'm saying.

343
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
I need an upgrade.

344
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,880
I need a dual core.

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,720
Can I come over and sleep with you tonight?

346
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,200
I don't know.

347
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm going to be devoting a lot of energy to pretending I'm a robot.

348
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,080
I'm afraid you might impede that in some sense.

349
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,600
Hey, my friend just got engaged to his girlfriend, which is great.

350
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,720
I'm invited to their engagement party, which is not so great.

351
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,120
Here is my problem.

352
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,680
It's a potluck at the girlfriend's house.

353
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,680
I think fiance is now the proper nomenclature.

354
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,160
Yeah, they are throwing.

355
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,560
I think it's really tacky and don't want to bring anything.

356
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
Is this a jerk move?

357
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,200
What should I do?

358
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
Mike, not even in the wedding.

359
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,840
Oh, this is so, this is like a Da Vinci code.

360
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
There's a secret in this question.

361
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,360
Can you find the secret?

362
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,920
Because his thing that he's upset about is total shenanigans.

363
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,640
And it just slips in the real question right there at the end.

364
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,440
Right there at the end.

365
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,000
What is it?

366
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,560
I don't know.

367
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,920
It's Hebrew for apple.

368
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,680
That means that it's at this address.

369
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,480
What's there?

370
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,560
The foreskin Da Vinci code.

371
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,320
So you guys are saying the real issue is that he's not in the wedding?

372
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,200
Of course.

373
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,480
That's what he's upset about.

374
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,360
What is his other issue?

375
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,640
He is abstaining from bringing potato salad because he was not asked to do a reading.

376
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
His other issue is that none of their friends or family are close enough to throw them an

377
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,280
engagement party.

378
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,480
That's what he's mad about.

379
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
Like, hey, I would have done it.

380
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,080
Why address me?

381
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
I would have thrown you a potluck.

382
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
Potluck is also the easiest thing to throw.

383
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,600
Well, potluck is the shittiest party because it's saying, hey, come to our party and we

384
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,840
just need you to bring the food and drinks and some decorations and I don't know, some

385
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
plates and cups if you can pick them up.

386
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,440
It's also the shittiest.

387
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,360
It's the shittiest party because you say on the invitation, like, everybody brings something,

388
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,760
but just make sure somebody brings rolls and then you get to the party and it's just fucking

389
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,560
70 rolls.

390
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,920
I don't even know what to do with these.

391
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,840
Everybody brought a two liter of off-brand soda and a bag of rippled potato chips.

392
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,920
Oh, man, that sounds like a, see, to me, sounds like a party.

393
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,680
Yeah, we need to get engaged.

394
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,880
Yeah, I gotta get engaged.

395
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
Gotta find my robot bride.

396
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,920
Can you be my girl?

397
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Girl, my heart is in beta.

398
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,720
Mike, Mike, you are upset about them not asking you to be in the wedding and that's what's

399
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,600
bothering you.

400
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,920
I think you gotta A, talk to them about it or B, like, just, just make some steak and

401
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,800
take it over.

402
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,760
Just pick up some macaroons or something at the Kmart and just take it over there.

403
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,400
Steak would be fucking baller for a potluck.

404
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,280
Are you kidding me?

405
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,240
How's your potluck?

406
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,920
I guess I just made it way better, huh?

407
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:47,520
Yeah, you should, if we treated potlucks more like competitions and less, and less like

408
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,480
fucking slop troughs, like just put Discord in your face, I bought it at Kmart.

409
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,680
But you sweet boy, I'm sorry.

410
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,160
I know that that must be, that's such a sensitive time, you know, choosing who's going to be

411
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,800
in a wedding party.

412
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,760
So many factors to consider.

413
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,160
It doesn't mean they didn't like you, you know, it means that, it means that maybe she

414
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,520
only had X number of friends and he couldn't ask you or something like that.

415
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,880
You never know what happened.

416
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,400
And bad news, yeah, you totally have to bring something to that party.

417
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,200
You gotta.

418
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,080
You have to.

419
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:16,880
Yeah, I can't.

420
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
I understand the reluctance, but you're going to be that guy.

421
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
I get it, but you're right.

422
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,480
Like Travis is right.

423
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,920
You are, there is no debate on what guy you're going to be because the answer is that guy.

424
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,400
That's the guy.

425
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,440
To put it in different terms, it's like if someone said a party was BYOB and you said

426
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,120
that's shitty and then you showed up and asked to drink everyone else's beer.

427
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:43,120
And not like some of everyone else's beer, literally just a row of all the beers at the

428
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,600
party that you're slamming one after another, like a scene from the hit ABC family series,

429
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,100
Greek.

430
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

431
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,760
Hey, I live in a college dorm and recently an unfamiliar girl has taken to using my whole

432
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,200
bathroom to shower.

433
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,880
This would be fine, except that she always showers with the curtain open.

434
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,160
I can only.

435
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:04,640
What?

436
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,680
Slower, slower.

437
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,400
Slower, okay, I will go slower.

438
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
Uh, hold on.

439
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,120
Just let me find a place here.

440
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:17,520
I can only assume that she's creeped out her own hall mates and has to find new turf, but

441
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
it's beginning to creep me out as well.

442
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,040
Not to mention flooding the bathroom, which leads me to wonder why might a person prefer

443
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:31,440
to shower with the curtain open and what can I do to get her to stop flooded in Philly?

444
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,040
You can shut the fuck up.

445
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,480
You're ruining it for everyone.

446
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,200
We need this.

447
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,640
We need this in our lives.

448
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,440
You're ruining it.

449
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,040
I mean, that.

450
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,080
What other reason could it be other than she wanted to get watched?

451
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,240
She wants you to see those fat boobies.

452
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,280
There is no justification to this action.

453
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,600
Yeah.

454
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,960
What other could I like to feel?

455
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,320
I like the breeze.

456
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,800
It's time for a show.

457
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,240
It's my it's my religion.

458
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,160
And this is probably a there's probably a girl asking this question.

459
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,320
Yeah, right?

460
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah, that's right.

461
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm not a guy because that that guy would know that even if he were not of that persuasion

462
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,200
where he would enjoy something like that, the the punishment for ending something like

463
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,600
that would be so severe that you couldn't withstand.

464
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,240
Right?

465
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,400
Listen, like we're talking exile, exile in Guyville, but communal showers in the first

466
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,560
place are so creepy and fucking weird.

467
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,000
And the reason I never lived in a dorm, if I lived in a dorm, I would have gone home

468
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,720
to shower.

469
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
I would have driven to my my parents' house and showered there and gone back.

470
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
That's unacceptable.

471
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,720
I have never, ever been in the shower and thought it's just so stuffy in here.

472
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,000
Yeah.

473
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,480
Oh, boy.

474
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,560
I need to pop open this door real quick.

475
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,280
Like, I don't understand why anyone the water splashes everywhere.

476
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,320
And it's just weird.

477
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
It's just weird.

478
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,400
Maybe she just maybe she just saw Psycho for the first time.

479
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,400
And like, but if a merger gets in the room, like saying them isn't going to do you any

480
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,040
help.

481
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,280
Yeah.

482
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,160
And here's the thing.

483
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,600
If you're in a communal bathroom, there's people in and out of that bathroom.

484
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,800
Like, is your fear like, what if somebody walks in?

485
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,360
Well, yes.

486
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,960
Maybe just to her and I, these are my least favorite kind of people on the planet to her.

487
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,120
Nudity is no big deal.

488
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,320
Don't worry about it.

489
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,000
It's just it's just my boobs.

490
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,520
It's just my boobs and my vagina.

491
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,480
No big deal.

492
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,120
This is cool.

493
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,800
One of those houses.

494
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,840
One of those houses.

495
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I can't.

496
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,440
I can't.

497
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
I can't be a party to that.

498
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,160
It's like when I go to the pool and like I go to the changing room and there are dudes

499
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,840
just like, check out my free balls.

500
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,080
Check these out.

501
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:40,880
My balls are waiting.

502
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
They're like inches away.

503
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Are you saying that maybe this girl grew up in a home where while one person was showering,

504
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
another one could be shooting a deuce on the toilet and like they just got so comfortable

505
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,880
with sharing bathrooms with each other, they just pop open the curtain and have conversations?

506
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm saying that the human body, the human body is not a natural, beautiful palace.

507
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,280
It's not.

508
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,800
It's not.

509
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
It's fucked up.

510
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
Everybody's is weird and fucked up in different ways.

511
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,320
Your secrets are stuck to you.

512
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,440
Your secrets are you have secret parts all over that nobody knows about and nobody should

513
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,320
know about.

514
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,960
And you can't be like, oh, this is how we're supposed to be.

515
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
This is natural.

516
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,360
This is natural.

517
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,440
This is humanity at zero.

518
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,200
We got to get back to zero.

519
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Check out this dick, please.

520
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,640
Straight up, even if you are one of the few that is a beautiful palace, man, that's so

521
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,040
weird.

522
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,280
Like, yeah, then you're just rubbing it in.

523
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:39,520
Yeah.

524
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,720
And somebody like walks in the bathroom, their media reaction is never going to be, oh, nice.

525
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
It's always going to be, whoa, you're ruining everyone.

526
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
You're ruining this for everybody.

527
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,800
You're ruining everything.

528
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,600
So if this person is, for some reason, listening right now, cover your shame.

529
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,840
Yeah, just hide that shame.

530
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,400
Nobody needs that.

531
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,360
Unless it's good.

532
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,160
Unless it's nice.

533
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,520
Is it not?

534
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,480
Is it nice?

535
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Wait, but is it nice?

536
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,880
Oh, I hadn't even considered the possibility that it might be nice.

537
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,800
Hey, can you just double check for me?

538
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,000
Because maybe you get spooked.

539
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,680
Double check.

540
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,120
Because it might be nice.

541
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,160
Do we already take a journey to the money zone?

542
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,680
How about a Yahoo first?

543
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,880
Yeah, I already said it.

544
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,440
I already said it.

545
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,720
So I got dibs.

546
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,320
And that's like a contract.

547
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,400
It's like a contract that we make with ourselves.

548
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:30,640
OK.

549
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
OK, Yahoo it is.

550
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
This one was sent in by Cameron Daigle.

551
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm sorry I said his name like that.

552
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,480
Thank you, Cameron Daigle.

553
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user Monkey Pot Tree Nut who asks,

554
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
pregnant with twins.

555
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,680
Are these good names?

556
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,960
I was thinking of cute and-

557
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,680
Wait, can I prognosticate an answer?

558
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,240
Sure.

559
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,720
They are not.

560
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,560
I was thinking of fun and cute names for my twins, boy and girl.

561
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,680
Heart, I'm also inspired by a lot of celebrities.

562
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Their children have such unique names.

563
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
Anyway, here it goes.

564
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,200
Starting with a girl's name and then a boy's name.

565
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
Jam and Ham Smith.

566
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,800
Nice.

567
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,040
Lola and Boba Smith.

568
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,280
Boba?

569
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Sammy and Sammy Smith.

570
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,280
Now hold up.

571
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,320
Sammy S-A-M-I and Sammy S-A-M-M-Y.

572
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,920
Oh, Jesus.

573
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,560
Law and Lee Smith.

574
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,600
Boy, that would make Sophie's Choice really tough, wouldn't it?

575
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
Take Sammy.

576
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,360
You guys work it out.

577
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,760
Can you say Law and Lee?

578
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,040
Law and Lee Smith.

579
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,440
Sugar and Spice Smith.

580
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,640
Oh, God.

581
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,280
That's got my-

582
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,840
Wait, is the boy Sugar and the girl Spice and the boy Spice?

583
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,800
Nope, you had it right.

584
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,360
Oh, God.

585
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,640
You know what that boy is?

586
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
A teen runaway.

587
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,440
Sylvia and Silvio Smith.

588
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,640
Because they're living in a Shakespeare comedy.

589
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
Apple and Pear Smith.

590
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,760
Oh, God.

591
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,880
Which pear is your favorite?

592
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,280
Thanks.

593
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,840
I like apple and pear.

594
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,400
Just like fucking turn your whole family into some big, awful fruit salad.

595
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Big, stupid.

596
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,400
Just a big, dumb compote.

597
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,720
Did my boys in the Yahoo Answers crew, did they have any votes?

598
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:43,440
Yahoo Answers user, you know you love me, said, great for dogs.

599
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
How's your burn?

600
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,400
Hey, check your face.

601
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
It's on the ground.

602
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,480
I just rammed your face to the deep fat fryer because it burned so bad.

603
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,440
I burned you so hard.

604
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:54,880
Pretty good one.

605
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,560
Pretty good zinger.

606
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,360
Okay, someone said Jam is an adorable name for a little girl.

607
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,800
No, it's not.

608
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,440
Nope.

609
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,600
Hey, I take you as my bride, Jam.

610
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,280
Excuse me?

611
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,480
Hi, I'm Jam.

612
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,840
Hi.

613
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,920
That is a fucking power play.

614
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,320
Oh, Jam, what does that mean?

615
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,000
It means my parents were borderline.

616
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,760
It means they were borderline retarded.

617
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
It's what it means.

618
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:23,840
It means that before I was even born, my parents decided they hate me.

619
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,040
They hated me already.

620
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,240
You got legitimate grounds, like, mom, dad, you hate me.

621
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,400
Like, yeah, it seems like it.

622
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,440
Can we come up with some other rhyming couplets for this?

623
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
Sure, sure.

624
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
Food based, maybe, since most of these are.

625
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,360
So, like, these are my kids, Hot and Pocket.

626
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,000
What rhymes would be better off adopted?

627
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,320
Mark.

628
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,280
Mark, that's not quite it.

629
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,200
But what about Julie and Julia?

630
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,480
These are my kids, Susan and Schmoozin.

631
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
This is my son, Schmoozin.

632
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
I'm very proud of him.

633
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,160
I love him dearly.

634
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,560
What about, can we call him Pepsi and Coke?

635
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,560
Pepsi and Coke.

636
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,320
Pepsi, okay.

637
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,760
Can you choose between my kids in a blind taste test?

638
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,800
What is that, Uncle Kevin?

639
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,440
No, thank you.

640
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,040
Can you call one Mountain Dew and one Dr. Pepper?

641
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,720
What if this is their younger sister, Mr. Pibb?

642
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,760
I am Dr. Dr. Pepper Smith.

643
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,200
This is my brother, Jam.

644
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,840
This is our poor cousin, Dr. Thunder.

645
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Just keep having twins until you can fucking stock a refrigerator with your children.

646
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,880
But don't do that.

647
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,800
I can't state this strongly enough.

648
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,560
Sweetheart, we ran out of Miracle Whip.

649
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,480
We've got to have a kid, I guess, and name him that.

650
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
How does this work again?

651
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,800
I don't understand.

652
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,840
Let's go for a kid.

653
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
I'm confused.

654
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,840
You name the kid the food, but I'm still hungry after it.

655
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,040
Oh, the poor hell that these kids are being born into.

656
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,360
Okay, here's what you need to do.

657
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,520
Whenever you think about what you're going to name your kids,

658
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,240
just set up some practice sentences in your head.

659
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,920
Like, hello, my name is Jam.

660
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,200
I would love to work here.

661
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,960
I want to be a doctor.

662
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm your Dr. Jam Smith.

663
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,600
I'm Dr. Jam.

664
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,160
No, I take it back.

665
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,480
Dr. Jam is perfect because you're setting him up to be a professional sports person.

666
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Dr. Jam.

667
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,160
This is my boombox.

668
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,200
He's my resident.

669
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,280
I'm going to cut into you and fix you.

670
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,400
Yeah, this is resident boombox and I'm Dr. Jam.

671
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,280
How can I help you today?

672
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
I'm in a private practice with Dr. Kreigenstein.

673
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,920
Take it back.

674
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,040
These are awesome names.

675
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,080
Who is that in the corner?

676
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,640
It's Ham.

677
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,760
It's my brother, Ham.

678
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Some of the ones and twos he's going to mix while I cut in.

679
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,160
Yeah, so I think they're all pretty good.

680
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,080
Griffin, let's do this thing.

681
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,120
What are they short for?

682
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,640
Hamilton and Jamalton.

683
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,360
And our country's 53rd president was, of course, Jamalton P. Smith.

684
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,640
Oh boy.

685
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,280
Holland, let me put my seatbelt on.

686
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,640
Yeah, strap in.

687
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,360
Okay.

688
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:46,000
Because you just got a first class ticket to the money zone.

689
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,720
We got two personal messages today.

690
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,240
Let's start with this super easy one.

691
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,760
We got a congratulations for Emily and Andrew from their buddy, Jacob Holler.

692
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,000
Tell me about him, Griffin.

693
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,720
Tell me a story.

694
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,800
A quick one, but a good one.

695
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,800
Emily and Andrew.

696
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,800
Naïve, right?

697
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,920
That's how you pronounce it?

698
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,420
Yeah.

699
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,000
Emily Hall and Andrew Horton have combined forces.

700
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,640
They have smushed together to form one person through love.

701
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,360
With love, I mean.

702
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,160
Before you say the last name, it is the dopest last name.

703
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,200
Like the hyphenated power of this name is amazing.

704
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,200
They had a dope ass, totally sick fucking wedding.

705
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:35,920
It was nice.

706
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,160
And Emily and Andrew are now Emily and Andrew Horton Hall.

707
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,480
That's really fucking dope.

708
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
That's pretty, that's pretty nice.

709
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,200
It was officiated by Susan Pratt, which I don't think we've ever announced that before.

710
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,800
But yeah, now you know that.

711
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,360
Breaking news.

712
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, there was a picture and Travis didn't attach it.

713
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,320
So I don't know how nice I should be to them.

714
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:58,960
I'll tell you what.

715
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,360
I saw this JPEG.

716
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,000
It was a beautiful ceremony.

717
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,280
They were dancing.

718
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:08,800
They were dancing and looking each other's eyes like, we got one last name now.

719
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,400
But hey, you guys, congratulations.

720
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,040
We're so proud of you and your buddy.

721
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,400
You have a good friend, obviously.

722
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,280
Jacob.

723
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,120
Emily and Jacob are in the same knitting group now, which is a pretty cool thing.

724
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,400
Oh yeah?

725
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,120
What are they knitting?

726
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,720
What do you think their project is right now?

727
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,200
Probably, hopefully something for us.

728
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,920
Yeah.

729
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,520
Because otherwise they're wasting their time.

730
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,640
Can I have a doily?

731
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,920
Can you knit those?

732
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,680
Can you wamp him up a doily, please?

733
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
Why don't you stop talking about it?

734
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,680
Make a tiny sweater for their dog, Frankie.

735
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,040
So they're a great couple.

736
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,600
And Jacob wanted to wish you guys a happy marriage.

737
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
And a happy birthday.

738
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,800
And a happy birth.

739
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,280
What?

740
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,000
Really?

741
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,520
I mean, eventually.

742
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,640
Eventually he would like to wish you a happy birthday, but he's going to have to pay again

743
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,200
for that.

744
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,160
I'm sorry.

745
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,480
Okay, so our next one comes to us from David.

746
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,880
And this is unprecedented for us, but here we go.

747
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,440
His money zone request is to buy our UK soccer alliance.

748
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,000
Allegiance.

749
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,840
Well, I like to think of it as teaming up.

750
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,400
Allegiance.

751
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,520
Allegiance.

752
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,960
We'll meet you in the middle.

753
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,720
And this is for the...

754
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
So who are we fans of now, Griffin?

755
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,200
We are now the official Brotherly Comm Advice podcast.

756
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
Comm Vice.

757
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,920
Bro Comm.

758
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,280
Bro Comm Vice of the Millwall FC.

759
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,120
Which I believe FC is short for football corporation.

760
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
They're with a Millwall football company.

761
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,000
Millwall football co.

762
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,040
They're out there every fucking day on the pitch.

763
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,440
Fucking striking it.

764
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,720
Fucking blocking it.

765
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,160
Fucking kicking it.

766
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,520
Penalties, passes, triples.

767
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:06,640
As you well know, they're the pride of South Bermondsey in the London Borough of Lewisham,

768
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,480
which is Southeast London.

769
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,680
They're formed in 1885.

770
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,160
It's a good year.

771
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,680
They're represented by lions.

772
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,880
Their home colors are blue and white.

773
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Their way colors are yellow and blue, it seems like.

774
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,440
And I would like to take a moment to thank David for having the foresight to think,

775
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,600
you know, for an amount of money, the brothers will become the official something of anything.

776
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,440
That's completely true.

777
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,320
Thank you, David.

778
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,200
This is a note for anybody else.

779
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,480
We will become the official whatevers of whatever the fuck you want.

780
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,320
There is no allegiance we have, we hold so dear,

781
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,040
that we will not abandon it for a hundred dollars.

782
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,160
You think if anybody else, if somebody from Crystal Palace or Charlton or Leeds or West Ham

783
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,400
had contacted us first, we totally would have become the official podcast to them.

784
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,680
But now, yeah, here's the problem that you guys can get to us first.

785
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,600
And now we think all your football companies are bitches.

786
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,960
Millwall is what's up.

787
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,560
Go Lions.

788
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,000
Go Lions.

789
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,560
Meow.

790
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,600
We're going to maul you.

791
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,640
What's that in the grass?

792
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,600
That tall, that tall African grass.

793
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Yeah.

794
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,320
It's Millwall.

795
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,080
And it was, it was an instant change.

796
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,640
Someone brings up all time top scorer Neil Harris.

797
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,680
I tear up.

798
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
Neil Patrick Harris is their football man.

799
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
He's their, he's their kick, he's their football kicker.

800
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,600
Yeah, close.

801
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,200
Guess how many goals he scored in his last game?

802
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,360
How many?

803
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,360
He got, he got three one-pointers and six two-pointers.

804
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,640
Wow.

805
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,960
That is very impressive.

806
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,920
Yeah.

807
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,320
And check this for an awesome name.

808
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,280
Team manager, Kenny Jacket.

809
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,320
That's-

810
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,680
Kenny Jacket?

811
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,120
Kenny Jacket.

812
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,080
That's why we got into him.

813
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,960
It's a dope ass name.

814
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah, Kenny Jacket.

815
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:54,800
I like it.

816
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,360
He's a, Neil Harris is a striker.

817
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,640
Why didn't we not have a football alliance?

818
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,920
Oh, by the way, we're also only calling it football from now on

819
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,040
because now we're into it.

820
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,080
Now we're into this world.

821
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:11,760
Now we call, we call our football, football Norte Americano.

822
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,880
Griffin, time to let that-

823
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,520
Oh, fuck.

824
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,480
That pride, that deep, deep-

825
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
Just open your heart and let the pride out.

826
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,000
Just let the pride out.

827
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
Can I, we should do a fight song.

828
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,880
Hold on.

829
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,160
For Emily and Andrew?

830
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,600
And a tender love ballad about the football.

831
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:40,000
Go fight Mary.

832
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,680
Uh, so give me some talking points.

833
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,040
How can I mix these two together?

834
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:46,240
Uh, we got, well, we got fighting.

835
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,160
Something about cleats.

836
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,520
Yep.

837
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:09,600
Strap on those cleats.

838
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,440
Walk down the aisle.

839
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,200
Don't block that goal.

840
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,120
Something about cleats.

841
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:26,880
And it's a soccer wedding.

842
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,920
You got a yellow card for throwing rice too hard.

843
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,960
You cut the cake and shoot a penalty shot.

844
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,080
It's a soccer wedding.

845
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:04,560
I went to the wedding of Emily and Andrew Horton Hall.

846
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,320
Neil Patrick Harris was there.

847
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,080
It was nice.

848
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,200
It was nice.

849
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
It was a soccer wedding.

850
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:28,320
It was a soccer wedding.

851
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,200
Go Lions!

852
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,360
That wasn't so much a jingle as much as it was a song about a soccer wedding.

853
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,240
Uh, I think it still counts.

854
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,080
If you could have thrown monsters in there and made it a monster

855
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,920
soccer wedding, you would have had a party hit.

856
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,120
Anything you threw in there sort of ideologically would have just glommed on.

857
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,240
That song was a, that was a music.

858
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,080
It was a monster soccer wedding.

859
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,760
A soccer wedding.

860
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,360
That was a thematic stew.

861
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,400
That's what I just made.

862
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,120
I like it.

863
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,800
Simmering its own juices.

864
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,280
I work in a pretty conservative office and although my co-workers are pleasant enough,

865
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
they're not the type of folks I would ever hang out with if I weren't getting paid.

866
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,880
Every once in a while they organize a dinner at a restaurant after work.

867
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,720
Pretty much everyone, including my boss, goes,

868
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,960
I've been to a couple and they're not torture.

869
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,800
They're just boring and I'd rather go home.

870
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,520
What's a way to get out of these without alienating anyone or seeming like a dick?

871
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,440
Just here for the cheddar.

872
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,800
I think you got to think of this as part of your gig.

873
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,840
You got to think of it because if you're going to advance in your, in your company or, or,

874
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,040
or whatever, having those personal relationships with people above you

875
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,800
are really going to be invaluable.

876
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,640
I think you got to think of it as like part of your job.

877
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,480
You could also, I don't know, find a fatigue disease.

878
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,640
Something that's not like deadly or life-threatening and like doesn't affect it,

879
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
but like just kind of makes you sleepy.

880
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,040
A fatigue?

881
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,800
Like say you have an iron deficiency.

882
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,680
Fatigue disease?

883
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Like, like African sleeping sickness.

884
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,800
Is this a, is this a go-to thing for you?

885
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,240
Have you done this before?

886
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,280
Have you pulled this move?

887
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,400
You came out with that move pretty quick, I think.

888
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
You know, you got mono.

889
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,880
I've got stereo.

890
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,920
It's double bad.

891
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,520
I'm sleepy all the time.

892
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,240
I got to go.

893
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,160
Thank you for the breadsticks though.

894
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,040
They were really good.

895
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,080
You got that from kissing.

896
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,360
I got mine from fucking.

897
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,760
It's called stereo.

898
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,600
Wait, that's a great idea.

899
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,280
At the dinner, just make such awkward conversation that they don't ask you to come back.

900
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,960
Prefer you not be there.

901
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,680
That's good.

902
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
That's that hold on.

903
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,080
What's that smell?

904
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,600
I smells like a recipe for success for in business.

905
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,320
So it smells like a recipe for business success.

906
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,800
Who we got a promotion coming up.

907
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,680
Who should we give it to?

908
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,160
I don't know.

909
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,280
Weird Mike.

910
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,720
Yeah, yeah.

911
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,800
Let's give it to jam.

912
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,720
Let's give it to ostracized jam.

913
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,400
That guy seems all right.

914
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,000
Jamalton.

915
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,440
Jamalton, we need to have a talk.

916
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,800
You said some shit during that party that I have never heard before.

917
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,560
I have never been a party to that kind of talk.

918
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,320
And frankly, I love it.

919
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,040
You're hired.

920
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,360
You're hired.

921
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,080
Double hired.

922
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,840
You're already hired.

923
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,720
You're hired twice.

924
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,680
Here's two paychecks.

925
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,880
Now get out of here.

926
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,160
Jamalton, you scamp.

927
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,520
Scampelton.

928
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,200
I know it's not like it's not super fun, but you gotta do it.

929
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,720
Cause like people notice that stuff and they know when someone's just there.

930
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,640
It's all about the money.

931
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,320
For the teasers.

932
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,280
That's the tricky thing.

933
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,560
You can't just go.

934
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,160
I think you really got to invest.

935
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,560
You got to go and you got to like bring your A.

936
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,680
Get your hands dirty.

937
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,760
Well, cause here the fact of the matter is like the underbelly is in any type of job.

938
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,720
You get promoted cause people like you.

939
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,200
Like you could be really awesome at your job.

940
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,840
But if you're that, you know, quiet, creepy guy in the corner, they're not going to bump you up.

941
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,680
They don't want to spend more time with you.

942
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:00,720
You know what I mean?

943
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,160
They're like, oh yeah, he's great at his job.

944
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,160
So we're going to keep him right there because he's doing such a great job.

945
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,320
But charming Jim over there.

946
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,760
We want to find out more about this charming Jim fellow, right?

947
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,880
We want to elevate him.

948
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah.

949
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,840
We want to put him on a pedestal so we can just be a radiated by his charm.

950
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,040
Be a radio.

951
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,360
You want to be a radiated by charm is what you're saying.

952
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,560
Yeah, by by charming Jim's charm by Jim charm.

953
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,520
And Jamalton, we want to keep right where he's at Jamalton.

954
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,560
You're fine over there.

955
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,160
Actually, can you just over a little just over a little bit?

956
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,520
Scooch a little over.

957
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,240
I'll say when.

958
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,760
Keep going.

959
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,200
Perfect.

960
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,560
Do you guys know what day it is?

961
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,600
Oh, God damn it.

962
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:47,840
Yep.

963
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,120
Oh, fuck.

964
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,880
It is May now.

965
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:58,720
I wanted this to be a official swoop in Osama's poon month.

966
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,680
But that might be in poor taste.

967
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,440
Brought to you by the Red White and Blue.

968
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,440
Some people aren't down with the present that the Red White and Blue brought.

969
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,760
And that's fine.

970
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,400
Who brought this to the potluck?

971
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,760
Oh, that's courtesy of the Red White and Blue.

972
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,400
Who brought this dead ass assassinated terrorist to the potluck?

973
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,280
Wasn't me.

974
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,480
I brought the potatoes.

975
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,320
I got to go down the list, though, because I didn't pick it.

976
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,080
Oh, good, good.

977
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,040
Carrots and cauliflower.

978
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:28,800
Not month.

979
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,600
That's just it.

980
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,280
That's just the title of it.

981
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,400
Just carrots and cauliflower.

982
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:32,560
Yes.

983
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:34,960
Baby names.

984
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,400
Get caught reading month.

985
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:37,680
Yes.

986
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,360
What are you doing over there?

987
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,040
Oh, knock first.

988
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,360
International audit month.

989
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,560
Yay, my favorite.

990
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,920
Let's all celebrate.

991
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,960
We did it.

992
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,880
Nope, you did it wrong.

993
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,600
I want to reject the premise of that month.

994
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,320
I don't think that what do we need to be aware that happens.

995
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,040
You know, I think this every month, but do you pay a fee to get one of these titles?

996
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,760
Like, do you send it?

997
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
I think it's like buying a star to name after you.

998
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,280
It's just sort of, you can't.

999
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,240
You know what I love?

1000
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,760
Carrots and cauliflower.

1001
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:14,240
Yeah.

1002
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,320
We need a month to celebrate.

1003
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,560
You probably should slap month on the end of that.

1004
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,920
Don't you think, Susan?

1005
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,040
No, no.

1006
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,240
I wish people would make fun of me for talking about carrots and cauliflower so much.

1007
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,720
What I need is a whole month where I can really just get down deep and also fuck broccoli.

1008
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,160
National salsa month in parentheses, the food.

1009
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,680
Oh, good.

1010
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,480
Oh, Jesus.

1011
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,240
I just got my dancing shoes on.

1012
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
I'm glad I get to put instead my tasting tongue.

1013
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,400
Prepare tomorrow's parents month.

1014
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,840
That's what we do every week here.

1015
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,760
I think we don't have a month for that.

1016
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,960
Teen CEO month.

1017
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,040
Oh, God.

1018
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,760
Like Bieber, right?

1019
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,400
Huh?

1020
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,360
Like Bieber?

1021
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,000
Like Bieber is the CEO of Bieber Industries?

1022
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,320
Yeah.

1023
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:12,240
Yeah, where did this company go wrong?

1024
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,640
Maybe it was the milkshake machine.

1025
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,520
This is mysterious.

1026
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,040
React month.

1027
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:19,120
Bang.

1028
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:19,680
What was that?

1029
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,760
I don't know.

1030
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,480
I'll tell you in May.

1031
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,560
National hamburger month, national barbecue month, a lot of food.

1032
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,000
I don't know.

1033
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,480
I don't know.

1034
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,920
I need a whole month for hamburgers.

1035
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,960
Like I'm pretty much up on those on the reg.

1036
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,560
I made a hamburger last week on a grill.

1037
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,480
I'm celebrating national hamburger a year.

1038
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,840
I'm celebrating national hamburger life.

1039
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,600
What about eco driving month?

1040
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,880
There's got to be some tips.

1041
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,400
There's got to be some tips and tricks.

1042
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
Guys, you might have to dip into the weekly observances.

1043
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,880
Please don't, Christ.

1044
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,400
Teen CEO month.

1045
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,160
Let's do it.

1046
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,360
Let's do it. Let's let's help spread awareness.

1047
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:11,120
Did you know that May 8th through 14th is national a salute to mom's 35 plus week?

1048
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,200
What?

1049
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,040
Did you know that May 9th through the 13th is national etiquette week?

1050
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,080
I don't.

1051
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,280
I can't do these weeks with you.

1052
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,160
Did you know that May 15th through the 21st is national dog bite prevention week?

1053
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,000
Hey, you, you're about to be bitten by a dog.

1054
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,400
Don't let that don't let that happen to you.

1055
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,400
I I'm just looking for I'm just looking forward to July, which is, of course, national.

1056
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,640
Admit this bit you've been trying to make work for six months isn't panning out so well.

1057
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,640
It's failing me now.

1058
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,000
You think you're not looking at you're not looking forward to that one?

1059
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,760
It's like an amnesty where you can admit like, ah, well, we'll give it our best shot.

1060
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,120
I'm going to be straight with you guys this entire time as you've been talking about the weeks and

1061
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,920
I swear I have, in fact, been picturing teen CEOs and like Mr.

1062
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,880
Brad rolling in to the boardroom on a skateboard and saying like, now there's a skateboard room.

1063
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,560
Let's do teen CEO month.

1064
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,480
Mr. Brad?

1065
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,280
Yeah, because that's what he has everyone call him.

1066
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,200
He's like, Mr. Johnson is my father.

1067
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:11,920
Call me Mr.

1068
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,400
Brad.

1069
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,560
Let's start.

1070
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,440
Let's start.

1071
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,960
OK, I already started.

1072
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,520
OK, but in in the form of a PSA, please.

1073
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,200
OK.

1074
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,360
Hey, hey, teen CEOs, they're just like regular CEOs.

1075
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,280
Regular CEOs only shorter.

1076
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,280
My brother, my brother.

1077
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,200
Teen CEOs.

1078
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,440
They'll get dumped and lay off the whole mailroom.

1079
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,160
Teen CEOs.

1080
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,800
As long as your CFO is a grown up, this should be OK.

1081
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,400
Teen CEOs because an adult would want to run everything his way.

1082
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,280
My brother, my brother.

1083
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,440
Make that one is specific to Charlie the Junko Factory, by the way.

1084
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,800
Teen CEOs.

1085
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
Good luck sleeping your way to the top, felon.

1086
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,280
Can I just talk more about Mr.

1087
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,780
Brad?

1088
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,440
Tired of shaggy songs not being pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

1089
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,640
Try a teen CEO.

1090
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,400
He loves that shorty one.

1091
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,400
I wish I had more modern references to dip into.

1092
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:24,000
Shaggy is the most modern you can go.

1093
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,280
Shaggy is about as modern as I can go in terms of music.

1094
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,680
If you want to hear more limp biscuit.

1095
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,240
Is there one called Disco Panic?

1096
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,200
Is that is that an outfit that the kids are listening to?

1097
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,880
Yeah, that is that is a pop punk outfit.

1098
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,380
All right.

1099
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,720
So you want you want to hear more Disco Panic pumped into your office 24 hours a day?

1100
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,960
If you want to hear more brown eyed peas, hire a teen CEO.

1101
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,280
Maybe they'll get Fergie to come do some motivational work.

1102
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,120
That would be inspiring, I think.

1103
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,080
Will.i.am come and help everybody get their group back?

1104
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,120
How about this?

1105
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,620
OK.

1106
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,800
Teen CEO.

1107
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,440
Profits are down 15%, but angst is up by 20%.

1108
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,240
I cut expenses just to feel.

1109
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,480
Oh, shit, try again.

1110
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,080
Try to save the last minute.

1111
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,600
Make this bit worth it.

1112
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,720
Do you have any killer Yahoos?

1113
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,480
I've got one.

1114
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,800
Yeah, how about this?

1115
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,320
This one was sent in by Toastrack.

1116
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,080
Thanks, Toastrack.

1117
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:43,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Angela, who asks, is it dangerous to shoot a pregnant kangaroo

1118
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,560
with a tranquilizer?

1119
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,760
Dangerous for the mom.

1120
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,260
Urgent.

1121
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,160
Dangerous for the mama kangaroo and Joey Fetus, I mean.

1122
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,640
I'm moving to Australia.

1123
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,920
If you guys get out to the Catskills this year, make sure to check out Joey Fetus.

1124
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:00,720
He is not.

1125
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,640
He has got a Frank Sinatra tribute show that will knock you on your ass.

1126
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:10,000
Joey Fetus and his mama kangaroos are playing all good this year, and I can't wait for those

1127
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,800
jam sashes.

1128
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,880
They late on 30-minute jam sashes at a time.

1129
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,960
I'm moving to Australia, and I'm domesticating a kangaroo.

1130
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,560
I don't care what the authorities say.

1131
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,400
They're so cute.

1132
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,560
They look like giant puppy rodents.

1133
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,080
I'm going to hug one so bad.

1134
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,920
Holy shit.

1135
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Well, maybe I won't do that, but at least I want to hug a kangaroo before I die.

1136
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,320
Do you think kangaroos are cute?

1137
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,960
You will hug a kangaroo right before you die.

1138
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,120
Seconds before you die.

1139
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,440
Have you ever seen a kangaroo's talons?

1140
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,200
They will kick a hole right through you.

1141
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:52,640
I love this because it's like, I fucking love kangaroos so much.

1142
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,200
They're like human-sized puppies that you can hug.

1143
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,800
I love them so much that I want to shoot one with a tranquilizer gun, destroying the Joey

1144
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,080
Fetus inside of it.

1145
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:07,040
That's how much my love is so boundless that I just want to destroy it.

1146
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,440
I love the phrase, you know, I don't care what the authorities say.

1147
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,640
It's like, well, you should.

1148
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,240
In general, rules like don't hug a kangaroo aren't like the man keeping you down.

1149
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,760
Are they hoping that the tranquilizer dart will kill the Joey Fetus?

1150
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,880
I think they're worried.

1151
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,400
Is that what you're telling me?

1152
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:32,160
They have a list, a scrolled out list, and it's called Operation Hug a Kangaroo, and

1153
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:40,560
the list is incapacitate the kangaroo using an incapacitation gun and then hug its lifeless

1154
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,000
body, hug its sleeping corpse.

1155
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,320
So first of all, that's not going to be very satisfying.

1156
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,000
Second of all, you don't fucking care if you kill a baby kangaroo while you do it.

1157
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,640
Like, I'll kill a kangaroo if it means I get to hug another one.

1158
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,320
That's the trade off you're willing to make.

1159
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,880
To hug a kangaroo, you got to bring a few kangaroos.

1160
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,760
Yeah, you can't make a kangaroo omelet.

1161
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,840
That's what I always say.

1162
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,200
I want to get that cross stitch.

1163
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,560
Can't hug a kangaroo without killing a few infant kangaroos.

1164
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,360
You know what I like, though?

1165
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,440
Hug safaris.

1166
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,000
Why not?

1167
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,440
Why not?

1168
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,240
Get in my Jeep.

1169
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,280
We're going to go shoot some lions, and then you can hug them while they're down.

1170
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,080
You see that giraffe?

1171
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,640
Do whatever.

1172
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,880
We'll take pictures of you riding them and get a picture of it draped around your shoulders.

1173
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,360
You see that giraffe?

1174
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:29,920
Whatever.

1175
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,320
Fuck it.

1176
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,240
God's creatures are your playthings.

1177
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,520
You see that giraffe?

1178
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:38,880
When he's awake and bucking, he's not good for hugs, but when he's incapacitated, when

1179
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,160
he's asleep, when he's laying on the ground, that neck is made for hugging.

1180
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,360
It's perfect.

1181
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,000
You can get like 12 huggers on that at one time.

1182
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,440
Stand that neck back up and give it some hugs, you silly goof.

1183
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,840
The cruelest joke God ever played was hanging the most huggable necks so high up that we

1184
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,480
can't reach them.

1185
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,960
You see that giraffe, and you just want to get all up on him.

1186
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,760
You could hug him.

1187
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,560
You could slide down, give him a slidey hug.

1188
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,200
Slidey hug.

1189
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,400
I'm just going to throw this out there.

1190
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,440
Okay, science, explain to me why evolution hasn't given us really long hugging arms to

1191
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,240
hug the giraffe.

1192
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,640
Yeah, science.

1193
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,160
Science if you're so smart.

1194
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:22,240
But wait, on the flip side, God, why didn't you give me arms long enough to hug a giraffe?

1195
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,840
This how you do me?

1196
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,480
I gotta make a tiny apple tree in my yard and just hope that one day a giraffe comes

1197
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,600
and bends his neck down.

1198
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,280
Now I'm left drugging kangaroos and looking at giraffes and dreaming.

1199
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:39,520
Yeah.

1200
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,480
God made you drug that kangaroo.

1201
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,760
God made you do it.

1202
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,600
God made kangaroos slower or weaker, then you could have just hugged him and not even

1203
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,160
sweated.

1204
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:52,720
God, why didn't you give me a chest able to withstand a kangaroo kick so that I could

1205
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:53,200
hug him?

1206
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,520
God, I'm dead and I'm in heaven because I got kicked in the chest by a kangaroo.

1207
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,560
All I wanted was a hug.

1208
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,520
This how you do me?

1209
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,280
Thanks, God.

1210
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,840
You couldn't give me-

1211
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,400
On the flip side, my bucket list did get finished.

1212
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,360
At the skin of my teeth.

1213
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,760
Speaking of which, I have some kangaroo skin in my teeth.

1214
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,200
That is unpleasant.

1215
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,760
Take this out.

1216
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,600
I do not enjoy that.

1217
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,960
This is Then My Brother, My Brother Meets An Advice Show For The Modern Era.

1218
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,480
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1219
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,920
But first, real quick housekeeping.

1220
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,680
Nothing major going on right now.

1221
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,320
nbnbam.com is our website.

1222
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,240
You can go there to find old shows.

1223
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,520
We need to get a link out there for if you don't have iTunes and you want to listen to

1224
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,760
some old shows, we'll put that up on our tweet-o this week.

1225
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,480
We tweeted it before.

1226
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,200
We'll tweet it again.

1227
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,320
We'll tweet it again.

1228
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:49,360
If you get a second to email us, you got a question, a query, nbnbam at maximumfun.org.

1229
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,600
You can also send any Yahoo answers you find right there.

1230
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,120
Also, we haven't pimp this in a while.

1231
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,920
If you want to do one of the promotional spots, if you want to get taken to the Money Town,

1232
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,360
shoot an email to Teresa at maximumfun.org.

1233
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:05,040
That's T-H-E-R-E-S-A at maximumfun.org there.

1234
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,600
$100 for a personal message, $200 for a commercial message, and we'll fucking,

1235
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,480
we'll do you up right.

1236
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,120
We'll give you a jingle and we'll talk some shit about your shit.

1237
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,400
And we will literally endorse anything.

1238
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,760
We will endorse anything.

1239
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,560
And this is official.

1240
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,400
I'm looking, I'm going to try to find a Millwall FC t-shirt that I can wear in public.

1241
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,720
So this is real for me.

1242
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,360
This is real.

1243
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,160
That's about all we've got going on.

1244
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,040
Send your questions.

1245
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:40,000
If you get a second to tell a buddy about the show, say hi to this thing

1246
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,440
that you would like, go to this website and check it out or, you know,

1247
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,880
burn them a CD or something or put a bunch of them on a thumb drive.

1248
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,600
Those are cheap now.

1249
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,840
You know, something to get them into the world so you can share it with them

1250
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,680
and talk about the show with them.

1251
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,600
That would be, that would be awesome.

1252
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,360
How about some shout outs?

1253
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,480
How about my boy Stephen Strom out there on the Twitter box making that happen?

1254
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,200
Ed Fail, a new convert, I think, who's out there talking us up.

1255
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,640
Oh yeah, he's been all about it.

1256
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,600
Let's give it up for Kyle Hillard.

1257
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,840
He's in the mix.

1258
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,640
And I want to throw out, I'm glad that Edizzle on Twizzler also agreed with me

1259
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,640
that Tristan is a hero and Tristan killed us.

1260
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,600
Tristan fucking got it done.

1261
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,560
And also, I just want to say thanks to everybody who's posted pictures on Twitter

1262
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,640
of their MBMBAM tote bags.

1263
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,120
Yeah.

1264
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,840
I'm loving it.

1265
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,200
Not only are they out there in the world repping stuff.

1266
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,400
Haven't seen any pictures of a dog and cat in the tote bag,

1267
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,640
which I have to say I'm a little disappointed about.

1268
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,280
Yeah.

1269
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,680
Now I'm going to-

1270
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,440
Which would you rather have, a dog and cat in a tote bag,

1271
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,640
a tote bag full of guinea pigs or a Joey fetus in a tote bag?

1272
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,520
That's what I'm saying.

1273
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,400
Not a Joey fetus.

1274
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,000
I want to see, I want a tote with a full grown Joey in it.

1275
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,400
Yeah.

1276
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Now is that the entire series of Joey on DVD?

1277
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,600
You want to get creative?

1278
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,400
It's up to you.

1279
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,680
If you have a friend named Joey-

1280
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,600
If you have a friend named Joey, put that bag on his head.

1281
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,560
Who's in there?

1282
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,040
Who's in there?

1283
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:13,040
Joey.

1284
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,480
He has to wear a name tag or something so I can know, I can finish, you know?

1285
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,320
So, oh, if you want to tweet about the show, make sure you use that MBMBAM hashtag

1286
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,680
and spread the word.

1287
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,720
So anyway, Griffin, I'm ready.

1288
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:30,960
This is so appropriate to our last question.

1289
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,600
It was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

1290
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,320
Thank you, Johnny B.

1291
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Mary Martin, who asks,

1292
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:45,200
if God is all good, why did he let me diarrhea in my pants on the Ferris wheel at the fair?

1293
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,000
This is how you do me.

1294
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,200
I'm Justin McElroy.

1295
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1296
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,200
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1297
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,720
You've been my brother, my brother.

1298
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,680
Make sure you kiss your dad.

1299
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,640
Because we're on the lips.

1300
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,400
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1301
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,360
Keep your heart.

1302
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:07,520
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1303
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,560
Keep your heart.

1304
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,840
Man, these girls are smart.

1305
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,680
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1306
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:28,880
Three Stacks, play your part, play your part.
