1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If you get no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If you got no place to go, when the pretty birds have flown

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,360
I mentioned before we begin that this is an advice show for the modern era.

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,960
We offer people advice for free, complimentary advice.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,580
And this first question comes in to us from Justin from West Virginia.

15
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:31,360
He says, if you buy a cereal that is called Cupcake Pebbles and is based on cupcakes,

16
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,440
how do you eat anything else until that box is empty?

17
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,640
That's a great question.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,940
This is so funny because before we started recording the show, you were talking about

19
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,640
the merits of Cupcake Pebbles.

20
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,640
And also your name is Dustin and also you're from West Virginia.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
That's weird.

22
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,320
The coincidence is overwhelming.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,320
That's weird.

24
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
You're right.

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
We should skip this question.

26
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,940
I think it might be a prank.

27
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,520
This first question comes in from Allen via Gmail.

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,200
Allen asks, this year I'm running for the office of student body president in my high

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
school.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,960
I'm a popular enough guy, but my opponent has an unfair advantage.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
His name is Adam West.

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Yes.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Believe it or not, his parents named him that.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,880
How the hell could I compete against his name on the ballot?

35
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,480
I would maybe ask his parents to adopt you and give you an equally awesome name because

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,920
they sound like awesome kid namers.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
They know what's up.

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,600
They know how to pick a good name.

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,280
The only better name would have been Jim West Desperado.

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,520
Rough Rider?

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,520
You know what, Nana?

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,040
I would say run on a very heavy Smilax based campaign.

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,320
The best thing you could do is change your name to something high school kids like more

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,720
than Adam West.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,640
What if you had your name legally changed to Free Milkshakes and the Calf?

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
That's not what kids are good at.

47
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,000
All kids, all high school kids want Free Milkshakes and the Calf.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No, no.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're all about Facebook.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
How about Twilight Bieber?

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
They're all about Facebook and Whippets now.

52
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't know what's going on.

53
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Free Milkshake.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
Let me hit you with this.

55
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,160
Milkshake, Facebook, Whippets for your student body president.

56
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
In the Calf.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,560
You know what, we failed to take into account that he might be running against the actual

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
Adam West.

59
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,520
Adam West has returned to high school to beat this kid in the student body president race.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,000
Perhaps he's time traveling.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,880
Maybe if this kid becomes student body president, maybe if Allen becomes student body president,

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:40,440
he'll, I don't know, create some sort of horrifying legislation that dooms the planet.

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,440
So maybe Adam West has traveled back forward in time to beat him.

64
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,200
To put forward, to put right what once went wrong, is what you're saying.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,560
An anonymous question from Form Spring, and it's a good one.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Throughout the course of the workday, my shirt comes untucked, but only on the sides of my

67
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,920
shirt by my hip bones.

68
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,720
Any advice on how to keep that part tucked in?

69
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
Two words.

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,720
Shirt garters.

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Shirt garters.

72
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
Shirt garters.

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,600
I was going to say, get yourself, what were those things that fine gentlemen would wear

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,880
in the 1800s?

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,480
And they were, it was basically a onesie where your bloomers and your t-shirt would be the

76
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
same.

77
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
I believe it was called a frockle.

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
A frockle.

79
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,320
I know exactly what you're talking about Griffin.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,040
It's called an anti-masturbation belt.

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,560
Yeah, sure.

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,480
Or an anti-anything you need access to your genitalia for because this whole thing would

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,400
cover up your whole situation down there.

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,680
My frockle has been strained lately.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
I meant to tell you guys that.

86
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Do you find that happening a lot?

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,260
The problem is the frockle, you're putting a lot of pressure on the frockle in a lot

88
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,120
of different places during your usual work routine.

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,760
What you have to do is just consistently buy more and better frockles.

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,040
And Hanes has some amazing new frockle technology that I really love.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,680
Their sport frockles are really nice.

92
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,960
The extended leg frockles, is that what you're talking about?

93
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,480
On another note, untuck your shirt you fucking nerd.

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Whoa.

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,240
How about you get a bigger shirt?

96
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,520
Be careful and make sure that your shirt is the kind that is supposed to be tucked in.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,960
If it's squared at the bottom, it's not designed to be tucked in.

98
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,240
Or are you going to a wedding or a funeral because those are the only two sitches.

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,160
Consider like the Cash Jude Law look, you know?

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Like the Jude Law.

101
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Totally Cash.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,160
Totally Cash.

103
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,240
Got a jacket over a fine button-up, only the button-up's untucked, but the jacket is tucked.

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Okay.

105
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,560
The untucked shirt with the tucked in jacket?

106
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Yeah.

107
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,960
It's difficult to pull off, but I mean if you can swing it.

108
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,480
This question comes from Kevin S. on Yahoo Answers.

109
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,760
He asks, how old do I have to be to get nunchucks?

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Legally?

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,960
I don't know if there is actually a law.

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,160
One of the answers was 21 years old.

113
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,360
It's a very definitive and also probably not correct answer.

114
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,960
Take a shot, buy some nunchucks.

115
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,280
Here's the answer, 45 and still living with your mom.

116
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,520
Another answer is old enough to not want to buy nunchucks.

117
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,400
The moment, so it's like a, it's like a sort of recursive law that's been put in place

118
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,680
where if you are of an age where you want to purchase nunchucks.

119
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
You can now no longer buy nunchucks.

120
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,580
You are too young to buy nunchucks.

121
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,060
So it's constantly in flux.

122
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,520
It changes from person to person.

123
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,400
Like for me, I still am not able to buy nunchucks.

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Yeah.

125
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Because I still really, really want some.

126
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,760
You want them too bad.

127
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
I want them so badly.

128
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,760
I want to have them.

129
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
That's incredible.

130
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:54,080
There's a ridiculously cute girl at Dylan's workplace that he's smitten with.

131
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,020
She flirts with me constantly, he says, and it seems like a genuine interest and attraction

132
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,540
coming from her, but there is a problem.

133
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
She might be married.

134
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
I know.

135
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,040
None of my coworkers know her well enough to say if she's married and she's from another

136
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
department.

137
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I don't know any of her coworkers.

138
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,240
Her desk has a picture of her in a nice dress and a guy in a tux, and she has a thin silver

139
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,520
band on her wedding finger.

140
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,840
What should be my first move to try and figure this out?

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,120
Dylan, great news.

142
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,200
You've already taken the first step.

143
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,280
You've written to us who are promptly going to tell you that she's married.

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Yep.

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,640
That's, yeah, that's too many signs.

146
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
That can't just be.

147
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Yeah.

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,280
Especially since she owns a wedding finger, and you don't get that for not being at a

149
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
wedding.

150
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,280
So.

151
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,220
I, you, no, no, she's married.

152
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,220
Yeah.

153
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,120
Do you remember when Ellen went on vacation for about two weeks last month?

154
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,600
What was that all about?

155
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,220
That seemed like an awfully, she said it was a honeymoon, but I thought that that was like

156
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,220
a joke.

157
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,520
Like a joke, a private joke between her and her coworkers.

158
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,560
I thought it was a joke because she flirts with me constantly, and I didn't get married

159
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
to her.

160
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:20,240
Maybe, maybe you're just a guy at the office who is in charge of pens, and she's always

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,240
trying to get some pens.

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Hey, did you guys get that invitation from Ellen?

163
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
That was funny, right?

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
What was that all about?

165
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,240
Was that a joke?

166
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,240
Was that all about weddings?

167
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
I don't know.

168
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Her weddings?

169
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,240
I don't know what that's all about.

170
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Wedding what?

171
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,240
Who's she marrying?

172
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,520
That's a weird theme for a Cinco de Mayo party, is a wedding.

173
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm not sure I get it.

174
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
She's so quirky, Ellen.

175
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,760
I love her so much.

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,760
This nice dress that she's wearing, Dylan, is it white?

177
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
Is it white, and does it have sort of a doily pattern?

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,960
Is there a kind of a thin fabric covering her face?

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,840
Yeah, like a veiled kind of look.

180
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,440
Is all of her family there, and also her husband's family?

181
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,120
Because that's her husband, because they're at a wedding, and that's a different question.

182
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,440
If her husband comes into work, she isn't married.

183
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
Yeah, she has a husband.

184
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,960
If she was wed, if she took part, if she was proposed to and said yes, and then after planning

185
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,240
a wedding, had the wedding, then she's probably been wed.

186
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,680
She's probably betrothed, is basically the thesis.

187
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,960
Even money, even money.

188
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,160
Tommy Redd, good friend of the family.

189
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
Justin's godfather?

190
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Is that true?

191
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,160
Yeah, he's my godfather.

192
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
What?

193
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
The godfather of your future.

194
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
He's my godfather.

195
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,520
He's your godfather.

196
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:44,720
If something happens to my dad, then me, 29-year-old Justin McElroy, will be adopted by Tommy Redd.

197
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
That is how it works.

198
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,320
I will live with him.

199
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,440
I will leave my wife to live under the care of Tommy Redd.

200
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Justin's daddy says, my seven-year-old and I spend a lot of time in the car listening

201
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,720
to music while commuting across town to her school or mother's house.

202
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,560
She has really impressive taste so far and claims they might be giants, binfolds, tally

203
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,240
ball, no doubt, real big fish, and the President's as her favorites.

204
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,120
I'd like to expose her to more artists and songs that I consider insightful and enjoyable,

205
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
but they use more profanity.

206
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,920
At what point is it okay to say, fuck it, and let your kid listen to whatever they want?

207
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Now.

208
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Fuck it.

209
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
I think it's okay to say fuck it after you count to three.

210
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,480
Justin could you perhaps give me a- One, two, three, and fuck it.

211
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Just like that.

212
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Just like that.

213
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
I'll say this.

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,200
They might be giants, binfolds, she's old enough to make that decision because she's

215
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
awesome.

216
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
She's cooler than I am.

217
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,320
She's cooler than me.

218
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
You know what, Tommy?

219
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,680
I think the bigger question is, when did you forget what fuck it means?

220
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,800
You do realize that fuck it's not like, I thought this over, and now my decision is

221
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
fuck it.

222
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,160
Fuck it means like, fuck it, who cares?

223
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:04,560
I've taken all the variables into account, and the only decision I could come to is fuck

224
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,640
it.

225
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,400
Fuck it.

226
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
That's my decision.

227
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,120
I checked the bubble box that says fuck it next to it.

228
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,760
After weighing all my options- Yes, no, maybe, fuck it.

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
I'm getting it notarized.

230
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,000
At the same time, though, that's the best answer to this question of, my kid is young,

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,560
should I let her listen to music with cursing in it?

232
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,160
The absolute correct answer is fuck it, yeah, sure, why not?

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,680
Let her hear those words so that she'll learn how to use them better.

234
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,800
I don't think there's a damn thing wrong with profanity.

235
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I love profanity.

236
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Fucking profanity rules.

237
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Shit.

238
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
Right?

239
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
But.

240
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
That shit is awesome.

241
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,400
But I think is the worst curse word.

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Poop, poop, poop.

243
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
You know what I'm saying.

244
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Whoa.

245
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
It's fucking douchey.

246
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Slow down there.

247
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Dick shingles.

248
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
ICP.

249
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Shit around.

250
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Fucking.

251
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
It's great.

252
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Okay.

253
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
That's enough.

254
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Okay.

255
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I hear it a lot.

256
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Let her listen to the last 30 seconds of the show, and then she'll know exactly what

257
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
she's saying.

258
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
She can listen to whatever she wants.

259
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,320
She covered all the bases there, son.

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,160
My lady friend and I are making a mega love mix to proclaim our undying love for one another.

261
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,400
So far we have two songs, Everything I Do, I Do It For You by Bryan Adams, and The Rose

262
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,920
by Bette Midler.

263
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,400
Suggestions would be greatly appreciated, but they must be held to the same standards

264
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,640
as the tunes previously listed.

265
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,800
By same standards, do you mean like Casey and JoJo and that kind of thing?

266
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,600
Like beautiful, soaring.

267
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah.

268
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
I know what Justin's gonna say.

269
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
I don't think you do.

270
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,240
I think I exactly do.

271
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,400
What do you think?

272
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I think you're probably gonna bust out.

273
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,800
I think you need to go with On the Wings of Love by Mr. Jeffrey Osbourne, one of the

274
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
greatest love songs ever written.

275
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,100
I think that we could have a whole series of answers to this question of songs that

276
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,160
people love as love songs that they play at weddings and stuff, but in reality those

277
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,040
songs aren't about really love.

278
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Like Afternoon Delight?

279
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Well no, that's about a different kind of love.

280
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
That's about love in the daytime.

281
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,280
I was talking more about Brick by Ben Folds Five, which people are like, I want that to

282
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,760
be my first wedding dance song.

283
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,840
It's like, that song's about teenage abortion, you need to wise up.

284
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,240
Actually Afternoon Delight would probably be appropriate for this list.

285
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Here we go.

286
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Can you imagine?

287
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:42,200
It's the two of you looking into each other's eyes, on the bird, the sweet honey-dipped

288
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:49,840
baritone of Mr. Jeffrey Osbourne, pumping from the birds, the hollow legs of the bird

289
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,080
are echoing with the sounds of Jeffrey Osbourne, can you even imagine?

290
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,080
I think that would be powerful.

291
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,160
Do you realize how much we're going to have to pay to, I think that's Sony Music Unlimited

292
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,760
Very pricey.

293
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,760
For that one 30 second clip, it'll be totally worth it though.

294
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:13,840
Hey, Yahoo Answers user Mega, in the baby names category, has a very, it sounds like

295
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,920
an important question, because it's going to be the moniker of her child, and it's five

296
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:29,240
names, and I'm just going to list them off, and you say which one you endorse.

297
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:42,720
Joseph, thought, born, Travis likes it, Justin not so much, Joseph, that's J-O-S-E-P.

298
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,480
Okay, shorter.

299
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,160
Shorter, Travis?

300
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,920
I like it, maybe it's, I like the first one better, but keep going.

301
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,440
Okay, so Travis is for number one, Joseph, Justin you're for Joseph.

302
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,440
Number three, Jessup, that's J-E-S-S-U-P, Jessup.

303
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Okay.

304
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,320
Jessup, okay, that's my favorite so far.

305
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Yeah.

306
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,320
Travis, have you changed?

307
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,320
Yeah, I'm going to go with Jessup.

308
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,080
What is it about Jessup that you guys like so much?

309
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,680
He sounds like a fun guy, right?

310
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Yeah.

311
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
What's Jessup up to tonight?

312
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Jessup.

313
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,560
So you guys like Jessup with a U-P, how do you feel about Jessup with O-P, J-E-S-S-U-P?

314
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,160
It sounds like he's going to tell me some fables.

315
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,200
Yeah, it sounds fable-y.

316
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:33,520
You think Jessup has a more, like, archaic sort of, no, I know, like, yeah, more artsy,

317
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,200
artsy name, while Jessup knows how to have a good time, Jessup is just, he wants to teach

318
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,920
you about old literature.

319
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Final one being Jesse.

320
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,320
Joseph, Joseph, Jessup, Jessop, or Jesse?

321
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Final vote.

322
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Um.

323
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
All of them.

324
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
All of them.

325
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,760
Like, what about, what about, uh, Joseph.

326
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,600
What about Joseph, Joseph, Jessup, Jessop, Jesse?

327
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
The third.

328
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Mega.

329
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Mega.

330
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
What about Mega-Jessup?

331
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Mega-Jessup!

332
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,240
Hey, who's that who's currently destroying our town?

333
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
It is Mega-Jessup.

334
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:17,200
To be fair, Jessup is how he starts out, and then he becomes Mega-Jessup.

335
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,040
He evolves into Mega-Jessup.

336
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,040
Don't make him angry.

337
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,880
You wouldn't like him when he's Mega.

338
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,560
I'm just going to throw this out, widen your scope.

339
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Yeah, maybe try some other names.

340
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,440
Like Adam West.

341
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Like Adam West.

342
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,680
Zerex asks from Twitter, he says, I do not drink and I find it hard to be enthused as

343
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,760
others during the token, as others during the token bar night.

344
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,800
I feel like I'm missing out, guys.

345
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Help.

346
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Oh, don't feel like you miss, you are missing out.

347
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Just know it.

348
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Know that you are.

349
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Just know.

350
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
No feelings involved.

351
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Just knowledge.

352
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
That's a fact.

353
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,120
Zerex, that's not good enough, man.

354
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,800
Here's the thing, you're at a bar that you, you might as well go to the Matrix and climb

355
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,120
underneath the seats and cover your ears and close your eyes and eat, just dump your face

356
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,720
in a popcorn bucket and say, I'm not enjoying this movie out loud, because like, you're

357
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,560
not, you're in a movie theater.

358
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,120
You would also, you would look less weird doing that than you would if you were at a

359
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,120
bar and not drinking.

360
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
Yeah.

361
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,480
Uh, the only other option I could tell you is eat like a giant meat filled sandwich

362
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
and hopefully you'll get meat drunk.

363
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Oh.

364
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
That's great.

365
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Yeah.

366
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,800
I say I was pretty good myself.

367
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
I've never thought of that.

368
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,080
There are some nights where I legitimately feel like getting drunk.

369
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,720
Like I don't feel like drinking, but I want to, I want to alter my state of consciousness

370
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,600
and you know, I've been sober from the meth for about three or four years now, so meat

371
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,680
might be the best option.

372
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,980
Meat is God's drug.

373
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,160
Meat is nature's drug.

374
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,240
Why not, uh, the next time you're out with your friends, do a tab of acid, flip the table,

375
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,800
call them pussies, blackout.

376
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,320
That would be awesome.

377
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,840
If your friends are giving you shit for not drinking whenever you go to the bars, just

378
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:19,160
one night, go out with them and get violently, dangerously, like horrifyingly drunk and like

379
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,440
just crash a car and put like one of them into like a short coma, but a respectable

380
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
coma.

381
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,280
And then next time you're out and they're like, they will never be like, Hey, you want

382
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,280
to drink?

383
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,800
But they also will never be like, Hey, want to hang out?

384
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,000
Next time they don't want to hang out with you because they need a DD because you're

385
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
crazy.

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,240
It's like Jessup up in here.

387
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Like he's crazy like a Jessup is what I'm saying, but in the future, whenever you're

388
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,600
like, I'm just going to not drink tonight, everyone's going to be like, okay, that's

389
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,180
an idea for you.

390
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,120
You need to stop drinking.

391
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,040
How you operate, but seriously start drinking on a similar, on speaking of starting drinking,

392
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:01,480
uh, Kyle on Gmail says it is my 21st birthday next Tuesday, May 11th.

393
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,960
I would like to go to the bars for the first time at midnight, the Monday night beforehand

394
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
to celebrate.

395
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,840
So tonight, right tonight, however, however, I have a very difficult final exam the next

396
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,840
day that I really should study for and be fully rested.

397
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,840
What should I do?

398
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,

399
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,840
shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots,

400
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,400
shots, obviously Kyle, get out to that bar, put that textbook down, replace that

401
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,440
textbook with a big stein of party liquor and then just get it done because that's

402
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
what you need to do.

403
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Little known college rule, and this is in every rule book on every college campus.

404
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,080
If it is your birthday, you automatically pass the final.

405
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,080
You're good.

406
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
You don't even have to worry about it.

407
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,080
Just tell your teacher it's your birthday and walk out.

408
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,960
It's like Chuck E. Cheese, you get a free token.

409
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,520
Bring in a copy of your birth certificate and then sit there for a while like you look

410
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,000
like you're doing the test, but then after 30 minutes, before everybody else because

411
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,120
you still want to look impressive, you pull that copy of the birth certificate out and

412
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,600
you lay it down on the teacher's table and you walk out of the room.

413
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Never check your grade because that'll break it.

414
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,680
You will fail, but you've been doing pretty good for the rest of the class, so I doubt

415
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
it's going to sink you.

416
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,880
A similar rule applies at Pizza Hut.

417
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,600
You can get a free personal pam pizza if you present your birth certificate on your birthday.

418
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,920
College and Pizza Hut are pretty much the same thing.

419
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
I went to Pizza Hut.

420
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
You?

421
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I don't know about you guys.

422
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,480
I was featured in those little pepper packets that they allow you to pour on your pizza.

423
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
What's in those?

424
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
I don't know, but it's spicy as shit.

425
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,480
What?

426
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Burns my mouth.

427
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,760
Griffin failed his final, so he never learned what was in those pepper packets.

428
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Right.

429
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,720
McElroy Brothers, yes, this is all we're talking about now.

430
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,200
McElroy Brothers, this is a theme show.

431
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,640
Do we have a theme block?

432
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,840
I'm turning 21 next Tuesday, okay, and I was hoping you could give me recommendations

433
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,080
on what drinks I should order first.

434
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:03,080
What drink did I order first, or what drink would I suggest he orders first?

435
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,440
I know the first thing you got was a Southern Comfort.

436
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,200
A tall boy of SoCo, like a bucket of SoCo.

437
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,280
It was actually one of those buckets that you use to build sandcastles.

438
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,240
I was in my basement, and I was drinking out of beach toys.

439
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
It was pretty dope.

440
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,680
We did a beer loose down a boogie board.

441
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,720
He's a real jessup.

442
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,920
He's a beach toy junk.

443
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Drinks out of beach toys.

444
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,920
Exclusively.

445
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,080
Exclusively out of beach toys and snorkels.

446
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,200
Big frosty glass of moonshine.

447
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,240
Just moonshine.

448
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,600
The greatest gift of all you can get for your 21st birthday, lots of vision in your right

449
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
eye.

450
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,640
Hey, that's not funny.

451
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
Hey, that's not funny.

452
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,160
Let's all just say our favorite that he should get.

453
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,880
I say get a seven and seven.

454
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,880
It is smooth.

455
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
It is mellow.

456
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
It is crisp.

457
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
It is refreshing.

458
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,480
It tastes great, and it gets the job done.

459
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
It's tough to make though.

460
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Difficult to make.

461
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,060
The best drink you can get is the vodka gimlet.

462
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,600
Make sure you get a decent vodka.

463
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,200
I would say a pineapple upside down cake.

464
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,440
It's delicious, and it'll get you effed up right.

465
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,120
Yeah, and it'll be really double great because all your sorority sisters will be super impressed.

466
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,560
Don't even act like you don't love yourself a pineapple upside down cake.

467
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Maybe you can get that cute boy to drink it out of your navel.

468
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,480
Travis, I think you may have misread the question.

469
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,240
That was my first 13-year-old shot, doing a farm and pineapple upside down cake, but

470
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,240
he's turning 21.

471
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
He's a grown ass man.

472
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,720
So I'll give you a second chance.

473
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,000
Troubling news from form spring, guys.

474
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,520
One of our listeners has a meeting in an hour, but it's still hung over.

475
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
We are probably a little late to this.

476
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,080
Or maybe you knew exactly when the show was going to happen.

477
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I know.

478
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I am planning on being hung over Monday morning.

479
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,960
In a week and an hour.

480
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
A speedy reply would be appreciated.

481
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,200
Okay, I can actually answer this one legitimately.

482
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,620
It really isn't any great secret.

483
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,440
The night before, you have to drink water.

484
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,760
Have to drink water and take one ibuprofen.

485
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,360
The next morning, wake up.

486
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Don't sleep in.

487
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Drink a giant glass of water again.

488
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,720
Take two ibuprofen and then go back to sleep for a half hour.

489
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Wake up and you'll feel great.

490
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,880
Justin had me on that regimen.

491
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,760
I came in town a couple of, was it last week?

492
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,200
It was last week, I think, and we went out to a prom and man, I got drunker than I've

493
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,600
been in a long, long time.

494
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,560
And Justin helped me up with a glass of water and an iView, and then in the morning another

495
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,880
glass of water, two iViews, and then I helped dad move.

496
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Like a champ.

497
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
Like a champ.

498
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
What up, dad?

499
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,880
I know you're listening.

500
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,720
I was totally hung over that morning because I got party drunk the night before.

501
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,480
And just to clarify, they didn't impersonate 17-year-olds and go to a prom.

502
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,340
They went to a prom-themed party.

503
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
It's important to note there.

504
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
Well, we went to both.

505
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,420
Before we get to the question.

506
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,080
We can't tell that story on the show.

507
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,200
We got drunk at one and got lucky at the other, so good luck.

508
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,640
Did you guys hear the rumor about Jeff's girlfriend from Gmail?

509
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,640
I did.

510
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,280
It's all over the Twitters.

511
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,440
Everybody's saying, well Jeff specifically is saying, that she snores like a stuffed

512
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,080
up Sigourney Weaver possessed by Gozer, which keeps him from falling asleep.

513
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
What should I do?

514
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Get rid of her.

515
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
She's done.

516
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,080
Catch out.

517
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,800
A man needs his sleep.

518
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,800
He needs his sleep.

519
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
He needs it.

520
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,920
Maybe tell her to sleep somewhere else.

521
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,560
This is so important.

522
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Your sleep.

523
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,160
You gotta get nine to ten every day.

524
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Is Jeff.

525
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Jeff.

526
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
Jeff.

527
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
Jeffrey.

528
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
Jeffrey.

529
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Jeffrey.

530
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,520
Is she Gozer?

531
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,440
Is she legitimately possessed by Gozer?

532
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Because then you have-

533
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
The Gozerian, I mean.

534
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
Yeah.

535
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:10,560
Did she, was she, did she recently somehow become more, I don't know, skanky?

536
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,000
Like Sig, like Sigourney did?

537
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,640
Like kind of glowy skanky though?

538
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,960
Like kind of glowy skanky, like deep dark circles around her eyes, and also she's

539
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,520
boning down on Rick Moranis.

540
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,400
Have you caught her making love to Rick Moranis sleep?

541
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,640
I know at first you thought nothing of it, but it's a problem.

542
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
Right.

543
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Cause who can blame her?

544
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,640
Right?

545
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
He's adorable.

546
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
Look at him.

547
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
He's teeny tiny.

548
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,440
You want to put him in your pocket and just carry him around and say, what up, Rick Moranis?

549
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
Honey, he stole my heart.

550
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,160
My girlfriend snores, and also fucks old cast members of Second City.

551
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
Can you-

552
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Dave Thomas, get out of here.

553
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:53,000
Go make another strange brew Canadian roust about.

554
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:01,880
Yahoo Answers user Shan says, how to turn an iPod touch into an iPhone without jailbreak?

555
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,480
Go back in time and buy an iPhone.

556
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,440
I really want an iPhone, but can't afford it at the moment.

557
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,800
I have an iPod touch, and I really want to try to turn it into an iPhone, but my iPod

558
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
is not jailbroken.

559
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,360
I do not want to jailbreak it, so if anyone has any salutations on how to turn my iPod

560
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,680
touch into an iPhone, I will be very grateful.

561
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Thank you.

562
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Wow.

563
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
Wow.

564
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
Wow.

565
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,920
Future of America right here.

566
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,440
Step one, read the instructions.

567
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,120
Step two, maybe you, maybe, maybe it already is.

568
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,720
Have you tried calling people on it?

569
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,800
Attach your iPod by, with a string, to other iPods, and then it might, you might be able

570
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,840
to get some sort of acoustic effects.

571
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,840
Agoustic?

572
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,840
Agoustic.

573
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Augustus.

574
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,360
Agoustic glue.

575
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,560
Maybe tape your iPhone, maybe tape your iPod to a larger cell phone.

576
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,840
Like an iPhone.

577
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,840
Maybe tape your iPod to an iPhone.

578
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,840
No.

579
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
Get like a track phone.

580
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm trying to find like an economical way for him to do this.

581
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,040
No, I've got it right here.

582
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:06,080
Put your iPod in your pocket, get in your car, drive to the person you want to talk

583
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,800
to, pull your iPod out of your pocket and place it to your ear.

584
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,000
The clarity's going to be awesome, you're going to be able to talk to that friend.

585
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah, but to do that, he would need to jailbreak it, and he doesn't want to jailbreak it.

586
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
Oh, that's true.

587
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,200
Yeah, you wouldn't need to jailbreak it.

588
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Jeff from Gmail.

589
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,400
Two Jeffs in a row?

590
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,440
Jeff Jeff.

591
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,840
And by the way, if you write it in the show, your name's not Jeff.

592
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
No.

593
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
It's Jeffrey.

594
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
It's Jeffrey, or possibly Jessup.

595
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
So Jeffrey.

596
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Or possibly Mega Jessup.

597
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,920
Oh, Mega Jessup.

598
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,360
So I'm accompanying my wife to visit her parents in the coming weeks, and while the visit

599
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:45,140
is usually rather painless, the bed we are relegated to is very noisy.

600
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:50,080
Being relative newlyweds, we still engage in the relations, if you know what I mean,

601
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,880
and was wondering what the etiquette on fooling around in this awkward situation might be,

602
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Jeff.

603
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

604
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
It's going to be okay.

605
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,880
You can still do it, but you got to keep it down here.

606
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,760
I mean, keep it down here.

607
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
You ready for the pleasure?

608
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
You ready for the pleasure?

609
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,000
Meemaw, Meemaw is literally, this wall is stucco.

610
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,440
This wall is completely stucco.

611
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,440
Anything we do, they can probably hear us whispering, going to keep it down here.

612
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
But let's make love.

613
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,800
Listen, I want to show you that our relationship is still as fiery, as fiery as it was when

614
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
we started.

615
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
No.

616
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
No, Jeff.

617
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
No.

618
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Jeff, no.

619
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
No.

620
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
No.

621
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
No.

622
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
I'm married, Jeff.

623
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
Gross, Jeff.

624
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Gross.

625
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
Gross.

626
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Jeff is a grown ass man with grown ass urges.

627
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
I get this.

628
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:52,440
Jeff's got to get himself sassified, and Jeff, noisy bed, adjacent Meemaw, or no, Jeff needs

629
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,800
to get, Jeff needs to get his Jeff off.

630
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Jeff, if your urge to get your Jeff off is not so strong that you have to rent, that

631
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,280
you can't rent a room at the Super 8 away from your Meemaw, then your urge to bed down

632
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,000
is not so strong that it cannot be resisted.

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,160
I'm saying learn how to bone down on the quiet, buy an inflatable mattress, and lay that out,

634
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,800
because that completely obviates the whole squeaky bed issue, and carry that around in

635
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,880
your bag, and then lay that down, and then make sweet, silent love upon it.

636
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,480
Maybe you should approach this problem head on, right?

637
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Here's my plan.

638
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,360
Go to your in-laws, day one, and say, listen, I appreciate you having us.

639
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,820
The bed you've supplied us with is quite loud, and we're afraid that our noise making will

640
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,240
be a ruckus.

641
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,760
So what bed might be quieter that you could accommodate us with?

642
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,560
And also, where can I put my oversized duffel bag with the words lube bag written on it?

643
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,400
Should I put that in, it looked like some spare room in Meemaw's abode.

644
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,600
Should I put it in Meemaw's room?

645
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Will she be offended?

646
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,480
I will need to access it at regular intervals.

647
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,800
What's a lube bag, oh, Meemaw?

648
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,000
Meemaw, don't be coy.

649
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,440
You know exactly what this oil is used for, you old whore.

650
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,480
You old racist whore.

651
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,320
I hate Jeff's Meemaw.

652
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
Jeff's wife's Meemaw, to be fair.

653
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Yahoo!

654
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,000
Answers user Dauntang asks, what happened to all the juggalos?

655
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,600
A few years ago, everywhere I looked, someone was wearing an ICP t-shirt or something with

656
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,680
the hatchet man on it.

657
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:39,160
Now I rarely ever see it, and I feel like the juggalo nation is starting to diminish.

658
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,440
How many of us juggalos and juggalettes are left?

659
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,760
And if you're a juggalo, please tell me.

660
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,920
Shouts out.

661
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,960
I saw my first hatchet man bumper sticker yesterday.

662
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Who is this hatchet?

663
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
I don't know.

664
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
He's like their logo.

665
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,400
He's got kind of the sideshow bob haircut, and he's got a hatchet, and it looks like

666
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,240
he's sprinting.

667
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
It's a nightmare.

668
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
To where?

669
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,240
It sounds terrifying.

670
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,760
He's sprinting to the dollar store to buy as many economy-sized bottles of Faygo that

671
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,640
he can fit in his fucking Vespa.

672
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,680
The bad news is there's been a juggalo rapture, and you've been left behind.

673
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:25,440
If you didn't believe strong enough in Shaggy 2 Dope and Murder Guy, Murder Man.

674
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,720
You can read all about it in Juggalo Kirk Cameron's Juggalo book, Juggalo Left Behind.

675
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm just kidding.

676
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,920
You can't read.

677
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:40,720
Be sure to get the audiobook version read by Jeff Goldblum.

678
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Also, you're so stupid, and the band you listen to is stupid, and the society that you've

679
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,600
created is the dumbest thing ever.

680
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,000
All the juggalos and juggalettes have gone underground to wait it out.

681
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,320
I don't want to ostracize any people groups that might listen to our show, but if you

682
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,120
listen to our show and you're a juggalo, just die.

683
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,400
Just go somewhere where you can die quickly and comfortably.

684
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,520
Are you not down with the clown?

685
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
No.

686
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,400
No, I'm so far up with the clown that I can't even see the clown anymore because I've evolved

687
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,600
so far above it because they're the worst band.

688
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,080
Gryffin, as we talk about this, I've actually drawn a little Venn diagram here of our listener

689
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,800
base and the juggalos and juggalettes, and unfortunately, those two guys in the middle

690
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,760
are going to be really upset at what you just said.

691
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,440
But those two guys are the guys from Insane Clown Posse.

692
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah.

693
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,440
I offended them personally on a very personal level.

694
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,320
Thank you, Murderfella and Shaggy and Shagtooth.

695
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,640
Murderpants and Shag- Mega Jessup?

696
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,640
That is the only...

697
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:54,080
If I ever met someone who was of the Church of the Clown and I said, oh, great, and I

698
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,220
knew he was one of them because of the face paint and the illiteracy, then I would turn

699
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,720
away and I would not want to talk to him until I asked his name.

700
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,080
If he said, Jessup, I would want to party.

701
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,080
What are you doing tonight, Jessup?

702
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
What are you doing tonight?

703
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,080
Party liquor?

704
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,080
Party liquor.

705
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,080
Drinking out of Beach Toys?

706
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,080
That's what your first drink needs to be.

707
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:23,720
One part Boone's Farm, one smart Faygo, and then just a bullet and a gun.

708
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,520
And the courage to do what's right.

709
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,880
Liam on Gmail asks, how do I find out who I am?

710
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,580
As a teenager, I thought this question only existed as a convenient replacement for a

711
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,920
plot and protagonist has amnesia type movies, but as I progressed through young adulthood,

712
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,200
I've realized how important the answer is.

713
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,240
The three of you come across as people who have gotten a handle on who you are.

714
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,880
How the hell do I do that?

715
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,400
Just hang out with us.

716
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,560
Liam, maybe you got it right the first time and maybe your life is getting a little hacky.

717
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,980
Maybe it is only a plot and protagonist has amnesia type movies and maybe the writers

718
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,520
on your life are starting to get a little lazy.

719
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,480
Maybe they're on strike.

720
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,760
Did you hit your head recently after all remembering things?

721
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,440
Do you have tattoos on your body of things that you've learned?

722
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,160
I spent so long since I've seen that movie, I can't make jokes at its expense.

723
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,440
So Liam, this seems like a serious question, so I want to bring it down here.

724
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,440
It doesn't matter.

725
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,680
It doesn't matter what you're like.

726
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,280
Stop worrying about that.

727
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Get interested in other people.

728
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
And don't be an asshole.

729
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,720
Trying to figure out what you're like is not going to get you anywhere, man.

730
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,680
Get interested in other folks and that's the best way to define yourself.

731
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Just find somebody.

732
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,680
You know what, Liam?

733
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,680
I like you for you.

734
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,680
Me too.

735
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:43,680
I think you're great.

736
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I just wanted to throw that out there.

737
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,680
You've got a cool name.

738
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Yeah.

739
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,680
You're right there.

740
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:55,280
Hey, I've been thinking about doing this thing where I think everybody, maybe not everybody,

741
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:00,760
I would say 95% of the people who listen to podcasts listen to them hoping that the people

742
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,800
on the show will at some point just randomly just say their name and call them out.

743
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,160
So I think it would be great if just throughout the course of the show with no explanation

744
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,240
or pretense, we just said, like, Kyle Collis.

745
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,920
Like Kyle Collis would hear it in his car.

746
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,080
Andrew Bardsley.

747
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,560
Like they're in the car right now and they're hearing it and they're with their friends

748
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,520
and they're just like Matt McCormick and they're freaking out.

749
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,760
Josephine Luna.

750
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
What is going on?

751
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Okay.

752
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I got one.

753
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Gary Sinise.

754
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,880
Gary Sinise is freaking the fuck out right now.

755
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,280
We've got to give a shout out to our man Craig Bierko.

756
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
Oh yeah.

757
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
He's a big fan.

758
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,240
Gave us two shout outs on his Twitter feed.

759
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,480
We should also give a shout out to Carrie Carter.

760
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Katie Carter.

761
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,480
Shit.

762
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,480
Fuck.

763
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,480
Also Carrie Carter.

764
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,480
Good one.

765
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Rowan Berry.

766
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
And also Mega Jessup.

767
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
Rowan Berry.

768
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,480
And Jessup.

769
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Mega Jessup.

770
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,080
Mike Suzek from Twitter asks, as a straight man, can it be socially acceptable to compliment

771
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,520
a lady on her shoes?

772
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,560
Are we past gender stereotypes?

773
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,560
I like shoes.

774
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

775
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,160
Nothing wrong with that.

776
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,480
Make sure that like you're ready to back that up though because if you say you like your

777
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:21,560
shoes you may be opening yourself up to a good 10, 15 minute conversation.

778
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
I know.

779
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
I got shoes.

780
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,560
That.

781
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Okay.

782
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Let's play a fun game.

783
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,560
This will be a nice little over and under.

784
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Okay.

785
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,880
How many pairs of shoes have I owned in my adult life?

786
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Oh god.

787
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,760
We'll say I turned adult, we'll say since I graduated from college.

788
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Justin.

789
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,520
My guess is going to be...

790
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm talking about not dress shoes don't count, sandals don't count.

791
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
I'm talking about...

792
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Your go-tos.

793
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
My go-to daily cash.

794
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Everyday shoes.

795
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Off court buddies.

796
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm going to go with three.

797
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Travis.

798
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
I'm going to go with $2,685.

799
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,520
No, no, no.

800
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
Real.

801
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Okay.

802
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,760
Real guess.

803
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,320
I know you pretty well.

804
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
One.

805
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Oh.

806
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:13,760
See if we're going Price is Right rules then Travis won because the answer is two.

807
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Oh god.

808
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,800
Do you remember those shoes that you got me for Christmas?

809
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Yeah.

810
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Was that 07 or 08?

811
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
Because I'm having trouble.

812
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I'm having trouble.

813
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,600
It was oh no.

814
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:33,720
I want to hear Griffin's last question but first I feel like I need to tell you guys

815
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,160
the important news about how you can get some help from us.

816
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,120
If you're on Twitter, first off just go to mbnbam.com.

817
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
All this stuff is there.

818
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,960
You can listen to all our old shows.

819
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:54,520
Let everyone you know to subscribe or just one person either way is good with us and

820
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,880
pass this show along to them.

821
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,240
Don't keep your light under a bushel.

822
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,800
This show is a gift that you can share.

823
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,840
For free.

824
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
For free.

825
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
You can email us.

826
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Mbnbam.com.

827
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
At gmail.com.

828
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,040
If you do that you'll just go to our website.

829
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,520
I'm not so good with tech.

830
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
Tech.

831
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
Tech stuff.

832
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,520
How do you science work?

833
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
Tech.

834
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
Tech things.

835
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,840
Any other ways that I'm not forgetting?

836
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,840
Tweet.

837
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,360
There's Twitter.

838
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,400
When you see the announcement go live for a new program, a new show, if you would retweet

839
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:35,440
that and tell everybody that the new show is out and that we're slipping down the iTunes

840
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,440
rankings because we get that first rush of everybody subscribing.

841
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,040
So tell a bunch of your friends to subscribe if they'll really like it and we promise in

842
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,040
return to only deliver quality radio.

843
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,600
And thanks everyone for the reviews on iTunes so far.

844
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,160
They've been really great.

845
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Really positive.

846
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,520
So many stories in there.

847
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,680
We really appreciate it.

848
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Thank you so much.

849
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Keep that up.

850
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Drop a review.

851
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,600
Drop a subscription.

852
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,060
Whatever you want to do.

853
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,920
Everything helps out and you're great.

854
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,480
We're still trying to get every mid to high range celebrity to tweet about Mbnbam.com.

855
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,240
Craig B is a great start though.

856
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:21,240
So far our list of people that we still need to get include every mid to high range celebrity

857
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,840
except Craig B. So if you could talk to the celebrities you know, harass them into tweeting

858
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:34,240
about our show, maybe listening, but probably not, that would be Gary Sinise, we're looking

859
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
at you.

860
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
We're going to get him.

861
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,640
We're going to get him.

862
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:41,280
He's so busy with CSI but I think he can break off.

863
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,920
And t-shirts should come soon.

864
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,480

Looks real great.

Keep an eye on our Facebook group and we'll talk about it there.

867
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,080
Griffin!

868
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
Hit me!

Our final question of the day comes to us from Yahoo Answers user Mariah.

00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,120
Oh man.

871
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,680
She asks, can you take a parakeet in the shower with you?

872
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
I'm Justin McElroy.

873
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
I'm Travis McElroy.

874
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,680
I'm Griffin McElroy.

875
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:14,480
And this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

876
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:42,320
You will never know me.
