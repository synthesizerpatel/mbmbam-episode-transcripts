1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:47,360
Hello, everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother being an advice show

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
for the modern era. It's Star Wars Watch 2014. I'm Justin McElroy,

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,120
your oldest brother and most seasoned Jedi master.

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm Travis McElroy, your most midichlorian brother.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,760
And I'm Baby Greedo. Look at me go, doing some crime. Everybody hop in on my spaceship.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,760
I think the bit- Griffin's already touched on it, but we all have just watched the Star Wars

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,720
trailer, the teaser trailer, and I think the biggest surprise is the baby versions

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,640
of so many of the characters. Yeah.

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,560
So many characters are baby versions. Which is weird, because it's not a prequel,

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,320
is it? But Griffin, is it weird? Because if you think about it, it is related to the Henson

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,640
Studios, the Muppets. That's a good point.

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,400
Muppet babies, Star Wars babies. Shit, shit, shit. And also,

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,440
Rodians age in reverse. Exactly.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Did I ever tell you the story about when I was showing off to my then-girlfriend,

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,600
who would later become my wife, Rachel, about all my Star Wars knowledge.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,080
And I was telling her all about Trandoshans and Wookiee Bowcasters.

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
And then she asked me when her birthday was, and I got it. I was off by a day.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,400
I got that one wrong. I'm a pile of garbage.

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,880
That's the other big surprise. That big pile of garbage, the sentient pile of garbage

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,080
from the trailer was something that really surprised me. Grimsham, the living pile of

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
garbage. I was surprised that they brought back Pete to the hut, because he ate himself

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,760
in the last movie. They're going to have to do some nifty storytelling acrobatics to get

27
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,560
themselves on this one. I did enjoy the cameo by Barf.

28
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,440
It's all holograms, I'm assuming. Oh, Justin, thanks for reminding us.

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
Oh, sorry. If you are not living with the fact of John Candy's demise every day in your heart,

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,080
then I don't think you're a true fan. I don't think you're a candy head.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
I was surprised to find out that part of the movie would be taking place on Earth in the

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,440
present. That was weird. The whales are fine, guys. You don't need to save them again.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:08,160
I didn't get the part where Ron Solo, which is Han Solo's brother, went down on a lightsaber.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
Did anybody else get that part? There was a 45-second stretch there in the trailer where

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,120
it's just like, and he just partied on it. It's weird because you think about it,

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,880
and it's a hot light laser, and that would kill him, but it didn't seem to have any effect.

37
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,360
I feel like they're just fucking playing Calvin Ball with their lightsabers now.

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,280
They're just making shit up now. They're just putting lightsabers on everything.

39
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,720
Just give me the one. I'm still blown away. Every time I see just the one come out, I'm like,

40
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,840
whoa. I don't need seven on one boy. I don't need it on a keychain. That's what I keep waiting for,

41
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,360
is a lightsaber keychain. It is real. I wish that they in maglites or in Star Wars,

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,280
they had the big lightsabers, and then they had the little lightsabers for just the tiny jobs.

43
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,120
We're joking, but you know that's going to be in the next trailer.

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,880
You have a light dagger? Yeah, I think he's the most evil Jedi that

45
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,040
ever lived, and then he pulls out a giant lightsaber, and the beam is like

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,680
the size of a bus, and he's like, fucking what's up now? I'm going to win every sword fight because

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,200
I've got a bus saber. Fuck this. And it weighs nothing because it's light.

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,640
We're all just making shit up now, so guess what? My lightsaber is a planet. Oh, I win the fight.

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,400
Why can't they have a lightsaber that's like a football field long? He just sweeps it around

50
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
and kills everybody. As long as we're able to run into it.

51
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,680
As long as we're making shit up, why does baby Greedo even have a lightsaber?

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
Rodians can't have midi-chlorians. I don't want to be racist, but Rodians can't have

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,920
midi-chlorians. It's bullshit. You have to be careful about making sweeping

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,320
statements like that, I found, because no matter what sort of bullshit you want to rule out,

55
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,480
someone will come to you and say, actually, in the extended fiction, there's been several

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,280
instances of Greedo and- Fuck that. Bug-faced little monsters. They don't get lightsabers.

57
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,000
Trandoshans neither. Again, I hate to cast aspersions.

58
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Can you only use a lightsaber if you can wield the force?

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,360
I think so. Although, I'm sure there's some EU shit for that too. I mean, Ron Solo can use it,

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,880
and he's not a force user, but I would say he's using it wrong. Decidedly wrong. He's not using

61
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,960
it to battle the Sith. He's using it to practice his gag reflex suppression.

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,520
Griffin, I saw on Twitter that you wanted to speak up about vibroblades. Did you have

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,400
something to add there? Is there something you wanted to say about vibroblades?

64
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,600
I'm just saying they're super tight, and that they are more realistic, I think,

65
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,840
arguably, than lightsabers are, and it's just a part of the fiction that we haven't fucking

66
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,240
completely explored. Put a vibroblade on that trailer, people will freak the fuck out. You

67
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,960
don't have to keep upping your lightsaber game. Is a vibroblade just a vibrating blade,

68
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,320
like one of those serrated turkey carvers? It's exactly like that.

69
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,280
It's basically just that, but longer. That's badass.

70
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,960
F for Wumpa. You use them on a Wumpa. How come nobody ever eats Wumpa?

71
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,840
It's stupid. Actually, they extended fiction.

72
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,240
Can we please go and do questions? There's a Wumpa chef who specializes

73
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
in cooking Wumpa-related dishes. This season on Wumpa Chef.

74
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm Wumpa boss. Let's help people.

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,600
For once. A friend of mine recently started doing stand-up

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
comedy. Due to scheduling conflicts, I have yet to see her act. But just this week,

77
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
we were joking around and she casually ripped off a bit from a stand-up special we had watched

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,480
just the week before. I highly suspect she's ripping off other acts on the reg.

79
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Do I bring it up or let her dig her own grave? She's not a really good friend.

80
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,000
Of comedic charlatanism in California. Cool, cool, cool.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,400
It sounds like neither of you are especially good friends.

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I feel like before you do anything, you have to go see her show.

83
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,440
Go see her fucking act, of course. Yeah.

84
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,560
And then if she starts doing like a Mitch Hedberg joke, you can see it and say like, Jacques Hughes.

85
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,200
She gets up there and she's like, hey, I've been thinking about this for a long time,

86
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,120
and I think that there's seven curse words. You'd be like, sit down. You're done.

87
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,800
That would actually be really great though if you got up there and you're like,

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,880
here's seven curse words. Fanny. And Fanny could be one of them.

89
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,640
You guys may not remember this, but there was this Christian youth leader that used to make

90
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,520
the rounds. I won't name him because I don't want to bring shame upon his house and his fine work.

91
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,000
But this guy was like a big hit with the youth. The youth love this guy.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,880
And he would do these bits. He did a lot of comedy, a lot of comedy bits.

93
00:07:53,600 --> 00:08:00,960
And at one point, and this would have been like early 90s, late 80s, he started doing a

94
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,840
here's your sign bit. Now, I have to keep in mind, this is pre Blue Collar, pre all that stuff.

95
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,040
Bill Engvall is just a young guy that my dad had seen on like Evening at the Improv kind of stuff.

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,920
And at the Apollo. Yeah.

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,920
And at the Apollo, dad had seen him there. And he's in his seat like getting

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,480
livid. He keeps whispering to me like, this is not his stuff.

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:32,080
Literally, dad goes to him after he does like the prime time everybody come to Jesus.

100
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,320
Like, come on, let's get right with the Lord thing. Dad goes up to him afterwards,

101
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
afterwards, after that. He's like literally praying and crying with

102
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,360
pregnant teens that want to get their life right with the Lord.

103
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,000
And dad's like, hey, have you ever heard of Bill Engvall?

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
You fuck. You fucking dipshit asshole.

105
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
God knows what you do. God knows what you do.

106
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,840
You're doing good work, but you're doing it in a bad way, you fucking creep.

107
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
Bill Engvall has worked for every dollar he's earned until he makes-

108
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,880
God gave Bill Engvall those jokes first. Then you steal them out of Bill Engvall's mouth.

109
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,440
God came to him low like a burning bush. He was like, yo, come here, check this out.

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,680
It's like they have signs, Bill. And the signs tell everybody how dumb they are, Bill.

111
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
Bill, the burning bush, here's your sign.

112
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:33,520
This is such a sticky wicket because she was in casual conversation with you and

113
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,000
she, quote unquote, stole a gag. I don't think that that's the same thing as like using it in

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
an act and passing it off. It's 100% not the same thing, Justin.

115
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
It's not, right? It's definitely not.

116
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,960
But we do this comedy show here and I don't know if you guys have ever done this.

117
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,040
I will sometimes listen to a past episode or someone like mentioned on Twitter like, hey,

118
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,040
you know, that's funny that this other guy did that exact joke.

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,320
Like, oh my God, it had been buried in my psyche and then it reemerged

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,760
purporting to be a new creation, a unique special snowflake.

121
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Yeah, you gotta go see the show and then I think afterwards, you know what, or don't.

122
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,400
Like, maybe just don't. What do you care? What does it matter?

123
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Why would you get into that fucking awkward black cesspool of a conversation

124
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:37,360
from which there can beat that oratory labrea tar pit of that conversation

125
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
if you did not have to? Yeah.

126
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
There is no reason for you to wade into this motherfucker.

127
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,040
Best case scenario, there's no issue, but like every other case scenario after that

128
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,080
is you having to say something or you knowing something and not saying something

129
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,720
or trying to find a way to say and it's all just awful.

130
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,720
One time I was at a comedy show here in Austin that was just like a stand up open mic thing

131
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,960
and this dude got up there and started making all these really horrible jokes.

132
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,600
He was talking about that driver who like crashed into a crowd at South by Southwest

133
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,400
and killed like six people. That happened like two days before.

134
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,560
Cool, cool, cool. Great job, dude.

135
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,080
But then he started ripping off jokes from The Daily Show,

136
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,840
which seems like a weird place to rip it off from because fucking everybody watches that.

137
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,880
And he talked about the plane crash that happened and how those kids called that news station

138
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,240
and said the pilot's name was We Too Low and like all that shit.

139
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,400
And he just like did that as if it was his own goof. And I heard a guy in the back of the crowd

140
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,000
just go, fuck you. And that's probably the best possible way to call somebody out on this.

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
That's one way of dealing with it.

142
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Someone told us on Twitter that they saw a stand up comedian in Austin

143
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,040
who had been doing some My Brother, My Brother and Me classic goofs.

144
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,360
And then they said they saw you at a restaurant later that same night.

145
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,880
So it was a very strange experience.

146
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,720
I don't go to places where anyone can touch my food besides me,

147
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,400
but I saw that tweet and I thought about which of our bits could fucking

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,160
possibly translate over to-

149
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
Hey, guys, ever notice how orb the horse? Am I right?

150
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, what's up with old people gum?

151
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
Peepum's nasty gum, that shit.

152
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,720
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

153
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,840
Dwarf? Dwarf?

154
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,040
Anybody got a dwarf? Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

155
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,840
Here's your sign.

156
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
Fucking here's your-

157
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,640
Horses, ghosts, where are you guys at?

158
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,200
That's what our show sounds like to us.

159
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
Rhodians don't get no lightsabers.

160
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,600
I don't watch no races, but Rhodians don't get no lightsabers.

161
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
Put that lightsaber down.

162
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,560
Andy.

163
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
That fucking classic Rhodian lightsaber dude.

164
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Fucking everyone's nipping at our heels.

165
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,320
They're ripping off bits that we haven't even posted yet

166
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
from earlier in the show.

167
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,640
Inception.

168
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,840
What, Frankenstein's dick? Holy shit.

169
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
That was from our candlelight episode.

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,080
I've become dislodged from the time stream.

171
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Frankenstein's dick.

172
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,720
You guys want a yahoo?

173
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:12,960
Yeah.

174
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,120
Accidentally made my mom and dad break up.

175
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm fading away.

176
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,080
Ghost horses.

177
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,440
Do you guys want a yahoo?

178
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,940
Help.

179
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
Getting hard to see.

180
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,800
This yahoo was...

181
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,640
Translucive.

182
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,400
This yahoo was sent in by level 44 yahoo shaman Drew Davenport.

183
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Thank you, Drew Davenport.

184
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,560
It's by yahoo answers user.

185
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
They've been suspended.

186
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,920
But when they existed, they asked,

187
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,840
what do you think Frankenstein's dick look like?

188
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,320
They asked, I tend to steal people's toilet paper

189
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,520
when I go to their houses.

190
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Not really a question, but...

191
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
I have tried to stop, but find that I can't.

192
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,400
It gives me an adrenaline rush.

193
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,480
Wait, it's not about Frankenstein's dick?

194
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,040
No.

195
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,120
I have tried to stop, but find that I can't.

196
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,480
It gives me an adrenaline rush.

197
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,880
I feel I may move on to more explicit

198
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,960
and vast bathroom materials.

199
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
What do I do to stop?

200
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,200
Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

201
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,240
This person's not getting a rush from the theft of it.

202
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,480
They're getting a rush because it's toilet paper

203
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
and therefore explicit to them.

204
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,040
And they're saying like,

205
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I'm gonna steal dirtier and dirtier things.

206
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
No, I think it's the thievery that's really doing it for them,

207
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
but they're gonna move on to more explicit and vast.

208
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,680
I don't know what that means,

209
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
but I think it could probably describe

210
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,400
the My Brother, My Brother and Me catalog at this point.

211
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:38,880
Fair.

212
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,960
Do you think they mean like I'm gonna steal like bigger?

213
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,040
I'm gonna steal like towels and the shower curtain.

214
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,320
No, probably like soaps and then maybe pills

215
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,520
and then maybe tampos.

216
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,680
See, but that's the thing.

217
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
This question would be a thousand percent different

218
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,880
if the question was,

219
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,400
I tend to steal pills from my friend's medicine cabinets.

220
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:56,960
Okay, great.

221
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,040
Like this is an issue that I steal toilet paper

222
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
and then you're just a dick.

223
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Are you?

224
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
It's a victimless crime except for the victim.

225
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,120
It is not.

226
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,960
I know exactly how many rolls of toilet paper

227
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
were in my home at all times.

228
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,360
That's bullshit.

229
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,840
That's not true.

230
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,720
You know how you've heard-

231
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,600
Three and a half.

232
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay.

233
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,040
Have you ever heard that like some cultures

234
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
only have words for like one, two and a whole bunch?

235
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
Like they just don't have words for-

236
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,600
Because they have no need for like numbers.

237
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
So they don't have words for like higher numbers.

238
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,800
Like in China, there's never four of something.

239
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
That's what's considered bad luck.

240
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,800
But I think that there are really only two numbers of-

241
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,360
Well, okay.

242
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,440
Three numbers of toilet paper you can have.

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
You can have none.

244
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,120
You can have one or you can have plenty.

245
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,160
I don't even think about it.

246
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,800
I'm like ethically bound to not buy toilet paper.

247
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,840
I cannot see when I have two rolls of toilet paper.

248
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,760
You don't possess the sight.

249
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,960
I do not possess a sight to see a number of toilet paper rolls

250
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,320
beyond one, none or plenty.

251
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,560
Well, because of that, where do you stop hoarding toilet paper?

252
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,600
Like at two, at three, at four, pretty soon you just have

253
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,360
like a closet full of toilet paper.

254
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
I think that that is why we as human beings

255
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,360
can only fathom buying more toilet paper

256
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,200
when we're down to the last roll.

257
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,600
It's true.

258
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,880
Right, because it's a slippery slope.

259
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
Yeah, otherwise you panic and you're just like,

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,600
it's on sale.

261
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,880
Yeah, cube, cube, cube.

262
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,080
And you just buy like cube after cube of toilet paper.

263
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,760
We're talking in circles here.

264
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,480
We got to get back to the heart of the matter

265
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,960
because how is this person doing this?

266
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,400
Are they going the full roll?

267
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,960
If that's the case, how do they get it on their person?

268
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
I was thinking about that too, logistically.

269
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
Yeah, do you take it all off the roll

270
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
and shove it in your pockets

271
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,120
and then leave the house with it?

272
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,320
Because that feels less like a crime.

273
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,600
Maybe you've got a cold.

274
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,640
You know what I mean?

275
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,160
Could you wrap yourself in it

276
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
and then put your clothes on over at the old under mummy?

277
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,640
That is what I would go with.

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,040
And that's good.

279
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,320
It protects you against the elements.

280
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,840
And bullets.

281
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,480
And bullets.

282
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,840
A lot of people don't know that.

283
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,560
Isn't it amazing?

284
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,280
I think that like toilet paper is like Time Lord technology

285
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,200
because on the roll, it's so compact.

286
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,400
But then when you take it off the roll,

287
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,080
I feel like it would take up so much room.

288
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,200
You'd have to like pretend to be pregnant

289
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,840
and your friends would be like,

290
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,280
you weren't pregnant when you got here, were you?

291
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm like, yes.

292
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,600
Yes, I thousand percent was.

293
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,720
I sat on a toilet seat where somebody did a naughty thing.

294
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,360
And I got instant pregnant.

295
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,800
I got super pregnant very fast.

296
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,120
I think that this is fine.

297
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,560
You think it's fine?

298
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,920
You think it's fine?

299
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,400
Yeah.

300
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,200
You think it's fine?

301
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,280
That's a pretty bold statement, Griffin.

302
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,800
I think you'd say not the weirdest thing we've talked about.

303
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
I'll give that to you.

304
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,040
Okay, but you know what?

305
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
Again, I go back to the same issue.

306
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,920
If you stole someone's roll of toilet paper,

307
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
that's a victimless crime.

308
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,200
If you steal the last roll of toilet paper,

309
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
your history is the greatest monster.

310
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,080
But okay, yes.

311
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,400
But how hard is it to buy toilet paper?

312
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,400
Not hard.

313
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Where do you even find it?

314
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,040
It's not very hard to buy toilet paper, right?

315
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,920
And whatever.

316
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,960
I do it all the time.

317
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,840
I do it every day.

318
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
It's a bit embarrassing when it's the only thing you buy.

319
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah, I'll give you that.

320
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,520
And then it gets more embarrassing

321
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,720
when you buy one other thing

322
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,440
because then you're saying,

323
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
this thing's gonna make me shit.

324
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
Yeah, sure.

325
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
But it's suntan lotion.

326
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,600
Yeah.

327
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Yeah, I don't know, man.

328
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
We'll figure it out.

329
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Maybe I'll put it on an English muffin.

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's not hard to buy toilet paper, right?

331
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But the thrill that this person gets,

332
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,080
they don't get from anything else.

333
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,720
So even if I knew that my friend was coming to my house

334
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
and stealing my toilet paper,

335
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,080
just knowing how happy it made them,

336
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,880
it would be fine.

337
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
As long as it didn't get more explicit and vast.

338
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,240
I think that your friends can have a talk with you,

339
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,960
like, keep it.

340
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,400
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

341
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
I need you to stick to the TP, my friend.

342
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
Pretty soon you're going to put up a sign

343
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,280
that says like all bags must be checked at the front door.

344
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,600
Like, I don't trust you to take your backpack

345
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,560
into the bathroom.

346
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,880
I think that's actually what the song Waterfalls was about.

347
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
Have you guys ever done anything like this?

348
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,440
Stolen somebody's toilet paper?

349
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,880
Well, because I have in my younger, poorer days,

350
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,080
I stole a roll of toilet paper from a business job type.

351
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
Oh, yeah, oh, fucking, I'll rob a business blind.

352
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,360
Forget about it.

353
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,960
Okay, because that I do think is victimless.

354
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
That giant roll.

355
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,520
Oh, you card.

356
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,640
Do you need a couple dollars?

357
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,520
How tight are times?

358
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,960
Next question.

359
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,200
Next question.

360
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,920
My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years.

361
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
When we first started dating,

362
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,440
we both lived in the same city as his extended family.

363
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,200
Now we live on the other side of the country

364
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,440
and we moved in together six months ago.

365
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,520
Christmas is coming up soon

366
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,560
and I want him to meet my extended family.

367
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,280
They live about five hours from his hometown.

368
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,320
But oh my God, this is like algebra, okay.

369
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,520
But he says it doesn't make sense for him to go to there.

370
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
He doesn't have a lot of money

371
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
and won't have access to his own car to drive.

372
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm going to be borrowing my father's car

373
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,920
to see him and his family on New Year's.

374
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,000
How can I convince him that meeting my Nana

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,080
is important to me without creating resentment

376
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,880
on the other end?

377
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,080
I wish it was originally from Ohio.

378
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
Listen, just like point of order,

379
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,080
all we needed was that last sentence

380
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,560
because the crux of this question is

381
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,440
how to really sell your Nana?

382
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,760
And that's, I didn't need all that maths is all I'm saying

383
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,240
because it got confused and I got angry.

384
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,360
How do I make my Nana seem like the newest, hottest thing?

385
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,040
Can you spruce up your Nana?

386
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,400
How do you keep your Nana fresh for the 2014 season?

387
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
Call the property brothers.

388
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,280
Call the property brothers.

389
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
They're going to put an I-beam in your Nana.

390
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,640
It gives it a real rustic.

391
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,080
Travis appreciated that property brothers joke.

392
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,480
We gave your mother exposed beams.

393
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,600
Listen, you broke motherfucker.

394
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
You can't afford this Nana.

395
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,480
We're going to buy you a shitty Nana

396
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,440
and we're going to fix her up.

397
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,160
Hey, my name is Gladys.

398
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,680
You fucking suck.

399
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,720
Yeah, but just check this out.

400
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,800
And look here on her back, heated tiles.

401
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,280
Now you would think that that would be out of your price range,

402
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
but we saved it by not getting her feet.

403
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,720
No feet.

404
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,800
I know you want this particular granite for your Nana's countertops,

405
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,760
but we don't think it makes sense just fiscally.

406
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
So we're going to get her some cheaper stuff.

407
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,760
We also put a skylight into this new Nana and that did kill her.

408
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,200
That was the thing that killed her.

409
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
That was on us.

410
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,760
But the lap still works.

411
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,560
Check out this lap.

412
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,080
So if I'm understanding this correctly,

413
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,880
when they moved in together, they lived in the same town.

414
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,560
So she's met his extended family.

415
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,360
Oh, yeah.

416
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
And now they live only five hours away from her extended family.

417
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,680
He doesn't think it makes sense.

418
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,680
You got to do it.

419
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,280
I mean, I know it's I kind of get where he's coming from,

420
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,120
but it's like important.

421
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,720
Like three years is a long time for him to not have met your family, right?

422
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,720
Like, well, I think this is specific.

423
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
Just I think this is specifically extended family

424
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,520
because he's not saying mom and dad are talking extended family.

425
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
Now, here's the thing and bear with me here.

426
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,240
There is a play you could do and it is that you our town.

427
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
You do our town realizes the importance of family.

428
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,920
That's a right smart Nana you got there.

429
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,440
That's my all gathered underneath the Nana nut tree.

430
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,920
You just got to say something along the lines of

431
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,080
we don't know how much longer she'll be.

432
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,240
Oh, don't do that.

433
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,520
I know, I know.

434
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
That is a Nana curse.

435
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,520
If I ever heard one, Travis, I do not know why you

436
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,880
convinced this question.

437
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Ask her to curse their Nana.

438
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,360
Fair enough.

439
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,440
It's a Nana curse in three days.

440
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,320
She'll be dragged.

441
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,520
She'll be dragged forward.

442
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,720
This Nana to someone else.

443
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,960
Man, this Nana is really taking a beating in this question.

444
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,460
Huh?

445
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,720
Well, you have fucking done everything to this Nana.

446
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I feel like what you really need to do is just explain to him

447
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,240
that this is important to you.

448
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,560
Yeah.

449
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,040
And like.

450
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,200
Yeah.

451
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,640
Have you tried like I'm as I get older, I'm more into this

452
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,120
like whole direct communication thing.

453
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,280
And I love a good scam.

454
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,800
A good grift as much the next person.

455
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,920
But maybe just say, hey, I this would mean a lot to me.

456
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,060
Yeah.

457
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,240
Boyfriend.

458
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Because that's the thing is you probably feel like you've had

459
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,440
the conversation, but there's a lot of talking around it.

460
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,480
You could do.

461
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,120
And I feel like if you just say like, hey, this is important

462
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,640
and he still is like, now, I will say that it does sound

463
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
like if he doesn't have a car and he doesn't have the money,

464
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,560
this isn't this doesn't strike me as the boyfriend saying,

465
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,840
no, I don't really want to like it's a boyfriend saying

466
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,160
literally I can't there.

467
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:44,800
Yeah.

468
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,600
So take that into account because this is probably is

469
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,160
important.

470
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,200
It is something that matters, but it may just not be the right

471
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:51,760
time for it.

472
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,320
You could do it any time of the year if you're only five hours

473
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:54,720
away.

474
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,440
Pop on a bus.

475
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,240
Yeah.

476
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,920
So maybe Christmas isn't the time.

477
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,240
Maybe you wait a couple of months till he can afford it

478
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
or you have a car that you can drive him up for.

479
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
And then you do it.

480
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,080
I'm saying there's probably going to be a Nana bound

481
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,440
Super Bus that you can hop on and it's going to cost you

482
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,000
$3 and you're going to have Wi-Fi the entire way there.

483
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,880
And but it's just going to be you on the bus because it's

484
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,240
a magic bus that goes directly to your Nana's house.

485
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
How about your Nana comes down and meets him?

486
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:20,480
Yeah.

487
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,000
Tell her to stop being so lazy.

488
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,640
What the fuck?

489
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,800
God, you're a lazy man.

490
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,080
Meet me halfway Nana.

491
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,280
Brothers.

492
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,400
My boyfriend's mother recently learned she would be receiving

493
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,840
a sizable inheritance.

494
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,880
I think it's around 30k.

495
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,760
God damn.

496
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:34,960
Yeah.

497
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,480
And has decided to spend it by taking my boyfriend, myself,

498
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,120
her, her other son, her wife, her a bunch of people on a big

499
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,000
family vacation.

500
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Awesome.

501
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,080
Except the last time I spoke to her, she was trying to devise

502
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
between two possibilities.

503
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,800
The Grand Canyon and Hawaii.

504
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,880
Now brothers, I'm not an outdoor person.

505
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
I have absolutely no interest in a Grand Canyon vacation.

506
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
I would love to go to Hawaii.

507
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,200
But I know that Hawaii would be significantly more expensive,

508
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,000
especially in terms of paying for my boyfriend and myself.

509
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,160
As we live on the East Coast and the flights will be twice as

510
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,240
much as for anyone else on the trip.

511
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,840
Would it be impolite to express my strong preference?

512
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,600
Should I let her take whatever vacation she prefers with her

513
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,640
money? And that's from craving beaches over canyons in

514
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Washington, D.C.

515
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,040
This is a really good question.

516
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,120
And this is a great question.

517
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,880
My first counter question is, what is your problem with the

518
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,080
Grand Canyon?

519
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,840
It rules.

520
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,800
It's giant.

521
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,920
It's made of rocks.

522
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,200
And I've never been there.

523
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,720
But I imagine it would blow your tiny mind.

524
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,320
Now, Travis, I don't think you're the best person to weigh on

525
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,200
on this question, because if I remember correctly, you are the

526
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,920
man who wouldn't drive four hours out of his way to see the

527
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,880
Grand Canyon.

528
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,240
Now, to be fair, Justin, I had a dog and a cat with me.

529
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
It was a whole thing.

530
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,120
It was going to be a whole deal.

531
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,560
We would have had to take them with us.

532
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,960
And it was like day seven of our cross-country trip.

533
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,480
What is your problem with the Grand Canyon?

534
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,600
It's a big hole.

535
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,480
It's just a big hole.

536
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,520
I maybe maybe fill up with water and let me swim in you lake.

537
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,240
And then we'll talk.

538
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,320
Can I?

539
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
Grand Canyon is a shitty lake.

540
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,120
It's a shitty dry lake.

541
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,680
We've really turned around on the Grand Canyon since the

542
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,800
beginning of this question.

543
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,920
This is the very definition of a win-win scenario.

544
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,160
Because if she chooses Hawaii, awesome.

545
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,720
You are going to have a fucking sitcom special episode.

546
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,160
And it's going to be amazing.

547
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,800
And you're going to love it.

548
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
You're going to have the best time ever.

549
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,040
Go to the Grand Canyon.

550
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,000
Going to save a lot of money.

551
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,560
Probably only going to spend maybe five G's on that, right?

552
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,120
Getting there.

553
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,480
That leaves 25 G's of this inheritance left over.

554
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,520
I have to be very delicate with my next few sentences because

555
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,240
I don't want to implicate myself in anything.

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,400
But as I see it, if you want this inheritance to kick your

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,440
way, you've got maybe six or seven people standing in the

558
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,880
way and the Grand Canyon, while a shitty lake.

559
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,080
Got to be so careful.

560
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,880
So carefully here.

561
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,280
Is if things, let me think.

562
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,480
Jesus Christ.

563
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,840
Things that fall into it will pick up, let's call it a fatal

564
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,880
amount of inertia.

565
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,640
Now, I'm not saying anything about murder most foul, but I

566
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
am saying how quickly can you push six or seven people?

567
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,800
All I'm saying, win-win scenario.

568
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm not saying murder these people if you go to the Grand

569
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
Canyon, but how much, how bad do you want this money?

570
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
Here is one thing.

571
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,720
Now, when you don't decide to push them into the Grand Canyon.

572
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,280
Don't do that.

573
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,560
I'm saying when you don't do that.

574
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,400
When you don't do that and get them on a line and push them

575
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,720
in the Grand Canyon, I cannot caution you enough against

576
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,480
losing your nerve halfway through.

577
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,520
Listen, if you only do three or four to lose your nerve,

578
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,480
that's no good.

579
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,480
Nothing good will come of that.

580
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,960
We're not saying any of that.

581
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,800
I'm saying I saw a YouTube video of somebody throwing seven

582
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:15,440
watermelons into the Grand Canyon and they did not even

583
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
come close to surviving the fall.

584
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,640
I'm also saying that watermelons are the most human-like fruit

585
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,840
and that's all I'm going to say.

586
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,560
That's just where I stand on the matter.

587
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:29,040
Do you know what this question asker did wrong?

588
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:30,960
What's that?

589
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,440
Their opportunity for this, not the other thing, but when you

590
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,120
were talking with your boyfriend's mother, why didn't

591
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,320
you say it then?

592
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,400
Why weren't you like, oh, Hawaii would be great.

593
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,600
Well, no, because it's her.

594
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,080
I get it.

595
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,040
It's her fucking money.

596
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
You are not a member of the family.

597
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,360
You are dating a member of the family, so it is super not

598
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,240
your place to be like.

599
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,520
No, but the loophole is this.

600
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,720
It's not like she said Grand Canyon and you said, oh, how

601
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,000
about Hawaii?

602
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,840
She said either Grand Canyon or Hawaii.

603
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
All you had to do is like, oh, Hawaii sounds fun or the Grand

604
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,160
Canyon either way, but Hawaii, I've always wanted to go there.

605
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,280
Because it's her 30 stacks.

606
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,880
She gets to make the call.

607
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,080
Oh, Hawaii is I feel like once you pay for the Grand Canyon

608
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
trip, it's pretty much paid for.

609
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,040
Once you go to Hawaii, though, I feel like you're just begging

610
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,920
for upsells.

611
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,560
But what about Burros?

612
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,080
I think you're getting upsold a lot.

613
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,320
What?

614
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,360
What about Burros?

615
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
You got to pay for the Burros.

616
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,000
Burro rental?

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,480
Yeah.

618
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,520
Very cold donkeys.

619
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
You got to get the audio.

620
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,640
That was a shitty joke.

621
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
Over here is a hole.

622
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,280
No, a lot of people give us give a shit for not recognizing

623
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,160
your good jokes.

624
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,600
And I'm trying to get better about that.

625
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,680
But that also means I'm going to call you out when you do a

626
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
fucking terrible joke.

627
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,840
Because it's a burro.

628
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,720
Shut up.

629
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,120
Stop it.

630
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,320
He's a chili donkey.

631
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,840
A burro.

632
00:29:49,840 --> 00:30:02,400
Two words, people.

633
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,560
Chili donkey.

634
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:04,720
Yeah.

635
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Two other words.

636
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,200
Free snacks.

637
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,800
Fatal inertia.

638
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,000
Two more words.

639
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,720
Free snacks.

640
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,520
We're going to give you the chance to get free snacks.

641
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,800
Potato chips aren't good for you.

642
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,040
Nope.

643
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,480
They're trash.

644
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
Get delicious, wholesome snacks.

645
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,800
That's what you need.

646
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,640
And you're going to get them in hrbox.com.

647
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,320
How do I do that?

648
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,440
I just type in the thing to my web browser and then they come

649
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,480
out of my CDR drive?

650
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,840
Just tell you about these things.

651
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,880
They have no artificial flavors, colors or sweeteners,

652
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,560
zero grams of trans fat and no high fructose corn syrup.

653
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
I mean, they do have color.

654
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,160
Color is all that we can perceive.

655
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,800
You know what I mean?

656
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,320
They do have color and shape.

657
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,560
Right.

658
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,440
They're not invisible.

659
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,520
They have texture and form.

660
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:51,760
Right.

661
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,800
What do we got new this month?

662
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,000
Let me tell you about what we got new in nature box.

663
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,440
This is a subscription service.

664
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,120
Basically, they're going to be sending you a box of snacks

665
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,840
that you choose.

666
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
You choose what you want and they're going to send them to you.

667
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,960
Here's some of the things you got here.

668
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
Blueberry Greek yogurt pretzels.

669
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,360
Whoa.

670
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,240
How about this?

671
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,840
Parmesan garlic pop pop.

672
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,400
Oh, my God.

673
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,560
They're doing they can do anything with pop pops.

674
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,120
Are you ready?

675
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
Because I haven't seen these before.

676
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,920
Beef jerky.

677
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,280
Beef jerky.

678
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,080
If you're like me, that's like the best thing you've ever heard.

679
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,040
That's pretty incredible because beef jerky that you get from like

680
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:33,200
Alberto or Jack Links, otherwise known as shitty beef jerky.

681
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,400
It's going to cost you like $48 at the gas station.

682
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,280
It's stupid.

683
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,360
Super quick.

684
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,240
Super Google side.

685
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,440
I watched the episode of Shark Tank where Jeff Foxworthy

686
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,200
was one of the guest shark and somebody came pitching

687
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,880
their beef jerky line and he said it was fine beef jerky,

688
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
but he was unable to invest as he was already in the beef

689
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,160
jerky business with his own personalized line of Jeff

690
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,520
Foxworthy beef jerky.

691
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,640
And it was like it was the most Jeff Foxworthy thing I've ever

692
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,840
seen in my entire life.

693
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,400
Carry on.

694
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,520
You can get these free ass snacks.

695
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,640
They're not ass snacks.

696
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,040
They're just regular delicious wholesome snacks.

697
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,640
You can get them for free.

698
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,360
Go to naturebox.com slash my brother and you will get a free

699
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
trial box of delicious snacks.

700
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,920
Stay full, stay strong, my friends.

701
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,240
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

702
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,600
And if you work for Naturebox, daddy hasn't gotten a box

703
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,080
in a while.

704
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,560
Oh, come on.

705
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,640
Just pay for it yourself.

706
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,680
Just pay for it your fucking self.

707
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,840
Maybe it's time to hit daddy with a taste of the crunch.

708
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,160
So what's that address again?

709
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,880
Because I missed it.

710
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,800
Naturebox.com slash my brother.

711
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,200
Perfect.

712
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,000
I'll try that.

713
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,120
Can I talk about Prosper?

714
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,400
Please.

715
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,040
Sure.

716
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,400
Travis usually does it.

717
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,400
And I feel like people are just ready for something new.

718
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:51,840
Oh.

719
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,280
Just saying, you're 2008 or 2000 late.

720
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,640
Shit, 2008 is 2000 and late now, isn't it?

721
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,240
Goddamn.

722
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,000
You're 2000 and gore teen.

723
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,840
I'm 2014.

724
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,280
Stop being so gore teen.

725
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,440
Guys, listen, there just aren't a lot of good ways to borrow

726
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,400
money when you need it.

727
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,680
2000 and snort teen.

728
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,360
Fuck.

729
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,080
If you need money, you're basically screwed nowadays.

730
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,320
And bad news, you always need money.

731
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,840
But you can get a low fixed rate loan at Prosper.com.

732
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,360
How it works is this.

733
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,560
You say, I need this many dollars.

734
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,640
It can be up to $35,000, basically infinity dollars.

735
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,400
And then people will come and invest in your loan.

736
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,240
And then you'll get their money?

737
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,520
I was waiting for Travis to confirm that.

738
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh, that is correct.

739
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,520
Nailed it.

740
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,240
Got it in one.

741
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,880
So yeah, it doesn't have to be $35,000, but that's a, I mean,

742
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
that seems like a pretty good sum to me.

743
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,880
You can check your low rate instantly without affecting

744
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,960
your credit if you go to Prosper.com slash my brother.

745
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,240
And if you get a loan through Prosper, you can get a $50 visa

746
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,680
gift card with your loan.

747
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,280
And you can spend that on whatever the fuck you want.

748
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,520
It's not like a Cracker Barrel gift card that you can only

749
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,880
spend at Cracker Barrel.

750
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,520
It's just-

751
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,040
You could spend it at Cracker Barrel.

752
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,080
Actually, I'm sorry.

753
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm reading the fine print here.

754
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,160
Explicitly, you can't spend it at Cracker Barrel.

755
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,560
But anywhere else that is not a good time country food store,

756
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,440
just feel free.

757
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,640
Justin, you wanna hit this disclaimer?

758
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,560
Yes, I will be reading this in a character that I am creating

759
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,400
in the moment called Christopher Lloyd, but also Kramer.

760
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,200
Oh, okay.

761
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,720
And possibly Richard Nixon.

762
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,320
Well, this is just gonna be terrible.

763
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,640
Other restrictions apply.

764
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,640
See site for program and visa prepaid card details.

765
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,800
All personal loans are made by Web Bank, a Utah Chartered

766
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,600
Industrial Bank, member FDIC, equal opportunity lender.

767
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,600
Great Jerry.

768
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Great Jerry, I'm not a crook.

769
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,240
Oh, fuck.

770
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,040
I got a message for Alan Michael.

771
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
Is it from Queen Elizabeth?

772
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,040
Alan, it says Alan Michael first name.

773
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,600
What is that?

774
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,200
Is the person's name Alan Michael?

775
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,120
And then his last name is first name.

776
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,920
Man, they really fucked the pooch on this one, didn't they?

777
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,520
This is not like a library card.

778
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,760
Queen Elizabeth says to Alan Michael,

779
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,920
Hey, old man, what better way to wish you the happiest of birthdays

780
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,000
than having the brothers do it for me?

781
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You're the greatest man in the world.

782
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,960
Holy shit.

783
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,040
And I hope you enjoy this because it's by far my favorite gift you'll get.

784
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,480
I'm sure yours too.

785
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,080
If Griffey wrote you a jingle though, this message would be put to shame.

786
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
Love you tons.

787
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,880
Love your bottom bitch.

788
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
Well, I can't, I can't, guys.

789
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,400
I forget.

790
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,840
I don't have the music anymore.

791
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,560
Also, I've got a sneeze caught in my nose too.

792
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,040
And it's like really fucking throwing me off.

793
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,480
And I don't think I can, hold on, let me try.

794
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,760
I don't think I can, hold on, let me try.

795
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
No, fuck this sneeze though.

796
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,520
Sorry, everyone.

797
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,640
I let you down.

798
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,120
This next message.

799
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,760
I got a message.

800
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,360
Oh, wow.

801
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,560
Sympathetic.

802
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,240
Happy birthday, Alan Michael.

803
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,720
Michelle.

804
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:16,960
Yeah.

805
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,040
Happy birthday, Alan Michael.

806
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
We hope it's a great one, Alan Michelle.

807
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,680
You're the greatest man in the world.

808
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,640
You're the greatest living man, you bottom bitch.

809
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,920
He's actually top bitch, I would assume.

810
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,640
Is that how it works?

811
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
HPIC baby.

812
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,440
I don't know the lingo.

813
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,080
I got a message for Julian from Brian and Sanford and Kate and Katie and Lilla.

814
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
Maybe Lillia.

815
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,720
I don't know.

816
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,120
Lillia.

817
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,920
Happy birthday to the finest playwright ever to sit around in his Walter White's.

818
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,760
A man with more character than a waddle of Dinklage's.

819
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,640
It's actually a converter.

820
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,400
It's a murder of Dinklage's.

821
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,080
It's a murder of Dinklage's, yes.

822
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,800
A converter of dozens to the Church of McElroy.

823
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,200
I know Griffin stopped writing jingles, but perhaps a reprise of Birthday Town for

824
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,920
such a leader of Mbim-bim-bim-bini is in order.

825
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,440
An anachronistic rendition of griffinspacejam.com.

826
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,560
Happy birthday.

827
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,720
Fucking sneeze.

828
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,640
It's my curse.

829
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,240
I'm going to take it with me to my grave.

830
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm going to be on my deathbed like, here it comes.

831
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,120
God bless you, son.

832
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,680
It brings you back.

833
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,320
God bless you.

834
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,520
I saw the light.

835
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:29,920
I saw the light.

836
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Do you guys want to know something about bottom bitch?

837
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,720
What's that?

838
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,040
Bottom bitch is the one girl the pimp reserves for himself or the player's favorite girl.

839
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:42,080
So while it seems like a derogatory term, it seems like you want to be bottom bitch.

840
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,720
Yeah.

841
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,480
Well, depends on the pimp, doesn't it?

842
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,440
Well, isn't that always the case, Griffin?

843
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,240
Can I blow my nose?

844
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,480
I gotta-

845
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,440
It's her happy birthday?

846
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,800
Happy birthday, I guess?

847
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:54,880
I guess.

848
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,880
Happy birthday, Alan, Michael, and Julian.

849
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,680
Today, we are all bottom bitches.

850
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
I gotta blow my nose or I'm gonna fucking die.

851
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,560
Hey, Ross.

852
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,280
Hey, Carrie.

853
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,560
Hey, it's me, your co-host.

854
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,760
Oh, yeah, we have a show, don't we?

855
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,560
We have a show.

856
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,520
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

857
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,400
Oh, no, Ross and Carrie.

858
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,120
It's about undercover investigations of fringe groups.

859
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,520
Yeah, like the Tony Olomo Ministries cult.

860
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,440
Yep, that's led by a pedophile.

861
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,240
He's in jail.

862
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,360
He's in jail.

863
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,920
Also, we became Mormons.

864
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
We became Raelians, which is a UFO group.

865
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:22,720
That's right.

866
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,800
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis.

867
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,280
Yes.

868
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,520
The 9-11 truthers.

869
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,160
We got cupped.

870
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,200
We got acupunctured.

871
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,920
We got rakey.

872
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,960
We've pretty much anything that you've heard of and been like,

873
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,640
that doesn't sound quite right.

874
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,600
We've done that.

875
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
So you don't have to do it.

876
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,240
So if you want to hear about this, and you should, then go to maximumfun.org.

877
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,120
This Yahoo was sent in by Rachel Sperling.

878
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,080
Game recognize the game, Rachel Sperling.

879
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,040
Crushed it this week.

880
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:55,360
Again.

881
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Is Rachel Sperling just the game now?

882
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,520
Rachel Sperling, I mean, it's hard to say, right?

883
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,440
Because I don't want to throw shade at my precious Drew.

884
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,800
But Rachel Sperling, I'm just saying, watch the throne.

885
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,560
That's all I'm saying.

886
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,400
Just don't let her into the zone.

887
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
Do not let her into our zone.

888
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Thank you, Rachel Sperling.

889
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,960
It's by Yahoo Answers user Holden Caulfield.

890
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,720
Holden Caulfield asks, do snakes and birds ever make love to each other

891
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,080
when scientists aren't looking?

892
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,720
Yes. I know birds are real.

893
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,280
Oh, okay.

894
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:25,840
Next question.

895
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,640
I know birds are really closely related to reptiles.

896
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,440
Does that mean they sometimes get intimate with each other?

897
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,160
Or are they so closely related that it would count as incest?

898
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,080
That doesn't make any fucking sense.

899
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,400
The rest, the stuff before it did.

900
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,760
But you lost me at that part.

901
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
Also, if a bird and a snake were to cross breed,

902
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,160
would the offspring be flying snakes?

903
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,000
Yes, that's where Quetzalcoatl came from.

904
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
Read the literature.

905
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,440
Please help. It's for a bet I'm having with my friend Holden Caulfield.

906
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,840
Now, to be fair, if it is a male, then it is a flying snake Quetzalcoatl.

907
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,920
If it is a female, it is a cockatrice.

908
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,040
Is that how it works?

909
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:07,680
Yes.

910
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,840
It's weird because you think it would,

911
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
and I don't want to go blue here,

912
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,600
but you would think it would be the other way around.

913
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,840
Well, but they call it a cockatrice before they understood that that was the principle.

914
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,360
So they thought like all animals were male till they decided to be female

915
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,360
because scientists used to be really super dumb.

916
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,400
What about a rock?

917
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
Was that, is there a snake in there at all?

918
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,400
No, it's just a stone, Griffin.

919
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,040
You shut up.

920
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,800
I bet that different animals probably fuck all the time when we're not watching, right?

921
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,440
This is specifically, sorry, this question is specific.

922
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,200
When scientists aren't watching.

923
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,440
Yeah.

924
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,600
Because that's all they'll believe.

925
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,840
Well, you would think, no, that's the problem though,

926
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,400
is that we're all fucking narcs, aren't we?

927
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,360
Like if I was in the woods and I turned a corner and it was like,

928
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,280
that's the sound of a snake and a bird fucking,

929
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,640
I'd be like, oh, I need a scientist over here, right?

930
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,320
Like I would narc them out in a second.

931
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,840
Someone give me a scientist.

932
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,280
I would Instagram that and then I would send it to all my scientist buddies, right?

933
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,520
This person is basically just describing a deviant version of Toy Story.

934
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,640
What in what?

935
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,160
No, they're not at all.

936
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,440
Scientists turn their backs and the snakes and birds are fucking.

937
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,960
Toy Story 4.

938
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,720
Toy Story 4, snakes and birds.

939
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,160
Getting it on.

940
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,280
Day 78.

941
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,200
I've been watching the bird and the snake constantly without fail.

942
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,160
So far, nothing is-

943
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,600
My pen's out of ink.

944
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,320
Hold on, I'll be right back.

945
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,600
Oh man.

946
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
Why are they both sitting there smoking cigarettes?

947
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,600
What is happening? There's nothing that gets birds and snakes hornier

948
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,720
than being watched by scientists for prolonged periods of time.

949
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,220
Yeah.

950
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,320
Hey, he's out of the room.

951
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,280
You want to do this?

952
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,920
I don't know.

953
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,720
I don't know.

954
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,400
I just, can I just, a really quick question?

955
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,440
And I'm no scientist as we've established,

956
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,360
because I could watch a bird and the snake fuck,

957
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,440
but is the snakes cum?

958
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
Do you mean jism?

959
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,400
Is a snake's jism basically just little snakes?

960
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,180
What?

961
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
If you think about it-

962
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,920
Slithering hither and yon.

963
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,440
If a snake, when a snake, because they have to, right?

964
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,080
If a snake.

965
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,600
If it, no, snakes have to-

966
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,160
When a snake.

967
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,040
There are more snakes.

968
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,400
There are always more snakes.

969
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:32,960
When a snake-

970
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,080
Could you with a snake?

971
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,920
When a snake jisms, it's just little snakes, right?

972
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,520
I always thought that's what was coming out of their fangs.

973
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,040
Oh my God.

974
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,000
That's horrifying, Justin.

975
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,080
That's just really bad.

976
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,280
Not only am I now dying of venom, but also, ew.

977
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,320
Ew, gross.

978
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,280
Suck the venom out.

979
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,760
No.

980
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,240
No.

981
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,680
Nah, I'm actually cool.

982
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,320
Ah, good.

983
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,040
Give me a bird.

984
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,880
Bird'll snuck the snake venom out.

985
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,720
You know how those dirty birds do.

986
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,320
Don't let there be a scientist around.

987
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,400
If a snake looks at a bird and thinks, I'm gonna fuck that,

988
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,880
is that the same as if a human looks at a dog and is like,

989
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,760
I'm gonna fuck that?

990
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,320
Well-

991
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,680
Is that equivalent?

992
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,720
Will you be shunned from snake society for birdiality?

993
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,520
I'd rather not consider it.

994
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:21,920
I'm seeing people-

995
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,000
What if you eat it when you're done?

996
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,560
If you eat, if you unhinge your jaw and eat the bird

997
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,000
you just consummated your love with.

998
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,480
And then it was like, you could convince him it was like a long game.

999
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,840
That's pretty sweet, I guess.

1000
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,320
Seen a lot of responses, a lot of very level-headed responses

1001
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,280
to this answer.

1002
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,000
Sure, right.

1003
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,280
A bird and a snake cannot biologically crossbreed.

1004
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,880
They are two completely different species.

1005
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,560
The egg would never get fertilized.

1006
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,960
Hey, you fucking bigot.

1007
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,800
Not all sex has to be for breeding.

1008
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,480
They may just be doing it for fun.

1009
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,360
That sounds like a scientist to me.

1010
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,920
And that's why you will never witness their love.

1011
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,120
And it's amazing.

1012
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,760
That's why you don't get to watch a bird and a snake fuck.

1013
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,360
You close-minded shit.

1014
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,960
We uneducated few get to see the magic and the majesty

1015
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,880
that is a bird and a snake fucking.

1016
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,600
And let me tell you, it is glorious.

1017
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,720
I don't know if that had been a lyric in that ICP tune.

1018
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,280
Did you ever see a bird and a snake fuck?

1019
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,880
That's actually where the phrase ignorance is bliss came from.

1020
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,400
It's because when you're ignorant, you get to see that sexy shit.

1021
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:26,720
Oh my god.

1022
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,160
Do you think it's more likely that a male snake would fuck a female bird

1023
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
or that a female snake would fuck a male bird?

1024
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,840
Oh, that's a toughie, Travis.

1025
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,240
Hey, why can't it be a male bird and a male snake?

1026
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,760
Do you ever think there's ever been a committed bird snake couple

1027
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,320
that were living with someone who is in a science discipline

1028
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,440
and then they graduated and got a job in science

1029
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,320
and then they said, listen, this isn't working out.

1030
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,120
Listen, we gotta go.

1031
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,240
You can't observe us anymore.

1032
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,720
I'm sorry.

1033
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,960
You should have thought of this before you got so into science.

1034
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,920
Every so often people email us or tweet at us and ask us

1035
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,720
if we're really stoned when we record episodes.

1036
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,040
I cannot stress enough that we are not.

1037
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,760
I wish we were.

1038
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,160
You're not.

1039
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm stoned on coffee.

1040
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:15,520
That's it.

1041
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,240
You want another question?

1042
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:16,400
Yep.

1043
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,480
Then let me use the bathroom.

1044
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,680
God damn it.

1045
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,280
My friend went through a breakup with her longtime boyfriend this past summer.

1046
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,120
And since then, she's been texting me mass amounts of selfies every day.

1047
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,840
I don't want to be insensitive or mean, but it makes you really uncomfortable.

1048
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,000
If she's still having a hard time, I want to be there for her,

1049
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,240
but I have no idea how to respond to her constant duck face pictures.

1050
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,160
What should I do?

1051
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,680
That's from Jen in Chicago.

1052
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,040
Holy shit.

1053
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,120
What makes this so weird is that she's sending them directly to you.

1054
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:53,920
You like if it was just her posting a bunch on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter and so.

1055
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,800
Okay, fine.

1056
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,440
Great.

1057
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,960
Why is she sending them to you?

1058
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,720
Look at me here and look at me here.

1059
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,280
Look at me here.

1060
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:01,840
Look at me here.

1061
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,360
And what my mouth can do.

1062
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,560
This is my face again.

1063
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:05,360
Did you forget?

1064
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,720
Did you forget what I look like?

1065
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,640
Look how happy I am.

1066
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,840
I bet that's it.

1067
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,560
I bet it's that.

1068
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,280
Look at me.

1069
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,120
I'm having a good time without him.

1070
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,160
Look how happy I am.

1071
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,080
I'm so okay.

1072
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah, which has to be true.

1073
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:25,040
I've never heard of anybody sending people selfies directly.

1074
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,240
I mean, is this a thing?

1075
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,600
I don't know.

1076
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:34,560
It's a if it's a thing, it's what?

1077
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,760
What are you guys laughing at?

1078
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,800
Oh Griffin.

1079
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,160
Griffin is just selfie does.

1080
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,320
Guys.

1081
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,600
Get a quick screencap.

1082
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,000
Uh oh.

1083
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:44,800
Get this out to the people.

1084
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,360
Oh, that's not.

1085
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,640
I don't look good in that one.

1086
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,600
I don't look internet good in that picture.

1087
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,320
I look text.

1088
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:52,400
I look text to my brothers on a Sunday morning.

1089
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,040
Good.

1090
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,600
Is there any kind of text associated with these selfies?

1091
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,160
Is she saying like, this is me having fun in a bar.

1092
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,320
This is me in front of the Eiffel Tower.

1093
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,200
Or is she just like?

1094
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,200
How did you get to France that quickly?

1095
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:05,840
You just sent me.

1096
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,400
You just sent me a selfie from the Grand Canyon two hours ago.

1097
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,520
You're amazing.

1098
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,480
You're incredible.

1099
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,640
You're you're a time walker.

1100
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,720
I don't.

1101
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,520
I don't understand why this is happening.

1102
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,240
Like this goes beyond all cultural things that I understand about the internet.

1103
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,920
Is this like my old man moment?

1104
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,000
Is this like when it falls apart for me?

1105
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,560
Because I don't understand why people send pictures of each other.

1106
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,360
I'll tell you why.

1107
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,800
Because this is your old man moment.

1108
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,360
I'm willing because the question asker asked.

1109
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,480
So it's like, OK, great.

1110
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,920
This is weird to you, too.

1111
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,360
Like this is weird to the question asker as well as being weird to probably everyone listening.

1112
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,040
So here's my advice.

1113
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,240
You should ask her why she's doing this.

1114
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,000
Just ask her.

1115
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,880
Yeah, and like ask her for us.

1116
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,920
It's so just so we know because I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight because the next time she sends one just say like, hey, this is great.

1117
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,840
But I noticed you're sending a lot of selfies.

1118
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,400
What's up?

1119
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,600
What are they?

1120
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,720
Why is this if I got nice pictures of my friends, I wouldn't be complaining.

1121
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,880
I love I love my friends and I love looking at them.

1122
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,560
At what point, Griffin?

1123
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,240
All points become too much.

1124
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:23,840
Oh, never send me a picture of you guys.

1125
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,280
Never send me pictures yourself.

1126
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,240
I find myself fucking forgetting what you look like.

1127
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,040
I know one of you has a beard and one of you doesn't.

1128
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,360
Does one of you have the best?

1129
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,560
Does one of you have glasses?

1130
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,080
That's the best you've got.

1131
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,120
That's all that I've got because you fucks won't send me pictures of you.

1132
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,920
But isn't that any pictures of my baby?

1133
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,120
Yeah, that's not you, is it?

1134
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,280
I can look at that and say, what if that was a boy that was like 45 years older?

1135
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,520
I'm just saying this seems like a nice service.

1136
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,040
I wish I wish my friend.

1137
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,640
I don't use Facebook anymore because fucking all that my Facebook wall is is videos of people popping.

1138
00:48:58,640 --> 00:48:59,360
Big pimples.

1139
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,400
Thanks, Facebook.

1140
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,800
And thanks you sick fucks use Facebook.

1141
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,040
Right.

1142
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,440
I can't do it anymore because it's so terrible.

1143
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,320
So I don't know what my friends look like or my brothers or family.

1144
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,240
Send me pictures of yourselves every day.

1145
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,360
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1146
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:13,360
I think this is a very sweet gesture.

1147
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,160
Y'all want a Yahoo?

1148
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,440
Uh, yes, that would be excellent.

1149
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,360
Um, let's try this Yahoo auto.

1150
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,560
Sent in by Rachel Sperling.

1151
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,440
Game recognized game.

1152
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,080
Thank you, Rachel.

1153
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,960
It's by Yahoo answers user Vicky who asks, could someone pretty please write a vampire story?

1154
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,560
Please start in a dark forest at midnight.

1155
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,720
And there is a girl named Elena who gets hypnotized and bitten by a slow down.

1156
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,280
Slow down.

1157
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,400
Okay, okay, okay.

1158
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,040
Start in a dark forest at midnight.

1159
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,840
And there is a girl named Elena who gets hypnotized and bitten by a vampire named Josiah.

1160
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,560
I want eye contact hypnosis, please.

1161
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,880
Okay, first of all, that's called thrall.

1162
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,720
It's not called hypnosis.

1163
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,480
You're in the thrall.

1164
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,080
Geez, amateurs.

1165
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,440
Glamour is what I prefer.

1166
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,600
Uh, glamour is something that masks you.

1167
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:10,000
So it's more like, uh, you would cast a glamour on someone to, so they would ignore you.

1168
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,600
Yeah, but in true blood, they call it glamoring and they verb it.

1169
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,680
I go, he glamored me into doing this.

1170
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,440
I think that means you dress them up in sequence and, and you made them more glamour.

1171
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,720
That's dazzle them.

1172
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,720
What a fucking stupid show.

1173
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,360
That sounds like never seen it, but it sounds pretty goddamn dumb.

1174
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:30,240
Can someone please write me a vampire story?

1175
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,720
Please, please, please, please, please.

1176
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,280
Please, please.

1177
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,880
There is not enough vampire fiction out there.

1178
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,720
Erotic vamp fiction.

1179
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,440
So is the question asker asking someone to write them a story?

1180
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:41,760
Uh-huh.

1181
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,320
And it's got to have a girl named Elena and then a vampire named Josiah.

1182
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,240
And it's got to have eye contact hypnosis.

1183
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,000
Can I just say, I really like this because I think we could call it choose my own adventure.

1184
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,600
And it's just like, hey, I'm going to tell you what I want in the story.

1185
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,040
I think I used to have a book like this where I was a little kid and mom and dad brought it,

1186
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,600
bought it for me for my birthday, where I went to like planet Travis and they had a machine that

1187
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,480
worked on wishes.

1188
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,800
I think a choose my own adventure book is just a book, right?

1189
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,240
God, I wish books would just choose the fucking adventure for me.

1190
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,920
Just tell me a story.

1191
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,400
I didn't buy this fucking thing to write it myself.

1192
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,680
This is garbage.

1193
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,600
Neil Patrick Harris, you lazy shit.

1194
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,680
What do you think this person wants the story for?

1195
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,720
Do you think it's an assignment where they have to write it and they're going,

1196
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,000
at least I've got all the bones of it, but I just can't put the meat on it.

1197
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,240
Yeah.

1198
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,880
From, from their, their teacher, Miss Clitoris.

1199
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,800
She's starting, but fair.

1200
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,720
Can someone fucking write this person?

1201
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:47,920
Okay.

1202
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,720
So let's go through it.

1203
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,080
She's in a dark forest at night.

1204
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:50,960
Okay.

1205
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,400
How much time do we have left in the show?

1206
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,720
Enough time to write some erotic vampire.

1207
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,360
Okay.

1208
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,480
Let's, let's, let's, let's write one.

1209
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,360
I'm the oldest.

1210
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,720
I'll start.

1211
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,360
Okay.

1212
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:05,040
And I'll like an exquisite corpse.

1213
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:06,960
Yeah.

1214
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,400
Maybe not once.

1215
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,640
Okay.

1216
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:08,720
Yeah.

1217
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,920
We'll do one sentence at a time.

1218
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,560
That'd be good.

1219
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:10,800
Okay.

1220
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,200
The night was dark and also horny.

1221
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,960
The forest was as dark as it was horny too.

1222
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,800
My name is Elena and this forest got me feeling real horny down there.

1223
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:32,800
I swired a shape in the darkness that was white, but had eyes and a cape and maybe fangs.

1224
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,520
It was definitely glamorous, but also erotic.

1225
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,680
His name was Josiah.

1226
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,760
He didn't tell me that, but he looked like one.

1227
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,040
He looked like my friend, Josiah.

1228
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:45,840
There's more than one.

1229
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,200
There was a semicolon in there.

1230
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,360
He looked like my friend Josiah from work at Dress Barn.

1231
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,040
I got closer to him.

1232
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,480
I saw that underneath the cape, he was wearing some sensible jeans and no shirt, but he just

1233
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,280
had like a cape and his muscles were like, yes.

1234
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,160
And I didn't know much, but he was definitely bonered.

1235
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,200
I could see it through his jeans.

1236
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,040
I could see the boner through his jeans.

1237
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,120
Another semicolon was in there.

1238
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,280
They were as sensible as they were see-through.

1239
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,280
It's not your turn.

1240
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:17,920
Oh, sorry.

1241
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,440
I looked at his eyes.

1242
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:25,760
They reminded me of Josiah, my friend at Dress Barn, and that's when it occurred to me.

1243
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,280
I'm going to bone this dude.

1244
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,320
I'm going to bone him.

1245
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,600
Like, you're good.

1246
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,680
I don't know where these thoughts are coming from.

1247
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,880
They definitely weren't my own.

1248
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,600
I feel like you're not saying yes and right now, Jarvis, I think you're saying yes boner-ish.

1249
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,280
No, you said that's when it occurred to me that I was going to bone this dude.

1250
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,320
I'm going to bone him.

1251
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,280
I'm going to bone him.

1252
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,320
I'm going to bone him.

1253
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm going to bone this dude.

1254
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,920
And also, I hate to take on bridge, and then it occurred to me it's not a complete sentence.

1255
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,640
There was a hyphen.

1256
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,080
There was ellipses at the end.

1257
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,480
Chapter two.

1258
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,840
I got fired from Dress Barn today.

1259
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,000
I got fired by my manager, Josiah.

1260
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,120
I thought he was my friend.

1261
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:16,240
And also, he has amazing muscles, and he doesn't wear a shirt, and he wears a cape.

1262
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:18,160
But a different cape.

1263
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,920
We're talking about a different Josiah here.

1264
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,440
I can't express this enough.

1265
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:21,840
I wish.

1266
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,520
I wish.

1267
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:26,240
I really tried to get a hook into this story, Travis.

1268
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,760
You were just not letting it happen.

1269
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,040
I wish everything in my house smelled like Dress Barn, Josiah.

1270
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,240
Suddenly, there was a clattering at my window.

1271
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,440
It was Santa Claus.

1272
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,040
I fucked my brain in the sexy stuff.

1273
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,240
Turns out Santa was a drakul all along.

1274
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,360
Santa climbed in my window, and he opened up his sack, and he let it fall to the ground.

1275
00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,160
And inside, there was just one gift, and it was Josiah, the vampire from earlier,

1276
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,000
and not the Dress Barn, Josiah.

1277
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,920
And he looked deep into my eyeballs, and I got totally bonered for him.

1278
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,600
And then Santa Claus was like,

1279
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,000
Well, I guess I should get going.

1280
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,400
Seems like things are about to get a little bit lusty in here.

1281
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,560
I've got other sex draculas to drop off at kids' houses like you.

1282
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,040
And then Josiah spun around, and he drank Santa's blood.

1283
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,600
Oh, no.

1284
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,160
Until he died.

1285
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,600
And let me be honest, it was a huge turn on.

1286
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:42,080
So I reached inside of his sack, and I got out hundreds of sex draculas, all for me.

1287
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,640
I'm not done.

1288
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,280
I'm not done.

1289
00:55:49,280 --> 00:56:04,720
I crowd surfed on the sex draculas like Buckethead at a corn show when Buckethead was stealing

1290
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:04,960
corn.

1291
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,720
Was he ever?

1292
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,480
Did he glamour him?

1293
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,560
Yeah, I said the thing about the eye fucking.

1294
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,360
Okay.

1295
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,200
I think we just covered all our bases there.

1296
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,120
Also, wait, hold on.

1297
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,720
Oh, hold on.

1298
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,360
Somebody's at my door.

1299
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:19,840
Give me a second.

1300
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,200
Oh, it's a major book publisher, and we're all millionaires.

1301
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,520
So yeah, this is the last episode of the podcast, I guess.

1302
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,720
There's an editor's note.

1303
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,080
I turned a page.

1304
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,200
There's an editor's note that Buckethead wasn't in corn.

1305
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,280
Yeah, he doesn't know what he was thinking about.

1306
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,200
That he did some sorts of GNR, though.

1307
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,200
Maybe that's what we'll put that in later editions.

1308
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,160
And it's going to make this first edition like super rare and super valuable.

1309
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:47,840
I was thinking a monkey, I think.

1310
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:52,880
Welcome to our rare book section here at the Library of Congress.

1311
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,960
Come and you won't believe what's in this edition of Sex Dracula's.

1312
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,040
So I think that's going to do it for us.

1313
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,440
We done?

1314
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,080
Yeah, I think so.

1315
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,360
Yes, pretty much done.

1316
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,040
I don't want to do the podcast anymore.

1317
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,320
We're kind of into books now.

1318
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,720
Listen, we're doing a live show in December 21st.

1319
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,200
That is going to be in Huntington, West Virginia, our hometown, at Huntington City Hall Auditorium.

1320
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:24,560
If you want tickets to that, you can go to bit.ly forward slash Candle Nights Live.

1321
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,480
And you can pick those up.

1322
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,280
They're 15 bucks.

1323
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,920
We've sold almost 500.

1324
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,520
I can't fucking believe how many people are going to be at this show.

1325
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,000
I know.

1326
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,160
It's going to be popping off in like a major way.

1327
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,600
And everybody's going to have a really good time.

1328
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,480
A really good time, I do want to tell you, if you're coming in for the show and you haven't

1329
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,800
gotten hotel accommodations yet, Chase Henderson, who's the guy putting the show together for us,

1330
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:57,280
has arranged a special deal with the Pullman Plaza Hotel where they're going to give people

1331
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,920
coming in for the show a special $99 rate.

1332
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,920
So if you want to get in on that, you call 866-613-3611 and say you're getting a room

1333
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,040
for the My Brother, My Brother and Me show before December 17th.

1334
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,320
And you can get one at a discounted rate.

1335
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:15,440
That would be a great place to stay because it would actually be really close.

1336
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,200
That would be walkable to the theater.

1337
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,960
It would be walkable to the Lantern, which is where we're meeting up after the show.

1338
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,040
And it's really close to Pullman Square.

1339
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,000
There's a lot of places to like eat and shop, whatever you want to do.

1340
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,440
So that would be a good place to stay.

1341
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,160
Again, the number's 866-613-3611 and you can get into that discounted room.

1342
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,400
Also, go ahead and start sending in your Candle Nights questions.

1343
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,520
Please, please, please.

1344
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,960
And if you're going to be at the show, make sure that that's clear in your question.

1345
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,520
We'll probably also take some questions for the audience.

1346
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,440
So be thinking about that when you get there as well.

1347
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,880
Just make sure to put Candle Nights in the subject line so that I can find it.

1348
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,560
Speaking of tickets, Max Fun Con tickets are on sale now.

1349
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:00,080
Hopefully they will be on sale when this episode goes live.

1350
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:05,840
At the time of this recording on Sunday, like 70% of the tickets are sold out.

1351
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:09,840
You can go to maxfuncon.com and you'll see the link for tickets there.

1352
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,800
Again, if they're sold out by the time this goes out, sorry.

1353
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,000
We've tweeted about it and so has the official account.

1354
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:21,040
But it is, guys, it's seriously the most fun ever.

1355
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,200
So check it out, please.

1356
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,760
We have new merch available for you.

00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,840
Go to maxfunstore.com and you're going to find that stuff.

1358
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,840
We've got cool buttons.

1359
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,720
We've got our Fraternal Order of Brothers patch.

1360
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,800
Bumper stickers.

1361
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,920
A question mark poster.

1362
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,480
Now, I think this is a new item since the last time we recorded.

1363
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,760
This is a very cool Saul-based inspired design by our friend Justin Russo.

1364
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
We sell a blue version of this at live shows.

1365
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:59,040
And it is red and it is really, it is probably my favorite,

1366
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,440
like some of my favorite My Brother, My Brother, Me imagery.

1367
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,920
It's in, I got it hanging in my office, I'm looking at it right now.

1368
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,480
It really is so, so, so cool.

1369
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,440
So go get that, the question mark poster.

1370
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,760
Also, make sure to follow us on Twitter.

1371
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,280
We've got a couple new projects coming up that you're going to be really,

1372
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,840
really excited about and we're going to announce them first on Twitter.

1373
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,600

It's just good to follow us anyways,

1375
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,360
because we usually talk about stuff on there before we get to the show,

1376
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,720
because we only do the show once a week.

1377
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,920
Uh, big thanks to the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,
