1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,480
It's my brother, my brother and me, and there's a chill in the air.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,880
Really? It's my brother,

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,720
my brother and me, and the ruffles have ridges. The ruffles have ridges and there's a chill in

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,160
the air. Can you guys feel that? I can feel it. My bones, my bones are so cold, oh my god!

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,840
Why can I feel temperature in my bones? Oh, you know what? I bought my wife a blanket at

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,760
the gas station. It was $5.99. It looked kind of like a Baja, and I tried to snuggle her up in it,

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,200
and she said that it smelled like tires. So I had to, I have to wash it. Of all the places

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,720
that make it. Wait, hold on. Did you go to the gas station to buy a blanket?

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,680
That's the question. Was it your blanket destination?

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,400
Let me hit you with this. Let me give you a bit more context. It was midnight,

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,840
and I was there at the gas station to buy beers.

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
And you thought, my wife is pretty fucking cold right now, I bet.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,720
Honey, I got you some beers and a blanket and this funnel.

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,400
She drove and she was, she was sober and good to go. Me, I was buying my 10th and 11th and 12th

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,480
beers in the night. And she was, and here's my thought process. I'm walking in to the gas station.

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,400
There's a chill in the air. I should see if they have any Navajo style blankets in here.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,360
Oh good, they do. Oh, do they smell like tires? I don't know. My olfactory center is shutting down.

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,480
This better cost less than $6. Oh, success. Perfect. Right underneath that line.

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,840
So this is an advice show. Can we start recording now or?

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Yeah. This is a, time to record. This is an advice show and also blanket recommendations.

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,960
I'm your oldest brother, Justin, the blanket man, McElroy.

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm your middle-aged brother, Travis, the Afghan McElroy. Oh no, wait, wait, wait. I'm gonna change

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,560
it. Good. My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm that quilt that you save just for picnics,

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
your dirty quilt. You know what I mean? The dirty quilt. Hey NDQ McElroy.

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,520
It's a quilt that you use it specifically for outdoor. Maybe there's a music festival.

30
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,160
Maybe you just want to fuck. Maybe you just want to fuck on a soft blanket.

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,880
I want to kick off the blanket advice by saying that if you're at the marathon station

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,600
on Hauger Boulevard, right off of 64, don't buy a blanket there.

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,120
That is enough information to triangulate and kill Justin.

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,720
Yeah. Just wait until 11 o'clock on a Friday or Saturday night. If there's a chill in the air,

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,920
you see one man wrapped in a blanket, like some sort of discount Mother Teresa,

36
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,480
then that will be me. As opposed to your high price, expensive Mother Teresa.

37
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah. You are going to get triangulated and it's triangulated.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,800
Let's get into the advice. Um, I'm in a relationship that recently passed the one

39
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,240
year mark. Congrats. My girlfriend is lovely and sometimes I'm, I'm sorry,

40
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,400
my girlfriend is lovely and I want nothing but to be with her. However,

41
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,440
I've recently noticed that in my sexy dreams are no longer of random hookups between single adults,

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,920
but of cheating on my S.O. It seems my relationship has crept into my very sense of self.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,080
I feel so guilty and fear my occasional sleep talking will give me away.

44
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,640
What can I do? And that is, of course, from thought crime at bedtime.

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,040
I do not think the sleep talking works that way. I do not think if you,

46
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,320
I do not think you anybody's ever been like, oh, Deborah, while they're asleep.

47
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,600
Oh, Deborah, your bobbums.

48
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,440
Oh, there was a time that I was having a dream about a book I was reading and leapt

49
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
up from bed to scream the main character's name because in my dream they were falling off a cliff.

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,640
But other than that, no.

51
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,880
Chas wakes up and just 50 shades of gray. No, I Griffin used to talk in his sleep.

52
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
I don't know if he still does, but I remember on car trips, you could have a conversation with

53
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,880
Griffin, but his only responses were in mumbles and he would be like, you say that, but there's

54
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
no fuck it. Like, how can you believe anything about me as a kid anymore after the baker under

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,560
your bed? That's true. You also, I used to think you slept with one eye open and now I wonder if

56
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,160
you never really slept. Yeah. Wait, what are you saying? Like Little Wonders? Like Little Wonders.

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
You might be a robot. That's small. That's small wonder. You're thinking of little monsters.

58
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,840
I was thinking of little women. Here's the here's ish. You can't control what you fucking dream.

59
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,960
No, you can't. I had a dream the other night that Teresa and I were fighting zombies and she got

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
bit and I had to kill her. And like she begged me to do it. She's like, you have to do it. I'm

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
going to change. And it was horrifying. And I woke up middle of the night, like two 30 and woke her

62
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:50,080
up to apologize to her. Yeah. And her response was it was a dream. Yeah. That's logical. Makes

63
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,800
a lot of sense. Hey, you guys remember an inception when the guy was like, I'm going to win, I'm going

64
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,720
to win this fight now. And then DiCaprio is like, oh, yeah. What? How about if I dream of this train

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,480
and then a train comes in and it kills the guy because Leonardo DiCaprio, like he aimed his dream.

66
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,840
Like first he created he he instantiated the train and his dream world and he aimed it and hit the

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,600
guy with it. Right. None of that shit would be true. Like he would say, like, here comes a train,

68
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,160
but instead he would be all of a sudden he's six years old and he's in gym class. Only the gym

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,440
classes upside down and they've invented upside down basketball. Here comes a train. It'll be

70
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Quad City DJs. And they would just, they would be singing about even that. Even that I believe is

71
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
true. And then you have a dream about cheating on your girlfriend with the Quad City DJs. It would

72
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,480
be the Quad City DJs except they'd be singing like the Smiths or something like that. Honey,

73
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,600
I swear the Quad City DJs and I are just friends. We do in fact have a space jam going on though.

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,640
Mm-hmm. But that is not true. See you guys need to get on my tip which is lucid dreaming. Come with

75
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,120
me. Lucid dreaming is where you take control. Yeah. You wrest control of your dreams from Leo

76
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,480
and you say I'm the captain of this ship and you tell yourself tonight I'm gonna dream about

77
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,280
punching Stalin or something. Yeah. Something cool and then you do it and you take control

78
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,600
of your dreams. You just put a little bit of peyote under your tongue before you go to sleep.

79
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,080
If you can, really the best way to do it is to colon roll. And then basically your dreams are,

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,680
you are the master of your dreams. Grab the bridle of your dreams and put this paper towel

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,600
in your asshole. You have to be spiritually open and ready to control your dreams. And rectally

82
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,920
if you're gonna get that paper towel. If I'm not spiritually and rectally open, I actually,

83
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I'm afraid to fall asleep because I have had control of my dreams for so long that I'm worried

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,160
if I go in willy nilly, the dreams are just gonna run rough shot over my emotions. Yeah,

85
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,160
the dream lord will be like finally a weak point. Finally. Now experience all the emojis you've been

86
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,440
holding back. You've been holding onto these emojis in this bottle. I've been saving them.

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,880
Experience them all. Have sex with the teeth that fell out of your head because you're naked at

88
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,360
school and you forgot your lines at the play. And you've forgotten how to run quickly and you feel

89
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,480
like you're moving through molasses. And also you're flying off a cliff and you're on fire and

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,560
your parents are there and there's your grandma. And you're trying to punch the dude but you can't

91
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,960
remember how to make a fist. You can't remember how to make a fist and your hands are bones and

92
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:28,240
teeth. I am the dream master, experience your emojis. And the fucked up thing about dreams is

93
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
you might be dreaming about- What is, hold on. What is the fucked up thing about dreams? No,

94
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,480
what I'm saying is like you might have a dream that's about like cheating on your SO. Sure.

95
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:41,280
And in real like, but what it translates to in the synapse of your brain is you were dreaming

96
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,920
about that because you're frustrated with the quality of work you've been doing at work. And

97
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,000
like it has nothing to do with your SO or sex or anything like that. Like your brain has just

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,440
translated those impulses to something else. So Travis, because you are, you are obviously so,

99
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,000
so good at this. If I do have a dream with upside down basketball and I'm getting gangbanged by the

100
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,160
Quad City DJs, how many of them are there? Quad City DJs? I assume there's four. Four from

101
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,880
different cities. And they each represent the different districts of that. Okay. Oh,

102
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,200
that makes sense. Four DJs inside. Then like, what's the- You're four DJs deep. I'm four DJs.

103
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,440
Well, they're, they're each one quarter Griffin deep. Anyway, what's the, what's the implication?

104
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,840
I think it means that there's big possibilities on the horizon. Okay. Okay. So you're using

105
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,880
them for fortune telling. Yeah. For omens and portents. Yeah. So you're saying that

106
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,920
dreaming of the Quad City DJs in a sexual fashion is a good, is a good omen. It usually means that

107
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,960
there's going to be a solid harvest. Yeah. I know there's going to be a solid harvest.

108
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,280
It's me and the Quad City DJs. You're going to like what you're reaping. Your barn will not be

109
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,680
overflowing with grain, but it will sustain you through the cold, cold winter. They are going to

110
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,000
be at, something's going to overflow. It's the Quad City DJs and me. Let the crystal pour.

111
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,040
Um. So long story short, your dreams don't mean shit. You don't have to worry about it. Dreams

112
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,440
don't mean anything. And you're not gonna, and if you, if she gets mad at you because of something

113
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
crazy you dream, that's a crazy thing to get mad about. Yeah. I don't think he's telling,

114
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,280
I do not think he's telling her. I think that his ish is that he feels guilty for his brain,

115
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,880
brain crimes that he's doing. Yeah. I don't think you have to feel guilty about that. Yeah. You

116
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:38,720
can't feel guilty. Your brain all day, every day, you spend controlling the literally thousands of

117
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,880
life ruining impulses. Yes. And you are, do such a good job of that. At evening times,

118
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,240
when you're asleep, just your, your brain has got to run wild like Hulkamania, brother.

119
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
It's got to get out there. It's got to do all the bad things that you didn't let it do,

120
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
but it'll do for pretend. It's a deal. Your brain is writing awesome movies starring you.

121
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,960
You don't censor them. You're saying, you're saying full, like lean into it, like full blown,

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:15,200
dip your balls into the Caligula Caligula, like wieners, wieners, ahoy everywhere.

123
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,040
Plaster the wall with them. Wait, why do you assume, whoa, why do you assume that everyone's

124
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,960
dreams are just full of wieners? Cause you can't imagine what a vagina looks like unconsciously.

125
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,280
Fair enough. Look at it this way. Like if you had a dream where you killed someone,

126
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,760
you wouldn't wake up the next day and be like, I got to turn myself in. Like I have

127
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,400
homicidal tendencies. I want to kill everyone. Like that's not how it works. So it doesn't

128
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:46,480
translate the other way. I'm not saying you should try to make your dream sexier. I'm not saying like

129
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
you should just like, you should like go to bed reading Tropic of Cancer to try to ramp up the

130
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,680
nastiness. Yeah. I'm saying, I'm saying that just like, let it, let it be, you know, don't

131
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:06,160
just let the stink build in there. Just let it get real, real ripe. Um, you guys want a Yahoo answer?

132
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,320
Yeah. You guys have totems, right? You got a little, like I've got a little,

133
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
it'll get a little thing and you hold it and then your dream, you know, if it's a dream or

134
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
if you're being incepted. Yeah, it's my wiener. Yeah, of course. Okay. Mine's my wiener too.

135
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:27,360
Cause nobody knows the heft. This Yahoo answer was sent. The weird sharp edges are. Why is it sharp?

136
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,240
This Yahoo answer is sent in by Supindle. Thanks Supindle. It's by Yahoo answer user

137
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,520
Rayo who asks, what do you think of Dan Aykroyd physically?

138
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:48,400
What do you think of Dan Aykroyd's aspect years ago and at present? Thanks.

139
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,800
All right. As weird as this question is, I know what this person is asking. Yeah. It's unrecognizable.

140
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,320
The shift. But, but, but the same shift has befallen

141
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,000
two of the Ghostbusters. I see what you're saying. Because Dan Aykroyd has gone through this. Harold

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,640
Ramis may as well be a different person. I mean, totally different dude. You would not connect that

143
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,200
guy. I would need him to show me his driver's license before I would believe that that is

144
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,520
Harold Ramis of Ghostbusters. Right. That's why I would say like Bill Murray has aged poorly,

145
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,280
but on a constant. No, no, no, no. Bill Murray, you look at Bill Murray, you look at a picture

146
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,680
of old Bill Murray and young Bill Murray and you say, okay, I can see how those two are connected.

147
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,400
That's what I'm saying. It's been on a constant curve, but not like for the better. Right. You

148
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,760
look at a young picture of Dan Aykroyd and it looks like Dan Aykroyd and you look at a picture

149
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,600
of Dan Aykroyd nowadays and it looks like Baron fucking Harkonnen. Like he'd look up.

150
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,600
It's, it's upsetting visually. Ernie Hudson, worth pointing out, looks great. Ernie Hudson looks

151
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,560
great. It's, you know why? He's young at heart and at brain. Dude fucking loves Pokemon cards. Well,

152
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
he's also my favorite Ghostbuster. The nice thing about Ernie Hudson is that he's managed

153
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,840
to take it easy since he hasn't worked himself too hard since Ghostbusters. Every so often he

154
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,160
does an episode of Psych and then he just kicks back, you know? He, I mean, he's still, he's got,

155
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,720
he's got his Beverly Hills Chihuahua residues, which is I'm sure treating him real nice.

156
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,280
I just looked up, I looked up Ernie Hudson just now to make sure that I was right about him looking

157
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,680
great. And he does look great for a 66 year old man. He looks wonderful. But I saw a picture of

158
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,600
his hand prints in cement. I was like, whoa, Ernie Hudson, you're a lot better than I thought. And

159
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
then I read the caption that says the hand prints of Hudson in front of the great movie ride at

160
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,240
Walt Disney World's Disney World Hollywood Studios theme park. Better than nothing. Better than

161
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,560
nothing. I don't have my, my prints aren't there. Yeah. It could have just been like he was going

162
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,160
outside to get the paper. He slipped, fell, they were filling in a pothole, burned his hands real

163
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,640
good. Did you guys see him in Franklin and Bash this year? No. I've never seen Franklin and Bash

164
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:12,320
to begin with. I'm pretty sure it doesn't actually exist. Is that a men's catalog? It's a Mark Paul

165
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,880
Gosler. Oh, I've heard of that. Yeah. It's on, it's in its third season. I don't know. I mean,

166
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,520
it's Breckenmeyer and Mark Paul Gosler, two of Travis's favorite, favorite people. I do not

167
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,720
believe that he is not watching the show. It's actually, they've canceled each other out and

168
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,640
that is so charming that it's just engulfed into a charming black hole and I can't watch it.

169
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,440
I understand. It kind of looks like his head is getting taller. Like his head never stopped

170
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,280
growing. Right. He is, he is actually becoming a cone head, ironically enough. Yikes. Yowzers.

171
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,360
Why are we? No, but now, okay, listen. Can we take a step back and figure out why we're making fun

172
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,560
of Dan Aykroyd as far as we are? That's what I was gonna say. To be fair, like it's never like in

173
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,880
the past when he was 25 that he was some dreamboat that everybody pined after. Oh, I'm gonna fuck

174
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,200
that. I think the interesting thing about Dan Aykroyd, other than the fact that he's obviously

175
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:06,720
a genius, is that Dan Aykroyd has made a career out of being a caricature of a person that it

176
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,080
turns out he is. Yes. Like, you know what I mean? I think the weird thing about Dan Aykroyd is

177
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,640
you think that he is mocking this like, like slyly skewering a certain type of person with

178
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:25,680
his whole spiel, and it turns out he just is, he snuck into Hollywood somehow, and he is in fact

179
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
that person. Yes. But I also, here's the other weird aspect that now as I'm going through my

180
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,440
head of all the Dan Aykroyd movies I can think of, it's like you could watch him become less and less

181
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,280
attractive, but he plateaued at this point where he was perfectly unattractive to play like a

182
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,120
hundred different roles. Like, instead of growing more and more attractive, something like, oh my

183
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,040
God, you're beautiful. You're perfect for this. Like, they were like, yeah, you'll look great as

184
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,840
a conehead. You'll look great as this dude. And then he kind of slipped over the edge of the

185
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:01,120
plateau and kept going down. You're saying there was a point in his physical life when Dan Aykroyd

186
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,560
was the perfect amount of unattractive and attractive to where he would be perfectly

187
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,640
believable in literally any role. He became the Lon Chaney of comedic actors for a brief,

188
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,400
for a brief moment in time, right around, I'm going to, I'm going to pin it actually

189
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:27,280
as, as right around, uh, I would say Casper. I think, okay. See, I'm going to put it in 1988

190
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,720
with my stepmother is an alien. There was a day, there was a six month period in his life

191
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,000
when Dan Aykroyd could be believably married to Kim Basinger. Did he sign on to that movie

192
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,240
because he thought it was like a hard hitting documentary. Finally, finally we're unearthing

193
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:51,280
these schemes and scandals. But I like, I picture him in gross point blank and he was

194
00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:01,280
perfectly unattractive in that, but not so much so that I was like, oh, see, I think,

195
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,400
I think Dan Aykroyd looks great. He's looking better. I think for me, there's a picture of him

196
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,360
from three where he's looking dynamite. Let me see up on his IMDb. We're just, we're just combing

197
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,520
through the, we're combing through the Dan Aykroyd pictures. I mean, no shit though. You guys,

198
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,400
Griffin might be right. And then I'm looking at a series of pictures as he's aged. His forehead

199
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,920
has literally gotten taller and taller. His hairline is not receding. His hairline is,

200
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,480
his eyebrows are just descending. It's like, it's like he's been put in a machine that's

201
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,000
filling his brain with thoughts. And it's just like making his head swell. Yeah. It's like,

202
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,840
he's got that, he doesn't have a forehead anymore. He's got that Tyra Banks five head.

203
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,480
Anyway, we're all big fans of your work, Mr. Aykroyd. And we do want to say thank you again

204
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,520
for, for listening to this show. I love your, I love your vodka. I love your, what if you pulled

205
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,440
like an Anthony Michael Hall and just like rolled up in a movie next year, just totally fit and

206
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,840
looking so good. And I was like, who the fuck is that? And like, Dan Aykroyd. I don't know who

207
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,200
that is, but I want to fuck him. Oh man. Maybe he'll be in a good day to die hard. But like,

208
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,800
as Bruce Willis's hunkier. Younger brother. Younger brother. Younger brother. This is my brother,

209
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:26,080
Stan McClain. This is my brother, Don McClain. He may look like the actor Dan Aykroyd, but that's

210
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,960
impossible. Look how fucking fit he is. Not to be confused with that other Don McClain fool.

211
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,640
I would love it if at the end of the movie, Bruce Willis just like takes off, takes off a prosthetic

212
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
nose and you look at it and it was, it was, it was Dan Aykroyd the whole time. You didn't even know.

213
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,400
And Dan Aykroyd like pulls out a, a shotgun and gives his signature line. Get along little doggies.

214
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,240
Get along, get along you jerkos. And then he fires at him.

215
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,480
I love that. Love that series. Love that franchise.

216
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,880
Sure. And it's only getting better. I work in a small rural high school and I have a problem.

217
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,200
The principal of my school does not know how to let go of a handshake. He will stand next to you

218
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
and hold a conversation with you. And without fail, never let go of your hand until the

219
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,240
conversation is over. Whether the conversation lasts 10 minutes or 10 seconds or three minutes,

220
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,560
he will not let go unless you pull out with the anxiety and fear of an anxious teen.

221
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,280
How do I extricate myself from these sticky situations without being too awkward?

222
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,680
That's from shaking in a small. Wait, his hand is sticky? Gross. That's an issue. This is an ish

223
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,480
of the highest degree. This is a serious situation. There, I have never felt, let me think, let me

224
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:54,640
think of. I think maybe. Really, just my girlfriend is the only hand that I've ever touched that I

225
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,480
wasn't immediately like, I don't like the way that that feels. You know what I mean? It's not like

226
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,920
there's always a humor on the on the human hand that I do not. I do not appreciate being in contact

227
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,080
with. I have for the longest time. It's a really weird hangout. But if you had the stickiest,

228
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,480
creepiest hands. No, but if I shake hands with someone or someone like touches my shoulder or

229
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,600
something, the first thought that pops in my head is their hand probably smells weird. I don't know

230
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,360
why, but like that always is like my first thought. I hate. Can I tell you something,

231
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:34,400
Trav? Can I real talk you? Yeah. Your hand has a faintly sweet smell to it that you put that I

232
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:42,320
don't want to cast aspersions, but everything you touch assumes that that scent. So maybe you may be

233
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,520
right in that assumption because you're passing it on to them. I think I smell wonderful. Okay,

234
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:55,040
yeah. I think I smell faintly of honeysuckles. You smell like you do. You smell a little bit like

235
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:59,760
honey and that's why. And that, but that's not good because your hand is gigantic. You don't

236
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,040
think you don't think there's a worse smell than honey. You don't think. No, you smell a little

237
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,680
bit like honey. That's just enough to be disconcerting, right? I'll work on it, right? It

238
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,640
sounds like fully like it sounds like a honey ham is a better way of saying it. When you shake hands

239
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,560
with Travis, it's like a honeyed ham. Now that is not true. I have a wonderful handshake that I've

240
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:26,400
been complimented on many times. It's because the people are you inspire fear in their hearts

241
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,000
because you have a very well, you know, Machiavelli said you can either be feared or loved, but not

242
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,200
both. And I chose to go with fear in my handshake. But then I love in the deep pools of my eyes.

243
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,080
When someone shakes your hand trap, they, they pull their hand back and they go, what the fuck

244
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
was that? And then they smell their hand and they go, what the fuck was that? I can't even imagine

245
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,760
why people have commented on the fact that they feel like the last couple of episodes have been

246
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,240
very anti Travis. If you're listening, it's not a bad Travis chase your bliss. It's not a bad

247
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,120
thing that my hand smells like honey or making it seem like it is. Is it possible that you can

248
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,680
convert the handshake to a hug? Oh, like a bro hug, like, like double tap on the back. Yeah. Like

249
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,720
a bringing in big, like a bump, maybe even not wrap the free arm around, but even like bringing

250
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:22,160
in and then pull out to show like, Hey, I'm done with this. Like I'm out of this. This is a really

251
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,440
odd cultural thing that would make me sincerely. I would, if somebody tried to hold onto me,

252
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,440
I would probably lose my mind with like being trapped in a social situation.

253
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,240
When is, when is a handshake appropriate? Like first greeting?

254
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,520
Never. No, but I mean, in the world, you can't say that. Cause like in a meeting, when like,

255
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,400
if you work in a business and someone goes, Oh, and this is such and such, like you don't just

256
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,080
like nod your head. It's a professional hug. Yes. Yeah. I feel like the hug is the, is the

257
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,920
gold standard of these, of these types of things. So I think the weird thing here is not the,

258
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,960
but it's not the timeframe for which he'll hold the handshake. It's that every time he sees you,

259
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,840
he shakes your hand. I really shake hands with people the first time we meet. And then the,

260
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,320
when we agreed to kill one another's relatives and we want to seal the deal. Those are the only times

261
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,360
and so we'll never be caught. Those are the only times when I feel like a handshake is appropriate.

262
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,760
Other than that, I don't want to hear about it. If you're, if you hold on past three pumps,

263
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,760
if you go to four pumps, you're officially holding hands at the very worst. You should

264
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,520
just slow your pumps, you know, in Somalia, you're married now. Now, when you say slow your pumps,

265
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,200
are you talking about doing like a very slow, like snake dance move? Or maybe you could go

266
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,520
to a side to side pump. Everyone does up and down pump, go side to side pump. And I guarantee three

267
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,720
times with that, he'll never shake your hand again. If I fucking ever met anybody businessly

268
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,280
and I grabbed their hand to go for the shake, but instead of doing the shake, I did the snake with

269
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,040
my arms and I started with my free arm and worked it over and he completed it to completion on his

270
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,720
other free arm. I would, I would sign any fucking contract that person put before me. Cause we are

271
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,480
then best friends. Yeah. That's the coolest move. That's a great move. There's no better way to

272
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,920
figure out like, do you know how when sometimes you think a person's lame or you just don't think

273
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,440
anything of them at all. And then you learn that they'd like say something like maybe they like a

274
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
band that you like, you're like, oh, you're actually pretty fucking cool. This is a,

275
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,880
this is a litmus test for doing that shit at first blush. Like, it's like the test from the thing

276
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,000
where you dip the hot wire in the blood. It's a, it's a quickest, fastest way to coolness. Travis,

277
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
when you say that someone should slow their pumps, you think that that's something you should try to

278
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,520
do with your own actions? Or are you literally suggesting a situation where you look this person

279
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,840
dead in the eye and say, Hey, hey, hey, slow those pumps down. What is the rush? Are you feeling

280
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,120
this electricity between us? This is something real we have here. Why are you rushing these pumps?

281
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,080
I bet you Matthew McConaughey would be in twice as many movies if he didn't do that every single

282
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,840
time in that four song person. If he didn't start with clutching the fingers and then work his way

283
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,800
into the palms. Hey, hey, hey, little nephew, why are we rushing pumps? Whoa, whoa, whoa,

284
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,640
Stevie Speils, let's slow it on down. I want to be in, I want to be your new Indiana Jones.

285
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,920
Who's having a stroke? The most, the most white beatenest man to ever live. Matthew McConaughey

286
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:42,640
and Bing Crosby's son, Matthew Crosby. Bing McConaughey, please. Please call me Bing.

287
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:50,480
My father was Mr. McConaughey. Someday at the end times, Matthew Crosby will have to take up arms

288
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,440
against Bing McConaughey. Once brothers, now bitter sworn enemies. Oh my Christ.

289
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:07,280
That was my Bing Crosby impression. We got to do this money zone. We got to do,

290
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,600
we got to. I don't think we helped that gentleman at all.

291
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,040
Here's what you do, fucking slap their hand with your other hand. That's why you don't handshake

292
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,040
with two hands. So you have the other hand to fight off an attacker. And that's what this

293
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,160
person's doing to you. Yeah, they are pinning you. Would you lose your job if once after he

294
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,400
was done talking, he went to break, you didn't break and you're like, we can think of more stuff

295
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,160
to talk about. That's good. That's good. Or maybe every time he touches your hand,

296
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,240
yell bad touch. Just like that. No, no, no, no, no dress it. Yeah. I mean, I need an adult.

297
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:55,680
Okay. Seriously. I want money. Okay. Who's this message for Griffin? I have no idea. Brad. Who's

298
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:04,160
this message from Travis? It's Amber. And Brad says to Amber, happy birthday love. I can't imagine

299
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,200
my life without noodle in the loaf and all this. Oh my God. It's noodle and the loaf, not noodling

300
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,000
the loaf. I just want to make that clear to everyone. They are both equally unpleasant on

301
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,280
a different spectrum of unpleasantness. How do you even do this? I just, so I'm clear. This is

302
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:28,080
Amber speaking to Brad and she loves noodle in the loaf. We were noodling the loaf. Oh yeah.

303
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:35,280
That was great. You're my Ron, my people, my bramble pelt. And she says the Brad is the best

304
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:42,080
writer slash musician slash singer she's ever known. His actual birthday is today. Oh shit.

305
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,520
Double. So double message. Go noodle his loaf and just wait, wait. Why is this a double message

306
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,800
Griffin? Cause it's his birthday on his birthday. Yeah. Also I don't think let's not get weird,

307
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:01,520
but I don't think he's the one that has the loaf. I can't actually think about the physics of

308
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,000
noodling the loaf. I know I wished it into existence and now I'm trying to wish it away.

309
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,000
So I'm going to move on to this message for Amy Endsworth and Brian. Be safe. If you're going to

310
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
noodle the loaf, please be safe. Make sure the loaf has cooled down. Don't take it right out

311
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:24,240
the oven. There's burns. Don't take your butt loaf right out of the sex oven. If you know what I

312
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,320
mean. And I think you know what I mean. I think you do. There's burns Amber. Be careful. Be smart.

313
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,840
Stay in school. Amy Endsworth. There's a message from Benjamin Endsworth, your husband. He says,

314
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,120
you make my life better in every way. You bring such joy into our world. I love you so much for

315
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,560
everything you do in our, you are my heaven and earth, my moon and my stars. And I love you. Thank

316
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,920
you for loving me. And by the way, can we try noodling the loaf? I read about it.

317
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,040
Well, see, I actually said it's insulation love sauce, which is what I see in what you

318
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:08,800
pour over noodle in the loaf. Yeah, we had this delicious noodle in the loaf. It was

319
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,640
smothered in love sauce. It was delish. That was, that was really sweet.

320
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,600
Please put, save funnier stuff next time for us. Next time, please do a little work for us.

321
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,280
I, I, I appreciate your love and it brings, it brings joy to my heart and my life. But if you

322
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,600
could say something in there, like a pop culture reference or something that we could make sound

323
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,000
like a penis and a vagina. That'd be awesome. Hey, doesn't it feel like it's time for Nicholas

324
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,480
Hyde's birthday? Yeah, it seems like just this time last year. Yeah. And then the year before

325
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,840
that, that he turned 91. Today we're celebrating the 92nd birthday of Nicholas Hyde from his pal,

326
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,240
John. He, Nick's a 3L law student. Apparently it's taken him a while to get through. He's a

327
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:07,840
apparently not. Why are you putting him on blast like that? Because he's 92 years old. He's a big

328
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,040
old dumb-o. Yeah. And it says he's starting a career in standup comedy. Nicholas, your birthday

329
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,080
present from us is that we're going to force you to choose a career path right this second. Go. You

330
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,080
can either be a lawyer, a standup comic or a video game master. Daris, those are the three things that

331
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,480
there are to be. Please choose one and move on with your life. One of those jobs pays real well

332
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,760
and then one of them's not really a job at all. I would choose lawyer. You'll get like a paycheck

333
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,880
and whatnot. That sounds pretty good. But video game master, the reward is inherent. And the robe

334
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:52,080
you get is beautiful. Yeah, it's all shimmery and yeah, I love that. The best thing about being a

335
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,960
lawyer is you earn a bunch of money and you know what the best thing to spend your money on? Ass

336
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,080
products. I was actually going to say a box that shocks your dick, but that's pretty good. You

337
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,800
guessed a good thing. I'm going to give you guys, I'm going to talk about ExtremeExchange.com. That

338
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:21,520
is your super store for adult toys. Adults only please. I'm going to get, we're going to do a

339
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,520
little quiz, a little quick two to three question quiz depending on how long your answers take.

340
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,640
I'm going to give you guys a name of a product and I want you to guess each guess with no hesitation

341
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,040
what you think it is. Who's starting? Travis will answer first thing. First product is nipple

342
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,520
boosters. I think it pulls your nipples out. I think it's like a jet pack, but you wear it on

343
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:52,880
the front and it's powered by nipple energy. Okay. That is Travis. Travis wins their suction cups

344
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,480
that you put on your nipples to heighten them. Okay. Okay. We're going to- I'm sick of my,

345
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,040
my nipples are like two inches below sea level. I hate them. My nipples are so lackadaisical.

346
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:13,280
Perk up boys. Pumping buddy tea hose connector. No. You know sometimes you're trying to steep

347
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,200
your tea and you're steeping your tea in there, but, and then- And you get lonely and you need

348
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,920
a pumping buddy to be there with you. You think like, I want to get that tea, but I want it to

349
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,200
go up instead of down. And so this is a special tube. And if you've ever heard of a butt chug?

350
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,800
Sure. This does it. This does it, but it's specifically with steeped tea. Okay. Travis,

351
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:43,760
what do you think it is? Let me give you a hint. Guess something with dicks. I think that you put

352
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,120
three dicks in and you form a tea and it pumps them. No. Well, it is that tube you connect,

353
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,120
you use to connect two dicks or a dick and a clitoris or whatever. Like a Chinese finger trap.

354
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,240
Exactly. Justin, on the subject of guess something with dicks, have you ever considered

355
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:13,360
turning this podcast into like a PSAT prep podcast? This podcast is two dicks. Do we have any sort of

356
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:21,520
measurable numbers for if this podcast does make you better at the PSAT? Yes, except the inverse

357
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,600
of that. I can't, it couldn't possibly make it worse. Nah, it couldn't make it worse. But anyway,

358
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:32,880
extremistraints.com is your home for awesome, awesome toys that you never knew existed. You guys

359
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,480
are buying stuff like, we like to go to the outer edges mostly just because we've talked about

360
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,160
Extremistraints so many times that I can't even get a semi talking about like dildos and stuff.

361
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,640
Yeah, that's old hat, man. That's old hat. That seems pedestrian. Are you saying that there once

362
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:54,400
was a time where you could say the word dildo and just like that? There's no full mask. No,

363
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:00,400
no, I'm not right. No. Extremistraints.com, use the coupon code MIDDLIST and we're going to save

364
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,320
you 20%. Well, we're not going to save you. The fine people of Extremistraints.com are going to

365
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,960
save you 20%. You guys are using that one and that coupon code quite a bit. And I would suggest you

366
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,400
continue to use it. And all your stuff will come in a very discreet box. None of those big bright

367
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,680
red, this box full of dildos boxes you normally get. You'll be lucky if you can find it. They will

368
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,720
make it look like the rock you hide your key under. Wait a minute. I could have sworn I ordered

369
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,800
something from them. Have you guys seen Looper? What they do is they travel back in time and they

370
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,920
give you that dildo 20 minutes before you ordered it. So you've actually always had that dildo.

371
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,480
Only you go, wait a second. But then you go 30 years and it's your dildo. It was your dildo.

372
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:52,000
They closed the loop. I closed my dildo loop. Now close your loop. And by loop,

373
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,520
I mean, butthole. Close it up with this thing. At Extremistraints.com.

374
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,520
Close your loop. You're orgasming wrong. I'm Dan Ackroyd, the brother of old Joseph

375
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,960
Ford Levitt. And I'm going to close your dildo loop. He grew up into me. He grew up into me in

376
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,640
an alternate future where someone gave him a dildo. Can you believe it? No, neither can I.

377
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,640
Me neither. In the future, dildos are illegal. So we have to put them in this machine and send

378
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,800
them back to you and you can save money on them and you got to get rid of them. By which I mean,

379
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,960
put them all the way up your butt until you can't see it anymore. That way future cops can't find

380
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,520
it. Griffin, are you suggesting that the reason Dan Ackroyd's head is increasing in size is because

381
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,880
people are using his head to store contraband future dildos? Is that what you're saying to

382
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,200
me right now? And as I assume all of you want a my brother, my brother and me shout out, just go to

383
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:57,120
maximumfun.org forward slash Jumbotron. And you too could join the podcast. I can't believe that

384
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:02,800
I use the same air in this room to wish those people that said that the stars were each other's

385
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,080
love or something to also say that Dan Ackroyd's head is full of illegal future dildos.

386
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,680
My husband Brett and I do a fantasy football league with a couple of friends and I have a

387
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:26,160
dilemma. I would like to flaunt my wins, especially over my husband, as I am the only

388
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,320
girl participating. However, I do not want to be mean and upset anyone. How do I celebrate

389
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,720
my victories without seeming like I'm throwing it in their faces? That's from Bama Girl. I think

390
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:46,160
it's Bama Girl. It could be Bama Girl. I will say this is a hard one for me to answer. Currently,

391
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,840
touchdown to an Abbey is a zero and four. So I think at this point, if I had a win, I would

392
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:01,440
pretty much set my house on fire. In celebration? In celebration. Thrilled celebration. As the Mario

393
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,840
Lopez dispenser, the GM of the Mario Lopez dispenser, who is currently sitting on a pretty

394
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:16,800
three-in-one, I think you can't worry too much about it. But can I make a suggestion to our

395
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,320
listeners, since that is what we are supposed to be doing? I think taking it from the angle of

396
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I'm the only girl and I'm beating you and I'm a girl winning, I think you're just going to

397
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,520
alienate yourself and I don't think that that's a good way to go. And you set all of woman combat,

398
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,760
just celebrate on the angle that you are winning and they are not. You could send a message.

399
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,800
You could send a message saying, saying like, I'm a woman and this is, so that's normal,

400
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,160
and I beat you any, I beat you normal like a normal person would. Is that good? This is a

401
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,400
neutral victory that I'm having. Neutral victory? Jenner has no play in this whatsoever. My points

402
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,560
were higher than yours and that's really all it came down to. But like, let's be honest here. We

403
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,960
are talking about game in which you win by picking which other person is actually going to do a real

404
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,480
good job in the real world. Yeah, like bragging is all you have. Like it is a game composed entirely

405
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,160
of just shaming people for your good luck. Like that's it. Yeah. At least I hope that's it because

406
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm zero and four. If it's not chance, then I feel brave. Do you want to know my fantasy football

407
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,760
secret? And this is not a joke. I follow on Twitter everyone on my team. Okay. And sometimes

408
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,840
like Michael Turner, I'll have a good game turning 22 points for the, for the Mario Lopez dispenser.

409
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,600
I'll send a little message, say, Hey, keep it up. I'm glad that I picked you from a fantasy team.

410
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:40,000
And then maybe Danny Amendola broke his fucking neck and he got four points for me. I'll say,

411
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,600
Hey, why'd you do that? Daddy needed those points. So you're doing like some, some computer chair

412
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:51,040
coaching. I'm doing some, uh, some Tweet-O coaching. I'll fly overhead and I'll drop those

413
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
sweet messages in their ear. Danny Amendola probably didn't want that. Probably didn't need

414
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,280
that. He probably needed support from his loved ones cause he's probably never going to ball again,

415
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,200
but I needed him to be a point factory, but that sort of positive or negative encouragement is

416
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,880
exactly what those people need to put the, put the PTs up on the board. By which I mean points.

417
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,200
Uh, I, so just brag, brag away. Griffin, can I have a Yahoo, please? You sure can.

418
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,440
Um, this Yahoo was sent in by Maxwell McCandless. Thank you Maxwell. It's by Yahoo answers user

419
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,320
A who asks, my boyfriend goes number two on my bathroom floor. Should I allow this?

420
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:40,560
I'm asking, I, I could ask the same thing of this question. Can we allow ourselves to discuss this?

421
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,560
Listen, listen to the specifics though. Okay. He says he can't go on a regular toilet because he

422
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,160
has to squat due to a medical problem. Okay. Sure. But he cleaned that's here's the, here's

423
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,200
the kicker. Are you ready? But he cleans up afterward. So the only reason that this woman

424
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:03,760
knows that this is happening is because he is coming in and going, Hey hun, drop the deuce on

425
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,320
the carpet. Don't worry. Full disclosure. I do not think it's carpet. I hope to God not.

426
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:16,640
I don't think he could ghost it quite that easy. I think that would be much, much more difficult to

427
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,160
go. I really need to, I really need to make business, but I don't have a spare 45 minutes

428
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,680
for the shampooing and a whole machine upstairs for some reason that grosses me.

429
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,000
You pop back to Tyler linoleum and I can work with it, but

430
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,400
okay. So everything is coated in feces. This is not a stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

431
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,480
You gross me out again. Now I'm saying everything is, is coated in urine and feces. That's like,

432
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,960
that's our world that we live in. Okay. The only time something isn't is direct. I'm sorry, Travis.

433
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,080
The only time it isn't after someone has cleaned it. So what he is offering you is a,

434
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:03,840
is a more frequent respite from it's a clean. You're going to end up with a cleaner floor.

435
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,560
So you're saying that the only issue here is your mental block of thinking it's weird,

436
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,720
but in reality it's a good thing. Except, except you go in and it smells like

437
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,440
Lysol and the floor is a little wet. It's like he did that to you almost.

438
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,720
Listen, here's the thing in the real world, brothers got a medical condition where he can't

439
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,800
like shit on a real toilet and the doctor just goes, okay, I'm going to send you out in the

440
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:40,560
world with this condition. You'll be fine. You're just an unacceptable solution. I guess I can give

441
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,160
you, I don't know, a container or something, but I feel that that would inhibit your personal

442
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,360
growth. So just wherever you want. Listen, every time you say a pronoun, you vomit uncontrollably.

443
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:57,920
Have fun. Have fun out there. That big, flexible spirit. I'm sorry. I'm just getting the hang

444
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,920
of hypnotism. I didn't mean to do that to you. I'm sorry. I'm a hypnotist doctor.

445
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
You probably should have come to me before you gave yourself a self colonoscopy.

446
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,640
I've never seen anything quite like this male lactation. See you in a year. Next checkup.

447
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:20,560
You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Suck it up. Sip some of that sweet milk from me, brother.

448
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,280
I'll put it at my sex level. I'm just saying, is it not a possibility that this boyfriend

449
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:35,840
just like shitting on his lady's floor? He just likes doing that. Guys, I feel like I'm in the

450
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,840
radiation filled chamber and I've been in for too long and we have to run out of this question.

451
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:46,160
We have to vent. Okay. There are toilets that they use in Japan that are just holes in the floor.

452
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,760
You should get in one of those and then it won't be a problem. Just don't just shitting on your

453
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,280
floor. I'm sorry. What Travis? Like a disposable cake pan. I cannot run the risk no matter how

454
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,120
infinitesimal. I cannot run the risk of being out of cake pans. There could be an earthquake.

455
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:13,040
The house would be abandoned for 10 years. You come back a decade. Where did you get this Pyroxid?

456
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:20,960
Oh, Debbie loaned it to me. No, no, no, no, no. I think so. You're setting yourself up for an

457
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,120
episode of the twilight dead where someone serves you meatloaf and you're like, wait a minute,

458
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,400
does that have a chip in the lower left-hand corner? No. You're setting yourself up to one

459
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,320
day and probably not tomorrow and probably not the day after that, but that day's going to come

460
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,640
where you throw all your dishware away because you forgot which one it was. Because you forgot

461
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,800
to mark it. I can't do this question. The blue one was white or the white one was blue. Oh,

462
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,080
burn it all. Burn the house down. Burn the whole thing down. I started a new job after moving to

463
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,520
NYC three months ago, but the job very quickly became intolerably stressful. I got fed up and

464
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,520
looked for a better job and today I was accepted for a position that's not only better paying,

465
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,920
but in a much less oppressive environment. My current boss exploded when I gave my two weeks

466
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,080
notice. She emailed me four times and called me twice in the course of an hour, all to tell me

467
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,920
how shocked and disappointed she is. How the company is going to be in trouble because they

468
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,760
can't find a replacement in two weeks, et cetera, et cetera. How do I survive the next two weeks in

469
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,120
a hostile guilt tripping environment? I want to make sure I make it to my new job intact,

470
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:32,960
guilt to the death. Allow me to help you. Stop going. I don't go there anymore. It sounds whack.

471
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,120
It sounds like a horrible place. Yeah. I think if you give someone two weeks notice and they

472
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:45,840
make it worse for you to be there, they just got a no week's notice. Yeah, because keep in mind,

473
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,880
what kind of wreck is this person going to write you that you would want to provide to

474
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,600
any future employer? You're done there. Well, because here's the thing. Two weeks notice,

475
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,080
really, whether it's in your contract or not, is a courtesy. It's something that's there so that

476
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,440
they have time to- Sure.

477
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,000
It's not like- I mean, let's be honest. If people get laid off all across this country,

478
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,280
don't get the courtesy of a two weeks notice. But traditionally, from what I understand,

479
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,280
I've never quit a job, is that the two weeks is so that they will, that's like the understandable

480
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,720
period for them to find a replacement so that you still get a recommendation out of it.

481
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah, but in this circumstance, she's already got another job. What's the boss going to do? Call

482
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
and be like, hey, my employee gave me two weeks notice, but I don't want her to quit,

483
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,200
so you shouldn't hire her. Dip. Get out. I would seriously, I don't think you're going

484
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,520
to salvage this, and I know that you want to leave on good terms, but it sounds like these

485
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,000
people have already decided that you're leaving on bad terms. So you might as well meet them halfway

486
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,560
on this. So you're going to need to take a personal day for the next nine days.

487
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,840
Yeah, you're just treating yourself to a personal day. Maybe smoke a little doja and then go in.

488
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,800
Ooh. Ooh, hello. Maybe get a little- Go in drunk.

489
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,760
Maybe get to smoke a little peaches and herb and then go in.

490
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
Yeah, I like that. It's like office space,

491
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,400
but instead of getting hypnotized, you get a little dip.

492
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,760
You're ganja-tized.

493
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,920
Okay. Well, I'll work on it. I'll workshop it. I'll come back.

494
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,040
Hip-pot-tized?

495
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,200
Is that any good? Maybe spend an hour with Man for Man's Earth band,

496
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,080
and then you roll in. You say, hey, what's up with the work?

497
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,320
Hey.

498
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,200
Where's the paper at? Let me sign it.

499
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,320
Let me file those reports for you.

500
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,680
Hey, these keys are crazy, man.

501
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,280
We've never smoked a marijuana before, so we're just guessing what it could be.

502
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,000
That's what it's like. Like you're trapped in a glass box.

503
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,720
It makes you talk like a very meek jazz musician.

504
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,440
And he's afraid of waking the baby.

505
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,240
Shh. Hey, no, no, no.

506
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,360
Shhh. Shuffler is sleeping.

507
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,800
Look at that computer screen.

508
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,280
Ooh. I'm gonna type in an email.

509
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,720
I think that'd be such a power play to just start being the guy in your office

510
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
who always talk like that.

511
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,240
Just low-talk Greg, and everyone's like, what? Excuse me? What did you say?

512
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,120
They would eventually, even if you had put in your two weeks notice,

513
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,480
they would ask you to stop coming.

514
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,240
I can't hear you over the laser printer. What the fuck did you say?

515
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,880
I can't believe I just sent that email without a subject. Can you believe that?

516
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,720
I wish they put a little guy in there. You could just call it back.

517
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,680
Come on back, email.

518
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,080
I like this guy. I like this guy.

519
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,800
I like this guy, too. Can I talk like this for the rest of my life?

520
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,200
Ah, shit. The printer's broken.

521
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,840
Oh, what's wrong?

522
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,960
Let me take a look at it. Yeah, that's broken.

523
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,800
Oh, you got a jam. Just got a little jam.

524
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,880
We got a little toner bone going on here. I'm gonna fix this right up.

525
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,480
Ooh, got a little on my shirt.

526
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
I'll tell you what, why don't you just get that screen

527
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,360
and just read it out loud to the whole office.

528
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:05,200
I'll get everybody to shut down. Hey, everybody, Philip's gonna read this

529
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,040
real important email about not eating people's lunch out of the fridge.

530
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,240
Go ahead, Philip. As we say in the jazz world, the stage is yours.

531
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,800
Come on. Go on, don't hold back.

532
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,880
Does anybody want some of this? I like your rhythm. That's a good cadence, Philip.

533
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,160
Anybody want some of this, Jay?

534
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
Why y'all grimacing at me?

535
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,160
I do want to apologize for bringing my infant son into the office again.

536
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,280
The babysitter canceled, so poor little Grimace had to come along with me.

537
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,440
Plum tuckered out. I did name him after McDonald's.

538
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,600
Hey, anybody want up on this spliff tanning?

539
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,240
Now, what's that? You'd prefer I not return tomorrow? Well, that is, of course, your choice.

540
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:57,360
I will hate to not live up to my contribution, but I understand sometimes it just don't work out.

541
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,200
It ain't the way of the world.

542
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,320
And now let me sing you this song I wrote about a situation just like this.

543
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,960
I know, it's a little song just like this about a little old caterpillar just wants to

544
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,640
fill up his stores with grain, so he plays his fiddle all winter,

545
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,640
and then the chicken comes along and tries to eat his grain. I'll just be gone. You're right.

546
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,720
It's best I go now.

547
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,160
Do you have a box I can put all my accoutrement in?

548
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,400
Oh, actually, I just have this pen, so I'm just going to take- whoa, you're being a little rough,

549
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,720
sir. There's no need for that. I'll find my way to the elevator. No problem.

550
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,800
At all. I did want to hear the end of Philip's email. Go ahead, Philip.

551
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,360
Philip, you don't have to just sit there staring.

552
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,320
Why y'all crying?

553
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,320
Why's everybody crying?

554
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,800
Philip, maybe you could forward that to me. I do not own a computer. I will read it at the library.

555
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,440
And I, again, I do want to apologize to everybody for me not wearing pants or underwear

556
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,280
into the office today.

557
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,480
I know, I know.

558
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,800
Way from me not wearing pants or underwear into the office today.

559
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,520
I don't even believe I work here now that I look back on it.

560
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,640
Come to think of it, this is Denny's, so I am sorry about this.

561
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,120
This thing I've been typing on, it's been a placemat.

562
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:17,200
I do understand why my employment is being terminated.

563
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,040
That is not a picture of my wife and kids. That is eggs.

564
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,800
And now let me scat for y'all. It's not what you think.

565
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,960
You guys want us to scat? It's not what you think.

566
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,800
So this has been my brother, my brother, and me.

567
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,680
Too much? Okay, I'll bring it down.

568
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,400
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

569
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:49,760
It's a comedy advice show, just a couple of three bros, laughing, learning, loving, living, leaping.

570
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,120
Quantum leaping.

571
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,720
Quantum leaping.

572
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,520
I'm just a little old jazz musician who had to go back and say,

573
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,280
right, well, once we were wrong.

574
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,560
It's like three quantum leaps, three old jazz musicians.

575
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,400
We will be back with you next Monday.

576
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,000
Hopefully that will be the leap home.

577
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,840
Unless, of course, we solve the problems of these three brothers' lives.

578
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,520
What happened when we jumped, Ziggy?

579
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,640
We'll consult with Ziggy to see what the problem is.

580
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,600
I thought we did pretty good with all the jokes this week.

581
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,760
Maybe, God, maybe we worked a little blue at some point,

582
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,680
but we haven't been told this was an adult audience.

583
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,120
See, no, we have committed this far.

584
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,920
We're going to drive this baby home.

585
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,840
Hey, do you mind if I take a second to show?

586
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,480
Go ahead, girl.

587
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,200
Let me go and show my little bit of appreciation to Mrs.

588
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,720
Go ahead, little brother.

589
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,080
Go ahead, go ahead.

590
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,360
Jonathan Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

591
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,720
It's an awesome place, baby.

592
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,640
Listen to that.

593
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,400
So we're going to listen.

594
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,840
Girl, you're fading out.

595
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,200
I put it on.

596
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,200
Set this record down on the radio.

597
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,160
We're going to listen to it all the way up to the kids.

598
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,920
I'd like to, you know, little brother, I don't mean to step on your toes,

599
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,320
but I do want to thank the people using Twitter to get their message on out there

600
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,280
about our little comedy show here.

601
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:34,080
Ejohns88, Vintage Spiffy, you know him, Iggy K, King Mento, Nobody Gaming,

602
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:39,600
Fox Shet, Bradley McStam, everybody, thank you so much for getting that,

603
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,800
getting that whole word out.

604
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,920
Yeah, I want you to know.

605
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,720
Hey, how about maybe just one more question?

606
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,720
Take us all on into infinity.

607
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,840
Hey, Travis, do want to thank you again for joining us this week.

608
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,320
Talking about your sweet sticky hands.

609
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,360
It's all right, y'all, I know.

610
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,240
I know what you do.

611
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:56,880
It's fine.

612
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,080
But now that I was good at it.

613
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,400
He just sounds racist.

614
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,760
That's why I'm so quiet.

615
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,040
I knew I shouldn't commit to the bit, so I just got quiet.

616
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,040
The two things that Travis has going for him are hands that smell like

617
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,760
hunted hams and a real honest self-assessment of his talent is really.

618
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,960
I know that voice abilities are not my strong suit.

619
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,560
You're just here.

620
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,360
This year, finally, Yahoo!

621
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,960
Answer was sent in by Emily Wall.

622
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,760
Thank you, Emily.

623
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,120
It's by Yahoo!

624
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,520
Answers user Jolteon01, who asks?

625
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,040
Hey, what's the difference between Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Haley Joel Osmond?

626
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:45,040
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

627
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,560
Why don't you grab your old daddy?

628
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,840
He's just playing sweet.

629
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,040
Right on his livers.

630
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,360
We're here in teams.

631
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,440
Keep your heart three stacks.

632
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,480
Keep your heart.

633
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,640
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

634
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,680
Keep your heart.

635
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,960
Man, these girls are smart.

636
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:07,600
Three stacks.

637
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,360
These girls are smart.

638
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:39,120
Play your part.
