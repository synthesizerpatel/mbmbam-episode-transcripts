1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,480
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:47,520
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome my brother, my brother and me. We have an exciting

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:53,360
opening plan for you. For the first time in history, we're going to be attempting our first

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,320
interactive choose your own opening. We have three different selections on tap for you today.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,920
One is, this is our hundredth Max Fun show. Second is X Games.

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,320
That one's mine and it's going to be the best.

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:19,760
Third is Arnani's birthday is today. So we have three options. If you look underneath your chair

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:29,520
or car, look underneath your jogging pants. Don't get in there. Don't get in there in your butt.

12
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,240
You should find a three tiered sort of button knob dial that you can turn to whichever choice

13
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,600
you like. So go ahead and do that now and we'll see how those please be careful. You can also

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,640
text. I like number two and number every five five. If you text that to everyone, you know,

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,560
then that will I'm sure we're in your phone somewhere. Uh huh. And if not, it'll phone

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,240
tree back to us. Happy happy. So I'm looking at the results coming in here. Happy birthday,

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,040
Nani. Happy Max Fun birthday. But it looks like the winner is X Games. All right. So here we go.

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,480
Well, okay. Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, the X Games of comedy. I'm your host,

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,960
Super Spike, Justin McElroy. And I'm your Middle East host, Sean White. I am your baby host. I'm

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Tony Hawk is the only one I know, guys. I'm sorry. It's the only one I know. It's the only one.

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,160
Get out of here, old man. Get out of here, old man. Me and Sean White are trying to carve up

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,000
some snow. Do you guys have any comedy stunts planned for your X Games episode? I was going

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,920
to a snowboard off of Bob Newhart's face. I was trying to I was going to try to do a 900 rotation

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,560
off of a half pipe. But what that is, is that it rotates towards did what is what he just said

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
racist. And then now I don't think it's racist. I think it is. And then I think it is. And then I

26
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,200
think it is. And I think it is. And then I land it. It's a slalom. No, it's a slalom. It's a I'm

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
turning in the air, vacillating between if what I just said was racist or not. So go ahead and do

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:22,480
that. Okay. Hey, gringos. That one I feel like you I feel like you botched that pretty much. No,

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,720
wait. Let me try it. No, I didn't do it right. Let me try it. Hey, gringos. I'm going to Harvard.

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:39,120
Oh, wow. You see what that just did there? I just turned it. I turned the perception in back on

31
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,480
itself. I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna try to say the word pussy, but I'm gonna make it last

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,680
for a whole minute. Don't stop. Don't give up. I'll tell you what you can give up. Can you like

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:06,480
keep going over me? We're gonna start right now. I keep doing the show over me. Oh, I thought you

34
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:14,320
wanted to like barbershop quartet. Why would I ever want that? How am I supposed to succeed if

35
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,840
my fucking crew team is acting up? I can't I'm not rowing the comedy boat. I'm trying to do fucking

36
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,200
long form endurance comedy sports and you guys are trying to do short term shit on top of it.

37
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,000
And I'm sticking. I'm trying to train for years. I'm trying to break the record for longest on

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,360
screen kiss here. Oh, my record just got stolen by the batch guys. And now I got to take it back.

39
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,640
Can we I know you know what we're gonna talk about the bachelor because I have no other way to do

40
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,760
this. In the latest episode, one of the dates was they went to the Guinness Book of World Records,

41
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,600
which first off cool day. And second off, they made them break the record for longest on screen

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,280
kiss, which was like three minutes and 15 seconds. Really? I had to watch the and they didn't cut

43
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
away. They did like window and window. So like you could watch it happen the whole time. I watched

44
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,280
two motherfuck ABC made me watch two motherfuckers put their mouths together for three minutes and

45
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,720
16 seconds. And it was the least erotic thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Yeah. Wait,

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,560
what held the record before that? I don't know. But it's torture born hostile for I don't know

47
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,480
what it was because it was fucking when you think about like all the all the spit in their mouths

48
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,720
when they started like one and a half minutes in like surely we're almost done because my mouth

49
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,440
has become a vault of spit. And then they look actually halfway through. It's a medical fact

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,680
that after you kiss someone for 316 seconds, or three minutes and 16 seconds, you become a match

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,640
for organ donors. Oh, God. It was true. It was rough stuff. It looks like the previous record

52
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:04,960
holder was from a movie called Elena Undone, in which two women kiss for three minutes and and

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,560
15 seconds. Yeah. Let me just update my Netflix queue. So as you've certainly guessed right now,

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,600
this is an advice show where we comedy and you can give us questions or and give us a questions at

55
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,520
mbnbam at maximum fun.org. We also take questions from the Yahoo News answer service. And we take

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,440
those and we make fun of those too. So you never know, kind of grab bag here on the show. So let's

57
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,200
grab a bag. Let's grab a bag and thump this melon. I have a little social media problem.

58
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,320
All of my profile pictures are either years old or non existent. And I don't have any recent

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,040
pictures of myself that I really like. I was planning on having someone take a good professional

60
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,520
looking picture of myself and using that on my profile pic of everything. But now I think that

61
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,800
might be a lazy solution. Someone who looks me up on each site would just see the same picture over

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
and over again. Should I take the effort to make more pictures of various settings or focus my

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,720
energy into one really good picture? And that's from out of focus on Facebook. And that's and

64
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,120
that's from a non-existing question in 10 years. Yeah, that that is a really good question. I

65
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,160
think. Is it? It is. It's the best question. It's the best question. Travis, you don't understand

66
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,960
because you you are in the theater. You have you have a built in apparatus for having pictures of

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,840
your face on hand up to date 24 sev. Justin, I don't Justin, I don't have that. People don't take

68
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,400
people just don't take pictures of me and Justin. They really don't. They can't find me. Sorry,

69
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,520
paparazzo. But but here's the thing, though. It seems to me like it would be beneficial because

70
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,720
you're building a brand. And if you have the same picture on everything, but it's identifiable.

71
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,160
It's like those people that like signed up in like 1997 for like a really super weird email

72
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,440
address and are still using it. I went easy just to have their own name. And then when someone's

73
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,600
like, I want your email and you're like, it's Chewbacca fan 72. Thank you for considering it.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,000
You for considering people like, oh, man, that's a fucking great email. How'd you land Chewbacca

75
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,560
fan 72? I think it's so unfair to have this conversation with a person in the family, right?

76
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,800
Because you have people have an infinite supply. Why does it sound like you're vomiting when you

77
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,520
say pictures of them and like dope costumes and armor and sword fighting and fire and beautiful

78
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,400
ladies and explosions and shit. It's not me. If you took a picture of me at my job, you know,

79
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,440
it looks like it looks like if I had a toilet or me, I'd be pooping all day. Like hold on. Hold on.

80
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,640
Let me ask you a question real quick. Do you think I work for Cirque du Soleil? Yeah, I think you're

81
00:08:52,640 --> 00:09:01,520
one of those those bendy orgy loving frogs. That's what I think. But see, in the theater,

82
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,560
we do have these things called headshots. And it basically is the idea of one picture

83
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,120
that you use for everything. But that but we are constant like Griffin and I, we are in a job where

84
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,640
if you try to like you do have to kind of treat yourself like an entity, like a brand that you

85
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,160
are selling. But also the moment you are actually doing that, you're the pits. You're the worst.

86
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,320
Yeah. Right. So you gotta pretend you're stumbling into a great picture. You need to get and promote

87
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,720
headshots, but with a level of discretion that is not required in theater. In fact, it's kind of

88
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,920
frowned upon, I would say. Right. So I think that there's a market for this for us to capitalize.

89
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:52,000
Whatever happened to like, whatever happened to the industry of like Ma and Pa photo companies,

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,720
where you like go and you get their homecoming pictures? Does that still happen? Yeah, what's

91
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:04,400
going on here? I guess. Really? Johnson's is still going strong. It's a simpler time. Let me suggest

92
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,600
this. Next time you're hanging out with a bunch of friends, say, hold on, guys, I've got one other

93
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,240
great friend I want to invite. His name is a popular photographer, Ricky Phillips. And then

94
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,040
Ricky Phillips shows up and he's like, discreetly taking headshots of you with friends. So it looks

95
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,080
like you were just hanging out cash. But really, he brings lighting. He snaps a great, great picture.

96
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,440
He is gonna need to thread a needle in order for this to be as discreet as we need it to be.

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,080
It's gonna, he's gonna have to roll up and be like, yo, what up, Michael? Hey, buddy. Haven't

98
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:49,760
seen you since the funeral. Let's set up these lighting cones. So my photosynthesis will kick

99
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:59,440
off because that's how I eat. I have a disease. Photosynthesis. I got a camera. Justin, Justin

100
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,800
got me a camera for Jesus' birthday. And like, I bring it around to stuff now in Austin. Like

101
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,800
anytime we have events, I'll bring it around and snap some great JPEGs of people's faces.

102
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
But I can't like hand it off to somebody and be like, hey, can you hold this? And man, if you

103
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,360
wanted to snap a JPEG of the G-Man, I would not hate it. You know, I would not hate you for it.

104
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Just make sure, you know- It seems to me like this is like quantum physics. Like as soon as

105
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,280
it becomes observed, it's pointless. Well, right. You just gotta leave the camera on the ground

106
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,200
and like just walk away from it. And then just walk away. My wife has seen me in the worst,

107
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,560
like most compromising positions of my life. But if we are at a public event and I'm taking

108
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,320
pictures of like her and people in the event, there is no shame greater than looking her in

109
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,480
the eyes and saying, hey, can you take the camera for a while so I can be in some of the pictures?

110
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,080
Like people know that I was here too. I'm 32 goddamn years old. That can't be that way. That's

111
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,040
why there's no videos. If you were a dad born before 1980, there's no video of you. You probably

112
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
don't exist. Right. You're just a voice in the background saying, no, don't eat that.

113
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't. And then what sucks the most is when you take all these great JPEGs of people's

114
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,280
beautiful faces. And we're talking like three megabyte files. We're talking big. We're talking

115
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,400
potential billboards. And then they pull out through like Nokia 9700. And they're like,

116
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,880
let me snap you now. And it's like, oh, fucking great. Cause I've always wanted a picture of me.

117
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,720
That was exactly three pixels. Just a two tan pixels on top of a brown. That looks like something

118
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,960
you'd make on Mario paint. That's fantastic. Thank you. You're worrying about your aperture

119
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,280
and your shutter speed. Do you even know about the rule of thirds? And they're just like,

120
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,840
oh, I forgot to turn on the flash. Yeah. It's like, oh, hold on. I've got a snake game. I

121
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:03,120
need to finish up. Have you been snapping a lot of JPEGs? Are you putting those on Facebook?

122
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,800
I'm putting them on the book. Yeah. And people love them. And like there there's a thrill that

123
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,560
goes along with like uploading a bunch of JPEGs and then just like bouncing for the day. Maybe

124
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,640
you don't use the internet. Maybe you get some farming done and then you come back and there's

125
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,520
like 40 notifications of people. Like I fucking love the way I look in this picture. It's like,

126
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,920
yeah, it's because you look great. And this photo is great. Now where's, oh, where let me go. Let

127
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:34,560
me lose. Let me get me on the book. Get me into my zone. My Facebook profile picture is like me

128
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,120
in like a senior in high school, like a shitty beard. And I probably still have braces.

129
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,960
I don't know. I don't know. Like it's not, I don't know how to use my picture at all.

130
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm looking at your picture. Well, let me ask you that. I think we've talked before about like,

131
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,320
what makes a good Facebook picture? What makes a good Twitter profile picture?

132
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,480
I think it's good if you have like a little,

133
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,680
like half of a word balloon in the picture. So it looks like you're saying the thing that

134
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,920
you're tweeting. That's like that. It's got to be, it's got to represent who you are. Like

135
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,880
it's got, for me, it's gotta be, it's gotta be funny. Like maybe I'm wearing like a loud shirt

136
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,680
and I'm sort of shrugging like, I don't know. I like it when it looks like when it's in a small

137
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,000
version, like it's new to me, but then you click on it and it's just like a really close up of

138
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,640
your nose or something. Oh, that's how they get you. That's how YouTube, that's how YouTube gets

139
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,840
you. That's how you got to expand your YouTube profile is like a split second clip of like

140
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,000
something that looks like a butt, but then they click it and they watch it and it's your elbows

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and you, they got you. They got your view. That's how, that's how you get them on Facebook. That's

142
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
how you expand your profile. That's how Brento Flores got all his views. He just puts lots of

143
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,240
pictures of his elbows up there. You put your elbows on there and maybe your elbows have nipples.

144
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,120
Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. Maybe you've glued nipples onto your elbows. Now that may not

145
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,560
work so well on Facebook when like Yunani is scrolling around and then she sees your name

146
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,520
next to a profile picture that looks like boobs or a butt. And then she's like, I don't, why is

147
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:16,000
this, she'll click it though. It's human nature. It's biology. It's physiology. You got to know

148
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,520
what's up with that butt. I will take pictures of anyone for, if you need, if you need your face

149
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,800
on, if you need a new face picture, then I will get that for you. If you want to tasteful. I tried

150
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,600
it at holidays when Griffin first got his camera. I got some great JPEGs of you. They're not super

151
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,400
in focus though. And that's really important. You dick. I don't want to be a monster. I don't want

152
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,520
to be that guy. There's a really great picture of you where you look like Jamie Lee Curtis from

153
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,720
that scene in true lies. That was a good picture. I don't know how you did that with lighting and

154
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,960
smoke and stuff, but it looked great. Hey, do you have a Yahoo question answer? This Yahoo answer

155
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,440
was sent in by Layla. Oh, thank you, Layla. It's by Yahoo answers user Farrah who asks,

156
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,080
should I be worried if my girlfriend posted a twerking video on Facebook?

157
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Okay. My girlfriend and her best friend, they both posted a twerking video on Facebook and

158
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,360
agreed to delete it after one hour. She used to be the girl who cheated and never settled down.

159
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,320
Now since she's with me, she changed and settled down, but yet it's only been around three months

160
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:32,240
together. She can go back anytime. Wow. Should I tell her not to do it or should I just let her?

161
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,200
Wow. That was a fucking rough one, guys. I am going to very quickly-

162
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,840
Don't Google twerking. No, don't. You'll betray the company.

163
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,360
I'll just tell you what it is. Travis? What is it?

164
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:58,800
Okay. You know when she pops the booty and then she does a booty shake and in your head,

165
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,360
all you hear is booty, booty, booty, booty, booty, booty like in the hit song?

166
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,160
Uh-huh. That is twerking and it shakes really

167
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:15,920
faster. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how to do that. I don't know how anybody does that,

168
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,920
but that's what twerking is. Are you sure?

169
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,600
Yeah. It's that fast butt shake where you're squatting down on the ground and you're twerking

170
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:34,720
it. I've not heard a more incongruous word to dance action, I think, in my life. When you hear

171
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
crumping, you think, well, that just sounds like somebody violently flailing. I'm like,

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,920
yep, that's pretty much it. Nailed it.

173
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,640
Twerking it, it sounds like a... I don't know. It sounds like a fun... It sounds like it could be

174
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:53,200
like a kid's thing, like the jerk, but for kids. I put a twerking gif in the Skype chat,

175
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,960
if you guys want to just check that out. It sounds like a tiny adjustment you make

176
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,360
to some kind of bubble gum machine. Why would you put this in front of me?

177
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,640
You guys have a visual reference to what twerking is.

178
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,480
I thought you wanted it. Oh, goodness. Oh, goodness.

179
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,440
I don't know how this woman is doing this. It's mesmerizing.

180
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah. I don't know how she's managing to- It's got to be wires, maybe pneumatics.

181
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,120
Yeah. This is like seeing the Matrix for the first time, but each butt shake is twerking

182
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,040
independently of the other. It's amazing. This gif was actually made by the Wachowski brothers.

183
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,080
They look like they're having a really terrible argument with each other.

184
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,800
No, I like Bush. No, I like Kerry. We are on opposite sides of the political spectrum,

185
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,160
and also a butt crack. I have to close it.

186
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,840
Oh, I barely pulled myself away from it. I know. Let's... Oh, my God.

187
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,920
The podcast is canceled. It hypnotized me, and now I'm going to kill

188
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,640
the president. It Manchurian-candidated me. This twerking butt Manchurian-candidated me,

189
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,520
and I did not sign up for this when I Google image search twerking.

190
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,640
But call it rump bumping. Call it-

191
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,000
Rump bumping?

192
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,440
Call it that jiggling or something, like the jiggle jig or something like that,

193
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,720
like something that is more representative.

194
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,720
I mean, you're talking about hip hop dance lingo that has a word for when you

195
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,240
finish on girl's back and then stick a sheet to it.

196
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:38,800
No, that's... No, one 14-year-old rapper saying that word in one of his songs does not make it

197
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,600
a cultural thing. Touchstone?

198
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
No. I guess it's not actually technically a dance move either.

199
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,960
No, God, I hope not. It would require... That would require some

200
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,800
pretty crazy muscle control in order to do that rhythmically.

201
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,560
Yeah, or just really amazing timing. I've got to get to the club now.

202
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh, man. I was going to say that funny thing you said, but then you said it, so I was like,

203
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
well, this one goes to Trav. Thank you.

204
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Game, set, match. Game, set, match.

205
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,120
Hey, man, where's Tony? Oh, his boss made him twerk late.

206
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,920
Everybody's twerking for the win.

207
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,320
You know what my favorite Fred Savage sitcom was twerking?

208
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,960
That one was a little on the nose.

209
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,680
What? Let me try again.

210
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,440
Okay. I'm trying again.

211
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,840
You don't have to be crazy to twerk here, but it helps.

212
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,760
Okay, that's not bad.

213
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,440
What's up with this guy, though, whose girlfriend posted a twerking video on Facebook?

214
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,360
It's hard for us to throw any shade at this person because we just talked about that.

215
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,800
We just talked about how you had to expand your social media profile,

216
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,280
any which way, any which way, but loose.

217
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,360
And there's nothing loose about twerking it.

218
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
Now you got to keep it tight.

219
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
And it's so hard too because you, and I can sympathize with this,

220
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,120
you spend so much time honing this skill of twerking and you want to share it.

221
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,880
You don't want to keep your light under a bushel.

222
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
You want to show everybody how you do.

223
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
You want to show them how you twerk.

224
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,680
And I don't think it's right as a boyfriend to sort of limit your art that way.

225
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,200
Yeah, that's true. That's a good point.

226
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,680
Especially when she's only putting it up for an hour.

227
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,720
Just an hour.

228
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Now that-

229
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:46,080
In the great span of the universe, she's only going to be visibly twerking for a blink of an eye.

230
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,520
That is an excellent point, Travis.

231
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:53,440
I do, however, why is she putting it up for an hour?

232
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
This is what I, for a limited engagement in select theaters.

233
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
Select theaters.

234
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
You know, I really-

235
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,640
Sunday's Sunday for one hour only.

236
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,200
I really wanted to watch Farrah's girlfriend twerking on Facebook,

237
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,160
but it didn't come to my city, which is a real shame.

238
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,520
I hear it's got a real, it's getting, picking up a lot of Oscar buzz.

239
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,640
I got the, I got the time zones maxed up.

240
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
I thought it was at four Eastern, but it was at four standard and I missed it.

241
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,280
Four standard.

242
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,000
Now is that a different time zone than Eastern in standard time?

243
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,440
Central, I meant to say central.

244
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,720
Fuck. Damn it.

245
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,280
Podcast is canceled.

246
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,000
Nice job, podcast.

247
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,680
Now, Justin, you've been quiet for a while.

248
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,600
I'm going to guess you've been Googling either the word twerking

249
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,680
or maybe things with work in the titles that you can say twerk inside of.

250
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,200
No, no.

251
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,920
No?

252
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,640
No.

253
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,320
What were you going to say, Justin?

254
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,040
I just want to say twerking not to fuck, that's no way to make a living, right?

255
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,520
Okay.

256
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,920
This girl should look into Snapchat.

257
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,400
What's that?

258
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,760
That's a new thing that teens are doing.

259
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,480
I don't-

260
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,280
Where it's a self-destructing photo or short clip.

261
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,560
It's chat that you do with your friends, but the picture doesn't remain.

262
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,240
Oh, thank God.

263
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,720
A lot of people are saying, a lot of folks are saying, hey, this is May for sexting.

264
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,040
Yeah.

265
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,800
There is literally no other purpose for this.

266
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,440
They are saying that only because that is exactly right and it's the only thing it's

267
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,400
designed for.

268
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,280
Yeah, it's a good thing.

269
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,960
Is it made out of special vampire glass that you also can't take a picture of the temporary

270
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,840
picture?

271
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,600
Fucking get it together, people.

272
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,640
I figured it out in 35 seconds and teens, this is all they think about.

273
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,960
All the teens think about is way to see dicks and boobs and butts and vaginas.

274
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,640
They will figure it out in four seconds.

275
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,720
Is it possible that Snapchat was created for pirate maps?

276
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,480
Wait a minute.

277
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,960
You don't want everyone to be able to find your hidden gold.

278
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,480
You want it to self-destruct.

279
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,680
You just want your friend Brenda to be able to find-

280
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,280
Brenda the pirate.

281
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,080
Your booty.

282
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,560
This could be-

283
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,640
I mean, either way, you're helping somebody find your booty.

284
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,760
I mean, no matter what you're using Snapchat for, it's booty-centric.

285
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,000
National Treasure 3, Legend of Curly's Gold wherein Curly is the nickname for Benjamin

286
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,080
Franklin and then Nick Cage-

287
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Because he had a hooked wiener.

288
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,280
Right, like a pigtail and then Nick Cage-

289
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,720
Keep turning, I'm not in.

290
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,480
Nicholas Cage-

291
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Sit and spin, please, or it's very painful.

292
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:55,040
Nick Cage pours lemon juice and heats up an old parchment of Ben Franklin's and very quickly

293
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,960
an animated GIF of Ben Franklin twerking it appears and then disappears.

294
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Inside of that twerking, it was Morse code.

295
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,240
What does it say?

296
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,280
The Constitution.

297
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,120
The end.

298
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,440
Then we learned that our greatest gift is freedom.

299
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,280
The freedom to twerk it as we choose, as we like.

300
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,720
Nick Cage-

301
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,640
When Ben Franklin opens a bottle of wine, that's pretty much the end of the party.

302
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,640
You know once he gets to that point and he's corkscrewing it, then it's time for everybody

303
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,200
to go home.

304
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,120
Oh, you're talking about with his dick still.

305
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,920
With his dick.

306
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,640
I already forgot the fiction we established.

307
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,400
Well, let's rebuild the fiction.

308
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,280
Okay, sorry.

309
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,760
That's it.

310
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,160
The thing about wine.

311
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,400
Okay.

312
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,680
Yeah, I said, I thought earlier, but I didn't want to step on your toes there when you were

313
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,320
saying something not as funny as opening a wine bottle with his dick.

314
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,560
I see.

315
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,680
So it's a new kind of competitive collaboration.

316
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,960
It's like American Gladiators now.

317
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,400
We're working together, but we're working against the American Gladiators of-

318
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
Our listeners.

319
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
We're actively working against our listeners.

320
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,960
We're trying to destroy them from the inside out.

321
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,680
Let's do another question.

322
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,920
Much like Ben Franklin having sex with a woman.

323
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,120
Okay.

324
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,240
Okay.

325
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
All right now.

326
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,480
That would be rough though.

327
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,560
It would be pretty brutal.

328
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,680
But God, think about how smart he'd be after.

329
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,640
Why?

330
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,440
He would like be having sex with you and then he'd whisper in your ear like, quad vocals.

331
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
And you'd be like, oh my God, DaVinci coded.

332
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,520
He would drop a, what are those things called?

333
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
They're like good advice.

334
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,240
What are they called?

335
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,600
It's got like a whole book of them.

336
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,280
Twerk?

337
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
Poor Richards.

338
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,360
The poor Richards Almanac.

339
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,960
He would like lean in and be like, it's super good to get

340
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
boned by a corkscrew penis.

341
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,120
And then you'd be like, I didn't even think about it that way, but that's-

342
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,240
So poor Richards would help them forget about his poor dick.

343
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:00,480
Right.

344
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,360
That's what you're saying.

345
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,960
He's awesome dick.

346
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,160
No, cause like poor-

347
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,000
Next question.

348
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,840
I like to stay current and I spend a lot of free time getting up on the latest in politics,

349
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,040
movies, music, viral videos, et cetera.

350
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,000
So when a friend of mine sends me a music video or a clip of some dumb shit Bill O'Reilly said,

351
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,160
chances are I've already heard about it.

352
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,720
How can I tell them that without sounding like a pretentious douche?

353
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,240
Impossible.

354
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,040
Impossible.

355
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,360
That's from 2hip in Texas.

356
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,680
Yes. The answer is you cannot.

357
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Nope.

358
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,360
Nope.

359
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
Here's the skill you need to learn.

360
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,640
Pretending.

361
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,280
Let me give you it.

362
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,720
Let me give you it one step deeper.

363
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
Cause everybody, if you exist on the internet and the very fact that you're

364
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,640
listening to this podcast suggests that you do.

365
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:52,000
Everybody knows everything about the pop culture.

366
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,440
Like everybody already knows everything and that person who's even telling you that shit,

367
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,760
they even know that you know about it already.

368
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,080
It's like an established social courtesy.

369
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,120
It's like a handshake.

370
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
It's like, I'm going to tell you this thing you already know and I'm going to see whether,

371
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,560
how good you do at pretending that you don't know about it.

372
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,400
Or here's, here's the solution.

373
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,880
What's that?

374
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
It's the agreement.

375
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,800
When they're like, check out this awesome video.

376
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,160
You go, I know, right?

377
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,960
It's awesome.

378
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,040
Like you don't have to go.

379
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,320
Oh, I've seen it.

380
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm really happy for internet because I feel like if I didn't have internet,

381
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,400
I would be hurdling towards just sort of like old age obscurity, like not knowing what's going on.

382
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:35,200
But I feel like I have this tool now where I'm just like, in like no time in history before,

383
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm just like clinging to the side of the youth comment.

384
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,520
Like I, you cannot shake me.

385
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:39,920
You are.

386
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,520
I will continue to know what's going on.

387
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:41,840
You are.

388
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,120
I will not become relevant.

389
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,880
You are a koala bear clinging to the eucalyptus tree of youth.

390
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,400
Yes.

391
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,960
You cannot get the eucalyptus tree.

392
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,600
That's me.

393
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,480
I'm just clinging to the side with my stubby little claws.

394
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,040
Let me give you one word that will fix your whole problem, 2hip.

395
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,080
Here's the one rude response.

396
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,480
You ready?

397
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,240
Classic.

398
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,240
This means two things.

399
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:15,120
One, this video you show me is new and it will go down in my classic archive of classic comedy bits.

400
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,000
To you, it means classic.

401
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,040
One I've seen many times, but I'm happy you're reminded of.

402
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,760
You have just been honest and lied with one word.

403
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
Classic.

404
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,720
May I just counter-argument?

405
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,680
That is actually the douchiest thing you could possibly say.

406
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Classic.

407
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,560
Oh, classic bit.

408
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,200
Oh, classic.

409
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
That is classic internet right there.

410
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,680
Gangnam style?

411
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,040
That is quintessential.

412
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,360
Gotta have Gangnam style.

413
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,720
Okay, first off, 2013, can we stop with douche?

414
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,480
Can we let it go?

415
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,000
You know, in the film Premium Rush, Detective Monday,

416
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,680
when he's chasing Wiley, the Joseph Gordon-Levitt character on the bike.

417
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,400
I am gonna die.

418
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,120
He says, I can't believe you can just say douche on TV anymore.

419
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
I think that's really offensive.

420
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,400
Kids could be listening.

421
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
I was watching the movie and of course rooting against his character

422
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,520
because he's trying to get the envelope from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

423
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,400
I'm gonna be dead.

424
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,680
But I was thinking that's true.

425
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,720
We should let douche go.

426
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,560
I think we're done with douche right now.

427
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,680
I think douche has gone around and eaten its own tail and now-

428
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,800
Oh, gross!

429
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,120
Fuck!

430
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,880
Can we instead, can we substitute for douche, can we just say Premium Rush instead?

431
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,640
Yeah, oh god.

432
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,040
This guy's a real fucking Premium Rush,

433
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,200
pretending that he hasn't seen Gangnam style.

434
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,920
Okay, but there is a point though, as you pointed out with Gangnam style,

435
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,560
where it's like when your friend goes, oh my god, have you seen this video?

436
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,400
It's of a baby panda sneezing.

437
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,520
Where you can go, yes, of course I've seen it.

438
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,680
That was the first video on the internet, you fucking Premium Rush.

439
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,520
What does that do though?

440
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,120
This is what I'm saying to you.

441
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,000
Telling the truth in that situation gets you nothing.

442
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,760
No, I disagree because here's what you're doing.

443
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,360
You're saving that same friend from going around to all of his other friends

444
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
and being like, check out this awesome video I found.

445
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
So this music video is called Gangnam style.

446
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,640
This is exactly my point.

447
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,080
People always try to say this when they're talking about correcting people.

448
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,680
Like, well, if I correct them, then they won't do it.

449
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,560
Not true, not true because they are going to resent you

450
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,400
for being the one that corrects them.

451
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,000
If you don't correct them, they'll resent the next person.

452
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You get to maintain your relationship.

453
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,040
You can create a safe space for them to be wrong in, is what I'm saying.

454
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,480
If one of my friends came in and was like, hey, have you seen this movie, The Godfather?

455
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,440
I just checked it out.

456
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,240
It's pretty good.

457
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,520
I think you should watch it.

458
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,440
It's a little indie film from, I believe, the 60s.

459
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,640
Then I want to be able to tell that.

460
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,040
It's also possible your friend's been in a coma for 30 years.

461
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,840
I want to be able to tell that friend like, hey, bud.

462
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,360
Hey, Awakenings.

463
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,400
Hey, bud.

464
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,680
You know you're my bud, right?

465
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,520
But that's what you just said was so whack.

466
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,120
And if you say that in front of people that don't love you like I love you,

467
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,080
then you're going to get in a spot of trouble.

468
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,000
Have you guys seen this Premium Rush movie?

469
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,680
Hey, friendo.

470
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,560
Friendo, you need to lock that up, okay?

471
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,040
I love you like a brother.

472
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,240
There are people out there who don't.

473
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,760
They're rooting against you.

474
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,200
Everyone wants you to fail.

475
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,520
I'm in your corner, Awakenings.

476
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:44,240
Awakenings, I want to teach you about culture as it is today.

477
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,880
That's the hardest part.

478
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,160
That's the least believable part about watching Homeland is this cat.

479
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,400
The lead cat has been in prison for eight years and then gets back in 2012.

480
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,080
The idea that anyone could be separated from this culture for eight years

481
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,600
and then live for more than a week after is insane to me.

482
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,960
You basically become the old guy from Shawshank Redemption when that happens.

483
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Yeah, you work at the grocery store, but you still have to ask to use the bathroom.

484
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,600
At one point he says, have you seen this video on YouTube?

485
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,840
And I'm like, oh my God, you would never be able to catch up.

486
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
You would just sit in front of the computer.

487
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,400
I mean, I do that every, it is a four hour job every day.

488
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,760
Don't tell my boss to keep up with internet culture.

489
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,560
You know, this guy's been out for eight years.

490
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,600
What's hot right now, Juice?

491
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,240
In the internet?

492
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,280
Yeah, in the youth culture.

493
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,360
No, in the prison culture.

494
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,040
This is going to surprise you.

495
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,280
Twerking.

496
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,600
Okay.

497
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,800
Yeah, I'm getting into it lately.

498
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,800
Past 20 minutes.

499
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,960
So it seems to be going pretty good.

500
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,680
I'm afraid I'll hurt my butt if I try it.

501
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,200
Hey, you know what?

502
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,640
If you really want to hurt your butt, I got a great place to head.

503
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,040
It's ExtremeRestraints.com.

504
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,440
It's an adult super site for all kinds of-

505
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
We didn't put in that transition in the money zone, you dick hole.

506
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,160
Well, like he can put it in.

507
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,520
I don't need to say money zone.

508
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,720
Speaking of, he can put it in.

509
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:43,040
As I said, ExtremeRestraints.com is an adult super store for every hole.

510
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,160
Every hole in your family is going to get serviced.

511
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,280
I don't mind.

512
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,960
There are several holes in my family that I would prefer to remain vacuous.

513
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,720
No, your body family.

514
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,120
Like my body is a family of hole.

515
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,640
You know, brother butthole.

516
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,480
Mother butthole.

517
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Father taint.

518
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,760
My body is a family of holes.

519
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,800
Father taint sounds like the worst character from like Rudolph's shiny new year.

520
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
I am father taint.

521
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,280
I welcome in the new baby taint.

522
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,320
You must rescue father taint or there will never be another Kwanzaa.

523
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,720
This is all awful.

524
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,320
Trinity 10 speed vibrating egg.

525
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,080
I love my vibrating egg that I have currently, but doesn't offer me enough specificity.

526
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,560
Jesus.

527
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,000
Just head to remote sex toys and you can get the Trinity 10 speed vibrating egg and looks

528
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,920
like that retails for 78 bucks and you're going to be able to pick it up for 39.95.

529
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,160
That is fucking savings and a half.

530
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,240
With that savings, you can go and you can buy like 10 dozen real eggs and then cook

531
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,760
a big dinner for your family.

532
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,960
An egg dinner.

533
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Now, so here's another straight from Extreme Restraints recommended product.

534
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
The ball tugging stroker.

535
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
Okay, hit me.

536
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:06,880
Okay.

537
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,960
I mean, do we really need the explanation?

538
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,280
It's all it's literally all of its functions are eponymous.

539
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,600
Every word there just says it is what they do.

540
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,360
It tugs balls while you stroke.

541
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
It's the ball tugging stroker.

542
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,960
ExtremeRestraints.com.

543
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,640
You're going to be able to get 20% off any of these different penetrators that you buy.

544
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,280
Holy shit.

545
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
It looks like a penis exoskeleton.

546
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,480
Right?

547
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,800
Sure.

548
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,000
It's so awesome looking.

549
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
It's like a sweet Voltron.

550
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,680
Just do one day without you saying that out loud.

551
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,720
It's like an exoskeleton for your penis within like a special thing that goes around your balls

552
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
so that as you stroke it, it tugs on your balls.

553
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,120
When your penis has to do battle with a xenomorph, the best option is ExtremeRestraints.com.

554
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,880
Do you need a penis carapace?

555
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,440
Here you go.

556
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,280
Okay, so I just we haven't actually talked about this.

557
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,440
I joined a intramural softball league.

558
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,320
Can I wear that in sports equipment?

559
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,480
I think you're fine.

560
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,040
Phenomenal.

561
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,480
Yes, also as a great way to intimidate your competitors.

562
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,600
Yeah, especially if you have it out.

563
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,480
Tuck it out a little bit.

564
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm not going to be able to defeat that penis.

565
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,480
So coupon code MIDDLIST, 20% off is what you're going to save.

566
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
Head to the website ExtremeRestraints.com.

567
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,960
They are the biggest supporters of our program and maybe it's time to spice things up a little

568
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,120
bit.

569
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,800
You know, Valentine's Day is coming up soon.

570
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,520
That is true.

571
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,360
And what better gift, what says romance like a cup for her nipple?

572
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,360
Now at this point, we've done, let me check.

573
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,640
Yes, we've done 10,000 Extreme Restraints commercials.

574
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,640
So I assume that all of you have spent millions and millions of dollars there.

575
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,360
So it's also important that you go back and review all the products that you've purchased.

576
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,840
Give it a nice positive review and tell them MBMBAM sent you.

577
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,760
Yeah, that would be good too.

578
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,280
My best friend and I have been friends with benefits for almost two years now.

579
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,600
A couple of months ago when I got my apartment, he immediately moved in with me.

580
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,760
Even before then, we hung out literally every day playing games and watching movies and

581
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,120
snuggling to the point where it became hard to hang out with other people since I'm kind

582
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,400
of his only friend.

583
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,760
He pretty much treats me like a girlfriend, but insists he doesn't feel love.

584
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,560
What do I do to make him love me?

585
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,520
What?

586
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,080
Listen to me.

587
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Listen to me.

588
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Listen to me once out of the FWB zone.

589
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,080
Listen.

590
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:44,080
You deserve better than this.

591
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,080
You have made this very easy for this person.

592
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Listen, we all have done this so I'm not beating up on you, but you deserve better than this.

593
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:58,080
You aren't going to make this person love you.

594
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,080
You are going to-

595
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
And you shouldn't even try.

596
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Because he sounds like the biggest premium rush ever.

597
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,080
He is a big premium rush and I know you're going to live with him, that's fine.

598
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,080
You know, you guys be friends.

599
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,080
But listen, something about cow and milk, you know?

600
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
I forget it.

601
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,080
There's something about it, there's a saying about it.

602
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:26,080
You should look on Urban Dictionary for what it says about cows and milk.

603
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:34,080
You are providing this person with every function of a girlfriend.

604
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,080
Well not only that, but you're also providing him, it sounds like, with shelter.

605
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Well, no, I mean-

606
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
With food.

607
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
He's living with you as well.

608
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
And he doesn't have any other friends.

609
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,080
Oh my god, listen to me.

610
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,080
Listen.

611
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,080
Listen, the snuggle train and the sexing train.

612
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,080
That train just pulled into the station everybody off.

613
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:04,080
It's time for him to fly on his own little bird out of the nest.

614
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,080
Now can I just really quick, why would a bird ride on a train?

615
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,080
Because the birds, it's a long distance, it gets tired.

616
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,080
This is a train for birds?

617
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
This is the best thing I've ever heard in my life.

618
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,080
What if you're the only human being on that train and you're like, oh fuck.

619
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
It's a bird train.

620
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
God damn it.

621
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:32,080
Listen, you have gone through the physical motions of being in a relationship.

622
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,080
And in much the same way that if you smile long enough, you're going to feel happier.

623
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,080
The emotions have followed.

624
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:44,080
It's completely rational and logical that you feel the way you do.

625
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,080
And it's fucked that he doesn't.

626
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,080
Justin, what you've just described is a prime example of why the friends with benefits cannot be a long term arrangement.

627
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Because it's fun at first, but after a while, emotions always follow for at least one of the party.

628
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
Right.

629
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,080
You know what I mean? And it always gets messy.

630
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:11,080
But what I'm saying is that maybe this is the arrangement that she wanted also for a while, but has only now developed feelings.

631
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,080
I'm not saying we have to make this guy out to sound like a total monster, you know what I mean?

632
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,080
But if he's not down with what you want now, then it's time to find a new thing.

633
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Yeah, by me saying it sucks that he doesn't feel what you feel, I'm not saying that it's because he's a bad person.

634
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:36,080
I'm saying it sucks for you, but you are never going to be happy in a relationship.

635
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,080
And this goes for everybody, by the way.

636
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,080
You are never going to be happy in a relationship that you had to con somebody into being in with you.

637
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,080
That's never going to make you happy.

638
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,080
If you change the context, and you were dating this person, and you wanted to say get married,

639
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:57,080
and they couldn't see ever taking the relationship to that level, then you would know you needed to get out of it.

640
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,080
This is just one step back. You want to take your relationship to the next level.

641
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,080
They don't. That's a sign that you need to end it.

642
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:11,080
The reason I called this dude a major premium rush is because he actually said out loud,

643
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,080
Oh, I don't feel love.

644
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Yeah.

645
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,080
Does he mean towards you, or does he mean like AI style?

646
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Good question.

647
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,080
No, because even in fucking AI, his love was real, but he is not.

648
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Right, exactly. This guy's like a reverse AI.

649
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Fair.

650
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,080
I don't know, guys.

651
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,080
I think that you're above it, and probably, you know what?

652
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,080
Probably he is too. It sounds like it's not the right circumstance for either one of you.

653
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,080
So continue being friends, and maybe even continue being roommates.

654
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,080
But you need to end the friends with benefits side.

655
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:56,080
If you're going to start benefiting other people, then I don't think living with this dude is going to be a hot plan.

656
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Okay, I amend it then. It's probably time for him to move out.

657
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Yeah, listen, it's time for you to go.

658
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Time to get on that big long bird train.

659
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:12,080
With all the other guac.

660
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
Oh, man.

661
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:26,080
Listen, I know it sucks, but please take care of your heart and cut it off before you do more damage to yourself,

662
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,080
or you miss out on any more good days.

663
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:35,080
Like, just get it over with, get the heartbreak over with, and move on to somebody who deserves you.

664
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
Don't cut your heart off, though.

665
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Don't cut your heart off, that's true.

666
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,080
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

667
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,080
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Ira Ray.

668
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,080
Are you Ira Ray? Who wants to know?

669
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,080
Not me. Yahoo answers user Zach Z.

670
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,080
Griffin doesn't care who you are.

671
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,080
I don't give a fuck. Come one, come all to the greatest show on earth.

672
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,080
This Yahoo is Yahoo answer user Zach Z, who asks,

673
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,080
How do you get the side splits? Fast!

674
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I'm going to get into a special dance team, and I need to get the splits.

675
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,080
They are going to see if I can in about two weeks. I'm pretty far, but not far enough. Help!

676
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,080
Have someone push you down.

677
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,080
Say, I'm gonna do a side split. Someone can push me down.

678
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,080
It's really just mind over matter, isn't it?

679
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,080
You gotta keep a moist, supple taint, though, or else you'll rip it.

680
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
Never, ever again.

681
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
You do not want to rip your taint.

682
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
Never again, those three words. Never.

683
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,080
Because once it starts ripping, chances are it's just going to keep going,

684
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
and pretty soon you'll be split in twain.

685
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,080
That's really how you train your body to do that, right?

686
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,080
That particular part of your body has to become whiter, right?

687
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,080
Okay, so this leads me to a question I've been wondering for a long time.

688
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,080
That's what they don't show you with people who are doing a side split is when they're not side splitting,

689
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,080
their taint is hanging below them like a saddlebag.

690
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:02,080
Right, like a turkey gobbler.

691
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,080
Yeah, it looks like a...

692
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
A waddle.

693
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,080
A gobbler is what children call it.

694
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:15,080
Is that another way people who don't know what it's called call it?

695
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:18,080
No, no, that's what idiots call it.

696
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,080
I mean, there might be children listening.

697
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,080
It leads me to a question I've always wondered, which is,

698
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,080
if you got someone strong enough and they, whilst hugging someone,

699
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,080
grab both of their buttcheeks and pull the part really hard, could you rip someone in half?

700
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Because I feel like the butt crack is like that little slit that they make in packages that allow you to open it easily.

701
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
Yeah, sure.

702
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
And it's like God's way of saying, rip this person in two.

703
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,080
Right, sure, it's your Achilles heel, except it's your asshole.

704
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Have you never wondered that, you guys?

705
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,080
You've never wondered that? Come on.

706
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,080
Why God perforated us? Is he tearing?

707
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,080
You're saying that if you were to tear a human being in half long ways,

708
00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:01,080
that the best place to start would be the buttcheeks because it's natural handles and also there's already...

709
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
Obviously. I mean, that's a given.

710
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
That's not my question.

711
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,080
My question is, I don't know if anyone's ever tried it before, but would it be a clean break?

712
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,080
Could you do it in two?

713
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,080
I don't think that anyone... I don't even think Hulk Hogan in his prime could do that.

714
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,080
Maybe the power team could. It was a blessing of God's will.

715
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:27,080
I just thought about it and I watched the Hulk Hogan sex tape and he actually did do that. I take it back.

716
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,080
Brother, are you ready for my special move, brother?

717
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,080
Here it comes. I'd rather not!

718
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,080
Hulkamania is about to run wild all over your butt and your vagina.

719
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,080
I'm going to tear your butt and vagina in half, brother.

720
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,080
Then there was a 48-hour manhunt.

721
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,080
Only one man could leave tracks like this.

722
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,080
It's just Hulk Hogan running naked through the woods.

723
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Somebody call Tommy Lee Jones.

724
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:04,080
I didn't destroy that butt, Hulk Hogan, sir.

725
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
I'm pretty sure you did.

726
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:09,080
We actually have a sex tape of you doing it.

727
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,080
I'm Hulk Hogan destroying this butt.

728
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,080
You have butt blood all over your hands.

729
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Sir, Andre the Giant is dead. There's nobody else.

730
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,080
Have you guys seen that Hulk Hogan Andre the Giant sex tape?

731
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,080
Oh my God.

732
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Both of them in a test for dominance trying to tear the other one's butt.

733
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:36,080
It's like the opening scene in Melancholia where the two planets collide.

734
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,080
That's basically what we're talking about.

735
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,080
It's like the last scene in Over the Top.

736
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:49,080
Except it's under the bottom.

737
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,080
Oh, man. Can we be done?

738
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,080
Hulk Hogan, it feels so good.

739
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:04,080
I didn't think I would like the way it feels inside, but I do in fact like the way it feels.

740
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,080
I'm going to call on you, Hulk Hogan.

741
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,080
What the hell is that impression?

742
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:15,080
That's what Andre the Giant sounds like mid-coitus, of course.

743
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:19,080
Because it sounds like the baby of Andre the Giant Sylvester Stallone.

744
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,080
If you tear my butt in half, then I do not think I will laugh.

745
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,080
Anybody want a penis?

746
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:33,080
Hulk Hogan, perhaps you?

747
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,080
Should we make love?

748
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:43,080
I have four gallons of what in my room?

749
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:53,080
I have a bag of 30 hamburgers.

750
00:48:53,080 --> 00:49:00,080
I have that giant armchair Gallagher used to use.

751
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:06,080
I have a bicycle built for two. It is just mine.

752
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,080
I'm going to snap into some butt cheeks.

753
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,080
What are you doing? Get out of here.

754
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,080
Nobody wants you here.

755
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:17,080
We're getting tender. Get out of here.

756
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,080
Oh, yeah. I have a lance. Tear my butt in half.

757
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,080
Get out of here, Randy. Please.

758
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,080
Randy, please.

759
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,080
Some of us are adults trying to make love.

760
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Well, everyone's childhood is ruined.

761
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,080
Sorry, everybody.

762
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,080
Hey, at least we didn't make the very obvious Jake the Snake Roberts joke.

763
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,080
Okay, so that's going to do it for us here on My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

764
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,080
I believe. I don't think we can ruin anything else.

765
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,080
There's nothing else I can think of to ruin.

766
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,080
Well, there's lots of other things we could ruin, but we have lots more episodes to do.

767
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,080
We've got to save it. Yeah, we've got to save it.

768
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

769
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:56,080
The Davenport, Evan Weston, Bearden Bowtie, Evil Chase, LG, Jared.

770
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:03,080
Don Chapel, Ted Winscott, Crazy Legs 2, everybody.

771
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,080
We really appreciate it.

772
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,080
So, thank you.

773
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,080
We've got a thread going on the MaxFun forums.

774
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,080
We're going to make a new sampler.

775
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,080
And we want your suggestions for what bits we should include.

776
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:22,080
And if you can, throw in like an episode number and a time code, if possible, to tell me where to look.

777
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,080
That'll make it a lot easier to get all that set up.

778
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,080
And while you're on MaximumFun.org, make sure to check out all the other MaxFun podcasts.

779
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:38,080
Throwing Shade, Jordan Jesse Goh, Bullseye, Josh John Hodgman, Risk, Memory Palace, International Waters.

780
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,080
What am I forgetting? Stop podcasting yourself?

781
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Stop podcasting yourself.

782
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
There's always one. There's like 13 shows.

783
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,080
And they're all free and they're all amazing.

784
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,080
But it's hard to remember them. They're all like a bunch of words, you know?

785
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,080
Well, that's because MaximumFun.org is a website on the grow.

786
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:57,080
Yeah, that's true. I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song,

787
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,080
It's a Departure, off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

788
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,080
They have a podcast, Roderick on the Line, with Merlin Man from You Look Nice Today.

789
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,080
It's not on the MaximumFun network, though. Am I allowed to endorse it? I think so.

790
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,080
Yeah, I think that's fine. Legally speaking, I think you're a fine one.

791
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
Let me check our contract. Yeah, it's fine.

792
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
Yeah, it's fine.

793
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:18,080
And yeah, we're trying to plan some live shows.

794
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:23,080
We're doing MaxFunCon West, so get your tickets if there are even any still available.

795
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,080
It's like the most fun weekend ever.

796
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:32,080
But we're going to try and do some more live shows, hopefully somewhere up New England,

797
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,080
the Boston, New York, Philly region.

798
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,080
So if you have any suggestions, drop those in the forum, too,

799
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:43,080
or email us at movinbam at MaximumFun.org.

800
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:47,080
And make sure that when you email us that you put in the subject line,

801
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,080
either say live show in there or something along those lines

802
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,080
so that when we're scanning through, I can pick those out.

803
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:59,080
This final Yahoo Answer question was sent in by Adam Schwally.

804

Thank you, Adam.

805
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Abdulliah, who asks,

806
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,080
Can you get a tattoo while breastfeeding?

807
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,080
I'm Justin McElroy.

808
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.

810
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:16,080
This has been my brother, my brother and me. This is your dad.

811
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
We're on the whip.
