1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,560
Happy birthday, Patricia Heaton. This is our special Patricia Heaton birthday episode of

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,440
My Brother, My Brother, Me, an invite show for the modern era and also Chaz Bono.

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,560
Did you just Google Wikipedia and then on Wikipedia,

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,360
did you Google birthdays on March 4th? This is our Bono Heat episode.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,520
Bono Heat honoring Chaz Bono and Patricia Chaz Bono, Chaz Bono, Patricia Heaton.

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,400
I bet you Patricia Heaton would fucking hate Chaz Bono because she's a very close-minded,

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,640
she seems very conservative to me. Yeah, she is. Is she the mom from Tool Time Show?

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,560
Yeah, she's mom from Tool Time and she is mom from the middle,

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,920
but not mom from Malcolm in the Middle. Common mistake. Really? What a small world. I know.

14
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,040
And who is Chaz Bono from? Chaz Bono is from Mermaids and Sonny and Cher. Okay.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
Also Rick Perry, so it's a cool day. March 4th here on My Brother, My Brother, Me,

16
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,040
it's sort of our Patricia Heaton, Chaz Bono, Rick Perry themed episode. So all of our questions

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,880
will in some way have to do with those three celebrities. If you don't see the connection,

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,240
you're probably just not thinking. The first person to respond with an email

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,360
that lists the connection between all of the emails and either Bono, Heaton, or Perry.

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
Oh, I got it. But, Griffin, you can't participate because you work for the show.

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,120
But I know the answer. But you can't say it.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,160
But the three of them fucked. The three of them fucked that one time all together.

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,360
Well, what does that have to do with any of the questions we're about to answer?

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,080
Unless all of the questions are about that time when Rick Perry, Chaz Bono,

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,360
and Patricia Heaton fucked. Yesterday, and as long as we're talking big news stories,

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,200
uh, recently, uh, Dennis Rodman traveled to North Korea to meet with Kim Jong Un.

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Uh, and the headline, the big opinion, the popular, popular reaction from media critics

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,920
is that he did not perform well. The, the CNN headline is Rodman Fouls Out in North Korea.

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,920
And I would just like to join with my media brothers and sisters in our disbelief

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,280
that Dennis Rodman did not handle international diplomacy, uh, with North Korea.

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
Our final hope has failed us.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,920
Our last chance, like sending Bruce Willis to destroy the media,

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,680
Meteor and Armageddon. Dennis Rodman has failed us.

34
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,240
Is it possible that he did like a passable job?

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,720
He just really wanted to use that fouled out pun.

36
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,880
I mean, just showing up is half the thing, isn't it? And like, nobody else has showed up.

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,440
How come? Hey, Obama, give him a fucking call.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,520
Hey, Obama, why don't you give him a fucking call and maybe talk it over?

39
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,720
They have nukes, guys. I'm spooked. Spooked about their nukes.

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
We're nuke spooked. And we just want you to pick up the phone and call that little guy.

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,720
Why don't you fucking give him a ring?

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,600
Let's say he's adorable, but he's also, he's probably just as scared as we are.

43
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,760
And he's more afraid of us than we are of him, except that we're really afraid of him.

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not as afraid of I am as Dennis. Let me start over. My fear of them and their nukes,

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
my nuke spookedness, is not nearly as crazy high as my general Dennis Rodman discomfort.

46
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,560
My Dennis comfort. Even seeing that fucking guy. It's not great.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
It's a bad situation.

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,440
It's like he looks like he survived a trap from one of the Saw movies.

49
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
It's rough stuff.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,640
What if he had rolled up and just been like the most amazing diplomat

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,000
and Kim Jong would have walked out going, I'm sorry. I see it now.

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
Rodman on North Korea. We cool.

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,640
He says, apparently we cool. We cool with North Korea.

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,800
He fixed it. He fixed it all.

55
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,440
This is an advice show where we take your queries and turn them Acme-like into wisdom.

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,680
Here's my first advice. Obama, pick up the phone.

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,920
Let's rip off the top and guzzle it down.

58
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,440
Hi, I'm a 22 year old girl and I have a problem with what I call nerd rage.

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,200
Seems to be getting in the way of my dating life.

60
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,920
Guys don't seem to like it when I let it out, but it's almost involuntary.

61
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,600
Once someone brings up an X-Men movie, I start going off on 20 minute tangents

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,320
without realizing I'm even doing it or getting into hours long arguments

63
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,640
over who would win between Loki and the Hulk.

64
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,760
I've tried dating not nerdy guys to avoid the arguments,

65
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,920
but I would die a little inside every time a doctor who reference falls on deaf ears.

66
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,200
What should I do? Should I tone down the nerdiness

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,960
or just keep waiting for David Tennant himself to whisk me away?

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
That's from Alonzi in Charlotte, North Carolina.

69
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Listen, we're all waiting for that day.

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Yeah, we all want David Tennant to scroll up.

71
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,120
Even if it's just like a friend romance.

72
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,840
We are all happily engaged or married.

73
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
And if Tennant knocked down a door, we could not say no.

74
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,080
Justin, quiet, get yourself an adventure.

75
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Like, all right, baby.

76
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

77
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,560
Justin, get in more books.

78
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,200
Get in more spaceship, Justin.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,560
We're going on an adventure.

80
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,800
I can honestly say that if David Tennant walked in the house,

81
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,000
I would get super like little puppy excited and I'd look at Teresa

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,920
and she would just kind of go like, go ahead.

83
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
She'd understand.

84
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,160
She would sing a refrain from Jolene.

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Yeah, I mean, this is...

86
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,760
Just FYI, let me go ahead and preface this by saying,

87
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,440
I don't think that this is like because you're a girl having nerd rage.

88
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,600
I think that anybody who does this, it's kind of a turn off.

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,840
It can be a bit of a turn off.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,360
Yeah, it's, you know, there's so many real things to be upset about.

91
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,600
Like North Korea, Dennis Robbins over there messing that up.

92
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
Like get angry about that.

93
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,600
That's a real thing.

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,560
There's like social issues and stuff that if you bring it up,

95
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,280
everyone's going to go, oh yeah, I agree too.

96
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,640
I'm also mad about that.

97
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,120
The problem that I've found consistently with nerd arguments or what have you

98
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,800
is depending on the setting, you're almost always alienating somebody.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,040
There's almost always someone who doesn't know the source material as well as you

100
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,120
or like is completely oblivious.

101
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,200
And that can make for a kind of unwelcoming social experience for anybody.

102
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,320
I mean, I love my nerdy escapism as much as the next guy,

103
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,880
but I find that it can have kind of a chilling effect on your social engagements.

104
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,440
I also find that in my life that it's like timing is everything.

105
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,560
Like, yeah, I've had real long debates with people about who was the best Doctor Who

106
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,280
or about the Superman movies or the Batman movies.

107
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,960
Lots of arguments about Avatar the cartoon versus Avatar the movie.

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,000
And but I don't do it every conversation I have.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,520
Like I have the one friend that I have my Doctor Who discussions with.

110
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,400
I got the friend that I talk about cartoons with.

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,160
I have a friend I talk about comic books with.

112
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,680
And then even that is maybe like five percent of the time.

113
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,040
You know, there's an appropriate time when that conversation happens organically

114
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,120
and not like, oh, I see that you own a Wolverine origins.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Now, let me tell you why that movie sucks.

116
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,840
You know, yeah, I think I'm about to do that.

117
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,280
I have a problem with you.

118
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,720
I'm about to come to your guys houses and duct tape your butt cheese together.

119
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,640
Why fucking nerd lords?

120
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
OK, what are you talking about?

121
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
I just I don't I don't party on these kinds of because it's it's

122
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,280
is there a topic for Mario Brothers that says don't hate the player,

123
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,000
hate the game.

124
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,480
You're welcome.

125
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,120
Hot topic.

126
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,620
Go on.

127
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,160
What I'm saying is if it wasn't Doctor Who or if it wasn't, you know, comic books,

128
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,120
if it was sports or if it was wine or if it was sport wine,

129
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,840
which is a new kind of wine that I'm doing, it's kind of like Gatorade.

130
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,640
It's kind of like the Gatorade of wine.

131
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,080
But it gets you messed up.

132
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
Yeah, it gets you really fucked up.

133
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
So it's not good for like if you have to throw or catch the football

134
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
or really run into anybody, it's it's still an R&D.

135
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,120
Anyway, it's snobbishness regardless of what it is.

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
And like some people can party on that.

137
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,880
But like even if they are of equal level nerdiness than you,

138
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,800
is that really how you want to like found a relationship?

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,960
So your point being Gervin, it's not content.

140
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,360
Yeah, it's not the content, it's the tone.

141
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,280
Because if you're like if you're like a fan of a specific baseball team, right?

142
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,040
And then somebody brings up baseball and you launch into this half hour long

143
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,840
diatribe about why the Cincinnati Reds are the greatest baseball team

144
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,360
and everybody else sucks and you're like really heated and angry about it.

145
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,760
Yeah, nobody's going to like that.

146
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,000
No, especially people sitting around you going,

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
yeah, I don't care about baseball at all.

148
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,840
And everybody cares about baseball.

150
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Fewer people care about Dr. Who.

151
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
I have to see the math on that.

152
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,080
Gervin, can you read us a Yahoo question?

153
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah, sure.

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,480
I can I can do that.

155
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

156
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,720
Are you Ira Ray?

157
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm on Colmeds.

158
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm sorry.

159
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,240
I know, but I just had this moment of like sheer horror all right.

160
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
What if he doesn't do it?

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I really I've got I've become Pavlovian like trained to be like,

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,520
but we hold on.

163
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,880
He's saying, say it.

164
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
Say it.

165
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah, I hear it in my sleep now.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,360
I hear it when people say things that sound like Ira Ray, which is weird.

167
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,080
Anyway, thank you.

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Do you have an IRA?

169
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,160
Who wants to know?

170
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user Wolf Runa who asks,

171
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
who would win in a fight between the dad in the Wonder Years

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
and the dad in Happy Days and why?

173
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,120
They both rule a strict house,

174
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,520
but who'd win in a fight between the two behemoths?

175
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,600
This is the best.

176
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Oh, God.

177
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,320
Speaking of nerd rage,

178
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,040
like too much time has been spent figuring out who would win in a fight

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,560
like Superman and the Hulk.

180
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,960
We need to get more like who would win in a fight

181
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,080
Wilson from Home Improvement or Comet the dog.

182
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Wilson would beat Comet to death with his own hands.

183
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,800
So who we got?

184
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
Dad from Wonder Years.

185
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
Jack Wonder Years.

186
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,160
Jack Wonder Years.

187
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,520
Papa Cunningham.

188
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,840
Papa Cunningham is Tom Bosley, correct?

189
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
I didn't watch any TV that was on the air before.

190
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
It's the Boz.

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
It's the Boz, right?

192
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Okay.

193
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,240
It's the Boz.

194
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
And then you got the...

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,560
Come on.

196
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Indomitable Dan Laria as the dad from the Wonder Years.

197
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,760
And he is a big...

198
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,960
I mean, he is a...

199
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,680
He fucking...

200
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
I watched that show late.

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,600
I watched that show in like college

202
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,280
and he fucking scared me.

203
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,480
He was scary.

204
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,760
He's a scary man.

205
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
I haven't seen a lot of Happy Days,

206
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,000
but I want to know what episodes this person is watching

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,800
where they're like,

208
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,760
Tom Bosley runs a strict house.

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,600
This is a tough house, Tom.

210
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,640
God, Tom Bosley is tight-fisted.

211
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,080
Everybody gets one.

212
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
You get one more and you're out.

213
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
Do you remember the episode where Tom Bosley

214
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
just beat the shit out of Fonzie

215
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,920
for leaving the light on in the bathroom?

216
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,240
He's not even his son.

217
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,400
That's a tight household, Mr. Cunningham.

218
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:40,960
Crazy.

219
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,520
I think Wonder Years' dad would eat him alive.

220
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,560
Oh, yeah.

221
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,680
Are you kidding me?

222
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Dan Laria plays Vince Lombardi.

223
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,680
Okay, okay.

224
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,400
But you guys,

225
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,080
Bosley is clearly more cunning, ham.

226
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,360
And so he's gonna win in the Battle of Wills.

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
Was that the whole thing?

228
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,360
No, I actually didn't realize till about halfway through

229
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,480
that that's where I was going with it.

230
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,600
But then you followed it.

231
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,960
But then I went with it.

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,320
I took that rabbit hole.

233
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
Can I come at you with this?

234
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,480
Uncle Phil versus...

235
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
Oh, I can't remember Reginald Bell Johnson's character's name

236
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,120
for Family Matters.

237
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,800
But I can remember his name is Reginald Bell Johnson.

238
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,760
Carl Winslow.

239
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,320
Oh, God.

240
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,800
It's Uncle Phil, because here's the thing.

241
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
It was always, I mean, not even under the surface,

242
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,960
that Uncle Phil had a violent streak.

243
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,440
He threw DJ Jazzy Jeff like 20 yards a day

244
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,880
for all of the great work Will Smith did on that series

245
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,680
of making African Americans non-threatening.

246
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,640
Uncle Phil was right behind him, undoing it,

247
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,680
moment by moment.

248
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,240
Just throwing DJ Jazzy Jeff.

249
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm a white suburban guy.

250
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm trying to not be afraid of you.

251
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
And Uncle Phil is throwing your people.

252
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,400
He is watching African Americans at his front door.

253
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,480
In the years that I've watched this show,

254
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,080
it has only just now occurred to me

255
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,520
that the neighbors of Uncle Phil and his family,

256
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,080
about once a week are looking out their window

257
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,760
to see a scrawny black man being launched out the door.

258
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
What do they think is going on in that house?

259
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,520
How is it?

260
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,560
How does Uncle Phil figure out that Will is the one

261
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,680
making them look bad in their DJ Jazzy neighborhood?

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,320
Right?

263
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,440
Phil is trying to blend in, in Bel Air,

264
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,120
and meanwhile he's throwing black people out his front door.

265
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,840
And there was an episode, if I remember correctly,

266
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,720
where Uncle Phil sits on a rabbit and kills it.

267
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
What does that have to do with anything?

268
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm just saying that's scary as shit.

269
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,520
Carl Winslow never sat on a rabbit.

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,160
Despite the fact that Reginald Will Johnson,

271
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,440
as TV's Carl Winslow, is armed and dangerous

272
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,360
because he's a fucking police officer,

273
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
you think that Uncle Phil's sitting power-

274
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,960
When Carl Winslow is ejecting Steve Urkel from the house,

275
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,560
he uses his words.

276
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
Yeah, and to be fair,

277
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,480
I never saw Carl Winslow's hand where his hip be at.

278
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,040
That would have been a great episode

279
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,680
if half the episode was just him spent in therapy

280
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,320
filling out paperwork for having to discharge his weapon

281
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,560
to kill a rabbit that was on the couch.

282
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,640
Maybe you didn't fucking watch Die Hard,

283
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,760
which is part of the Winslow-verse.

284
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,480
It is in the Winslow-verse.

285
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
I could convince myself of this, by the way.

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,520
I mean, he plays that cop in like 19 movies.

287
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,600
Oh, that's real nice, Trav.

288
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,560
Real nice.

289
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,880
I mean, that funny buddy, he's just afraid to shoot people.

290
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
What other than Die Hard and Die Hard 2?

291
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,280
Oh God, now you can put me on the spot.

292
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,080
Yeah, I put you on the spot

293
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,360
because you're talking out of your ass.

294
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,440
No, you also did it in Family Matters.

295
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,840
Family Matters.

296
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,040
Family Matters, the movie.

297
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,080
There were like 100 episodes of that.

298
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,720
He was a cop in all of them.

299
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,200
You can think of Die Hard as being a long

300
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,680
and confusing episode of Family Matters.

301
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,320
I believe, if I'm not mistaken,

302
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,800
I think he was also that cop in Ghostbusters.

303
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,880
I think that was a ghost.

304
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,600
Dead Carl Winslow.

305
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
I'm just going over his IMDB page right now,

306
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,160
looking for any kind of character that's just listed as

307
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,520
cop who's afraid to shoot gun.

308
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll get back to you.

309
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,920
I had someone on my paper route when I was younger,

310
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,520
his last name was Bosley,

311
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,760
and I convinced myself that it was Tom Bosley

312
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,720
living a life of prophecy in Huntington, West Virginia.

313
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
In Huntington, West Virginia?

314
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
Tom Bosley just couldn't handle the attention

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,280
in Pavarazzi anymore.

316
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,320
All of the getting out of the limo shots

317
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,840
where his vagina was showing,

318
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,760
he just couldn't stand the attention.

319
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,760
All the Father Dowling heads chasing him around,

320
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,760
trying to get their pick with Father Dowling.

321
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,480
All the sex tapes, drug scandals,

322
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
Tom Bosley just could not handle it anymore.

323
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
Tom Bosley, you're missed.

324
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,120
Yeah, I do.

325
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,400
I do miss Tom Bosley.

326
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,000
I guess that is one advantage that Dan Loria has over

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,560
Tom Bosley is being corporeal, I guess.

328
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,280
This is one thing that's good about Dan Loria

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,000
is that he's alive, so that is helpful.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
I mean, that's a big plus.

331
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,920
But as angry as he is, though,

332
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
counting down the days over here,

333
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,640
that takes a toll on a man's heart, you know?

334
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,920
Yeah, no kidding.

335
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,360
Especially when a man is that big and that threatening.

336
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,160
Okay, semifinals.

337
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,040
Semifinals?

338
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
Hey, we're gonna bracket this.

339
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm not trying this, we're doing it.

340
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,400
To be fair, Dan Loria in 2014 is starring in a movie

341
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,640
called Icky, An American Dog Story, as Paul Puccini.

342
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
So he probably wishes that Tom Bosley had killed him.

343
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,760
Every day.

344
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,360
Every day he wishes Tom Bosley...

345
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
What could have been?

346
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
Why did you finish the job, Tom?

347
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,480
So here's another question from one of our users.

348
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Recently, I've been feeling that I think about things too much.

349
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,680
Sometimes I find I'm unable to take action

350
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,440
because I'm busy thinking about what might happen.

351
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,040
Case in point, I recently helped my friend DJ a dance party

352
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,760
and a girl I don't know came up and tried to dance with me.

353
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
I wasn't dancing before.

354
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,040
And rather than getting out on the floor and having a good time,

355
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
I thought about the reasons why I shouldn't

356
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,640
or why it wouldn't be appropriate.

357
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,040
Pretty soon, this girl makes some excuses and left.

358
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,120
I wasn't able to have any fun because I was thinking too hard.

359
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,680
Is this a problem or is it just a personality trait?

360
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,320
And that's from Introspective in Indiana.

361
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,760
Before we get to the question,

362
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,920
I want to say that the thing that caught me is

363
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,760
all the excuses why you shouldn't.

364
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,320
Like what?

365
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,320
What was it?

366
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Was it like a kid's party?

367
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,400
That's a pretty good fucking excuse.

368
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Were there snakes on the dance floor?

369
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
This party is at McDonald's.

370
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,760
We're in the play place.

371
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,880
What are you talking about?

372
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,560
The floor is lava.

373
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,040
I mean, okay, yes, it is a personality trait.

374
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,680
And personality traits, I think, are only a problem

375
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,920
if they're impacting your happiness.

376
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,960
I mean, that's when they become-

377
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,520
I guess it depends on,

378
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,320
is this you saying that you think things through?

379
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,080
Or is this you saying you have a hard time making decisions

380
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
because you're thinking about every different possible outcome?

381
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,960
That's not a bad trait to have.

382
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,760
You just have to know that when an attractive person is,

383
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,360
stranger is dancing with you,

384
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
that you have to shut that voice that you just gotta fuck up.

385
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,840
I feel like this is an issue that I have in real life,

386
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,360
or I did, but I've been making a very strong effort

387
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,000
over the last two or three years to stop doing it,

388
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,920
and my life is like a thousand times better.

389
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,240
Because every so often, that's a good thing.

390
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,360
When it's deciding how you want to do your health insurance

391
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,920
or a payment plan for something.

392
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,360
I want to meet someone who's impetuous

393
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,320
about their health insurance.

394
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,040
I don't know.

395
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
Let's still catch the wind.

396
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,120
PPO?

397
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,400
PP, I have no idea.

398
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,280
Let's do it.

399
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:15,840
Just do it.

400
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,880
Sign me up.

401
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,000
Do I want a new car?

402
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,640
Sure, I do.

403
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, no.

404
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,680
Whoops, I got dog insurance on myself.

405
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,240
That's okay.

406
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,840
I'm gonna have a luscious coat.

407
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,760
If someone's like, hey, you want to go see a movie?

408
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:28,980
Yeah.

409
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't sit there and go,

410
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,400
I don't know if I see that movie

411
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
while I beat two tires tonight,

412
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,880
and I was saving money in that extra $8 maybe.

413
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
Like, if you want to go, dude, do it.

414
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
If you want to dance with the girl, do it.

415
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,280
Don't sit there and go,

416
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,360
well, what if it turns out that she has a boyfriend,

417
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
and then he beats me up, and I break my leg,

418
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,800
and I lose my track scholarship,

419
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,840
and then I end up homeless.

420
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,000
No, if you have a track scholarship,

421
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
you need to keep your head on a fucking swivel.

422
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,240
Because everything out there wants to break your ankles.

423
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,920
I'll tell you one thing that I've been doing lately

424
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,880
that has kind of helped me deal with this,

425
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,360
because I absolutely have a problem with this.

426
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,840
And it surprised its negativity.

427
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,240
I remind myself that basically,

428
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,600
everything bad that has ever happened to me,

429
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,560
I never have seen that shit coming.

430
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
I never think, like, something bad's coming,

431
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,880
and then it does.

432
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,560
It's that I think everything's cool,

433
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,000
and then it gets very bad.

434
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
So, like, the very fact that you have even thought

435
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,880
about a negative outcome means that

436
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
that's probably not the one that's gonna happen.

437
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,320
So, like, just, just get over it.

438
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,200
Just go with it.

439
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,040
And bad things are gonna happen.

440
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,400
Absolutely.

441
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
A ship in harbor is safe.

442
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
But that's not what ships were made for.

443
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,240
They were made for sailing to adventure with Captain Ron.

444
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,120
You are a ship, and Captain Ron is beckoning you to adventure,

445
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,280
and you need to just pile on board.

446
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
You could have had this lady on your, on your mast.

447
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,360
Wait, hold on.

448
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,440
What's the front thing on the front?

449
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,520
Your, your, the mermaid statue?

450
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,320
Your figurehead.

451
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,840
This girl could have been the mermaid statue.

452
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,800
The prow.

453
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,480
I think the prow that you put tape to the front of your boat.

454
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,960
Hold on.

455
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,040
You could have duct taped this girl to your boat.

456
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,800
You could have fucked this girl on a boat,

457
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,160
and you didn't because you thought about

458
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,360
how your dancing wasn't correct or some shit.

459
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,960
It just makes me sick.

460
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,480
Yeah, this could have been a person.

461
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
You could have made love, and then the condom had an accident,

462
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,880
and you could have had a person.

463
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,240
And that person was, like, the next Martin Luther King Jr.

464
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,640
Or, or it also could have been the next John Wayne Gacy.

465
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,440
Oh, no.

466
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Okay, it became a Paul Harvey story.

467
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
He probably thought, what if I fuck this person,

468
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,480
and then it's John Wayne Gacy?

469
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,440
That comes out, not the person themselves.

470
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,480
I think I would see that.

471
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
Dude, dude is huge.

472
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Turns out to be John Wayne Gacy.

473
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,600
I didn't notice.

474
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
So foolish.

475
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,400
You're wearing clown makeup.

476
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
You're covered in kid blood.

477
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,040
Let's continue this party under my basement.

478
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,080
Can we not, John?

479
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,000
The party's fun already.

480
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,960
Can we just spend a night on the couch watching Netflix?

481
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,360
The other thing that is important to remember

482
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,040
that it is more negativity to cure your anxiety

483
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,120
is that no one thinks about you ever.

484
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,920
No one ever thinks about anybody other than themselves.

485
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,000
If you're worried what people will think, don't.

486
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,880
They don't.

487
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,160
They're not thinking about you.

488
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,280
They don't.

489
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,320
They don't care.

490
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,600
You're the only one that's caring,

491
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,440
and you're caring more than everybody else.

492
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
I would argue that in this situation,

493
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,000
like, not doing it and being like, uh, uh, uh,

494
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,160
is making her think less of you than if you just got out there

495
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,280
and been a bad dancer.

496
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,000
Because now she's thinking, like, what was the big deal?

497
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,520
Why didn't that guy like me?

498
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Like, why is he being so weird?

499
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,840
You made her feel bad about herself.

500
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
She doesn't pick up a guy at a bar.

501
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
They didn't make the baby that would ultimately save the world.

502
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,600
This is what I measure things in now, by the way.

503
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,280
I do love that it's only like a three or four step process.

504
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,640
Yeah, that's right.

505
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,560
And there are only two degrees of people.

506
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,720
Either it's the next Gacy or the next King.

507
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,640
It's one of those two?

508
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,880
Always?

509
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Always.

510
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,520
I think there actually was a Paul Harvey story

511
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,640
about like an abortion clinic where it's like two women came in

512
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,360
and one got an abortion and one didn't.

513
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,560
And the one who got an abortion, her son was going to be Picasso.

514
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,960
And the one who didn't, her son was Hitler.

515
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,200
And that's the rest of the story.

516
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
Paul Harvey was a fucked up guy.

517
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,240
Man, Travis, that is the funniest bit you've ever done about abortion.

518
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,480
You might have made your top five abortion bits.

519
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
That is definitely the top five.

520
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,400
That didn't come from me.

521
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
That came from Paul Harvey.

522
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,680
But it came from the Paul Harvey that doesn't exist in your fucking head.

523
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,720
Via the transit of property, it came from you.

524
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,320
It came from the Paul Harvey.

525
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,000
It's so fucking stupid.

526
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
He thinks that people who get aborted,

527
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,320
we somehow can predict what they would have been.

528
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,760
It was a what if.

529
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,200
It was a what if, you guys.

530
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,400
It was a what if.

531
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,040
It was a what if story.

532
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
Pop this abortion in the what if machine.

533
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
And now you know the bullshit I made up.

534
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,120
Okay, Paul.

535
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,280
I'm Paul Harvey, drunk as fuck.

536
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,680
Wouldn't it be crazy if, hey pass that bong over here.

537
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,120
Wouldn't it be crazy if a woman had an abortion

538
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,920
and her baby was like Jesus or some shit.

539
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,120
Ah, that'd be weird.

540
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,280
And now you know a fucked up thing.

541
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
That I made up.

542
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,200
Man, Paul, you have not lost a step in your old age.

543
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,400
Even though you think that cucumber is a radio microphone,

544
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,160
you have not lost a step.

545
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,280
Paul Harvey, radio titan, full of shit.

546
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,600
Maybe dead.

547
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,160
Possibly dead, I'm not sure.

548
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,040
Definitely on the run.

549
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,840
Dead as Dan Loria wishes he was.

550
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,480
Paul Harvey, total asshole.

551
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
Abortion fetishist.

552
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,200
Liar.

553
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,800
Professional bullshitter.

554
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,600
Paul Harvey.

555
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,040
Real asshole.

556
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,320
Paul Harvey.

557
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,360
You wanna go to the money town?

558
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,640
Yeah, try to stop me.

559
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:42,880
Travis, how weird do you like it?

560
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,480
Uh, you don't know.

561
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,680
That's the problem.

562
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,600
And it's a problem that we're all facing

563
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,080
because we haven't gone to extrememachines.com

564
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,640
and gotten ourselves some sex stuff for sex.

565
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,360
Yes, but let me throw this out, Justin.

566
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,240
I hate to derail your hilarious goof train,

567
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
but what if it wasn't for sex?

568
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,280
What if it wasn't for sex?

569
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,520
We got, we got, we got a customer review,

570
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,720
a confessional from a listener named Meg.

571
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,840
She works for an artist at a video game company

572
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
and they call other guys over to check their computers

573
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,840
to review what they're working on.

574
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,240
And sometimes haters are gonna hate

575
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,520
and they just won't leave you alone.

576
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,680
And so she brought a drill-a-hole fucking machine

577
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,760
at a discounted price using the midlist coupon code.

578
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,800
And that's what she uses to drive away haters.

579
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,720
Oh, sorry, haters.

580
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
Sorry, haters.

581
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,760
I've got a fucking machine.

582
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,720
Hey, HR?

583
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,160
Hi, this is Griffin from the podcast.

584
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,160
Did, there's some shit happening under your fucking nose

585
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
that you let a fucking machine,

586
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,680
you let a drilling fucking machine into your office

587
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,200
and somebody is using it.

588
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
They have weaponized it.

589
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,840
She uses, she has a special carrying case

590
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,600
that like she pops the latches on.

591
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,920
I imagine at this point, like that's enough for them to go.

592
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,600
High human resources.

593
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,680
She made a holster for her fucking machine

594
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,120
that she brings into work every day

595
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,320
that you haven't noticed.

596
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,520
So streamerchase.com is an adult superstore

597
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,600
and a great place to pick up a plate thing to scare people

598
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,960
that will probably get you fired.

599
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,760
Mm-hmm.

600
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,200
And you can get everything on the site 20% off

601
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,800
using the coupon code MIDDLIST.

602
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
That's right, MIDDLIST.

603
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,440
They're running a special promotion right now on dildos

604
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,120
where if you buy 10 dildos,

605
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,880
then you're gonna feel great when you get all of that.

606
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,920
Great when you get all those dildos in you.

607
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,680
It's not a conventional promotion.

608
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:56,240
Special, well put in the coupon code 10 dildos inside

609
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,920
and then buy the 10 dildos.

610
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,160
You're not gonna get any kind of discount on it.

611
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,680
Only for the coupon code MIDDLIST.

612
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,000
Just type in the coupon code quiverofdildos.

613
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,880
If you can get all 10 dildos in you

614
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,920
and you take a picture of yourself and you send it in,

615
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,240
then they will have that of you.

616
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
Not to us, not to us.

617
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,160
Not to us.

618
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,440
But for the love of sweet baby Jesus, not to us.

619
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,680
Unless.

620
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,160
If you craft yourself like a dildo bandolier

621
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,840
and then use them to fight crime as like the dilder.

622
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,520
The Dilbert.

623
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,840
The Dilbert.

624
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,880
That would just be awesome.

625
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
Head to extrovertrace.com,

626
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,080
use the coupon code MIDDLIST and get fucked.

627
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,680
Hey folks, this is Kevin Allison of The State and the podcast RISK

628
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,440
where people tell true stories

629
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,280
they never thought they'd dare to share.

630
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,800
X-rated stories.

631
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,440
Outrageously hilarious stories.

632
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,960
Tear-jerking stories.

633
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,160
You won't believe how real and raw and surprising RISK can be.

634
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,120
You've heard people say,

635
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,560
oh, too much information.

636
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,640
Don't be sharing that in mixed company.

637
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,960
Well, at RISK, we say, screw that.

638
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,080
Anything goes.

639
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,840
So you've got a treasure trove of jaw-dropping entertainment

640
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
to dig into, my friend.

641
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,840
Look us up at maximumfun.org

642
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,960
or of course just go to podcast at the iTunes store

643
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,560
and search for RISK.

644
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
This Yahoo is sent in by Jacob Locker.

645
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,760
Thank you, Jacob.

646
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,560
It's by Yahoo Answers user obesecatholic who asks,

647
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,680
is it safe to let a horse live in my bathroom?

648
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,320
That's it.

649
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
Okay, well, depends on the size of the horse.

650
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
Safe for you or safe for the horse?

651
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,960
These are both great questions.

652
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,440
What's your flooring situation?

653
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,480
Is it a first floor bathroom or a second floor bathroom?

654
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,520
Do you know any people who will ever come over to your house

655
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,200
and use your bathroom?

656
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Not anymore.

657
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
Because they-

658
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,880
Because if you do, a pretty good goof would be to pretend

659
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,960
like there is no horse in that bathroom.

660
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,160
A what?

661
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,640
What did you see in my bathroom?

662
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,680
Pardon me?

663
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,160
No.

664
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,960
Excuse me?

665
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,000
That's my sacred space.

666
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,920
That's where I store my 10 dildos.

667
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,560
What exactly are you accusing me of, sir?

668
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:16,880
Sir?

669
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,680
That is my mother-in-law, sir.

670
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,120
How dare you?

671
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,160
How good day.

672
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,160
You racist.

673
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,560
I have to go feed her some oats to cheer her up.

674
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,240
The shenanigans.

675
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,840
The shenanigans that this situation would lead to.

676
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,880
There are literally, if this podcast was six hours long,

677
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,640
I couldn't enumerate them.

678
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,520
There's so many possible shenanigans.

679
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,800
He's gonna eat all your TP.

680
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,240
Uh-huh.

681
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,400
He's gonna use up all your hot water.

682
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,240
Yeah.

683
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,200
He's gonna shave-

684
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,840
He's big.

685
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
He's a big horse.

686
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,360
He's gonna shave his face and then he's gonna have like

687
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,880
a regular skin face and a hair body over the rest of him.

688
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,160
He's also gonna get in the shower while you hide in the closet

689
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,720
and do voiceover for him and make whoever's pooping

690
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,680
think he's Mr. Ed.

691
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:12,880
No?

692
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,360
No.

693
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,920
Why would they get, they wouldn't get, nobody would,

694
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,800
nobody would, in this situation, nobody would poop around the horse.

695
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,360
Nobody would walk into the bathroom and be like,

696
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,240
oh, a horse, huh?

697
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,960
Well, if there's one thing I like, it's being seated and pantless

698
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,440
around a giant 400 pound monster with chitinous feet.

699
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,840
The horse is in the shower with a shower curtain drawn

700
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,320
and the water is on.

701
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,120
There's no reason.

702
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,320
There is no reason.

703
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,960
The person comes in and says, oh, sorry, I didn't know someone

704
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,320
was in here, I was just gonna use the bathroom.

705
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,280
And you voiceover and go, oh, yes, of course, use the bathroom.

706
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,600
But you are-

707
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
And then when the horse takes his head through the curtain,

708
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,560
you're like, oh, I see that you're shitting.

709
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,680
Travis, I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you,

710
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,680
but you're being a real part of Harvey right now.

711
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,000
I can't imagine any scenario in which you could lure a horse

712
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,440
you could lure a horse, a full grown horse,

713
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,520
unless we're talking like a little spasticity situation,

714
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,240
a full grown horse into your bathtub.

715
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,360
It is not happening.

716
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,000
More importantly-

717
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,120
What if you had a carrot?

718
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,760
Okay, no, listen, listen, they're not discrete creatures.

719
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,640
They are not God's most, they're God's most beautiful

720
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
and they're God's most brilliant and soulful creatures.

721
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,840
And killable.

722
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,120
They're most killable.

723
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,560
Most destroyable creature.

724
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:31,040
Yes, but they are not what you might call stealth.

725
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,640
They are not stealth animals.

726
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,160
God made it so they can't sneak up on you.

727
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,560
So what you're saying is you need a really opaque shower curtain.

728
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,200
He gave them-

729
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,240
Oh God, Travis.

730
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,960
He gave them percussion on their fucking feet.

731
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,760
You're gonna hear them.

732
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,520
You gotta put down the little rubber fishes

733
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,120
so they don't slide all over the place.

734
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,080
Nobody has ever, nobody's ever walked into a barn

735
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,160
and been surprised by a horse's presence.

736
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:55,920
Turn the corner and be like,

737
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,240
oh my God, I didn't know a horse was in here.

738
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,880
Travis, do you know what they call a ninja that rides a horse?

739
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,360
What's that?

740
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,080
A corpse.

741
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,760
Cause they can't sneak at all.

742
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,280
Cause it's really dark, Justin.

743
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,520
Yeah.

744
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
Sorry, ninjas.

745
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,720
You took a really dark place.

746
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,160
Our whole ninja contingent is gonna-

747
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,400
Sorry, anybody who's listening and also a ninja.

748
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
I didn't mean to be such a Paul Harvey.

749
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,440
Might be fun though.

750
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,480
Dress them up in a little suit.

751
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,720
For like a day, it would be the best.

752
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,440
That's the thing, it would be great for like 10 minutes.

753
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,000
Or another good goof if somebody comes over for dinner

754
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,960
and they're like, holy shit, there's a horse in your bathroom.

755
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,880
And you go, oh shit, he escaped from the kitchen.

756
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,320
The worst thing about having a horse in your bathroom

757
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,840
is that you are gonna be desperate for somebody to see that shit.

758
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,240
And from the moment they come over to visit,

759
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,600
you're gonna be looking at them like,

760
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,320
oh, how's your bladder feeling a bit full?

761
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,080
Do you want some coffee and bran?

762
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,320
Did you need to poopy?

763
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,440
You need to make dirt?

764
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,080
Hey, hey, you need to make dirt?

765
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,240
You're a little bloated, you need to make dirt?

766
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,360
You need to make dirt?

767
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,400
Go make some dirt.

768
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
No, not down here, upstairs.

769
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Why would you put the horse in the upstairs bathroom?

770
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,080
And not the downstairs?

771
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Because I only have a half bath downstairs

772
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
and there's no goddamn way I'm getting the horse in there.

773
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,980
Okay.

774
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,320
Come on, Griffin.

775
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,200
Come on.

776
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,640
You've been in Justin's house.

777
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,440
Use your brain.

778
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,640
That goof is also on a time limit.

779
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,080
You need to get them in the toilet.

780
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,680
That horse is gonna give you maybe five minutes of silence.

781
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,680
If you slop some peanut butter in its jaws,

782
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,040
and if you take him on a long, beautiful ride

783
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,240
for several hours in the countryside, getting real worn out,

784
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,080
maybe he'll stand still for you for five minutes.

785
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,600
But after that, all bets are off.

786
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:55,120
Horses, horses are noted assholes

787
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,640
and they like to feel majestic at least,

788
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,120
at least three times an hour.

789
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,320
So if you go for too long without making them feel

790
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
or look majestic, they're just gonna start whining

791
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,880
and then the goof's over.

792
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,280
And then you're a weird guy in the horse's bathroom,

793
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,760
not the prankster supreme 2013.

794
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,000
But if you can pull it off.

795
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,120
Oh God, if you can pull it off

796
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,160
and take a picture and send it into us,

797
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
we will give you the title of goof master supreme 2013.

798
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,880
We will give that to you.

799
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,960
We'll send it with a big novelty check

800
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
for as much money as you want.

801
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,600
The check means nothing.

802
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,200
The check will be worth money.

803
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,080
This is what I'm saying.

804
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,160
If you can pull it off, you can have everything.

805
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,920
You can have the check.

806
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,760
The world is yours.

807
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,640
The hat.

808
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,680
Oh, there's a hat.

809
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,240
Listen, do not take it to a photo shop

810
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,760
and have it photo shopped

811
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,640
because I will know the difference.

812
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,200
If you take a picture of a horse in a photo shop,

813
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,240
that would be awesome.

814
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,400
I will also accept horse in a photo shop,

815
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,600
but I have to know that it's original for us.

816
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,160
The horse has to be saying my brother, my brother and me

817
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,800
or making his mouth.

818
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
And holding today's paper.

819
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,680
And holding today's paper in his,

820
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,240
no, he's holding tomorrow's paper in his mouth.

821
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,160
And we've got an early edition.

822
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,840
I love it.

823
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,880
Oh, man.

824
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,400
You guys want another question here?

825
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,200
Yeah, I'm 20 years old.

826
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,920
And while I'm fortunate to have my parents pay my tuition,

827
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
something I'm very grateful for,

828
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,520
I try not to rely on their financial assistance

829
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
as much as possible.

830
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,080
I just got a text from my dad saying

831
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,600
he put a hundred dollars in my bank account

832
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,040
as a gift for a rainy day.

833
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,960
A hundo is nice.

834
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,800
Feel bad for taking the money.

835
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
Should I just give him the money back?

836
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
As I step towards independence?

837
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,480
Or should I take the gift and go with it?

838
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,120
That's from Mr. Wants to be independent.

839
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,920
That's so cute.

840
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
That's so nice.

841
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,280
It's really nice.

842
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,800
Just take it.

843
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,520
What are you?

844
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
Take your dad's fucking money.

845
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,480
Take your dad's fucking money.

846
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,720
He earned it and it makes him happy to give it to you.

847
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,080
If you were 46 and your dad dropped a hundo on you,

848
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,360
I see you going, hey, dad, you're in a home.

849
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,280
Please don't give me your money anymore.

850
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
I'm literally paying for all of your care.

851
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,320
This is coming directly out of my account.

852
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,160
You take that money.

853
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,200
Just take the money.

854
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Your dad is trying to do something nice.

855
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,120
Don't worry about it.

856
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,000
Trust me.

857
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
He'll get sick of giving you money soon enough.

858
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
So soon.

859
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,800
So soon.

860
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,800
Squirrel it away.

861
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Do you like have a, do you have a job?

862
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,240
Here's my opinion, guys, and this is just for me.

863
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,040
I think if your parents are paying the bulk of your expenses,

864
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,840
I think, I think that like trying to strike out on your own is, is noble.

865
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,040
And I think that trying to secure your independence can be really great for

866
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,920
your confidence.

867
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,480
But like, if your parents are already paying the bulk of your expenses,

868
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,080
like that, you know, it's a, it's a futile gesture.

869
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah.

870
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,120
Yeah.

871
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,240
It's a pure victory.

872
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,000
If you're like, no, I won't take your Benjamin, like, just, just take it and

873
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,560
then get yourself on your own two feet as soon as you can.

874
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,160
And also, I mean, helpful advice.

875
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,040
There's a big difference between having to ask your dad for money to pay for

876
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,800
something and your dad just being like, Hey, because I love you.

877
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,760
Here's the present.

878
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,720
That's your, that's you've been a good sign.

879
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,720
You've been a good son.

880
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,560
This is your good son reward.

881
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,440
Just take it and go buy some Pokemon cards or some shit.

882
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,960
There is nothing that there's nothing unindependent.

883
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,920
There's no dependent.

884
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,960
That's what I'm looking for.

885
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,080
There's nothing dependent about someone giving you a present.

886
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,080
Yeah.

887
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,680
I mean, it's just nice.

888
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,240
Yeah.

889
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,880
Don't worry about it.

890
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,600
It's not a big deal.

891
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,280
That was easy.

892
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,080
Next one.

893
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
That's easy.

894
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,920
Here's more advice.

895
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,080
I just moved into a new apartment building.

896
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm loving everything about the upgrade in space compared to my last place.

897
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,680
However, my next door neighbors have started ruining my excitement by playing

898
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,280
their music TV all day, every day.

899
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
Now here's the thing.

900
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
They aren't blasting it by any means.

901
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,600
But the bass is audible enough to hear in my apartment.

902
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,880
It makes watching quiet movies hilarious because it's hard to appreciate a

903
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,360
haunting scene where Philip Seymour Huffman with a quiet in the background.

904
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,120
I can usually jot it out by playing my TV and music, but then I risk annoying

905
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,960
my downstairs upstairs neighbors.

906
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,400
The short version, my right to be so annoyed with this barely noticeable noise.

907
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,160
Or am I just a premium rush?

908
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,520
That's from IRAE in Illinois.

909
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,320
I would, I would argue that it is more annoying to have it barely audible.

910
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:34,880
Oh my God.

911
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,120
Yes.

912
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,240
It's super.

913
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,280
Right, right.

914
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,240
Absolutely.

915
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Okay, no, because if it's super blasting, you can roll next door and be like,

916
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,160
Hey, turn it down.

917
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Well, can you, can you Superman?

918
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,840
Is that something you're big, tough, Jeannie?

919
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
Is that something you're capable of doing?

920
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,320
Luke Kang?

921
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,160
I did not know.

922
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,800
I did not know.

923
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,360
I was brothers.

924
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,240
It was a superhero.

925
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,040
I did not know.

926
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,680
I did not know.

927
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,320
I did not know.

928
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
I was brothers. It was a superhero.

929
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,480
Turn it down.

930
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:07,360
Are you implying that politely asking your neighbors to turn something down is such a

931
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,960
scary experience that only Luke Kang could accomplish it?

932
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,840
I'm saying to have the bravery to, to confront anybody for any reason.

933
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:23,920
Okay.

934
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,400
You know what?

935
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,920
I'm laughing and I'm making fun of you, but you're absolutely correct.

936
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,080
I think whenever something like that happens, everybody instantly turns into Charlie Brown

937
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,160
and goes, I'll wait.

938
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm sure it'll be fine.

939
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,400
They'll move eventually.

940
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,600
That might just be because the three of us have the kind of type J personalities that

941
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,360
never help you get along in the world.

942
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,720
The number of times in my life that I say things like, you know, I should go say something.

943
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,440
I mean, I'm not going to, but I recognize that I should.

944
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,120
This is one of those moments where if I had a dick, if I-

945
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,040
I would definitely use it.

946
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,040
You guys should get in Sydney as a wife because boy, howdy.

947
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,720
She does not suffer that.

948
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,760
We were in a, we were in, used to stay at that apartment.

949
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,080
You guys remember that apartment that she used to be in on 6th Avenue next to Marshall?

950
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,320
Yeah.

951
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:24,560
We were there and her downstairs neighbors, like, took this to its logical extreme and

952
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,360
did the most insufferable thing in the world, which is to, at all hours, especially like

953
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,720
2 to 3 a.m.

954
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,200
See, we really choice, would blast Sublime's Santeria.

955
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,720
Oh, that's a good one though.

956
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,920
Definitely volume.

957
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,960
On loop?

958
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,680
Yes, yes.

959
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,400
Like, oh my god, they're listening to fucking Santeria.

960
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,240
I'm getting to the deepest levels of it.

961
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,960
Play it again.

962
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,600
She would just-

963
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,320
I'm hearing it.

964
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,120
She would just get on our hands and knees with this cast iron pan that we bought.

965
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,880
It was the first thing we ever bought together, actually, and she would just pound on the

966
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,080
floor with it.

967
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,280
And then one night she just eventually got sick of it and went downstairs and started

968
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,920
banging on their door with a cast iron skillet and told them to turn off the goddamn Santeria

969
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,520
because it was the only song they listened to with Santeria constantly.

970
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,240
And now you guys can't make love unless you listen to Santeria by Sublime.

971
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,320
Totally weird, totally weird, totally true.

972
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Hey man, we're all right there with you.

973
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,080
Yeah, listen, this is no Paul Harvey stuff.

974
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,720
This is real.

975
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,600
No, this is real.

976
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,440
I have upstairs neighbors that, I swear to god, they've got kids that are like five and

977
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,240
six at like three o'clock in the morning.

978
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,680
Those kids are running in circles.

979
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,760
I don't understand it.

980
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,120
It blows me away.

981
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,280
And like, it will wake me up, but not enough to tell them.

982
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,160
My fucking backyard John Hammond, I wish you would make a noise.

983
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,520
I wish I knew what that fucking dude was doing back there ever.

984
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,280
I'm getting one clue.

985
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,120
Give me one thing.

986
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,200
Give me one thing, dog.

987
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,160
If I heard like a weird like full brass klezmer band coming from there, I'd be like, oh, okay.

988
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,640
So he's like just some sort of weird klezmer guy.

989
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,840
But it's not that.

990
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,560
It's not that.

991
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,760
I can't fucking crack that nut and it's killing me.

992
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,520
You're not going to know until it's too late.

993
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,400
You know that, right?

994
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,680
You accepted that?

995
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,480
Oh, yeah.

996
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:10,960
Yeah.

997
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,280
The only noise I'm going to hear is the chainsaw that he's ripping through my spine.

998
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,840
That is the first sound from him I will ever hear.

999
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,960
You're going to have time to think, is that piano wire?

1000
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
And then your air is gone.

1001
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,640
You're blacking out.

1002
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,160
You're done.

1003
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:26,880
Oh, man.

1004
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,920
You got another Yahoo Griffin?

1005
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,840
I mean, is that where we should go now?

1006
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,200
Yeah, we can take it here.

1007
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,040
This Yahoo was sent by Joe Ruscio.

1008
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,600
Thank you, Joe.

1009
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,680
It's by Yahoo answer user R who asks, is it cool so see a boy sagging their pants?

1010
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,520
Whoa, if you like it, what type of underwear should it be and how low?

1011
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,560
If you don't like it, why?

1012
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,520
I'm sorry, I need the thesis statement one more time.

1013
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,320
Is it cool so see a boy sagging their pants?

1014
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,720
Okay, is it cool to see a boy sagging their pants?

1015
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,440
Which is great because it's not asking if it's cool to sag because the answer is of

1016
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,280
course, still and forever.

1017
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
Is she asking like a bird watching question?

1018
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,160
I saw another one today.

1019
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,120
It's a good omen.

1020
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,160
Make a wish.

1021
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,720
It's like the cowboy on the Tootsie Roll Pop wrapper.

1022
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,400
But what you don't want is a boy sagging his pants to like be outside your window because

1023
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,000
then someone in the house is going to die.

1024
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,560
That's true.

1025
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,680
Shh, look at the front of the bed.

1026
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,520
Shh, look at the front of the bed.

1027
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,800
It's a boy sagging his pants.

1028
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,760
When I sag, I just go commando.

1029
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,400
Okay.

1030
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,680
Which is not a thing.

1031
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,640
So you just have your balls out.

1032
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,840
I have my butt and half of one ball out.

1033
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,160
And it's not a popular thing at the mall to do.

1034
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,120
No.

1035
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,400
What I do is I sag my pants and then I have another pair of pants underneath and it looks

1036
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,600
like my pants are molting.

1037
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,160
Shitting.

1038
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,000
And sometimes you wear snakeskin pants which really heightens the effect.

1039
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,880
Mm hmm.

1040
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,400
I think the best time I ever saw a boy sagging his pants was when I was watching Three Stooges.

1041
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,400
And this in the movie.

1042
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,000
Are you talking about Larry or Moe or Curly?

1043
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,040
In the hit film.

1044
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,720
In the hit film, they see someone, Larry or Moe, Curly, see someone's pants sagging as

1045
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,080
an African-American gentleman.

1046
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,440
And he says, Hey, buddy, let me help you.

1047
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,200
Your pants are falling down.

1048
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,640
And then he pulls them up.

1049
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:43,120
And I thought, it's 2012.

1050
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,000
You also thought this is the most racist thing I've ever heard.

1051
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,120
This is really crazy.

1052
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:47,840
This is really wild.

1053
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,560
You also thought, why can't I stop masturbating?

1054
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,720
I also thought, why is it 2013 and I'm watching this movie for a second time?

1055
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,560
That is another thing I thought last Saturday.

1056
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,800
One of the other thoughts I had.

1057
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,560
And then I thought, this joke is still pretty racist and not a joke really so much.

1058
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:09,600
So the only thing that happens, and if we may tangent into this, in the movie, the joke.

1059
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,160
A tangent?

1060
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,760
Okay, a logical step.

1061
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:21,920
The joke is just referencing that the young man is sagging his pants and Moe doesn't realize

1062
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,240
that it's been a cultural thing for like 30 years.

1063
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,200
Right.

1064
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,320
Attempts to pull them up.

1065
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,080
That's the punchline?

1066
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,320
Yeah.

1067
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,520
Cool.

1068
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:37,120
Is it possible for us to continue this bit without sounding like the script of Old Dogs?

1069
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,280
Is it possible for us to get out of this episode without sounding like three Tim Allens?

1070
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,400
Travis, are there any other bits in Three Stooges you'd like me to clear up for you?

1071
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,920
I still haven't seen the movie.

1072
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,760
So it's like hearing tales from a foreign land.

1073
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,400
You still haven't seen Three Stooges?

1074
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,520
It is on my bucket list.

1075
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,440
Didn't you want to get ready for the Oscars?

1076
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,440
The best sound mixing I think was on there.

1077
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,160
Yeah.

1078
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,960
Best yucking?

1079
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,480
Oh, God.

1080
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,200
Did you guys think the In Memoriam was lame?

1081
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,280
I think the In Memoriam was kind of lame this year.

1082
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,000
You guys think so?

1083
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,840
I don't know who died.

1084
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,360
Not a lot of like good people died.

1085
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,280
A lot of Beast Trainers.

1086
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,240
A lot of Beast Trainers.

1087
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
A lot of cinematographers, a lot of...

1088
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,560
Yeah.

1089
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,920
Do we all disagree to make a commitment to have more awesome people die this year?

1090
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,720
Just can we get some good people to die this year?

1091
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,680
Listen, I'm not saying anything wink nudge,

1092
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,440
but I'm just saying I'd like a really blockbuster In Memoriam this year.

1093
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,080
I mean, we could talk to them about adding people that haven't died yet.

1094
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,560
Uh-huh.

1095
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,200
How fucking crazy would that be?

1096
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,760
Fucking Mickey Rourke up on the screen like in the audience.

1097
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,320
And then cut to Mickey Rourke going, what?

1098
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:48,880
No.

1099
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,760
No, I'm here.

1100
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,480
Can't you see me?

1101
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,280
Can't anyone see me?

1102
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,240
The whole night's about trying to convince Mickey Rourke that he's a ghost.

1103
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,240
I'd watch those Oscars.

1104
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,320
What's happening to me?

1105
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,720
And then like the only person that can see him is Bruce Willis,

1106
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,240
and he just shits his pants.

1107
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,000
By the end of the night, James Cameron's like,

1108
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,560
thank you for this Oscar for Avatar 2.

1109
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,480
He's jumping up and down behind him, waving his hands.

1110
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,400
Please, someone, if you can see me, call somebody.

1111
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,840
I'm not ready to go.

1112
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,120
I'm not ready to go yet.

1113
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,560
I have so much left to do.

1114
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,200
At least turn me into a snowman like in Jack Frost.

1115
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,920
I need to tell my son I love him.

1116
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,720
I need to tell my son I love him.

1117
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,680
Like the documentary Jack Frost that I saw.

1118
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,360
Please, if anyone knows a voodoo priestess, please.

1119
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,040
I promise to be a good Jack Frost, like the killer kind,

1120
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,280
the killer one Jack Frost movie.

1121
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,040
Snowman, killer, good snowman.

1122
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,600
I'm done.

1123
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,640
I quit.

1124
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,760
I gotta go back to work, guys.

1125
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,880
I'm done with this podcast.

1126
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,160
Okay.

1127
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,360
This has been My Brother, My Brother.

1128
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,960
Made it to the advice show for the modern era where we do it.

1129
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,440
You heard it.

1130
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,160
You know we do.

1131
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,160
You know how we do.

1132
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:04,960
You know how we do.

1133
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,360
Thank you for everybody tweeting about the show.

1134
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,520
Unless you tweeted to ask where the show was today,

1135
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,040
because that really gets on my nerves.

1136
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,640
I'm glad you like it, but come on.

1137
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,000
Hey, dog, you can't rush perfection.

1138
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,960
Can't rush it.

1139
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,840
For real, though, I've had a real bad poopy bug.

1140
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,200
Griffin has had, for real, my butt.

1141
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,560
Griffin's butt fell off.

1142
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,800
I've had the worst poopy butt like for a week now,

1143
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,000
and it was pretty touch and go there for a while.

1144
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:37,600
You were about to say that.

1145
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,960
By which he would touch something and then he would go in his face.

1146
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,000
Anytime my physical form touched anything.

1147
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,760
I had to be suspended in the air.

1148
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,240
Thank you to everybody tweeting about the show.

1149
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,520
Thank you to Rachel.

1150
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,280
That's Bransonatron.

1151
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,240
Elliot Binder.

1152
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,200
Chris Daly.

1153
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,080
Beven Blocker.

1154
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,720
Mark Brown.

1155
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,520
Adam Ford.

1156
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,240
Anders Clem.

1157
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,680
Jordan Dahl.

1158
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,920
Prince Cabbagehead.

1159
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,040
Danielle Farless.

1160
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,400
Joel Kelly.

1161
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,240
Complicated Wasp.

1162
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:08,180
Hepzy.

1163
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:10,880
So many people tweeting about the show.

1164
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,200
Thank you.

1165
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,800
Make sure if you tweet about it,

1166
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,440
you use the hashtag MBMBAM and you include our sample link.

1167
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,760
It's bit.ly forward slash.

1168
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:22,720
It's my bim bam.

1169
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,720
I want to say thank you to Jonathan Barnes,

1170
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:32,160
a friend of ours who works at Cosi and took me and Riley and Sydney

1171
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
on a sort of behind the scenes tour.

1172
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,840
Oh, that's so awesome.

1173
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,400
I know.

1174
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,280
It was so much fun.

1175
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,960
We got to do a show there sometime soon.

1176
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:39,440
I know, right?

1177
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:39,940
Columbus.

1178
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,520
So thank you to him.

1179
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,120
And and thank you to everybody sharing the show

1180
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,960
and getting other people interested.

1181
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,200
And be sure to check out all the other shows on Max Fun.

1182
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,120
At this point, you know all of them

1183
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,120
because I assume all of you are listening.

1184
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,520
But go to maximumfun.org and check it out.

1185
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,920
And while you're there, get the information on boatparty.biz.

1186
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,040
Jesus fucking Max Fun cruise.

1187
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,200
Drink it in.

1188
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,160
It's it's bananas.

1189
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,880
This cruise.

1190
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:10,640
It's going to be crazy.

1191
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,840
The Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

1192
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,640
Get there.

1193
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,560
I'm thinking about going because I just got over poopy butt.

1194
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,760
So I can't get it.

1195
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,520
I can't get the norovirus again.

1196
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,640
And the good thing is, since Mark McGrath canceled his cruise,

1197
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,520
they've just added Jen Blossoms and spin doctors to the Max Fun cruise.

1198
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,000
So it should be pretty fun.

1199
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,200
Did Mark McGrath cancel his cruise because he knew that people being on a boat

1200
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:43,120
and listening to Sugar Ray was like a diarrhea cocktail?

1201
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,000
He actually said, his direct quote was,

1202
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,240
the poop cruise did us no favors.

1203
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,760
Which is great because I bet the poop cruise would be like,

1204
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,400
the Sugar Ray cruise did nothing for us.

1205
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,280
Anyway, thanks.

1206
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,400
Griffin, you got a special thanks to John Roger Gright.

1207
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,680
That's usually what you say now.

1208
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,080
You usually say something about thanks to the Long Winters

1209
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,360
for letting us use their song as a departure from putting the days to bed.

1210
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,000
Go ahead.

1211
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,500
Do it.

1212
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,040
But you just did all of it.

1213
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,760
Was that the bit?

1214
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:16,260
Oh.

1215
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,040
So thank you for listening to our show.

1216
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,800
Make sure to join us again next Monday.

1217
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,920
Oh, if you want to have a shout out on the show,

1218
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:25,600
if it's like somebody's birthday,

1219
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,320
or if you just want to say congratulations to someone,

1220
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,400
or if you have a small business, or I guess a big business.

1221
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,560
I mean, we're not going to discriminate.

1222

just go to maximumfund.org forward slash Jumbotron.

1224
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,760
Get there.

1225
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,800
Griffin, take us out.

1226
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,800
I am ready.

1227
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,840

It's by Yahoo Answers user Catherine, who asks,

1230
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,880
opinions on the name pretzel for a girl?

1231
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,840
I'm Justin McElroy.

1232
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,960
I'm Travis McElroy.

1233
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:03,920
I'm pretzel.

1234
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,400
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1235
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,440
He's your dad.

1236
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:33,360
Square on the lips.
