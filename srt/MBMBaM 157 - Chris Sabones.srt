1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello, everyone. Welcome to my brother and my brother and me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,680
era. Before we get into the advice this week, just want to give a huge welcome, a welcome aboard

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,520
to the new official house chef for my brother and my brother and me productions,

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:12,880
my bim-bim prod, Ms. Paula Dean, Bella of the South. God, guys, these craft services are,

9
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,520
they're just, they're hard to get through. They require- This Krispy Kreme lasagna is delicious.

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,040
There's a lot of chewing, a lot of crunching, a lot of snapping and smacking of the jaws and gums.

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,720
A carnival of textures. Now, I know what you're wondering, friends at home. Paula Dean,

12
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,840
she's a bigot. Wait, that's exactly right. She is. You are correct. You are correct about that.

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Although, you know, all she did was use a couple, what are words? Think about it. We give words

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
their power, you know what I mean? We give words their power, and for us, the words have given us

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,800
the power to get Paula Dean at an extreme discount. It's, we're talking about extreme

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:07,440
restraints, coupon code, sexabunga levels of cheapness. Just really a great value. It's sort

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,320
of a house strategy here, my brother, my brother and me. We employ famous racists. That's kind of

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:26,480
our thing, because once they're outed as really racist, see, we're all white, so it's not as much

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,440
of a thing where we're afraid they're going to malign us. Right, because we know we can get away

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,600
with it ultimately because of our obscene privilege. Exactly. So with our straight white

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,480
male privilege and ability to suss out bargains, we can get deeply discounted racists. I mean,

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,360
we got Paula Dean for a song. I mean, she's fantastic. She's cooking up a storm. That song

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,400
was written by Lynyrd Skynyrd too, because she is holy shit sexual. That song was Song of the South,

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,360
was the one that we got her for. Can you guys think of any other, I'm trying to think who else

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:11,040
on staff we picked up for being really. Well, we got Mel Gibson. Oh, wow. That was a huge steal.

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,440
He was a, and as my suggestion to you, if you need security for an event or let's say a live

27
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,000
podcast, I highly recommend Mel. I mean, you can't have him now. He's ours. He does terrific,

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,200
terrific work. It's not so much that he is physically imposing, but yes. Although I don't

29
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,880
know, he's kind of, I want to say disintegrated a little bit since the beaver. Maybe he's not

30
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:45,040
quite as burly as he once was in a, say a science, but man, he is just, nobody wants to be around him.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Like nobody wants to sort of even enter his field of view. So like he's a very effective

32
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:59,920
bouncer and security man in that sense. We've also had great success with Michael Richards.

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
Not only keeps us in stitches, but keeps our laundry looking really, really clean. He does

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,880
some punch up. And then when we don't need the punch up, which is never, he'll, you know,

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,840
he'll clean off the mics for us. He'll get, he'll, he'll change the spit filters. Is that a thing in

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,280
a mic? Ironically, you know, the only problem I've had with him doing our laundry, what's that? He's

37
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,560
not so hot at separating the whites, which is surprising to me. You would think that that would

38
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,920
be a strong thing for him. That would be a thing. This is shocking. What was it? What was the shit

39
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,960
he said? What was it? I promised myself I'd never forget the shit he said right after he said that

40
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,960
shitty shit on the stage. And then he, he like tried to like play it off. Like it's words of

41
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,520
power. These are, these are the things that we say like dog, you need to fucking, you know,

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,040
you have finished, you have, you have completed. That's where you just go, well, I'm done. Bye,

43
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:04,320
everybody. We also got Garrison Keillor, which is weird, not a racist, but I don't think his agent

44
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,440
knew that. So it worked out pretty well for us. We got him at racist rates. Let's just put it that

45
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,640
way. We've been trying to get him to say some racist stuff. Nothing. He just won't do it. Huh?

46
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:22,000
No, wait, no, not right now. No dog. No, I don't need a massage right now. Dog the Bounty Hunter.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,960
Thank you. Is Dog the Bounty Hunter not? Yeah. Dog the Bounty Hunter, uh, uh, racist, but big hands.

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,240
Yeah. Strong hands. Great for a massage whenever you need him. Is this our most slanderous intro

49
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,560
ever? Uh, everything we've said has been a joke. Parody, fair use, less than a minute.

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,680
Garrison Keillor is a huge racist. Garrison Keillor hates people of any color, any color.

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,800
Discriminate with his hate. If they're not translucent, if they're not ghosts, Garrison

52
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,560
Keillor is, is just not interested in communing with them. Uh, by the way, I'm Justin McElroy and

53
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,480
I'm your oldest brother. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm your middlest brother. I'm Griffin McElroy. I'm

54
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,920
your, I'm your sweet baby brother. Uh, this is our Revice Show where we help people and not just

55
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,640
disadvantaged racists, uh, former celebrity racists. Well, okay. Former celebrity current racists. It's

56
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,800
kind of a co-op of, of current celebrity racists. Uh, we got a little bit of everybody here, uh,

57
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,960
but, but let's, let's start to help people or else our entire support system is for naught and

58
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,080
how else are we going to, uh, keep them in the lifestyles which they become accustomed?

59
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,880
The hate, the hateful lifestyle. The hateful lifestyle. I love my job. However, it is an

60
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,400
unusual occupation. I'm a seamstress for a company that makes costumes and accessories for anime fans,

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,680
furries, and bronies. And yes, Griffin, we make Pokemon costumes. I don't know why you need,

62
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
like, why- My problem is that- Why you putting Griffin on blast? My problem is that during a

63
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,920
small talk with strangers, no, sorry, my problem is during small talk with strangers, not a small

64
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,120
talk with strangers, uh, people always ask what you do, which causes all sorts of problems. Some

65
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,640
people assume I'm into these things, which I'm not, or it results in me answering tons of questions,

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,600
usually the same. What should I do, brothers? Uh, should I just lie about my job or is there

67
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,600
a quick sentence that can explain my job without the assumptions or repetitive questions that's

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,160
from Gmail? There's no shame in lying about you. I lie about my job all the goddamn time.

69
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,400
Yeah, me too. If you're over 60, you do not know what I do. Nope. I am a special interest. I am

70
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,600
a pop culture journalist. If you, if that, seriously, I've dropped that on them. Um,

71
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,280
I write about electronics. That's that lends itself to, again, I'm not ashamed of my job

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,800
if you're not my people. I've had the, I've had the lie trying to explain what a podcast is to

73
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,080
people. And it always ends up just being like, I'm on an internet radio show and that's about it.

74
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
Right. Cause if you don't have to, if you don't have to explain what a podcast is,

75
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,000
then people already know who you are. Yes. My job is easier to explain when I don't talk about what

76
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
I actually do, which is I'm the managing editor of a video game website. That's not like management

77
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,480
is not actually that hard for people to comprehend. But I usually just say that I review video games

78
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,880
because a that's more glamorous and be easier to explain. Uh, but when some people don't even

79
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,720
comprehend that, so I end up saying, uh, well, you know how like Roger Ebert did for movies?

80
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Oh no. I do that for video games. And then I realized one day I said that I was like,

81
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,120
wait a minute. Is that's right. I'm the Roger Ebert of video games.

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,760
But I feel like every games writer does that. So every games writer is the Roger Ebert of

83
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,440
video games. There's, there's a point of diminishing returns on that analogy.

84
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
Imagine trying to explain that you don't write reviews. You write news and people are like,

85
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,440
I don't, why, how can there be news about this thing? I don't give a fuck about.

86
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,800
Right. There is trust us. There's lots. There's so much.

87
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,840
How, what about this? What about you just stare them dead in the eye and say, I enable fantasy.

88
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:06,080
Ooh, I am a dream maker. I enable dreams to come birthed from the dreamscape to corporeal.

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,480
I am the modern day. I am the modern day Geppetto. I'm a Geppetto bringing your fantasies to life.

90
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,960
And then this is essential. Do not expound. In fact, don't speak anymore. If you can speak,

91
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,120
don't leave the room. Don't exit the conversation. Just do not respond.

92
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,360
If you can pull a fushigi ball out of your pocket and start twirling it around like in labyrinth

93
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
and talk about how you make fantasies come true. If you can just be dressed up like Jareth.

94
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,480
No one will talk to you. That'll be good.

95
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
Yeah. And also you won't have to explain what your job is because people will just be like,

96
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
oh, he's a, he's a troll king.

97
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
A costumer. People understand that.

98
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah. A costume seamstress or you make, you make costumes for people. Do you really need to go

99
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,240
into the individual? Like when someone asks me what I do, I say that, you know, I'm a theater

100
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,320
technician and then I don't go on to explain what I build.

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Yeah. You don't have to say that you like take regular dog costumes and you sew dicks onto them.

102
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
You don't have to mention.

103
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,360
Oh, that was hateful. Not all of the furry culture is about sex. I'm sorry.

104
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,240
I can't believe I fell into that pitfall so quickly.

105
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,160
We've gotten so much better over the years.

106
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,080
I know I have gotten so much better. And I honestly, I understand that community.

107
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,400
It was a closed minded statement and I apologize.

108
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,600
And to that community, that was a joke. It was a loving joke that we were laughing at with you.

109
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
So join in.

110
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,520
I don't think they're laughing. I don't think they're laughing. We're laughing with someone,

111
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,520
but it's, I don't think it's them. And I think I fucked up.

112
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,800
Can we say that they take anime costumes and sew dicks onto them?

113
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,920
Well, every costume should have a dick on it somewhere.

114
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,320
Right.

115
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
Otherwise, why are you making a costume?

116
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
This is a beautiful My Little Pony costume. Could I get a dick on it?

117
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
Can you just slip a dick in there?

118
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,840
Just wherever. Yeah. It doesn't have to be anatomically correct. Just

119
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,480
under the armpit is fine. Just put a dick on there.

120
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Let's get off the dick.

121
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,880
Done.

122
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,480
I can totally understand where this person is coming from. And I would honestly,

123
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,000
I think if you just say, I am a costumer, people will sort of get where you're coming from and

124
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,080
they will think that it's fun. You do not have to go into the specificity of what type of Pokemon

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:22,880
costumes you do sell. But if you have Vulpix, hit me up. My number is 512-5528. Vulpix. It's 512

126
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,200
Vulpix. And then just get me back to that. I'm not interested in Ninetales.

127
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,080
Or you can email him at Vulpix or it didn't happen at gpale.com.

128
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Right.

129
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
Sorry, Travis. Did you say gpale?

130
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,120
I did.

131
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,400
That's true. That's where you send me-

132
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
I was enjoying my joke so much.

133
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,240
You send me pictures of real human beings in Vulpix costumes,

134
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,040
and then I put them in the gpale, which is to say the garbage pail.

135
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,080
I will file it right there. Thank you. No, I'm just kidding. Hit me up with the price.

136
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,440
Gpale's priority taken.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,240
Gervin, how about a Yahoo answer?

138
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,800
I can do a Yahoo answer.

139
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,480
Yahoo answer servers.

140
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
We got a lot in this week. Thank you to everybody who sent this in.

141
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
This one was sent in by Daniel Geller. It's by Yahoo answer's user,

142
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,640
Economics Dickey, who asks,

143
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,480
what does an average American look like?

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,400
What does an average American look like?

145
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,640
That was the headline in the body.

146
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,000
Paula Deen, do you want to take this?

147
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,120
She just says, why?

148
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,520
Fat.

149
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,800
Oh, Paula.

150
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,880
We got to be careful here because we do not want to come off as

151
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:43,680
as either racial, gender, hetero, age normative in any way.

152
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
There's got to be a way to thread this needle without-

153
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,840
Oh, God bless.

154
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,280
There's got to be some amount of-

155
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,800
What does an average American look like?

156
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,440
Delicacy.

157
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,600
I think we can say big.

158
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,560
I think we can say, we don't have to say fat, but big.

159
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
There's a lot to the average American.

160
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,560
Confident in, nope.

161
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,840
You say confident.

162
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,320
I feel that, but it's not really a physical attribute,

163
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,400
unless it's the way that they're carrying themselves, their posture.

164
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,240
You look at someone, you look at their deportment,

165
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,840
and you say, well, that's a confident somebody.

166
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,560
You look at their what?

167
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
Their deportment, how they carry themselves.

168
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,200
I don't understand why you want to deport all the Americans.

169
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,760
You know what?

170
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,120
One thing I've found is that my view of what the average American looks like

171
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
has been extremely skewed by where I live,

172
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
which is in West Virginia, where people are more rotund as a rule.

173
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,600
I am a gentleman of some heft myself,

174
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,520
but I am trying to shed those LBs, first off, number one.

175
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,440
Number two, I'm not, for here, I'm pretty good.

176
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah, you're doing great.

177
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
For where I live, I'm pretty good.

178
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
And it's funny when I go to a place like LA and I'll walk into a building,

179
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,840
I think, oh, man, I'm the fast person in here.

180
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,200
And you can actually rate my physical attractiveness

181
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,000
as I'm flying cross country.

182
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,840
As I'm coming back to Huntington, West Virginia,

183
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm getting more and more attractive.

184
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,240
As the plane capacity diminishes, I'm actually getting stubby.

185
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,080
I think it's when they open the doors and there's a decompression.

186
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,160
Because you've still got the LA air.

187
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,640
Right, when the plane gets full of West Virginia air,

188
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,080
it's like you go like three notches up the hotter not scale.

189
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,480
Yeah, it's like when Superman, you know,

190
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
the difference between the yellow sun and the red sun.

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
That's right.

192
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,520
That's right.

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,640
Only the yellow sun, in this case, is a Jolly Pirate donut.

194
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,080
You know, we lost one of the, we lost one of the,

195
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,800
we're down to one Jolly Pirate donut.

196
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,360
Oh, dang.

197
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,480
Which one did we lose?

198
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,080
We lost the one on First Street near Kroger and-

199
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,400
That was the one I always went to.

200
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,080
So wait, so we only have the one on Route 60?

201
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
Yeah, so we only have the one on Route 60,

202
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,000
which perplexingly sells donuts and heroes.

203
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,480
Not heroes, heroes.

204
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,800
I don't know why they've-

205
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Well, it's the Alex Andropoulos family that runs the joint.

206
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
No, that would make sense.

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,880
So this is just a cry for help to all of our listeners.

208
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,280
If you drive through Huntington, West Virginia,

209
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,520
please stop at the Route 60 Jolly Pirate donuts.

210
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,640
Let's keep the hope alive.

211
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,840
Just keep the lights on.

212
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,240
The donuts are, the box that they come in

213
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,520
looks like a treasure chest.

214
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,760
Right, and that's the most exciting thing to see,

215
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,520
like you wake up and it's Sunday morning,

216
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,200
you're like, oh, church.

217
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,960
And then you go downstairs and it's like,

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,160
a fucking bounty, a royal bounty for you.

219
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,440
Maybe a pirate brought it here.

220
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,000
Nope, it's your dad.

221
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,400
Trainers from the East Indies have brought

222
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,480
a collection of the finest donuts.

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,080
I love Travis's elephant hunter, old timey elephant hunter voice.

224
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,760
What are some of the,

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,880
what are some of the people volunteer there, Griffin?

226
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,720
Some pretty-

227
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
Hold on, wait, before you answer that,

228
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,600
I do want to tell you everyone that gpale.com

229
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
goes to iggypop.com.

230
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,920
So I don't know if that's a nickname of his,

231
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,520
but if not, it is now.

232
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,280
Is it like spelled G-E-E-P-A-L-E?

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,200
Like, gee, that dude is very pale,

234
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,000
because that is a description true of Iggy Pop.

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
Yeah, there's a lot of xenophobic shit up this Yahoo.

236
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,840
Not on the internet.

237
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
They look almost nothing at all

238
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,600
like you see on television or in their films.

239
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Almost all white Americans have huge big eyes,

240
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
flat wide noses, very wide mouths,

241
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
square jaws, and are all teeth.

242
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:38,900
What?

243
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,880
Well, Americans' bodies are composed entirely of teeth.

244
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,560
Most white American guys have their crew or buzz cut hair

245
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,320
or the Martin Sheen haircut.

246
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
What the fuck does that even mean?

247
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,880
What is a Martin Sheen haircut?

248
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,320
Give me a Martin Sheen.

249
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
And wear clothes two to three size bigger

250
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,440
to their body size with tennis shoes and white socks.

251
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,760
Most white American women look like Cass Elliot

252
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,080
or are very thin 70s Marcia Brady plain looking

253
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,680
with long hair and Brooke Shields eyebrows.

254
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,440
Man, this guy's painting a fucking picture.

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
They all wear tight jeans, ski pants, or shorts

256
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,720
with oversized t-shirts and flat shoes.

257
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,640
Both genders always dress up only on Sundays

258
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,400
in the 60s looking clothing.

259
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,240
Is this an alien writing this?

260
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,720
Is this our entry in the entire sky of the galaxy?

261
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,760
That's messed up.

262
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
Who wrote this?

263
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
This is the most detailed answer.

264
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,880
Some of them get like light tan skin,

265
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
five nine chubby and just okay looking.

266
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,560
Like, all right, that actually,

267
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,960
that guy's kind of got a number.

268
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,840
Are they outside my house and a asshole?

269
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,920
I'm five eight, so nice try.

270
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,800
Girls, tight jeans or sweat pants and a sweatshirt

271
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,200
or a brand name t-shirt like Abercrombie,

272
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,360
American Eagle, Hollister, or Arrow.

273
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,680
Guys, oversized jeans and brand name t-shirt.

274
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,200
That's what I see every day anyway.

275
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Brands.

276
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,640
Brands all around.

277
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm a McDonald's.

278
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,420
What?

279
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,160
What does that mean?

280
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,080
I like generic t-shirts.

281
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,600
I only buy my t-shirts at Piggly Wiggly or Kroger.

282
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,280
I actually own a Piggly Wiggly t-shirt

283
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
and some Radio Shack pants.

284
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,560
They got lots of pockets in which I store 19 batteries.

285
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,040
You need a battery?

286
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,760
Need a battery?

287
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,240
What do you got?

288
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,800
A Game Gear?

289
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
I don't know if I got six double A's.

290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,600
Just kidding.

291
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,880
Of course I do.

292
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,840
I absolutely do.

293
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
Let me get down in my Game Gear pocket.

294
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,280
I want to help somebody else.

295
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
I've recently been drafted by a group of friends

296
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
into a fantasy football league which is a sport

297
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,560
I have effectively zero interest in

298
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
and an activity I don't understand

299
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
and therefore fear deeply.

300
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,360
Is there any way to take part in this league

301
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,600
and not embarrass myself while at the same time

302
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
avoiding actually learning anything about football

303
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,160
in the process?

304
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,520
That's from Sam from Lakewood.

305
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,920
Why did you agree to do this?

306
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,200
This fucking guy.

307
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
How can I get better at this thing without trying?

308
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
And also I didn't want to do it anyway

309
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
but I'm doing it.

310
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,960
Did you like literally get drafted?

311
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,120
Like your number was up and it was like

312
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,920
Sam you're in.

313
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,240
What?

314
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:08,640
No.

315
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,440
No.

316
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,560
Guys you gotta help me.

317
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm 1A in the football draft.

318
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
What you gotta do is you gotta chop your finger off

319
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,040
and that's the only way to get out of the draft.

320
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,320
Yeah it's like I tried to hit the

321
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
let me hit the space bar on my keyboard.

322
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,440
No can do.

323
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,280
Sorry guys.

324
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
I mean I'm in a fancy football league

325
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,640
and I don't know anything about football.

326
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,520
It hadn't slowed me down.

327
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
I mean it slowed me down from doing well in the league.

328
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
Yeah I mean I'm pretty sure I came in dead last place

329
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,560
because I kept forgetting to set my team for the week

330
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,200
but that's not because I don't give a shit.

331
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,160
It's just I'm very busy.

332
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,480
I think the most the nice thing is like

333
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,240
depending on what service you're using

334
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
most of them say like

335
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
Who is the best one?

336
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,640
Who's the best one.

337
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,360
You can usually just ask your computer aloud

338
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,360
who is the best one and you can do a lot that way.

339
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,240
There's also like when you're doing the actual draft

340
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,600
you can get a top 200 rankings

341
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,000
and once you've just sort of gone down that list

342
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,960
once you've extended past that list

343
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
at that point it's just guessing.

344
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
It's just it is just

345
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,160
who's gonna be who's gonna be good this year?

346
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,080
Can you get to the fucking ball fields

347
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
and like check these dudes out?

348
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm here I figured out the solution.

349
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,200
One word three syllables.

350
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,760
Okay.

351
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,320
Moneyball.

352
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,080
You're talking about saver metrics now.

353
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,600
Okay I like this.

354
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,760
You need to watch the movie Moneyball.

355
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Okay you haven't seen it

356
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,520
so we can't make this advice any more applicable.

357
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,120
And then you need to hire Jonah Hill.

358
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,040
I watched.

359
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,080
Run your team for you.

360
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,600
The problem is I watched Moneyball

361
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
and the math of Moneyball

362
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,880
is all based on fucking points on the board

363
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
and like that works for Moneyball

364
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
but for fantasy football

365
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
it's like you don't want a nose tackle

366
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
that is going to get a lot of touchdown scores

367
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,800
because it's the points.

368
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,000
He's gonna put the points up.

369
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
He is but I think it's actually negative.

370
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
I think it's negative.

371
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,360
There's still some life left in him.

372
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
It's negative points if your if your defense

373
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,040
gets uppity and decides to start scoring touchdowns.

374
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,840
It's like guys you have a very specific job.

375
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,280
We don't need you showboating

376
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,040
and and taking it to the taking it to the red zone.

377
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,280
But you could do you all see that in sports movies though

378
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,640
where it's like we need a kicker

379
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,480
and then they like bring in the dude who's like

380
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,920
you know he's he's just been the worst tackle all his life

381
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
and then he turns out to be an amazing kicker.

382
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,720
Sure why don't you in your fantasy football draft

383
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,160
maybe draft some people in

384
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,760
that aren't in the positions that's fun.

385
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,200
So for your lead quarterback for your lead quarterback

386
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
you went ahead and you picked the coach of the team

387
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
which is interesting.

388
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
I don't know how you hacked the website in order to do that.

389
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
Your offensive line is the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders

390
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,440
which is in or that's an interesting strategy.

391
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Moneyball money.

392
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,560
You did money ball though so I guess I got any points

393
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,680
for points or do zero of them specific Randy Moss.

394
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,160
All right that's your insider Justin with a hot tip.

395
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,160
You got to get to the you got to get to the pitch

396
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,480
and you got to scope these dudes out.

397
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
You got to here's here's an important lesson I learned

398
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,880
when nearly all of my players were injured simultaneously

399
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
is you got to scope out these dudes injurability

400
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,520
because if you can make it to the end without anybody

401
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,960
fucking dying or murdering somebody

402
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,800
then you have picked a damn good team.

403
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
Look at their bones ask about their bones.

404
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,640
How do your bones feel Jermichael?

405
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,680
Jermichael can I inquire about your bones?

406
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,600
Mr. Friendly tell me about your bones.

407
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,080
Specifically your leg bones because man I need those good.

408
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,600
Your holding bones would be ideal.

409
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,520
If your ball holding bones.

410
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,760
Which arm do you use to just sort of tuck that ball in?

411
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,480
Your right one?

412
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,680
Let me check out that right tip.

413
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,000
Looking pretty good Jermichael.

414
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,120
Drink this milk.

415
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,840
Special milk.

416
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,880
It's got ball bearings in it.

417
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
It's going to lubricate you.

418
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,080
You got to get out of this league Sam.

419
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,680
Sam you got to get out of this league.

420
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,440
No matter how hard you work at this

421
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,240
you're going to come up against a wall of disinterest from you.

422
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,280
I'm yourself.

423
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,320
Here's how you get out of it.

424
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,080
First meeting right show up to the draft wearing a wizard's robe

425
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,440
and carrying a sword and say I'm ready for the fantasy.

426
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,840
Right and then they're going to ask you to leave.

427
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,560
Yeah.

428
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,120
Say you were prepared by your fantasy seamstress

429
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
and now you're ready to fucking rock it to Russia.

430
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:37,440
You could also try to make it seem like you know too much about football

431
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,520
to be in the league.

432
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,640
Here's how I'd recommend doing that.

433
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,280
Go in and ask your buddy so do you draft an entire team defense

434
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,120
or do you draft individual defensive players?

435
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,120
And then when they answer that then you tell them that you've done that before

436
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,280
and it's beneath you.

437
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,480
You can't do that again.

438
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,880
Right.

439
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,480
And then it'll make it seem like you love football and you love drafts.

440
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,960
You just don't love this football.

441
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,240
And then when you draft the worst team ever drafted in fantasy football history

442
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,960
that illusion will be so mysterious to them

443
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,040
because they'll be like damn I thought Jeff knew shit.

444
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,680
I thought Jeff knew the shit about this.

445
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,480
But you could play that out like with every pick you make.

446
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,720
If it's really bad just act like you're way more plugged in.

447
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
You wrote down Chris Sabo.

448
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,280
What the fuck are you-

449
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,720
Shh shh shh shh.

450
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,920
Got some insider tips.

451
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,280
Just put your finger beside your nose and wink.

452
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,720
I checked out Sabo's bones.

453
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,040
That dude's collar bones are fucking tight.

454
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,360
I checked out his Sabo's-

455
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,320
His eyeballs.

456
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,280
His eyeballs, I won't lie, leave a lot to be desired.

457
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,400
Not a lot of glasses allowed on the pitch.

458
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,040
But this guy's collar bones? Disgusting.

459
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,760
He's ripped.

460
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,000
You could-

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,040
You could great Gruyere on this guy's collar bones.

462
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,840
They're amazing.

463
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,680
His Sabo's are indestructible.

464
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
I miss Chris Sabo's.

465
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,920
Me too.

466
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Love that cat.

467
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,960
Here's a quickie.

468
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,240
When you're staying at a friend's house are you allowed to use their shower stuff?

469
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
That's from Sneaky Shower Sampler.

470
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,200
My answer is 100% yes.

471
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,760
Yeah, definitely.

472
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,160
They should have put that stuff in our lock and key.

473
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,680
You walk into a friend's hotel and they've-

474
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,960
Oh, they've set out some nice little sampler sized shampoos here.

475
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,800
Sometimes I'll try both the soaps in there.

476
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,560
You need to keep your scalp-

477
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,520
Showing my armpits.

478
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,520
You gotta keep your scalp away from them though.

479
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,800
You gotta keep-

480
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,360
You gotta make-

481
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,960
Because it's an assumed thing, but it can lead to some sticky situations.

482
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,240
His wife turns the corner into the kitchen and gets that whiff,

483
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,960
that familiar Old Spice whiff and is like,

484
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,680
hey honey, I'm-

485
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,960
But it's you.

486
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,360
She just called you honey.

487
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,280
Now there's some tension in the mix.

488
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
And then they're divorced.

489
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,040
And then they're divorced.

490
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,520
See, I have a quandary about this though, right?

491
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
Does this apply to bar soap?

492
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,040
Okay, the initial reaction is like,

493
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,480
okay, I don't want to rub somebody else's skin on my skin.

494
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,640
Well, skin is a best case scenario when you're talking-

495
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,200
Their butt dirt, okay?

496
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,400
Their butt dirt.

497
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
Their crease.

498
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,880
But here's the thing, we're talking about an object

499
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,120
that is specifically designed to eliminate the danger of butt dirt.

500
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,200
It's not like a magic thing that banishes the dirt.

501
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
And we also need to address, Justin,

502
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,200
are you just taking that bar of soap and just like,

503
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,800
are you directly getting that bar of soap in your butt?

504
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,480
Because we fucking stayed in the same fucking hotel room

505
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,880
in Los Angeles like a week ago.

506
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,320
Because I want to get all my butt dirt out

507
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,200
and be daddy's clean boy.

508
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,400
I'm suddenly the pervert here?

509
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,200
You're not daddy's-

510
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,240
It doesn't make any sense.

511
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
Okay, first of all, I'm pissed off because that first day

512
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,480
you're like, oh yeah, I guess I'll take the first shower.

513
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,280
No big, little did I know you were fucking claiming

514
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,120
that bar of soap so that nobody could ever use it again,

515
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,960
even though I did, because I didn't know you were fucking,

516
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,080
a fucking butt soap enthusiast.

517
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah, please be more specific, Griffin,

518
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,040
about the parts of my anatomy on which you are comfortable

519
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,720
being a secondhand rough-

520
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,440
If it doesn't touch me in a hug, I'm not interested in it.

521
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,800
So you thought that I was washing and showering

522
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,560
and doing my regular shower business,

523
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,120
but leaving my crevices unmolested.

524
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,320
Like maybe using a washcloth like a fucking sane adult.

525
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,160
Hey, fucking Clouseau, did you see a washcloth in the shower?

526
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,280
There were two literally on the shelf right next to it.

527
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,440
Were they used?

528
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,640
No, but I thought maybe there were four and you used two.

529
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,240
I thought there were four and you used two.

530
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,240
You thought I was just doing semaphore.

531
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,520
There, in the shower.

532
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,200
Please send liquid soap, help.

533
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
I don't want my grimy butt dirt to be passed on

534
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,360
to the next generation of McElroy.

535
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
Oh, that bar of soap, they didn't change it too,

536
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,360
because it was the worst hotel ever.

537
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,640
I really want to stop talking about

538
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
your guys' butt dirt exchange.

539
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,760
That makes one of us.

540
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
Let's talk about farm wisdom.

541
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,880
Farm wisdom.

542
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Get a piece of straw.

543
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,080
Here's he-ha farm wisdom.

544
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,280
That was pretty good.

545
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,160
Um, Sam sent us a really lovely picture of a real live baby cow

546
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,040
that he had, that he was with in the picture,

547
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,640
because he was holding a piece of paper

548
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,680
saying NVMB AM, June 2013.

549
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,720
You sure wasn't a chop?

550
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,600
So, it looked pretty real.

551
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,440
I'll post it, I'll post it on Twitter

552
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,040
and everybody can take a peek.

553
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,520
I photoshop myself into a lot of pictures with cows

554
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,160
just to brag.

555
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,000
That's fair.

556
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,120
Show off.

557
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,360
This bit of farm wisdom comes from Elizabeth

558
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,800
and she says, raccoons perceived as mere pests

559
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,960
and trash diggers in urban environments

560
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,680
are stone cold assassins who will murderize your ducks

561
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,640
under the cover of night.

562
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:02,960
Sure.

563
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,840
Their paw prints look exactly like baby hand prints

564
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,240
and supposedly early settlers believed

565
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,920
there were tiny babies walking around

566
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,200
on their hands in the woods.

567
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,880
How the fuck did we win this country?

568
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,040
How the fuck were we the conquerors

569
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,680
when we thought fucking baby, we had baby duck thieves?

570
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,640
Oh, those are those forest babies.

571
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,760
The babies of the woods.

572
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,800
And this next one comes from Fred

573
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
and Fred says his girlfriend's mom

574
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,920
dropped a nugget of farm wisdom on him.

575
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,240
If you see a turtle crossing the road,

576
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,600
it's going to rain.

577
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,360
The more turtles you see in the day,

578
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,240
the worse it rains.

579
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,240
That seems like dog shit to me.

580
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,720
No, I don't want to confuse old wives tales

581
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,160
of farm wisdom, right?

582
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,720
No, I actually looked it up.

583
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,000
I checked it out because I wanted to confirm this

584
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,120
and that really is the thing.

585
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,400
It has to do with like them moving to find water and such

586
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,000
that apparently the more turtles you see,

587
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
the bigger it's going to rain

588
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,560
because they're anticipating it.

589
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,160
How did the turtles-

590
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,440
How did the fucking turtles-

591
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
Are the turtles moving out of where it's not going to rain

592
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,120
towards where the rain's going to happen?

593
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,440
No, now you're getting beyond why not.

594
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Because if so, like that would be a pretty dope scene

595
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
in Twister if they're like,

596
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,320
we got to chase down this fucking deadly F5 funnel cloud,

597
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,600
how are we going to pull this off?

598
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,320
And then Helen Hunt?

599
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,560
Helen Hunt?

600
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,600
I'm not sure.

601
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,360
Helen Hunt or Laura Dern?

602
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,920
Helen Hunt?

603
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,760
It's definitely Helen.

604
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,400
Helen Hunt.

605
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Twister 2 is Laura Dern.

606
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,320
Helen Hunt then in Twister 1.

607
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,640
I guess the scene would work in either film.

608
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,000
Gets out a box of turtles

609
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,440
and then the fucking turtles get sucked up into the cloud,

610
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,600
but the turtles have sensors attached to their backs.

611
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,440
And so Bill Pullman?

612
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,360
Bill Paxton.

613
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,160
Bill Paxton achieves his live stream.

614
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,600
Bill Polkston?

615
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,920
I'm going to edit all that together

616
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,920
and it's going to sound like I'm not having a stroke.

617
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,880
Well, we got to pay for Griffin's stroke bill some way.

618
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,320
So let's go to the Money Zone.

619
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,280
Can we go to the Money Ball?

620
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,320
So basically our only sponsor for the Money Zone this week.

621
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,400
And if you, by the way, would like to be a sponsor,

622
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,920
go to MaximumFun.org forward slash Jumbotron

623
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,200
and you can wish someone happy birthday, happy anniversary,

624
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
put out a personal or commercial message,

625
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,800
anything you want, head over there.

626
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Our one sponsor though we're very happy to have

627
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,000
is an adult Wonderland, really.

628
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
I would call them a super-duper store.

629
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,880
A super-duper store called ExtremeRestraints.com.

630
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,800
They are also merchants of fantasy.

631
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:48,960
That's true.

632
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,000
That's true.

633
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,040
You want to talk about somebody

634
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,400
who maybe has a hard time explaining their job?

635
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,560
How about the guy that has to pack up

636
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,480
the Clitoris Enhancer Clip Pump Kit

637
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,560
for shipping to you at a really great discount?

638
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,040
I can-

639
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,680
Even the import-export business.

640
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,320
You keep listing off different jobs

641
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,480
and I'll tell you what they actually tell their friends and family.

642
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,520
Okay, dildo mold cleaner.

643
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,480
They clean out-

644
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,360
Sculptor.

645
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,000
Sculptors.

646
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,640
Yeah, that works.

647
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,600
The guy who writes slut onto the impressions paddles.

648
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,240
Calligrapher.

649
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
Okay, so you're saying that someone's gonna tell me

650
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,880
that they're a professional calligrapher

651
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,400
and I'm gonna let that convo drop?

652
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,640
Oh, okay.

653
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,520
What do you calligraphize?

654
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,960
Like wedding invitations?

655
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,680
In a manner of speaking, in a manner of speaking,

656
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,320
it is inviting to some-

657
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:40,720
Travis.

658
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,840
To some individuals.

659
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,160
What about the guy who individually tests

660
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
each Rump Shaker vibrating anal plug?

661
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,240
That would be R&D.

662
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
I'm in R&D?

663
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,160
Yeah, research and development.

664
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,640
Thank you.

665
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,560
Who, what about the guy that picks the model

666
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,440
that displays the spider mouth gags?

667
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,480
A talent scout.

668
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,800
Okay, you're pretty good at this.

669
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,280
I'll give it, but if you would like to see

670
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,400
all these different career opportunities,

671
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,920
they're all at ExtremeRestraints.com.

672
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,320
What about the person that tries masturbating

673
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,280
to all the pictures before they can put it up on the web?

674
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,960
Because before they put up a picture on their website,

675
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,760
somebody has to successfully masturbate to that picture.

676
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,040
Focus group.

677
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,080
Damn.

678
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,600
Damn, you're good.

679
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,080
I don't think you can be a professional focus group member,

680
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,280
though, that's not a very-

681
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm a focus group of one.

682
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,160
I get paid in Teddy Grahams.

683
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,440
You can get everything on this website for 20% off.

684
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,480
All you need to do is use a coupon code from us,

685
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,840
and it's Sexabunga, which is spelled just like it sounds.

686
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
But I would not recommend saying it out loud.

687
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,880
Or, yeah, because the fucking prism.

688
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,000
Prism could be listening,

689
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and then they'll fucking leak it to a coupon site.

690
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,160
We can't have that, guys.

691
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
You got to keep this coupon code secret,

692
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,680
but don't keep it so secret that you forget to use it,

693
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,080
and pick yourself up an offer.

694
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,040
And pick yourself up an ostrich tickler.

695
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,160
I don't have-

696
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,000
That was actually the job that I tell people I do.

697
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,880
Hi, I'm Jesse Thorne, the host of NPR's Bullseye.

698
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
And I'm Jordan Morris, another guy.

699
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,520
Jordan and I have been friends for a really long time,

700
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,280
and we co-host the comedy podcast,

701
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,960
Jordan and Jesse Go Together.

702
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,680
Jordan, what would you say Jordan and Jesse goes all about?

703
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,880
Well, it's about funny stories, crazy ideas, swearing.

704
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,160
So basically nothing.

705
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,040
Yeah, nothing.

706
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,360
But we always have fun and funny celebrity guests

707
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,240
from the worlds of comedy, television, music, everything.

708
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,520
I think you're actually gonna like being radio friends with us.

709
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,000
Yeah.

710
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,040
Check out Jordan and Jesse Go online at MaximumFun.org,

711
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,600
or free in iTunes or your favorite podcatcher.

712
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,240
Do you guys know Yahoo?

713
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
Absolutely.

714
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,920
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray.

715
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,360
Are you Ira Ray?

716
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,560
What happened to you?

717
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,600
I'm sorry, I was waiting for the question,

718
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,200
and I wanted to say something funny about it,

719
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,800
and I'm sorry.

720
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,520
You choked.

721
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
You don't even know what the question is yet?

722
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,520
How are you gonna-

723
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,000
Idiot.

724
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,400
Okay.

725
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I was just opening my mind and getting ready.

726
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:06,900
Okay.

727
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
Who wants to know?

728
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user Nigel, who asks,

729
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,400
is it fun to butt chug Diet Pepsi Max?

730
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,280
I was wondering if doing it gets you buzzed faster than normal.

731
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,680
Yeah, what's irritating is I've been having a hard time

732
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,120
finding Pepsi Max lately,

733
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,360
and I guess this is where it's often going.

734
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,600
Because you'd have to do this a lot to get buzzed off it.

735
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,240
When he says buzzed, does he mean like a caffeine booze?

736
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,120
Well, the Max has some, what, like some Guarana,

737
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,800
some justice shit up in, right?

738
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,240
Yeah.

739
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
What is butt chugging?

740
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,640
Butt chugging is, it's when, you know how like you get thirsty

741
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,880
in your mouth and your throat,

742
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,680
and the way you remedy that is to pour liquid down it

743
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,600
and just like send it down the right pipe?

744
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,240
This is the wrong pipe.

745
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,880
This is the wrongest pipe for this particular activity,

746
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,480
but there are certain individuals,

747
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,440
it's like a genetic flaw that like your mouth and throat gets thirsty,

748
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
your butt gets like super, it's called dry butt.

749
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Okay, I've never heard that.

750
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,880
Well, it's because we don't-

751
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,320
That's because you wash your butts.

752
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,120
And in the McElroy kitchen, Punnett Square,

753
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
dry butt doesn't appear anywhere in the mix.

754
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,600
It's not a recessive or a dominant trait,

755
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,760
so we didn't even run the risk of having it,

756
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,560
but there are a lot-

757
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,680
We have the wettest butts.

758
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:36,160
I wouldn't say we have wet butts out loud on a podcast, Travis,

759
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,480
but I would say that they are-

760
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,520
Moist butts?

761
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,800
They are of average-

762
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,800
Moisture.

763
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,840
Moisture, yes.

764
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Okay.

765
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,560
Okay, so this is like a, also teenagers do it to get fucked up

766
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,280
because they're dumb.

767
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Why don't they just put it in their regular holes?

768
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,680
Because when you put it in your butt, it absorbs more efficiently.

769
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:57,920
Yeah.

770
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,880
Does it though?

771
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,600
Yeah.

772
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,520
They've gotta be, I don't believe,

773
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,840
I think that kids are the dumbest things that exist.

774
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,520
Kids between the ages of 10 and 19.

775
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm sorry if you are listening and you fall into that category.

776
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,240
I don't, I think they're the dumbest,

777
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,680
but I don't think that they would butt chug or colon roll

778
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
if it didn't get results.

779
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
But somebody had to do it the first time.

780
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,480
Like there had to be a pioneer who was like,

781
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,600
I've got it, you guys.

782
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,960
A 13 year old was doing it

783
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,360
because they were trying to early pledge for a frat

784
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,320
because the world is fucked and we're all dead.

785
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,240
Children are our future and our future is looking pretty shitty,

786
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,880
if you ask me.

787
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,800
There's a problem that I have with butt chugging.

788
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,680
At just the one?

789
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,360
That you do it.

790
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,520
That's the issue, that it exists.

791
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Is it, I mean, what about the taste?

792
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Don't you miss the taste of alcohol?

793
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,480
Well, you catch some of that with your taste buds.

794
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
I don't think that is accurate.

795
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,440
I think you're starting to lie to me about butt chugging now.

796
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,240
Well, no, cause like when you eat food,

797
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,840
some of your taste buds come off with the food

798
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,360
and they go down in the bolus.

799
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,880
Can I tell you guys something that is so sad to me

800
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,920
is that we have been doing this show for this long

801
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,480
and we have gone to so many depraved corridors of humanity

802
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,320
that when I'm introduced to the concept

803
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,480
and the opportunity to discuss this idea of butt chugging,

804
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,720
it is not even remarkable enough to me

805
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,880
on the landscape of human depravity

806
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,840
that I can come up with anything too useful to say about it.

807
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,480
Yeah, I mean, I guess people do everything.

808
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
We're talking about literal teenagers

809
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,400
literally pouring liquids up their body

810
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,840
and I'm just kind of sleepy.

811
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,440
That's like where I'm at.

812
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,520
I was just thinking about how great it would be

813
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,560
to take a nap right now.

814
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,960
Do you think that's what getting old is

815
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,000
when people are like, why?

816
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,440
I mean, it takes all kinds.

817
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,880
Like they say stuff like that

818
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,160
because they've seen how bad it gets everywhere

819
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,880
with everything that they can't find it

820
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,760
in their hearts to be moved.

821
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,920
Well, yeah, because like, and that's also what death is.

822
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,280
Death is like you see the last thing

823
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,360
and you're like, oh, vagina chewing.

824
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:21,760
I'm out.

825
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm out.

826
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,360
I peaked at vagina eating and now I'm done.

827
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Are we accelerating our own,

828
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,240
like are our deaths gonna approach us quicker

829
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,440
because we've seen and or secondhand experience

830
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,800
like more of the things?

831
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I know because like in the giver,

832
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,520
we need to have children that we pass along.

833
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't wanna give any experiences to

834
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,640
and then we can die.

835
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,920
I would rather inject these kids

836
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,880
and put them down the chute

837
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,240
to continue the giver analogy.

838
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,760
No fucking way.

839
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,840
No fucking way.

840
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,840
My kids can never know about this program.

841
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,160
I am fucking burying everybody's computers in a vault.

842
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,720
Seriously, and yes, Justin, I feel like we are moving,

843
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,520
like we are definitely moving ourselves faster

844
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,280
to the grave with this podcast

845
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,520
because I was shooting for 250 when we started

846
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,160
and now I feel like I'm on death's door

847
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,360
before we even get to 200.

848
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:22,320
Wait, you're saying that you wanted to live to 250 years old.

849
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,320
250 episodes, not years

850
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
because fucking teenagers won't let me get that long.

851
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,040
They're trying to kill me.

852
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,880
I feel like once we do 200 episodes,

853
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,680
that'll be enough.

854
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,080
Yeah.

855
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,080
I mean, like, I feel like we'll have enough of a catalog.

856
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,400
There won't be any more shit that teenagers do

857
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,560
that we haven't talked about.

858
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,960
We'll have to start answering adult questions.

859
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,000
Yeah, children are quite literally our future on this show

860
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,720
and the future is running out.

861
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,680
We're running out of future.

862
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,800
Or we're gonna have to like start going

863
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,240
to fucking Spencer's gifts and doing some polling,

864
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,160
doing some census work on the ground.

865
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,000
Have you heard about anything dirty?

866
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,520
Hey, what do kids do?

867
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,240
Butt checking?

868
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,960
Nah, we did that.

869
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,320
Vagina chewing.

870
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:58,960
Ding, ding, ding.

871
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,880
Griffin joked about it once.

872
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,640
We can't do that one anymore.

873
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,880
We invented that actually accidentally.

874
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,160
We invented vagina chewing.

875
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,520
Kids, please start doing some really messed up things.

876
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,880
Like really depraved.

877
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,240
Yeah, keep us going.

878
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,920
Just keep this show going.

879
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,800
We're running it.

880
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,200
But in no way are we endorsing the horrible things

881
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
you're going to do to your own body.

882
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,320
But do tell us about them.

883
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,280
Do tell.

884
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,480
If it's gonna happen to someone,

885
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,000
you can even abstract the story

886
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
so it happened to a buddy.

887
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,920
A wink.

888
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,720
Um, no, don't do it.

889
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,000
We gotta legally cover ourselves here.

890
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,040
Don't do these things.

891
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,640
Don't do anything.

892
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,400
But do, you know, feel free to listen to this next question.

893
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,680
You've earned yourself that much.

894
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,080
My wife and I recently found out

895
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,360
we're gonna have a second child.

896
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,560
For our first one, we got a name pretty quickly.

897
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,000
And that's worked out pretty well.

898
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,760
But we're stumped on this one.

899
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Any advice on finding that perfect name

900
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,520
that's from Addled in Alabama?

901
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,720
I like the idea of the first name

902
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,560
it worked out pretty well.

903
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,760
Like there's like a shit, like it's a fucking like fluid,

904
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,520
like you name your kid Douglas

905
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,080
and then like the world's most famous mass murderer

906
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,120
is named Douglas.

907
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,640
And then you're like, well, shit.

908
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,280
Dammit.

909
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,960
Do you think he'd check with the baby?

910
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,040
Like, hey, baby, how's your name going?

911
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,840
Are you with Douglas?

912
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,240
I just wanna do a quick, let me dip in real quick, baby.

913
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,680
Um, yeah?

914
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,240
Thumbs up?

915
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,560
Your baby, your baby, as soon as he learns to speak

916
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,800
and put together like cogent thought is like,

917
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,040
ah, man, that's a good name.

918
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,400
Thought is like, ah, man, you should have gone with,

919
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,000
the correct answer was Craig.

920
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,600
I have been a Craig since day one.

921
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,320
I just feel like I'm a Craig trapped in a Douglas body.

922
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,880
Right.

923
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,680
You should not name your children until,

924
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,000
I think you should let them name themselves.

925
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,960
Or let your first child name your second child.

926
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,080
Oh, that's fun.

927
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,920
Cause every child born onto the United States

928
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,960
will be called Trucks.

929
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,360
Trucks.

930
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,800
This is my son, Cheerio.

931
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,600
I think that's my first word.

932
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,640
Cheerio, I think.

933
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,120
Cheerios.

934
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,320
Good job.

935
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,640
Get those complex carbohydrates going.

936
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,440
Introduce them early.

937
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,480
Well, at least it wasn't like, uh oh, crunch berries.

938
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:04,960
You know what I mean?

939
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,400
Like they're far, they're far berries.

940
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:08,880
Yeah.

941
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,520
At least your first.

942
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,360
This is my little brother, Piscetti.

943
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:11,760
Get it?

944
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,440
Cause I can't say it cause I'm two.

945
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,560
Or if your kid is older, your first child is like eight

946
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,040
and he just names them like, uh, the other one.

947
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,520
Mommy's new favorite.

948
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:23,680
Yeah.

949
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,680
Oh, it got sad.

950
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,600
What if you got like the right age for a kid?

951
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,920
You could come up with a pretty banging name though.

952
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,680
Like if you let your, say seven year old,

953
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,360
name your baby Decepticon, like that could be pretty good.

954
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:37,520
I think.

955
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,200
Wait, is he naming the baby Decepticon

956
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
or did you have a baby Decepticon?

957
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,320
No, no, no, no.

958
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,760
That technology is years away.

959
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,080
I'm saying just that you let the child name the other baby

960
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,880
based on whatever, you know, whatever he's into.

961
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,560
What are you into right now, kid?

962
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,560
Captain Feathersword, the baby.

963
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,520
That sounds like a good name.

964
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,960
Put it on the certificate.

965
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,680
That's pretty good.

966
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Um, I don't want to talk about celebrity gossip on this show,

967
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,720
but we're about to because I saw this news story.

968
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,760
I saw this news article on the times.

969
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,800
One of the times, um, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian

970
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,760
named their baby North, making the babies named Northwest.

971
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,000
And we can all agree that that's fresh.

972
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,280
That's fresh as shit.

973
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,920
Except they came out and they said it's not,

974
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,400
the name is not like the cardinal direction.

975
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,080
The name, they were saying like North is like up

976
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,360
and that's where this baby's going.

977
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,640
It's on a skyward trajectory, which.

978
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,880
So I'm sorry, were they trying to make a case for the fact

979
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,040
that both this child's names were cardinal directions

980
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,800
were unrelated?

981
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,400
Like they didn't realize till after?

982
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,120
No, I think, I think that they are trying to make that argument.

983
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,720
They're also trying to make the argument

984
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,440
that when you look up in the sky, that direction is North.

985
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,920
It's not dog.

986
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,360
That's that direction is up upwards.

987
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
You collaborated with God up.

988
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,280
You collaborated with God once.

989
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,920
I don't think he's going to change physics for you.

990
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,080
Sorry guys.

991
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,720
Yeah, yeah, I had to work part of the retainer on the album

992
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,400
is North is up now and forwards is just Yeezus.

993
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,120
I tell you what though, these compasses are fucked up.

994
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,880
Are you guys coming to a Yeezus by Yeezus East this year?

995
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,120
So I see some pretty good shows there.

996
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,760
Surprisingly Yeezus is not performing.

997
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,920
My, you know, a lot of people will give me shit for this.

998
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,960
My favorite Rob Reiner movie is still Yeezus.

999
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,280
That's why I know it's a little off the wall,

1000
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,000
but I really think that Elijah Wood is good in it.

1001
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,720
14 whole seconds to understand it.

1002
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,040
Do you guys want to know about Yahoo?

1003
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,040
Northwest is a good name.

1004
00:45:59,040 --> 00:45:59,920
It is a good name.

1005
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,400
Just fucking just like own it.

1006
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,040
You know what I mean?

1007
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,960
Yeah.

1008
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,400
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1009
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,200
Thank you Jacob Locker.

1010
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,440
It's by Yahoo answers user Cassie who asks,

1011
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,720
I want to bury stuff.

1012
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,360
What will protect it in the ground?

1013
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,200
I want to put stuff in a box and bury it.

1014
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,320
What will protect the box?

1015
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,600
A bigger box, larger box.

1016
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,080
Oh yeah.

1017
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,760
But then you think of like coffins and shit.

1018
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,520
Like I almost always am.

1019
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
And then like this worms and bugs and dirt and nutrients

1020
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,520
and shit get in there.

1021
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,320
You got to put another box.

1022
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,640
Well, wait a minute.

1023
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,840
You got to double box it.

1024
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,160
Right.

1025
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,080
But I think it depends on like what you're burying, right?

1026
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,600
Because if you're burying something

1027
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,400
that already has dirt in it, like a butt.

1028
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,200
How bad can it get?

1029
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:46,640
Yeah.

1030
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,720
It's just going to keep going down that path.

1031
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,800
There's really nothing you could do to prevent it.

1032
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,560
You're saying pre-ruin your shit.

1033
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,720
And then when you put it in the ground,

1034
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,920
like it's not going to get any worse.

1035
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,880
It's already shitty.

1036
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
That's a pretty dumb idea,

1037
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:03,440
but it's no worse than Travis's shitty Matryoshka doll idea

1038
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,440
of box upon box upon box upon box.

1039
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:06,880
Although that.

1040
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,800
I'm sorry.

1041
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,480
I thought that this,

1042
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,880
I thought this podcast was a free exchange of ideas.

1043
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,120
I was not aware that this was a hate factory.

1044
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:18,960
It wasn't.

1045
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,200
But then after we hired Paula Deen, she insisted.

1046
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,760
Hey, y'all.

1047
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,120
Hey, y'all.

1048
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,480
Welcome to the hate factory.

1049
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,640
The world's worst stand up comic club.

1050
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,760
You look slightly Italian.

1051
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:35,680
Can we not?

1052
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,640
Dinosaurs.

1053
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,680
Dinosaurs little kids are always burying their shit.

1054
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,080
Why not?

1055
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,240
Why not put it in?

1056
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,360
Why not put it in a tree?

1057
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,640
Why not do like a little kid sky burial where you cover it with,

1058
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,680
you know, with berries and other things that birds like,

1059
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,760
and then they'll just take your things in the sky.

1060
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,400
Are you even talking English now?

1061
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,280
There's you haven't heard of what it's a sky burial where like

1062
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,880
somebody dies and they let them get down to just bones.

1063
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,760
It's getting a little morbid,

1064
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,520
but they let the body just get down to just bones

1065
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,880
and they cover those bones in sweet sense.

1066
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,120
And then they put it on top of a mountain

1067
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,640
and birds just carry it in the sky.

1068
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,440
Sky burial.

1069
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,040
The birds carry the bones away.

1070
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,160
Birds carry away the bones.

1071
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,000
They don't remain in the sky.

1072
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,040
I imagine.

1073
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,400
I don't think that a plane is going to be flying like over the Alps somewhere

1074
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,160
and then run into a bone cloud.

1075
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,040
Because that would be pretty gnar.

1076
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,560
But I am saying for temporarily your bones are in flight.

1077
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,000
They're in transit.

1078
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,480
So it's not a sky burial so much as a various locations nearby burial.

1079
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,560
Well, it's a burial for as long as a bird can stay interested in carrying anything.

1080
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,040
It's a-

1081
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,040
Which newsflash is very short.

1082
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,680
I mean, it's a nest burial.

1083
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,560
Like, let's be honest.

1084
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:50,800
Yeah.

1085
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,480
But then you become in part,

1086
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,520
you're getting back into the fucking live stream.

1087
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,320
Back into the manna.

1088
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,520
I do like that though.

1089
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,400
I want my energy to help support a beautiful robin egg.

1090
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,120
That's what I'm saying.

1091
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,160
I would rather birds didn't shit all over my corpse though.

1092
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
Well, it's just your bones.

1093
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,720
And really, once you get down to bones, that's not you anymore.

1094
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,520
It's just bones.

1095
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:10,880
Yeah.

1096
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,600
I think Mary Roach wrote about that in Stiff,

1097
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,400
where she talked about just the natural cycle of life,

1098
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
where it ends with birds shitting all over you.

1099
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,280
Do you know who would make a great nest?

1100
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,240
Michael Finley is looking so good this season.

1101
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,720
Chris Sabones, put him in the sky.

1102
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,960
Put him in a nest, no matter where he is.

1103
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,440
Football, baseball, basketball, hyali.

1104
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,360
Dude's got the best bones.

1105
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,840
If I was a bird and I could make a nest out of Chris Sabones,

1106
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,040
I think it would be something I would pass down to the next generation of birds.

1107
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:52,480
There are vultures just like chilling outside of his Cincinnati compound.

1108
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,320
Just waiting for the day.

1109
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,960
I think we're done.

1110
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,460
Yeah.

1111
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,520
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast,

1112
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,640
my brother, my brother and me.

1113
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,400
Uh, note, programming note, uh, if I may be so bold,

1114
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,080
uh, we have a new addition to the Maximum Fun family,

1115
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,840
uh, and it's a show called Sawbones that's made by me and my wife, Sidney.

1116
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,560
Sounds shitty.

1117
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,060
Who's it?

1118
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:15,840
Yeah.

1119
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,800
No, it's good.

1120
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,240
It's made by me and my wife, Sidney.

1121
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:18,960
She's a doctor.

1122
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,600
And we talk about, um, the history of medicine,

1123
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,360
but it's, it's a silly show about the history of medicine because I'm dumb.

1124
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,160
Now, Justin, I've heard it's a 45 minute long fart.

1125
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,880
Is that true?

1126
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,480
No, it's, there's no farts.

1127
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:31,920
We haven't done that episode yet.

1128
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,280
Our first episode is about trepanation,

1129
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,680
which is a, uh, a medical procedure that involves putting a head hole in your head.

1130
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,200
Uh, you can find it on iTunes.

1131
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,720
If you could subscribe and like tell your friends and rate and review and everything,

1132
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,160
that would be supremely helpful.

1133
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,680
These opening weeks are so important.

1134
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,160
If you could, if you could fucking like not stop listening to our podcast

1135
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,400
when you like make a hole in your life for Justin and Sidney's new podcast,

1136
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,200
that's not this one.

1137
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:00,400
Like I would, I would have, I, as the only, this being the only podcast that I really do

1138
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,600
other than besties, which doesn't count.

1139
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:06,960
Um, I just, it's so important to me that you guys maintain.

1140
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,440
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my podcast is still dead.

1141
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,560
Oh man.

1142
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,320
I am working on a new podcast though.

1143
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,000
Why do you have to make this about you?

1144
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,160
Why can't this one moment be about me?

1145
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:20,660
Fuck.

1146
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:26,340
Oh, also, uh, John Hodgman has a special on Netflix called Ragnarok, uh, filmed in front

1147
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:29,380
of a live audience and it's absolutely hilarious.

1148
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:30,340
Make sure you check it out.

1149
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,060
I will check that out.

1150
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,100
That's free on Netflix.

1151
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:34,100
Still way better than Justin's thing.

1152
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:38,740
I am still looking for angel investors for my Pokemon logistics podcast.

1153
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:43,220
Uh, we're in series a right now, funding requests.

1154
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,260
And like, I don't know anything about any of those words I said.

1155
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:52,100
So if you're a business man, a businessman, and you want to give me some help, I will not

1156
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,660
turn it down.

1157
00:51:53,860 --> 00:52:00,500
Uh, hey, listen, thank you to people tweeting about the show like, uh, Sean McNamara, Jeremy

1158
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:07,700
Frank, Arthur Barnhouse, uh, symphony man, uh, Peter Williams, Jess Baker, Dr.

1159
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:13,540
Dinosaur, Casey Green, Bonnie Hardwick, everybody, uh, you're the absolute best.

1160
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:16,340
Uh, thank you for spreading the show around.

1161
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,180
Um, we love you very much.

1162
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,460
Um, I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1163
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,580
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed.

1164
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,100
Um, not the only song on that album.

1165
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,380
There are several others.

1166
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,740
Um, just, you know, if you, if you're, if you want to be cheap, you know, checking out

1167
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:41,060
on Spotify, but I, I must insist that you buy the album both in its, uh, physical vinyl

1168
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,580
and, and digital forms.

1169
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,020
Our last question is coming to us from, uh, young Griffin McElroy.

1170
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,340
He's got one for us to think about every week.

1171
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:53,620
And then of course, as always, we'll come back and answer it next week, which is just

1172
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,140
our way of enticing you to, uh, continue to stay with us.

1173
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,380
It's just a fun thing we always do.

1174
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:02,420
Um, it's, it was sent in by Jacob Locker.

1175
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,140
Thank you, Jacob Locker, my boy.

1176
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,380
It's by Yahoo Answers user question mark.

1177
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:12,340
Who asks how much are 100 million people watching?

1178
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:16,660
120 silly bands worth.

1179
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,860
I'm Justin McElroy.

00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,860
I'm Travis McElroy.

I'm Griffin McElroy.
