1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:49,440
Who's that whispering in the trees? It's two citizens there on leave.

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,800
Hi everybody, welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,840
modern era. I'm the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. It's 1996. It's 1996 and I'm the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm the Squirrel Nut Zippers, Travis McElroy.

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,760
And I'm Scabies, Griffin McElroy. Now you might not be familiar with Scabies.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Is it like Scabies?

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,200
That was the play on words. My ska band from 1997. We came in kind of at the tail end,

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,680
Swingers Mania. That was the name of my band was Scabies, and nobody ever came to any of our shows

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
and we did like 150 of them.

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,600
Do you know how, like think about the ancillary costs of being the Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,880
Think about how many people they forced to say those words.

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,840
Think about the fact that like, think about at one point Casey Kasem, God rest his soul,

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,160
probably had to say Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,920
There had to be a moment where he turned to his producer and was like, I'm not gonna say this.

20
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm an adult.

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Coming in at number one.

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,600
My refusal to say Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
Don't we have anything by the Mighty Mighty Boss tones?

24
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
I don't find that displeasurable.

25
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,280
Casey, we've talked to you about this.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Please don't phrase all conversations in the form of a top 40 list.

27
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,760
Well, I mean, it was either that or Hymen Wreckers.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
It's the worst.

29
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop.

30
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,240
Hymen Wreckers is worse than Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,560
Yeah, because mine is at least clinical in nature.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
It's, well, that's true.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,120
But like, but Cherry Poppin' Daddies, I think, insert, does insert this sort of like

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,480
gleeful, almost Robin Hood-esque,

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,160
roguish, as if one cherry hasn't popped and they've leapt into the trees to go pop cherries

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
another day before like the sheriff of Nottingham can catch them.

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,000
For my money, it's not the Cherry Poppin' part of their nom de plume that I disagree with

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
and wish to throw into a lake somewhere.

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,240
It's the daddies part.

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,920
Because why does it have to be that?

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
It couldn't, they're both bad, both parts of it, right?

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
But why do you have to have the daddies on the end of it too?

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,880
Because that's genuinely upsetting in combination with the earlier two words.

44
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,280
Agreed.

45
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,160
Why couldn't it be the Cherry Poppin' friends, the Cherry Poppin' guys?

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,880
Why couldn't it just be like the good time down home ska band?

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
You know, it's swing time.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
That would certainly be ideal, wouldn't it?

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,440
You could guess what the Cherry Poppin' Daddies are up to for, uh, a hundred years,

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,480
and not guess the most recent fact on their Wikipedia,

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:43,040
which is in a Huffington Post interview, the lead singer of the Cherry Poppin' Daddies said,

52
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,560
uh, my plan is to do a Psychobilly slash Zappa slash American Idiot

53
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,200
slash R. Cum type record that paints a picture of the American socio-political scene circa 2014.

54
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,400
Yay!

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,760
Wait, why 2014?

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,080
You're two years behind already, Cherry Poppin' Daddies.

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,720
Well, I mean, I guess-

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,800
These guys, like, do swing music.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,040
They're not really, like, up to date.

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
Well, this interview, uh, is 20, I mean-

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,160
This interview happened, this interview happened in 1999.

62
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,800
How did he know?

63
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
15 years in the future.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,520
Let me tell you, it's gonna get-

65
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,600
The Cherry Poppin' Daddies are unstuck in time.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
It's gonna get all fucked up, guys.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Social media, we're all gonna be real dicks to each other for a long time.

68
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,760
Uh, he also mentioned in that same interview from 2014

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,040
that he had recently obtained the rights to Zoot Suit Riot,

70
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,440
and so I bet, I mean, just in time, I guess.

71
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,200
Uh, oh my god, I'm reading the lyrics to Zoot Suit Riot right now.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,600
Hold on.

73
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,480
And this- this song was released in the late 90s,

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
and one of the verses starts out, um,

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
hashtag snapchat sexting too.

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,000
So, like, they, like, are- they are able to see through time.

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,280
They have pierced the veil of time.

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,840
Do you remember their hit song, Our First Black President?

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh my god.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Yeah, whoa, whoa.

81
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,960
That one had a- that one had a nice beat I could dance to.

82
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,080
Uh, oh god.

83
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh no, their song- they have a song called the 2017 All Flu,

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,520
and it's the dark all flu will consume the globe.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh shit.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
None left but the bugs and rats.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,560
Oh no.

88
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
That was one of their ballads.

89
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,760
But they have a song right here that's-

90
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,600
they have a song right here that said Carly Rae Jepsen will have the summer jam of 2016.

91
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,840
So, like, I'm fucking super on board with that.

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
That's a look forward to.

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,560
Yeah, before the all flu consumes- just consumes us all,

94
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,880
at least we'll have, like, some good tunes to go out to.

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
Thanks, Cherry Pop and Nostradamy.

96
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah, you guys are great.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
As you've certainly guessed by now, this is an advice show.

98
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,720
Um, how the fuck did we- like, what was the-

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
why did we start talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies?

100
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,640
What was the- what was the scene that we planned?

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
The better question is why did we stop talking about Cherry Pop and Daddies?

102
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
Yeah, good point.

103
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,440
It's a whole episode.

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
Uh, it- I'll tell you- I'll tell you, Griffin, honestly, the truth is,

105
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,680
we introduced ourselves, right?

106
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,480
Justin McElroy.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah, that's when I said that great scobbies joke.

108
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,480
Yeah, it's great.

109
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,240
Uh, I- I- I think they were on my mind because, um,

110
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,360
there were a few people campaigning on Twitter

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,920
that we should never say part the kimono again

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,920
because they found it morally repugnant.

113
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
Mm-hmm.

114
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,560
Just the whole phrase and idea.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,360
And, um-

116
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,840
Do they not understand that- that we also do?

117
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Yeah, that's disgusting.

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,360
That's what I'm struggling with right now is, like,

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
it's disgusting and repellent and I'm still using it.

120
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
In this sort of, like,

121
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,240
how would you- like, immersion therapy?

122
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,920
Like, trying to- to rob it of its power over me

123
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,000
by, like, just really employing it.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,240
And I think that was on my mind

125
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,320
when I started talking about the Cherry Pop and Daddies

126
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,960
because I'm trying to, like, think of just a list-

127
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
you were making a list of morally repugnant things.

128
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Just repellent things that I need to, like, overcome in my day-to-day life.

129
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
Okay, yeah.

130
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh, you can always, uh, you know, drop part the kimono

131
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,360
and get back to put the tiger on the table.

132
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,200
Um, and yell at it?

133
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,760
Was that it?

134
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,320
Fuck, I don't know.

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
We gotta rewind the tapes.

136
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Was ass- ass deep in alligators?

137
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
I think that was in there.

138
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,360
Maybe.

139
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Hey, this is crazy, uh, brothers.

140
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,680
Uh, we got a voicemail this week.

141
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,080
That voicemail line-

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
Holy shit.

143
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,920
Here- so here's- this is an actual true story.

144
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,400
We got a voicemail from somebody, uh, this week.

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,480
If you don't remember, back when the show first started,

146
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,800
like, a long, long, long, long, long time ago,

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,680
we had a voicemail line, uh, that people could call

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,720
and leave us a message.

149
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,760
And I think- did we- did we edit them into the show?

150
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,120
Like, I don't think we did.

151
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,080
I don't think we ever did.

152
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,080
I think they were just for our enjoyment.

153
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,560
But, um-

154
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Maybe we could, like, try to do that at some point.

155
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,880
No, no, because when we tried to do it last time,

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,680
it became a fucking repository for people

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,760
who would do, like, fucking whippets

158
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,480
and then just, like, barf garbage into our voicemail.

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
And we had to listen to all of the-

160
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,160
Like, you could hear them, like, finishing the whippet

161
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,440
as the voicemail started.

162
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,320
Okay, wait.

163
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,200
Like, uh, hey, brothers, what's up?

164
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,680
I'm Carolyn and fuck.

165
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,720
Fuck.

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Um, I'm gonna go chill.

167
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,080
I need some orange slices.

168
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,800
Uh, no, I think that, um-

169
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,120
So anyway, I got the- I got an email notification

170
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,920
that we had gotten a voicemail.

171
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,280
I was like, aw, shit.

172
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,080
So I listened to it.

173
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
Then I was like, wait a minute.

174
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
What is the number for the voicemail?

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,880
I have no clue of what the voicemail box number is.

176
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,160
And so there was a phone number in the email notification.

177
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
I was like, oh, shit, that must be it.

178
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
So I'm gonna call it real quick and just-

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,880
I forgot what the message was and everything.

180
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,880
And I- so I called and, uh, it was ring, ring, ring, ring.

181
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,920
And then, hello?

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,640
Oh, this isn't what I expected to happen.

183
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,560
Turned out that that phone number was the phone number

184
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,920
of the person who had left the Google post.

185
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,440
No, Justin!

186
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
I just called this person at about 10 30 at night.

187
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,200
Just like, to kind of sh- just out of nowhere.

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,480
Hi, this is Justin.

189
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,360
I'm lonely.

190
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,400
Hi, this is Justin.

191
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,960
Did you call?

192
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,080
So-

193
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,600
Do you want to be my friend?

194
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,800
Did you have a chat?

195
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,120
What?

196
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, we said hi.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,640
It's a cool dude.

198
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
Very complimentary.

199
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,840
And, uh-

200
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
It would be great if that guy just assumed that, like,

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,960
everybody who, like, everybody was just getting Justin calls

202
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,600
all the time.

203
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,160
The fucking-

204
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,440
Justin called them back.

205
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,680
The sweet treat for that dude, he didn't even realize,

206
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,040
but the sweet treat for that dude is that I was a hair's

207
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,840
breadth away from tweeting that number out like,

208
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,360
hey, let's do some voicemails again.

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,120
I miss it.

210
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,080
Oh, shit.

211
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
All right, let's use some advice.

212
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,280
If you can find that number, please tweet it at me.

213
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,960
Yeah, that's sad that we don't know.

214
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,840
I want to say it's like something something mabim bam one.

215
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Something like that.

216
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,920
Yeah, I don't remember it.

217
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,680
This is the- and it's un-Googleable.

218
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,720
I've tried to Google it.

219
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
I couldn't find it there either.

220
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,160
Damn it.

221
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
This is the second winner.

222
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,120
Anyway, these are not voicemails.

223
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
These are emails people have sent to mbmbam at maximum fun.org.

224
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,640
These are like voicemails, but with words.

225
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,560
Voicemails you type.

227
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,360
Here we go.

228
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,760
This is the second winner that I've owned my home.

229
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
Thankfully, I don't have a very big section or sidewalk

230
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,280
driveway that I need to clear snow from.

231
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,640
But despite it's not being very big, it's still something I need to do.

232
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,320
What's the neighborly etiquette for removing snow?

233
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,200
Some of my neighbors get out there and remove snow so quickly,

234
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,240
and I have more of a philosophy of I'll do it when it fits my schedule.

235
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,840
If it snows overnight, do I have to take care of it first thing in the morning?

236
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,360
I can't wait till I get home from work.

237
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,160
I already think my neighbors judge me for not being right on top of those outdoor chores,

238
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,520
like mowing the lawn, raking the leaves, snow removal, etc.

239
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,160
Yes. Thank you for including snow removal in the group.

240
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
I already forgot what these emails are about.

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,680
I'd forgotten what you're talking about.

242
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
What are some thoughts on neighborly etiquette for removing snow?

243
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,920
And that's from I'll shovel when I get to it in Wisconsin.

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,560
Well, I think it's important to note that I think it's too different.

245
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
I think your driveway is one thing and the sidewalk is another.

246
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,960
Because I don't think your neighbors give two shits what you do with your driveway.

247
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,200
No, but postwoman Melinda is going to care what's up with your sidewalk.

248
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,920
Exactly.

249
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
Like the old lady that lives next door to you that needs to get down to the corner

250
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,560
to catch the bus and has to walk through two feet of snow

251
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,960
because you just decided you'll do it when you get home.

252
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,160
That might be an ish.

253
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,760
You were the one who decided to live between an old lady's house

254
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
and a store labeled Old Lady Pills.

255
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Bargains.

256
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah.

257
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,040
What's the name of the store?

258
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
Old Lady's Pills.

259
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,960
Underneath that sign, there's a smaller side.

260
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,520
Hold on.

261
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,040
Bargains.

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,800
The subtitle to the store.

263
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,000
I was trying to make the store as appealing as I could to old ladies.

264
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,880
And about two blocks down, the Old Lady Pills store colon origins.

265
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,120
The Old Lady Pills store rises.

266
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
Hey, have you been to Old Lady Pills store ascendant yet?

267
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,440
It's a brash new take.

268
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,960
It's got webisodes.

269
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,200
It's a dark webisode reboot and it's fucking horrible.

270
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:00,800
It's a flash-based 18-part webisode series about a store called Old Lady Pills.

271
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,200
It's like a choose your own adventure YouTube dive.

272
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,960
I don't want to spoil it, but she gets the pills.

273
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,400
But not how you might think.

274
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,800
My new Old Lady Pills store is a Twitch channel

275
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
where people vote on whether or not the old ladies get pills.

276
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,760
I'm just glad there's so many audience-facing Old Lady Pills stores now.

277
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,160
You gotta just consider the public use section of your zone

278
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and then take care of that.

279
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,360
That's just common courtesy.

280
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,440
Travis is right.

281
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,480
That's a different thing from like,

282
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
oh, you let your grass grow too tall and it doesn't look good.

283
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
I mean, you should still tend to your shit.

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
But it's not as important as like the thing that could kill an old person.

285
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,520
Well, because the problem is if you wait too long

286
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,640
and if you become known as the dude who doesn't do it till like 5.30 PM or some shit,

287
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,480
someone in your neighborhood is going to start doing it for you.

288
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,800
And I know that that sounds cool, but that's not going to feel good.

289
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,920
Here's what I want you to do.

290
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
And then you turn it into a little fun game.

291
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,400
I've been really in the gamifying my processes lately.

292
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
You take a roll of lifesavers.

293
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,160
And then when you wake up and you got that fresh, crisp powder,

294
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,920
I want you to close your eyes and spin around 10 times

295
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,840
and then just throw it into your yard.

296
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,520
And then when you're digging, it's like a little fun game.

297
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,360
Where are those lifesavers at?

298
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Where's my buried treasure?

299
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,400
Where's my fruity reward?

300
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,920
I do that with like most of the things in my life.

301
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,840
You hide lifesavers in them?

302
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,320
Yeah.

303
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,120
Like if I want to, if I need to do them, but I can't like,

304
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
but I can't like bring myself to do it.

305
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,120
Tuck some in the cat litter.

306
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,080
Good.

307
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
Oh, now I'll clean it out.

308
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,560
There's pineapples in there.

309
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,720
I'm way into just throwing rock salt down.

310
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,880
Cause I feel like that even if that doesn't melt enough of the snow and ice,

311
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,440
it gives you like a grit, a nice gritty sort of grit

312
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
that is going to minimize.

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
Can you put a little bit of salt in there?

314
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,120
Can you put a sign on your yard that says I work nights?

315
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
Hey, chill out.

316
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
Hey, wouldn't that be the easiest thing?

317
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,720
You don't know my situation.

318
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
I don't know your situation.

319
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,480
Exactly.

320
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,280
A sign in your yard, six foot by six foot, that says I work nights.

321
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
And then that way, whoa, wait a minute.

322
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,880
That could get you out of a lot of stuff, right?

323
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,280
What do you mean?

324
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,960
Like somebody comes to the door.

325
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,080
You don't feel like it.

326
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,160
Like you just can't right now with that.

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,520
You can't right now with that.

328
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,320
Put a sign up in the front yard that says I work nights.

329
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
That means they come to the door.

330
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,920
It's during the daytime.

331
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,720
They're going to see that sign.

332
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,560
They're going to think, oh, I shouldn't.

333
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,680
I really shouldn't bother them.

334
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,040
They're probably sleeping.

335
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,760
They come back at night and then you still don't answer.

336
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
They're like, oh shit, he's at work.

337
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
I should break in.

338
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
But then you're there.

339
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,280
But you're there.

340
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,720
Uh oh, honey pot.

341
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,840
What I'm saying is if you have a sign as a sign that says I work nights,

342
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
um, you don't have to do anything anymore.

343
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,200
Why is your yard not shuffled?

344
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,840
Well, I work nights, so I guess I'll get to it tonight in the freezing cold.

345
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
If that's what you want from me, I guess.

346
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
I don't know.

347
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

348
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,960
I thought you had a human soul, but I guess I'll go out and shovel it after working.

349
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,680
After working?

350
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,520
I guess I'll get to it at like three.

351
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,600
You jerk.

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,560
You jerk.

353
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,840
Is there not a neighborhood child that you could pay ten dollars like every time it snows,

354
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,240
they get really excited and they're like ten dollars and they jump to, they knock on the

355
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
door, you answer in like your robe and slippies with a coffee and you're like, this is good

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,640
enough and you give them ten dollars and you never have to worry about it.

357
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,920
And then they do a super duper shitty job because they're a little kid and what the

358
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,080
fuck do they do?

359
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,120
Well, but then you give them five.

360
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,080
It's a sliding scale.

361
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,200
It's good for the economy.

362
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
It's capitalism, you know?

363
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,480
Okay, but you need to bump both those up because ten dollars doesn't buy shit for shit anymore.

364
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,640
Well, then another kid moves in, he does it for eight, you know, and now you're competing.

365
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,680
I completely did this at my last house, but there was a lot of foot traffic.

366
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,680
I'm just having, I don't even have a snow shovel because I believe in like putting money

367
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
back in the economy.

368
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,520
Yeah, so I don't even have a social, but I'm just having this, the terrifying realization

369
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,000
like nobody's going to come to my house now.

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,280
It's a, it's more removed.

371
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,720
No one's going to come here.

372
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,040
What am I going to do?

373
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,320
You're like on a call this act.

374
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,600
I think you're fine as is just like leaving her.

375
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
Just leaving her.

376
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Just leaving her.

377
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,800
Just leave her.

378
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,080
How about a Yahoo?

379
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,400
Please.

380
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,160
This Yahoo was sent in.

381
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,040
This is, this is fucking service journalism.

382
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,760
What we're about to do because like maybe a dozen people sent this Yahoo in.

383
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,960
And thank you, all of you.

384
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

385
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,400
They are anonymous.

386
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,000
I'll call them rope.

387
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,400
You're calling them rope.

388
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,200
Their name is rope.

389
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,720
Rope asks, do you ship planets together or no?

390
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,280
I ship Mercury and Mars.

391
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,320
Yes.

392
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:10,480
No.

393
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,480
Oh, okay.

394
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,080
Yes, the planets only.

395
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,400
IDK why I do what I do.

396
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,800
And then there's like a really creepy smiley face emoticon.

397
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,400
I think they are fine together since they both have lots in common.

398
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,200
They're both red.

399
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,480
They're both quite windy.

400
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,880
They're quite familiar with this planet, etc.

401
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,920
What about you?

402
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,720
Be a sweet and innocent please and thank you.

403
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,000
Update.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,880
Anyone else a Mercury X Mars shipper?

405
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,520
Just me?

406
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,160
Okay.

407
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,240
And I mean by relationships.

408
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Update two.

409
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
I also ship stars.

410
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,680
My fav one is Sol and Sirius.

411
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,200
Our sun times, the star Sirius equals true love.

412
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
Not sure what any of that meant.

413
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,560
But let's ship the fuck out of these astral bodies, gentlemen.

414
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,520
Well, here's the thing.

415
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,720
I think the obvious option, and I think we were all thinking it,

416
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,480
so I'll just come right out and say it.

417
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,000
It's Earth and Pluto.

418
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,040
Now hear me out.

419
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,880
Earth is the popular girl, right?

420
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
Everybody loves Earth.

421
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,400
Everybody loves Earth.

422
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,320
Pluto, he's an outcast.

423
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,040
He's dark.

424
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,680
He's brooding.

425
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,640
He's a little cold.

426
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,800
Everyone's like, stay away from Pluto.

427
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,480
He'll treat you wrong, right?

428
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
He's not even a planet.

429
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,720
He doesn't belong with us.

430
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
But Earth sees something there.

431
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
But at first she's afraid, right?

432
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,920
Because she thinks, oh, I need to keep up my popular girl,

433
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,800
cool girl image.

434
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,960
But then she spends a little time with Pluto,

435
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,720
and she sees something there.

436
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
He's got some moons.

437
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,520
He's got some heart.

438
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,120
And once she gets past his frozen shell,

439
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,800
there's something there.

440
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't think Pluto has moons.

441
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,920
I think they classified it as a moon, didn't they?

442
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,800
No, I think Pluto's got moons.

443
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,560
It's fucking big old dumpy moons.

444
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:53,200
Can I just request that Earth not get into any relationships

445
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,840
with any other planets?

446
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
Because we're all having a lot of fun here today.

447
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
If Earth fucks another planet, we die.

448
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
We're done, though.

449
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,200
Yeah, we're done.

450
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,760
That's it.

451
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
There's no intercourse where that works out well for us.

452
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,600
The Earth is the protagonist of the solar system.

453
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
It's the emotional core of the solar system.

454
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,760
So I know the most about it.

455
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,400
I want to match it up with a planet.

456
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,080
I feel like Jupiter, we could have some fun there.

457
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,440
A lot of dumpy moons.

458
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,600
To be fair, isn't the Earth and the Sun already

459
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,240
in a pretty solid, loving relationship?

460
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
Yeah, but the Sun is a polygamist

461
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,040
because they're in a relationship.

462
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,880
Yeah, but we're the only one that it treats right.

463
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,560
We're the only one that could sustain life

464
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,640
that we don't burn or are too cold.

465
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
I can't imagine Earth's going to be very popular

466
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,200
with the other planets, because they're

467
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
going to get a little too close to Earth,

468
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
and they're going to be like, what is that itchy shit

469
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,480
all over you?

470
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,840
What is that smell?

471
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,400
What is that smell and itchy, gross shit on you?

472
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,560
And Earth's going to be like, ah, that's life.

473
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,600
I don't know what happened.

474
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,280
I got colonized.

475
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,120
I need to see somebody about that.

476
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,160
A planet doctor.

477
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
I like Earth-Mercury.

478
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,960
I think that's a fun match up.

479
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,440
Yeah.

480
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,720
Oh, you could call it mirth.

481
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Earth, there's a Japanese concept called tsundere,

482
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,280
and it just means like a character

483
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,560
that plays you hot and cold.

484
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I feel like that's Mercury all over, isn't it?

485
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,360
Like you, Mercury's like, nah, nah, Earth,

486
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,360
never going to get it, never going to get it.

487
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
But then it turns around, faces the right way,

488
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
and it's like, nah, come here, come closer.

489
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,200
I feel like-

490
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
See, I was going to say that like Mars and Earth

491
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
have like a Sam and Diane kind of thing.

492
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,000
You know, where it's just like, will we land on it?

493
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,360
Oh, we kind of landed on it.

494
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
Oh, but nothing happened.

495
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, will we get people there?

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,120
Well, who knows?

497
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,840
Mars is like a lot of women I've loved

498
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
in that I have spent a considerable amount of time

499
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,160
looking at them through a telescope.

500
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,240
Okay, okay, okay.

501
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,560
Oh, bring it back, Jerry Pop and Daddy.

502
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
We're going to reel it back on in.

503
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,120
Let's pull that one back.

504
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,240
Let me hit you guys with this.

505
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,680
Let's stop being so geocentric.

506
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,360
I want to pitch you with Mars cross Jupiter

507
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
and think about that for a second.

508
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,200
Obviously, there is a spatial difference

509
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,320
in terms of scale,

510
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
but also they're separated by the great asteroid belt.

511
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,880
And I feel like that's fucking pretty romantic, don't you?

512
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,560
Separated by an ocean of a cosmic ocean of unforgiving rock,

513
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,200
but these two lovers just want to be together.

514
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't you think?

515
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,680
Their families don't approve.

516
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,120
And also the asteroid belt separating them is problematic.

517
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,920
Okay, everyone on this side of the asteroid belt

518
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,560
is on Team Cool Guys.

519
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,360
And everyone on that side of the asteroid belt

520
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,760
is on another team that is not Team Cool Guys.

521
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
Just like in Romeo and Juliet.

522
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,080
I couldn't think of a name with Team Cool Guys,

523
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,960
which would be a way better version of Romeo and Juliet.

524
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,560
We Cool Guys hate you, not Cool Guys.

525
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Bite my thumb.

526
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,520
But yeah, think about Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus.

527
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,120
How have we not talked about Saturn,

528
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,400
the most beautiful planet in the solar system?

529
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,560
Saturn is aesthetically dope.

530
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,640
Yeah, but he's stuck up, isn't he?

531
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,960
Ooh, Saturn's a boy to you, huh?

532
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,200
Yeah.

533
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,240
Okay.

534
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,000
Why is that an issue even at all?

535
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,560
I don't know, but for some reason to me, Saturn was a lady.

536
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,560
Interesting.

537
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,200
I think Venus is a woman, because it's right there.

538
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,040
But all the other ones, I think it's a fucking grab bag.

539
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,920
What about Orion's Belt plus the Big Dipper?

540
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,880
Okay, so now we're just sort of expanding the scale of it.

541
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
Well, stars are included in there,

542
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,920
and I don't know any proper names.

543
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,560
Okay.

544
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,920
What about Beetlejuice and Lydia?

545
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,800
Yeah, that's a good one, actually.

546
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,000
I never really understood,

547
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
is there a romantic thing going on there or what?

548
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,280
That would be bad.

549
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
Yeah, but now that she's in Beetlejuice 2,

550
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
the sequel to Beetlejuice,

551
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
Beetlejuice-ier.

552
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,920
Are they going to be romantically involved?

553
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,120
Well, in the cartoon, she was much more like his little buddy.

554
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,360
Yeah.

555
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,880
Yeah.

556
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,800
It's definitely in the movie, he tries to marry her.

557
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,600
That is true.

558
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,160
That's true.

559
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,280
And that would be a bad union, because there would be a lot of

560
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,600
what I'm just going to go ahead and call ever so delicately, slime time.

561
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,680
You know, I bet there's going to be a joke in the next Beetlejuice movie,

562
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,680
Beetlejuice 2, the sequel to Beetlejuice.

563
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Beetlejuice-ier returns, returns ascension.

564
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,920
When he gets out of black and white stripe cell phone

565
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,920
and starts pounding keys on, he's like,

566
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,080
hey, check it out, Tweedlejuice.

567
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
And he's tweeting.

568
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,480
That's pretty good.

569
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:46,960
Yeah.

570
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
Oh, can I just tell you something?

571
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:48,880
Yeah.

572
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,240
My penis shriveled up when you made that joke,

573
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,720
because I think it did predictively.

574
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
Like, just because I know you're so right.

575
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,280
You're right, and that is going to happen.

576
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,720
And it is going to happen.

577
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,960
Yeah.

578
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,280
I don't think that's a good joke.

579
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,240
Don't get it twisted.

580
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,280
Although if it's delivered by the inimitable Michael Keaton,

581
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,320
he could probably sell it.

582
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
Do you think there will also be a joke where he's wearing the black and white suit

583
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
and he goes, look, I'm thick.

584
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,680
Something along those lines of thick reference.

585
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,400
This guy, I just hate all these blurred lines, Lydia.

586
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
I came back from the digs.

587
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
This guy digs stealing my look.

588
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,800
It's so Beetlejuice-sounding.

589
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
Yeah, it is absolutely.

590
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,520
Can we cut out the middle man and just get thick in the picture?

591
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,840
Thick is Beetlejuice's junior in Beetlejuice 2,

592
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,320
the sequel to Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice here.

593
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,920
He's Beetlejuice's-

594
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,640
Ascension.

595
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
You left out Ascension, and that's an important part of the brand.

596
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,560
He doesn't think his dad's cool.

597
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,600
He thinks his dad's yesterday's news, but he still loves his look.

598
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
Nope, I'm not ready for him to come back in my life yet.

599
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm not ready.

600
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,360
How about another question?

601
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,200
Like, some days I don't have much energy, and I want to take a nap.

602
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
If I don't set an alarm, I end up sleeping for hours,

603
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
and wake up feeling groggy and gross.

604
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
When I do set alarm for 15 to 20 minutes,

605
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
I never seem to fall asleep, and am I napping wrong?

606
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,680
How can I master the art of the nap?

607
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,840
Tired in Toronto, we have got your back.

608
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
You are talking to three professional nappers.

609
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
Nap genius.

610
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
I wish somebody would annotate Justin's naps.

611
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Annotate my naps.

612
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,080
It would just be a string of, he looks so adorable.

613
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,440
He looks like an angel.

614
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Look at him.

615
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,960
Is he glowing?

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,880
It seems like a precious nap light.

617
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
He's napping actually a centimeter off of the bed.

618
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,040
You can't tell, but there's actually air between Justin

619
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,640
and whatever surface he's napping on.

620
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,320
Now why does Justin make constant kissing noises while he's asleep?

621
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,360
Well, no one really knows for sure, but here's my theory.

622
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,760
Dream kisses.

623
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
Naps are personal.

624
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,080
You can do naps wrong.

625
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,600
A lot of people say they can't do naps.

626
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,040
It's because you're doing them wrong.

627
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,240
I want to tell you my nap strategy, because it's very personal, I think,

628
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,920
but here's what I do, okay?

629
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,600
It's very scientific.

630
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,440
I use an app called Pziz.

631
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
That's P-Z-I-Z-Z.

632
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,440
You still on Pziz?

633
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,480
Still on Pziz.

634
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,840
I started to get worried at, no joke,

635
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,320
started to get worried about some like Manchurian candidate shit

636
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
happening via Pziz as the delivery vehicle.

637
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,560
It does work though, right?

638
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,680
Like it puts you to, it's a nap, it's an application.

639
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,120
Yeah, I mean, it's a creepy, it's a creepy nap application.

640
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,320
It's not an application where you set the exact amount of time

641
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,520
that you want to go to sleep.

642
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,920
For me, it's 25 minutes.

643
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
If I set a nap for 25 minutes.

644
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,080
Five minute warm up to fall asleep,

645
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,720
and then 20 minutes of unconsciousness.

646
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,040
And then 20 minutes of perfect unconscious sleep.

647
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,760
If you sleep for, the next nap station that you can,

648
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
see the naps go in a circle, right?

649
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,800
They're like a curve.

650
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,840
It's a curve.

651
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,920
So a full cycle of sleep takes about 90 minutes

652
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,560
from peak to valley to peak.

653
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,440
So if you wake up at 45 minutes,

654
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
you're gonna be right in the middle of a valley.

655
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
You're gonna be way deep in REM,

656
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,840
and it's gonna be hell on earth.

657
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,000
You're never gonna recover from that until that evening.

658
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,040
But if you hit it just the right spot

659
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,120
where you're just sort of like asleep,

660
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,560
you can just like kickstart yourself.

661
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,360
So that's what I do.

662
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,400
25 minutes, invest in a sleep mask.

663
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,920
It's totally worth it.

664
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,960
And also I use like noise.

665
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,360
Especially if you do funny googly eyes on the outside of it.

666
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,480
Yes, totally worth it.

667
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,040
That's a sight gag that never wears out.

668
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,120
And then I use like earbuds

669
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,280
with like some like noise cancellation shit.

670
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,440
So like full sensory deprivation.

671
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,240
Here's another tip, super quick,

672
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,360
and then I'll let my brothers talk

673
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,880
because they're like nap geniuses too.

674
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,760
I don't get under my sheets or blankets for an hour.

675
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,640
Interesting.

676
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
I have like an outer blanket.

677
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,160
Like I'll pull up a blanket.

678
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,400
You have a nappy time bing bing?

679
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,160
Like a nappy time bing bing?

680
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,680
Because if I get under my sheets,

681
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm telling myself it's bedtime.

682
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,720
But anyway, that's why a nappy time bing bing is great too.

683
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,600
That's great.

684
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,760
See for me, I've experimented with naps

685
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,440
for going on 32 years now.

686
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,360
And I feel like I finally figured it out.

687
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,080
And that is one, I cannot nap in a bed.

688
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
It's too much pressure.

689
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,400
It's telling myself it's time for sleeping for bedtime.

690
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,240
And it's not, I have to nap on a couch.

691
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
And I can't nap in a quiet room.

692
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,520
I gotta put on low level TV,

693
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,760
something that's distracting me,

694
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,200
that's clicking off like,

695
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,880
hey, you're not trying to fall asleep.

696
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,400
You're just going to fall asleep.

697
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,720
Because if I try to fall asleep, I will not.

698
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,760
So I need something that's like lulling me to bed.

699
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,040
And I use the alarm.

700
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,520
I just tell Siri, wake me up in 25 minutes.

701
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,200
I don't go through the like programming.

702
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
I don't make a big rigamarole.

703
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Don't make it a big deal.

704
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,120
I just say like, Siri, wake me up in 25 minutes.

705
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,560
Sleep, right?

706
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,760
I just, and then-

707
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,080
You're saying you literally every step of this process,

708
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,440
you trick your body into thinking

709
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,040
you're not about to take a nap.

710
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:45,600
Exactly.

711
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,760
You circle back around the back door.

712
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,800
And you're talking over the door.

713
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
It's like, psych, we're going to sleep.

714
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,720
This is full body confusion.

715
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,760
When I try to, it's too much pressure.

716
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,560
I can't do it.

717
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm sitting there going, fall asleep, fall asleep,

718
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,360
fall asleep, fall asleep.

719
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,760
But instead I'm going, nope, just going to relax,

720
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,200
watch some TV, I'm out.

721
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
That's the way I do it.

722
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,840
And it works because then you wake up

723
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,080
and just as you gently fell into sleep,

724
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,000
you gently come back out of sleep.

725
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:13,680
Here's my thing.

726
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
The other thing, oh, super quick, one other tip,

727
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,360
especially if you go with this 25 minute shit,

728
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,240
it is going to feel like you just fell asleep

729
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,920
and that's exactly the idea.

730
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,640
If you think, oh, 10 more minutes, you're fucked.

731
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,680
You're fucked.

732
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,880
Do not snooze.

733
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,120
Don't put the alarm too close to you.

734
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,320
Set it on the table away from you

735
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,200
so you got to reach for it.

736
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,440
Throw your body out of bed and just get on it.

737
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:33,940
Griffin.

738
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,800
I plan, you have to plan on taking,

739
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,840
I'm the opposite of Travis.

740
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,880
I plan my naps a good half day in advance.

741
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
When I wake up in the morning,

742
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,600
oh, that wasn't a very good sleep.

743
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,040
I know I'm going to need a nap later on.

744
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,000
That is actually true.

745
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Griffin has told me like while we're having breakfast,

746
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
like I'm going to need a nap later.

747
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,560
Okay, yep.

748
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,160
Yeah, my shit don't sneak up on me.

749
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,280
I know my body at this point.

750
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,480
I've been around for 28 years.

751
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,200
I've had 28 years of knowing just how my body reacts

752
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,880
to the pressures of day to day life

753
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,640
or night to night sleep life.

754
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,480
And so knowing that in the morning times,

755
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,160
I take my shower and I eat my oatmeal

756
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,480
and then I'm picking out my outfit for the day.

757
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
I say, what is the tightest,

758
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,880
most uncomfortable clothing that I own?

759
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,000
This belt, there's not a good notch for me.

760
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,040
There's like one that's too loose

761
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,000
and one that's too tight.

762
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
I wear that, set it to the too tight setting.

763
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,200
I wear a shirt that I got too fat for in the holiday times.

764
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,320
Put that right on.

765
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,520
I wore these skinny jeans.

766
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,600
I don't know why I own these fucking idiot things.

767
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,200
They make my butt look like a Cinnabon somebody sat on.

768
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
I'm going to wear that too.

769
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,360
Put all that on.

770
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,960
Socks with holes in it.

771
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,480
Yeah, absolutely.

772
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
And then I'm going to wear dress shoes all day

773
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
like a clown.

774
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,720
So I'm going to wear all that

775
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,680
and then I'm going to walk around

776
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,880
and just like do my stuff

777
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,760
like feeling uncomfortable the whole day.

778
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,920
And then delay it.

779
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,600
You got to delay your shit

780
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,280
until you are about to literally pass out unconscious

781
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,480
because of how sleepy you are.

782
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,600
If you start to feel a little sleepy

783
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,360
and you go for the nap, you're not going to hit it.

784
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:01,840
Dope.

785
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,720
You got to dive off this-

786
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,920
You can overshoot that though.

787
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Be careful.

788
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,640
Oh yeah.

789
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,200
Cause if you-

790
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,680
Yeah.

791
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,560
Yeah, cause you will just-

792
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
You got to learn where your point of no return is.

793
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,040
Yeah.

794
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,160
Like if you go to-

795
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,720
I know that if it's past like 4.30 PM-

796
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,280
Oh, don't see that.

797
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:13,760
No, no, no, no.

798
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,640
Don't nap after four.

799
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,280
That's ridiculous.

800
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,160
So yeah, you get so sleepy

801
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,840
and you know you've hit your peak low

802
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
and then go to the bedtime.

803
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,360
You don't need any fucking special application

804
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,640
voice telling you to kill vice president Joe Biden

805
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,080
in your ear while you're asleep

806
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,480
when you're at your most fucking psychically vulnerable.

807
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,120
You don't have to like lower your fucking window shade

808
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,160
made out of deer bones or whatever

809
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,520
to begin the sacrament.

810
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,400
No, you just take off your super uncomfortable clothes

811
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,760
that you've been wearing all day

812
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,280
that you put on in the morning in advance

813
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,840
and then you feel amazing.

814
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,240
And then you get in bed however you want,

815
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,760
whatever bed, couch, floor.

816
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,320
It doesn't matter.

817
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
At that point, you're going to be so comfortable,

818
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
so ready for beddy by time.

819
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,480
And then you zonk out and then you-

820
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,160
Oh, you have to have set an alarm

821
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,520
because what they said about 25 minutes

822
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,720
is also very important.

823
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,560
But Griffin, you are so human being who,

824
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,320
if I remember correctly from our youth,

825
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,160
could sleep anywhere.

826
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,400
Yeah.

827
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,360
See, I have to trick myself.

828
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,320
I have to trick myself.

829
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,080
Well, you haven't tried my super tight clothes thing.

830
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,560
Try it out.

831
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,520
It's changed my life.

832
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,320
So Griff, you agree with 25 minutes too?

833
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
Yeah, it's gotta be 25 minutes.

834
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
Any longer than that and you're-

835
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,200
I have gone 45 and felt awesome.

836
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,840
No, then it must have taken you a while to go to sleep because-

837
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,560
That's what it is.

838
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,640
If I know that my backwards falling back into it method

839
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,160
isn't going to work right away,

840
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,800
the secret to a good nap is falling asleep instantly.

841
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,400
And I'm telling you this combo of waiting

842
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
until you are at peak sleepiness

843
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,160
and also you take off all your own comfy clothes.

844
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,640
Oh boy, you'll be asleep before you hit the bed.

845
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,560
Have somebody aim you.

846
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,120
Have a friend there to aim your unconscious body

847
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,600
as it plummets into dream zone.

848
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,800
Fucking kicking it with Morpheus from the Matrix movies.

849
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,520
Let's go to the-

850
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,280
Swiggy, you go to the dream zone.

851
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm headed to the money zone.

852
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,000
The money zone is my dream zone.

853
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:13,360
Jokes on it.

854
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,000
Hey guys, tell me what we're selling today.

855
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Well, Justin, it's 2016.

856
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,920
Correct?

857
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,960
Do you make resolutions?

858
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
Do you have resolutions?

859
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,520
I don't really do that.

860
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,760
I just try to live a little better every day.

861
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,680
I got a resolution and it's to sip

862
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,480
fucking tasty, elegant cups of that good red stuff.

863
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,560
Well, good news, Griffin.

864
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560
We've got sponsors gonna help you out.

865
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,440
It's Blood Club.

866
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,520
Oh no, oh no.

867
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,800
Oh no, wait, I read that wrong.

868
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,600
It's Club W.

869
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Club W is a wine subscription service.

870
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,520
And let me tell you guys, I'm a big fan.

871
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,800
Big old fan.

872
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,880
Basically what it is is they have a series of questions

873
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,840
that helps you determine what kind of wine you will like.

874
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,120
You don't have to be an expert.

875
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,560
You don't have to be a connoisseur.

876
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
You don't have to be a sommelier.

877
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,880
Maybe you're just like, you know, I kind of like sweet foods.

878
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,560
You don't have to be a Somali pirate.

879
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,080
You don't have to be Somali at all.

880
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,080
You just have to know what you like.

881
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,520
And then like you answer these questions

882
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,840
and Club W recommends some wines

883
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,680
and you're like, yeah, that sounds great.

884
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,760
Let me get some of that good red stuff.

885
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,120
And then they send it to you.

886
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,960
It's a revolutionary new wine club.

887
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,280
It sends the wine directly to your door.

888
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,680
So you don't have to like go out to the grocery store

889
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,840
and not only does it send the wine to your home,

890
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,080
it sends you wine you love and the best part,

891
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,320
my favorite part, along with the wine,

892
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,600
you'll get these cards that tell you all about the wine.

893
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,840
So if you pop it open with some friends,

894
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,080
you can be like, oh yeah, this has notes of cinnamon

895
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,520
and like earth and leather and whatever.

896
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,960
And then all those friends will take turns

897
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,000
punching you in the face.

898
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,000
And it's just a big circle.

899
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,680
That's going to happen regardless though.

900
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,120
Yeah, but it also tells you what it will pair with

901
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,240
and gives you recipes for examples of dishes

902
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,360
you could possibly serve it with.

903
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,920
We did this and the wine's not super expensive.

904
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,200
Let me just jump right out and say that.

905
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,080
No, it's way cheaper than you would get it in the store for.

906
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,800
And not only that, right now Club W is offering

907
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,160
my brother, my brother and me listeners

It's amazing.

914
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,840
It's incredible.

915
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
I'm a huge fan of the service.

916
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,040
I want to read this next one because it is from

917
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,320
good friends of the show.

918
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,400
Me undies, me undies.

919
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
What's the secret to New Year's resolutions?

920
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,360
Fucking sexy soft underwear.

921
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:33,680
Yes.

922
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,320
That's something you have to do every day

923
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,200
is put on underwear and in 2016,

924
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,280
it's time to take all your old stupid underwear,

925
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,880
throw it in the garbage and buy new me undies.

926
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,480
The world's most comfortable underwear.

927
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,200
Justin, my wife, Rachel, my loving wife,

928
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,840
bought me those me undies lounge pants

929
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,280
for the candle nights.

930
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,000
Yeah.

931
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,880
And my God.

932
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,160
Yep.

933
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,960
It's like all I want to wear.

934
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,840
It is like a wearable angel soft circus tent.

935
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,960
There's so much room to explore down in there

936
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,000
and they're so soft and oh God.

937
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
I want to be wearing them all the time.

938
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,640
It's like they say in that song, huge basketball shorts,

939
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
it's like a Bedouin group tent stitched with a belt.

940
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,000
It's beautiful.

941
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
If you head to meundies.com,

942
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,480
you can choose from a variety of underwear styles

943
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,040
in limited edition patterns, both for men and women,

944
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,400
and they'll be delivered right to your door.

945
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,000
You get matching pairs of underwears for you

946
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,200
and a loved one or a family member.

947
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,240
And that's fun.

948
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,960
And that's fun.

949
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
Not family member.

950
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,880
I'm sorry I said family member.

951
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,440
That sucks.

952
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't do that.

953
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:38,960
Don't start out-

954
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,640
Me and Griffin have lots of matching pairs.

955
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:40,880
Right.

956
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,640
Don't start your new year in old underwear.

957
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,440
So important.

958
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,800
Get your sexy right.

959
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,600
Make a change.

960
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,080
Head to meundies.com slash my brother right now

961
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,080
and you can get 20% off your first order.

962
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,480
Again, meundies.com slash my brother.

963
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
Get yourself some new underwear.

964
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,120
Think about that as lounge pants

965
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,560
because they fucking changed my life.

966
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,480
If I was a like a video game character

967
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,360
and I had to wear the same outfit in like every scene

968
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,360
for my whole life, it would be these lounge pants.

969
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,240
And then on top, I would probably wear my,

970
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
I don't know, nice polo.

971
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,280
It's just like a nice tasteful collared shirt.

972
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,640
Yeah, like a nice polo.

973
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
And just dank ass lounge pants.

974
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,360
Got some messages here from listeners.

975
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,040
First up is from the Past Cast,

976
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,440
a weekly podcast dedicated to discussing pop culture topics

977
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,320
from the past.

978
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,880
Each one focuses on a different theme

979
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,000
as Rick and Ben talk about their experiences growing up.

980
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,240
Episodes last roughly 45 minutes.

981
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,960
I like that.

982
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
I like no one I'll get it in for.

983
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,160
And cover a broad range of categories

984
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,440
including video games, books, television, movies,

985
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,480
board games, fashion, music, and toys.

986
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,080
New episodes are released each Monday.

987
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,680
How dare you?

988
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,920
Monday Funday.

989
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
You're not part of the Monday Funday block.

990
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,480
You could be though.

991
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,400
The Monday Funday rock block is not.

992
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,480
We'll talk to our people.

993
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,000
We'll see if we can make room for you.

994
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll talk to my lawyer.

995
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,080
Until we can get you in the Monday Funday rock block

996
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,240
on an official stance, we're gonna need you to change.

997
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,200
Thursday seems good.

998
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,560
Nope, that's adventure zone day.

999
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
You can do Sunday mornings.

1000
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,280
So visit the pastcast.com and you can listen and subscribe

1001
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,200
to Rick and Ben.

1002
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,800
It's only gonna take 45 minutes.

1003
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
That's half a nap.

1004
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,800
Or you got that.

1005
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,080
That's two naps almost.

1006
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,120
We also have a message for CJ and this is from Charlie and Goran.

1007
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,160
Or Goran.

1008
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,960
Or Goran.

1009
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,080
I prefer Goran.

1010
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,720
It makes it sound like Godzilla monster.

1011
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,220
Okay.

1012
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,440
We want to wish our dear friend CJ a happy, happy belated birthday.

1013
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,680
I wonder if that's what people call Godzilla.

1014
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
I said Godzilla monster.

1015
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,200
I said they're Godzilla monster.

1016
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
Shallowing down our house buildings.

1017
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,920
With his foot stompers.

1018
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,040
Hey, that's a Mr. Skyscraper Godzilla monster.

1019
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
CJ turned 27 in August.

1020
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,200
Just missed it.

1021
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,400
CJ is a giant vegetarian Japanese speaking ear of corn from Nebraska

1022
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,400
who has a cat named Bucket and enjoys a nice glass of Riesling.

1023
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,400
That all sounds pretty straightforward.

1024
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,920
Are you like going down a checklist of human characteristics?

1025
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,000
Like yes, yes, has a cat named Bucket.

1026
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,520
Okay, this all seems so right.

1027
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,200
This all seems legit so far.

1028
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,560
Seems like a person.

1029
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,080
We love you so much and please understand our lateness.

1030
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,000
We didn't have the idea till later.

1031
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,040
Let's get brunch soon.

1032
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,560
Like we've tried to tell you this so many times.

1033
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,880
You don't have to take the heat for being late.

1034
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,680
We'll take the heat.

1035
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,280
We'll take the heat but I think we can make an exception this time.

1036
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,480
Charlie and Goran.

1037
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,560
Because I think we're fucking closer to the next birthday

1038
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,200
than the birthday that you originally intended.

1039
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,040
You have almost fucking split the uprights of the year.

1040
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,280
Yeah, happy early 28th birthday.

1041
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,680
And late 27th.

1042
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,280
We planned it so it would be equidistant between the two dates.

1043
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,880
It's two birthdays in one.

1044
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,720
Like this is, you've reached the point of the year

1045
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,200
where CJ does not even remember whether or not they have birthdays.

1046
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,160
Wait, birthday, do I have those?

1047
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,920
I got caught, I guess I did.

1048
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,800
Huh, weird.

1049
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,680
So happy birthday CJ.

1050
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
Happy birthday.

1051
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm Jesse Thorne.

1052
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
I'm Jordan Morris.

1053
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,520
The federal government has millions of dollars

1054
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,280
in programs and opportunities that you need to seize today.

1055
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,800
You're a taxpayer, right?

1056
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,320
Well then you've got it coming.

1057
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:26,240
Thanks to Uncle Sam, you can get grant programs for veterans.

1058
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Postage stamps that'll ensure your mail gets there in a timely fashion.

1059
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,680
Fruit for you and your family.

1060
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,040
Child care for your children that turns them into super soldiers.

1061
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,680
Get a million dollars to open your own lake.

1062
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Useful power tools that are easy on your soft, delicate hands.

1063
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,840
Your own personal radioactive brick.

1064
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,360
More sexual attention from everyone at the used bookstore.

1065
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
Greyhound tickets.

1066
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,920
Soft, gentle kisses from TV's John Goodman.

1067
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,200
A real narwhal.

1068
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,440
Athletic socks filled with stew.

1069
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,840
A valuable pamphlet on millet.

1070
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,760
Your father's approval.

1071
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
Don't wait right now.

1072
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,200
For all of this and more, drop us a line.

1073
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,560
Jordan, Jesse, go.

1074
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,680
123 iTunes Street or wherever you download podcasts.

1075
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,880
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

1076
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,360
Yep.

1077
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:13,600
Yes.

1078
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,200
Got a couple here.

1079
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,920
This one was sent in by game recognized game, Rachel Rosen.

1080
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,720
Thank you, Rachel.

1081
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, question mark.

1082
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,400
Question mark only has 2% best answers, which I guess is better than 1%,

1083
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,400
but it sort of lets you know the bar of quality we're about to duck under.

1084
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:41,200
Question mark asks, if someone was to clone Barack Obama, could the clone run for president?

1085
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,760
Huh.

1086
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,120
Yeah, as a thinker.

1087
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,120
So this assumes the form of cloning that's like one and one,

1088
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,600
like another adult Barack Obama steps out of the other two.

1089
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,000
No, it's a half formed baby Barack Obama.

1090
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,680
But he can talk like regular Barack Obama.

1091
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,880
I want to be next president.

1092
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,960
Yeah, I think in that case he could.

1093
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,080
I'm the cool one.

1094
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,120
You're cool?

1095
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,520
Sorry, clone Barack, you sound-

1096
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,560
Make baby Obama president.

1097
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,320
Okay, okay.

1098
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,960
Help with flag pin.

1099
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,760
Throw flag pin into slime torso.

1100
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,320
Vote for me, hope and slime.

1101
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,080
Put nutrient sucker on baby.

1102
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,240
Pick me up, Robot Biden.

1103
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,880
Take me, Robot Biden.

1104
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,760
Put me in your stomach, Robot Biden.

1105
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,600
Put me in your stomach, Robot Biden.

1106
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,520
I'm Barack clone bomber.

1107
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,520
I have a mess.

1108
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,080
Put me in my nutrient bath.

1109
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,400
I think he stands a good chance.

1110
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,720
Constitution wouldn't have-

1111
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,040
Fuck all to say about it, right?

1112
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,400
Nature versus nurture, baby.

1113
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,560
Well, that's not what that means at all.

1114
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,280
That's in the constitution right next to the separation of church and state.

1115
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,920
Yep, and we do a pretty good job of following that one too.

1116
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,000
I do want to see that where they're flipping through the constitution like,

1117
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,840
it doesn't say anything in here, I guess.

1118
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,040
I guess we're good.

1119
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,000
I guess it's fine.

1120
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,280
We could do what we always do and just make shit up based on-

1121
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,960
We could take one word from article one and then 16 words from article three

1122
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,480
and just throw them all together.

1123
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,080
Is that an apostrophe or a fuck?

1124
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,160
Or a fucking ketchup stain?

1125
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:52,560
I don't know.

1126
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,760
Let's call it an apostrophe.

1127
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,640
Okay, we've changed it.

1128
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,440
No clones.

1129
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,600
We could continue on with our 200 year old sham of pretending that

1130
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,880
dudes who did not know what cell phones were,

1131
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,760
can make it through the rules for us.

1132
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,840
They have any idea how things are going to be going now.

1133
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
They didn't have any Twitter followers

1134
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,760
and they're trying to tell me how to live my life.

1135
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,160
Do you know how many followers GW had?

1136
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,840
By which I mean George Washington?

1137
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,640
None.

1138
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,040
Zero.

1139
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,360
None.

1140
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,560
None. GW was a fucking egg.

1141
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,520
He was an egg.

1142
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,400
None.

1143
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:22,880
None.

1144
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,000
All right.

1145
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,240
He didn't even have a Facebook fan page.

1146
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,800
No, he did not.

1147
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:35,120
Let us assume that this is one of those fucking multiplicity,

1148
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,840
which is basically we have exited the realm of sci-fi

1149
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,480
and entered the realm of Michael Keaton magic.

1150
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,760
It's a multiplicity clone chamber.

1151
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,040
Okay.

1152
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,520
And President Barack Hussein Obama,

1153
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,840
a lot of people like to omit that middle name.

1154
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
Griffin says it because it matters.

1155
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,640
Steps into that and another Barack Obama comes out,

1156
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,720
steps up to the podium,

1157
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,800
surprise guests at the next Democratic debate.

1158
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,920
He's like, got you suckers.

1159
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:14,080
I very much enjoy the reality in which we can't convince people

1160
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:21,120
that Barack Obama is not like a secret Kenyan Muslim from space.

1161
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,440
And yet we will be able to convince him that no,

1162
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,880
this person who looks exactly like him in every way

1163
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,240
is not actually him.

1164
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,840
It's a fucking double standard, isn't it?

1165
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,120
Because if Barack clone Obama can't run for president,

1166
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,720
then Jeb Bush, who is clearly a slime time fail clone of G-dubs,

1167
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,560
shouldn't be able to get up there.

1168
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,360
You know what I mean?

1169
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,840
What if clone Barack Obama took like a pivot?

1170
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,240
It was like, he just turned on the old one.

1171
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,880
Like, unlike that last Obama, I'm a real Christian, wink.

1172
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,880
And Obama was like, what the fuck?

1173
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,880
He's like, I don't know.

1174
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,720
I was cloned in America.

1175
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,760
I don't know what to tell you.

1176
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,600
I was cloned in America 15 minutes ago.

1177
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,320
And I do have my birth certificate.

1178
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,040
It's more of a stamp.

1179
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,640
It's kind of a barcode.

1180
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,720
It's like a stamp that a scientist drew.

1181
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,680
It's basically a barcode on the back of my head.

1182
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,960
So you can see, if you look at that barcode, scan it in.

1183
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,280
That's right, when you read it after you scan it in,

1184
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,960
it says Barack Hussein Obama,

1185
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
but then the Hussein has been scratched out.

1186
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,840
And instead it says Earl, the most American name.

1187
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,560
Barack Earl, that's too bad.

1188
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
I was gonna go with Barack to say Obama,

1189
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,240
the sequel to Barack Obama.

1190
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,200
I love sequels.

1191
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,080
Yeah.

1192
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,400
Yeah, I think that, so yeah, I guess.

1193
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,720
I don't see any reason why not.

1194
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,560
I think he'd do a killer job, right?

1195
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah, he'd crush it.

1196
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,160
I guess he would retain all the memories

1197
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,360
and experience of Barack Obama.

1198
00:46:51,360 --> 00:47:00,560
Could we clone him now, but the clone would be eight years younger?

1199
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,600
You're saying it's upset.

1200
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,000
It's kind of a bummer to look at him now

1201
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,360
because it's like, homie, you aged like a billion years

1202
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,000
in the past eight years.

1203
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
What I'm saying, Griffin, is imagine a president, right?

1204
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,720
With the youth and vitality and springiness,

1205
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,040
his ability to leap from room to room

1206
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,280
that eight years ago Barack Obama had.

1207
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,240
But with all of the knowledge of how all this shit works

1208
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,520
and how to get shit done.

1209
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,640
Why just rewind to eight years?

1210
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,080
I wanna go way further back to fucking fresh ass Chicago Obama.

1211
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,680
That dude was the best, the best.

1212
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,200
I try to model myself and my life based on a single picture

1213
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,200
I saw once of Chicago Obama.

1214
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,160
And it was the freshest thing I've ever seen.

1215
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,400
He comes in smoking cigarettes and he just whips off his shades

1216
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,400
and he's like, I'm gonna fix this shit this time.

1217
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,040
He's dunking on Michael Jordan and Michael Jordan's clone.

1218
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,880
Like, we'll never get him.

1219
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,480
We can't stop Barack Obama.

1220
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,600
He's got all the knowledge of Barack old-Bama,

1221
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,000
but with all the youth and vitality of Barack young-Bama.

1222
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,880
Do you think if we clone Michael Jordan a dozen times,

1223
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,960
each one would go and master a different sport?

1224
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,440
Absolutely.

1225
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,960
MJ went on a baseball hiatus to explore.

1226
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,040
Conquered that.

1227
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,720
He did some baseball.

1228
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,680
He was the best at that.

1229
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,440
Everybody was like, all right, you did it.

1230
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,560
Please go back to basketball.

1231
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,680
You're making the rest of us look bad.

1232
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,920
But I think if we clone him a bunch,

1233
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,200
he would do that for every sport.

1234
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,120
Like hockey Jordan, golf Jordan.

1235
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,760
Football Jordan.

1236
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,320
Football Jordan.

1237
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,880
Oh, football Jordan, can you fucking imagine?

1238
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,960
He would be like the world's greatest wide receiver.

1239
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,760
Yeah, he would be.

1240
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,440
Because he would be on the fucking 50 yard line

1241
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,440
and he'd like jump to the end zone

1242
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,800
and stretch out like a cartoon

1243
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,280
because he still retains that space jam magic.

1244
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,280
Because he drank Michael's secret stuff.

1245
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,840
What would that movie be if he was football Jordan though?

1246
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,880
Football.

1247
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,480
Oh, because he couldn't call it space jam.

1248
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,040
Yeah.

1249
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,000
No, punting is not like jamming and punting

1250
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,080
are diametrically opposed in terms of like radical scale.

1251
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,560
Fair enough.

1252
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,680
Space Juke?

1253
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,160
Space Juke is fine.

1254
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,200
Space Down.

1255
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:03,840
Space Down.

1256
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,200
Space Down.

1257
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,720
It would be Space Down.

1258
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,480
The film Justin would be Space Down.

1259
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,160
Well, it works on a lot of levels

1260
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,400
because you get downs and you also get touchdowns.

1261
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,640
Yeah, and also you can like get down while dancing.

1262
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,720
So like, I'm sure the Quad City DJs-

1263
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,320
As you get tackled, you're taken down.

1264
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,800
The Quad City DJs can do something with this.

1265
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,120
I'm so glad, I see now in retrospect,

1266
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,600
I'm so glad I cloned the Quad City DJs

1267
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,440
into the Octuple City DJs.

1268
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,560
Oh, you made me do it.

1269
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,400
So we can, they can do this new song, Space Down.

1270
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,120
Oh my God, no, Justin, you left the cloner on.

1271
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,160
Dodeca City DJs, shut it down.

1272
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,560
They've taken up all available matter.

1273
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,320
The problem is if you clone 12 Michael Jordans, right?

1274
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,040
Statistically, one of them will be super evil.

1275
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:53,680
Oh, fuck.

1276
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,640
Right?

1277
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,200
Yeah, and nobody can stop him.

1278
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,560
No one can stop him.

1279
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,280
And the fucking-

1280
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:01,680
Except the other 11 Michael Jordans.

1281
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,080
Okay.

1282
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,560
We're just lucky, like we're just lucky

1283
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,320
he decided to basketball.

1284
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,280
Like if he had like walked into,

1285
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,440
like if his dad had been like,

1286
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,000
Michael, someday you're gonna be the greatest person puncher ever.

1287
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,080
And you're gonna be the king of strangling.

1288
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:20,000
You're gonna be the strangle king.

1289
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,400
No one will catch you and you'll strangle everybody.

1290
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,160
He would still be going door to door,

1291
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,440
like why can't we stop him?

1292
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,200
Someone please.

1293
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,320
Someone please.

1294
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,600
The police would have just given up.

1295
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,480
Everyone would just accept that you had like a one in six chance

1296
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,240
of being strangled by Michael Jordan.

1297
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,480
911, 911, he's here, he's here, he's here.

1298
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,040
Who's here?

1299
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,400
Michael Jordan, he's here to strangle me.

1300
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,280
Oh, that sucks.

1301
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,000
That's right.

1302
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:40,400
Sorry.

1303
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,040
You had a good run.

1304
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,480
Can you send the cops or something?

1305
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,880
Oh yeah, we never thought of that before.

1306
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,600
Hey cops, you guys want to go stop Michael Jordan

1307
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,720
from strangling this guy?

1308
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,600
Yeah, they can't.

1309
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,960
They can't stop number 23.

1310
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,760
Good luck.

1311
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,200
That's right, he's still number 23

1312
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:55,120
because he's got a strangle jersey, idiot.

1313
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,640
I'm glad you're dying today.

1314
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,040
Hi, it's me, Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

1315
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,760
I have an announcement to all the citizens of Chicago.

1316
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,520
Michael's coming.

1317
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,640
He's coming for you.

1318
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,240
And there's nothing we can do about it.

1319
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,880
Everybody get up.

1320
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,640
It's time to strangle.

1321
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,080
We've got a real thing.

1322
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,960
Crangle.

1323
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,480
Welcome to the space.

1324
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,120
You okay?

1325
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,400
Michael Jordan got to him.

1326
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,800
Why didn't he strangle me?

1327
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,200
Why didn't he strangle me?

1328
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,160
This is the end of the show.

1329
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,880
That's the last thing we talked about on the show.

1330
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,640
So until this, when I said thanks again to MeUndies

1331
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,800
who are dedicated to offering the most comfortable underwear,

1332
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,640

1334
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:37,680
Nice.

1335
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,040
Justin, you did that real good.

1336
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:39,280
Thanks.

1337
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,800
It sounded like a real professional.

1338
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,800
Yeah, you really nailed it.

1339
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,200
I did.

1340
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,280
I think I did way better than Justin would have.

1341
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,440
Wait a minute.

1342
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:56,800
I mean, oh, I mean, I'm glad I did a good job.

1343
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,840
Glad I did a good job.

1344
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,080
Wait, are you a robot or a clone?

1345
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,560
Well, we've been talking about clones all episode.

1346
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:03,920
I know, but you stuttered like a robot.

1347
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,880
What would be the thematic consistency of me being a robot?

1348
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,120
Hey, Justin, don't part the kimono right now, okay?

1349
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,680
Listen, I'll pop whatever cherries.

1350
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,720
I'm in hell.

1351
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,760
I can't reclaim it.

1352
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,640
I can't reclaim it.

1353
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,760
It has to stay where it is.

1354
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,000
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winter.

1355
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,760
She sort of theme song into departure off the album,

1356
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,720
putting the days to bed.

1357
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,760
It's a good album.

1358
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,840
And I hope a lot of you guys got it for candle nights

1359
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,480
and listen to it nonstop because that's what I do every day.

1360
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,640
I listened to the album front to back twice.

1361
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,960
Takes up a lot of time out of my day.

1362
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,640
Yeah, but it's worth it.

1363
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,800
I want to say thank you to everybody who chipped in

1364
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,200
and helped out on the my brother,

1365
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,720
my brother and me appreciation group.

1366
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:50,400
We had our annual charity drive called NBNBA Angels

1367
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,240
where we help out people in Huntington, West Virginia.

1368
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,720
And it was a stunning response.

1369
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,000
Hundreds, like literally hundreds of people here

1370
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,400
in West Virginia and specifically Huntington

1371
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,760
and the surrounding area had more of a Christmas

1372
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,640
because the people in our appreciation group

1373
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,080
are dope as hell.

1374
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,120
So dope.

1375
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,400
So dope, have you been following the secret Santa stuff

1376
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,120
they did for each other?

1377
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,480
It's like a secret, a self-organized secret Santa trade-off

1378
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,120
that's going on.

1379
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,560
And the gifts that people are getting each other

1380
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,840
are like insane.

1381
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,200
They're so wonderful.

1382
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,040
Like they're almost all like handmade,

1383
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,080
great, jokey, fun, awesome gifts.

1384
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,400
And that group fills me with life.

1385
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,560
You should, yeah, that groups that it's called

1386
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,160
the my brother, my brother and me appreciation group.

1387
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,760
We have 303 people who are waiting to get in.

1388
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,760
So maybe we could start sorting through those.

1389
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,880
Yeah, we should probably take care of that.

1390
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,560
Well, I don't trust fucking Travis to do it

1391
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,800
because then it's like, oh, hi, my name is Carolyn Goodboobs

1392
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,480
and I'm in a billion groups

1393
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,400
and I just joined Facebook a minute ago.

1394
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,320
And Travis is like, yep, sounds good.

1395
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,720
Welcome to the club, Goodboobs.

1396
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,080
You want to buy some cheese?

1397
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,880
The last time you chastised me, I've gotten very precise

1398
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,160
and I search and I do it and that's what's taking so long.

1399
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,480
You can, if you join our group, you can also see

1400
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,080
Hamilton composer Lin-Manuel Miranda troll Griffin

1401
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,840
with pictures of gold dust just in the opportune moments.

1402
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,360
That fool hit me on Twitter too.

1403
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,400
And it's like, it made me double afraid.

1404
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,720
Like I'm gonna open up Snapchat and it'll be like,

1405
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,360
hey, Snapchat waiting for me from gold dust

1406
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,200
and fucking Lin gave him my number or something.

1407
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,400
And then no one will fucking believe me

1408
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,920
because this is a Snapchat and it's gone.

1409
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,760
Oh, gold dust.

1410
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,160
Anyway, that's our Facebook group.

1411
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,040
We're on Twitter, we're at MB, MBAM.

1412
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,320
We haven't mentioned a while, but maybe go to iTunes

1413
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,640
and give us like a rating or review.

1414
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,560
That's super helpful if you like the show.

1415
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,160
It's the least you could do.

1416
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,080
And maybe tell a friend.

1417
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,600
Maybe tell a friend just this once.

1418
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,160
2016 is gonna be a good year to tell a friend

1419
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,600
to listen to my brother, my brother and me

1420
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,200
and tweet with the hashtag, hashtag MB, MBAM,

1421
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,760
that kind of thing.

1422
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,760
I want to say in response to our decision

1423
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,280
to claim that 2016 is 2016, building bridges,

1424
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,800
we got a lot of people.

1425
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,400
A lot of people, a lot of kibitzing with that.

1426
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,320
And a lot of the theme of that kibitz,

1427
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,920
a lot of stuff I'm seeing is like,

1428
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,000
I can't believe you guys didn't think of blank.

1429
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,120
But more importantly, a lot of it is,

1430
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,440
I can't believe you didn't think of like 20 tricks team

1431
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,560
continue the con.

1432
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,800
And it's like the fact that you thought we should do that

1433
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,560
is exactly why it is so important that this is 2016

1434
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,720
building bridges because it's time for us

1435
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,400
to do some selfless shit for each other

1436
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
and help put this shit back together.

1437
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,800
Because guys look around you, it's falling apart.

1438
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,640
Yep, it's falling apart.

1439
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,120
We need to fix it.

1440
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,480
We're the only ones who can do this.

1441
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,400
But anyway, thanks for listening to the show.

1442
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,600
We love you very much.

1443
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,360
Hey, go listen to the other MaxFun shows,

1444
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,280
the other shows on the MaxFun network.

1445
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
There's lots of so many amazing programs

1446
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,400
like the Flophouse and Stop Podcasting Yourself

1447
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,200
and Lady to Lady and Can I Pet Your Dog.

1448
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,840
And you should go check out Oh No Ross and Carrie.

1449
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,080
They've got some very special stuff coming up

1450
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,040
in the next couple of months.

1451
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,800
And I think everybody's really going to dig it.

1452
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:09,840
So start listening now and rare up to it.

1453
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:12,000
I want to do a special plug for the Adventure Zone.

1454
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,760
It's a podcast that the three of us do with our dad

1455
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,440
where we play Dungeons and Dragons.

1456
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,040
And I'm real proud of it.

1457
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,320
And if you haven't listened

1458
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,400
because it is all about Dungeons and Dragons,

1459
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,720
I promise you we don't actually play that much Dungeons

1460
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,600
and Dragons in it.

1461
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,080
We mostly just make shit up.

1462
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,400
And it's sort of like a communal

1463
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,440
like fucking psychic storytelling adventure.

1464
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,080
I was trying to figure out how many spells I should know.

1465
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,600
I started reading the rules theoretically

1466
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:39,680
for how was it supposed to work.

1467
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,800
Wow, it is a liberal, a liberal take on that, huh?

1468
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,280
We are off book, so to speak.

1469
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,200
And the book is the Player's Handbook, fifth edition.

1470
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,320
Anyway, the Adventure Zone.

1471
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,360
Go listen to it and Sawbones and Bunker Buddies.

1472
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,600
Can I Pet Your Dog?

1473
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,240
Can I Pet Your Dog.

1474
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,040
I already plugged that one.

1475
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,680
Nice try.

1476
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,480
Oh, sorry.

1477
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:00,720
And I'm working on a new one

1478
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,720
that should be coming up pretty soon.

1479
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,520
Yep, but I think everyone's really gonna take.

1480
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,440
Yeah, yeah.

1481
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,320
Can you fucking focus?

1482
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,480
I don't do anything else.

1483
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,280
I guess that's true.

1484
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,720
I was laying around with 102 degree fever

1485
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,400
and in a fever dream, I woke up and went,

1486
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,440
oh, new podcast.

1487
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,240
Cherry Pop and Daddy's Fan Cast.

1488
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,560
Honey, honey, give me a pen and paper right now, quick.

1489
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:28,240
I've solved it.

1490
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,160
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

1491
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,800
Yeah, please.

1492
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,920
Please.

1493
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,120
Can I read a question and also the description of it?

1494
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,560
I know this is unorthodox, but it made me laugh really hard.

1495
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:39,280
Sure.

1496
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,640
It's by, sent in by level 9000 Yajuru Drew Davenport.

1497
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,520
Thank you, Drew.

1498
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,760
It's by Yajuru Answers user Ducky who asks,

1499
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,880
are potato guns deadly?

1500
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,480
I built a handheld spud musket.

1501
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,640
I know it hits pretty hard because it made a dent

1502
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
the size of a Buick in our hay barn,

1503
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,200
but my grandson is a sleeping late again.

1504
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,520
I was thinking a good Christmas prank would be

1505
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,000
to wake him up with a blast to the face.

1506
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,800
Oh, God.

1507
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,040
I just don't want the blessed goof to die.

1508
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,800
I just want to rattle his cage a bit.

1509
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,480
Fucking grandpa rules.

1510
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:14,480
That's good.

1511
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,280
Your update.

1512
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,840
Oh, no.

1513
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,800
Oh, God.

1514
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,760
The blessed goof.

1515
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,320
The blessed goof is down.

1516
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,200
Thanks.

1517
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,160
What do I say?

1518
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,200
I'm Justin McElroy.

1519
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,480
I'm Justin McElroy.

1520
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,040
I'm Travis McElroy.

1521
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:27,840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1522
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,480
I'm my brother, my brother, me, because your dad's square on the lips.

1523
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,280
Maximumfun.org.

1524
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,320
Comedy and culture.

1525
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,440
Artist-owned.

1526
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,480
Listener-supported.

1527
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,000
Welcome to Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

1528
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,480
Ross.

1529
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,040
Hi, Carrie.

1530
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,720
What do you think is creepier?

1531
00:58:58,720 --> 00:58:59,200
OK.

1532
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,840
You jump into a swimming pool.

1533
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,760
All of a sudden, the water goes away.

1534
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,080
And instead of water, there is the bones of your dead ancestors.

1535
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,640
Ew.

1536
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,240
Or our show.

1537
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:13,760
That's pretty tough, because we visited a live exorcism.

1538
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,520
We joined the Ordo Templi Orientis, where we had to worship a naked lady.

1539
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,440
Oh, and we joined that Tony Olomo cult.

1540
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,320
They were scary.

1541
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,040
Super creepy.

1542
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,560
We joined the Ethere Society.

1543
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,880
We tried penis enlargement, or at least I did.

1544
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,200
Oh, boy.

1545
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,400
I tried breast enlargement.

1546
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,480
We have basically done every creepy, weird, fringe thing, except for thousands more, which

1547
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,160
we will get to if you listen to our show.

1548
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,880
I'd still say the swimming pool of my ancestors' bones.

1549
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,560
Well, then I don't even know if people should listen.

1550
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,440
I guess they shouldn't.

1551
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:56,960
But if you want to, we're at Maximum Fun, and the show's called Anna, Ross, and Carrie.
