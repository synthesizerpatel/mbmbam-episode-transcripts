1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the modern

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,960
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. And I'm your

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,480
sweet baby brother, Griffin McGregor. Uh, welcome. We made it. First of all, if you're listening to

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:13,200
this, we made it. I 12 o' one a.m. All my skin fell off. New skin, 2017, new fresh skin. We cannot

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,200
begin this episode in earnest without talking about earnest scared new year. Scared new year?

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
Is that what you said? That's one of the ones that didn't come out, but it was filmed and edited

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,680
and just had some posts, some like color correction to do, but they just didn't make it out in the

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,400
theaters because there wasn't a marketing budget for it. And also his dick was like all over this

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,880
new year. Yeah, we, uh, so we need to talk about, uh, what this year is called. We've had many

14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,080
different suggestions and we need to settle it before we can begin our episode proper.

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Okay. Okay. I have some here that I've jotted down. Um, let me give them to you.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,520
Okay. Uh, I'll just run through them and then we can discuss them all ad nauseum. Um, 20 even teen

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,240
restoring balance. 20 given teen. Okay. Well, hold on. Let's talk about, let's talk about the

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,640
discreet ways in which the, your suggestions are bad before we move on to like another one.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,720
I can't holistically talk about how they're bad. I need to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I see. All right.

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,160
Yeah. Yeah. Let's tear me down bit by bit. New year, new year. Uh huh. Uh, 20 even teen

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,120
is it's was the, I don't think the last year was imbalanced as much as it was just extraordinarily

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,800
bad. And I don't even think that suggesting that like if there had been good stuff ticket to like

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,240
for each bad for every, you know, famous Harry Potter diehard character actor who passed away.

24
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,760
Hey, if you received a $100 check in the mail, I don't think, I don't think that the balance was

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,320
the issue last year. I think it just stunk. That's fair. That's fair. And that was one of

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,120
the more esoteric ones. I realized that because restoring balance was that me. I get that. What

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,800
about 20 given teen helping when you can? Still doesn't rhyme with seven, does it?

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Well, we got to get away from the rhymes with seven because then our options are 20 heaven teen,

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,960
which may be it or 20 Kevin teen or 20 Devon teen. Well, this one, this one was, uh,

30
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,360
suggested by a listener named Rachel. And I really liked it. 20 Reven teen. Reven on the end.

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,480
Kick it into high gear. Yeah. I feel like we need to get,

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,240
last year's was a fucking disaster building bridges. I think it was too esoteric. It was

33
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,560
too abstract. And so people didn't know how the fuck to do it. Even though I thought it was pretty

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,880
clear. Just like be cool for once. I thought it was pretty clear, but apparently not. I think

35
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,600
our instructions can't just be like, rev it up. It has to be like, go donate your money and time

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:55,760
to this place. Like go treat your body right with this specific like juice cleanse. What about this

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
one? And this, if you have problems with rhymes, this might bother you, but 20 sweating teen

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,560
getting fit. That's not even a thing. It's close though. Also, I don't have sweat glands in my body

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,720
and you know that I have a special spray bottle I carry around a spritz myself with. So thank you,

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,760
Travis. Now I'm thinking about my spritz bottle and all the many, many sort of like social snafus

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:28,400
it's gotten me into. Joseph Gordon Levitan celebrating the works of JGL. Yeah, we're getting

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,280
closer. That's what I thought. I wanted something that was like, yeah, you could mark that off a

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,760
list. You know what I mean? Like I did watch the complete third rock from the sun today and I feel

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,160
great. Yeah. Well, Travis, this means that you would have to watch and like Looper and I don't

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,920
think that's, yeah. Well, maybe it's time to, you know, give it a second chance and appreciate the

46
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,640
amazing work that JGL does in it, even if I don't like the massive plot holes. Well, I have one to

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:03,200
suggest. How about this? Hey, all right. 20 raven teen. We've all got ravens. Now here's what I said.

48
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:10,320
Here's the thing about it is by the end of the year, everybody's got a sort of pet raven.

49
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,960
So we're talking about a one to one human raven ratio. Yeah, we got to find a lot of ravens. We

50
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,000
have to bond with them. We have to train them in the ways of old. The bonding has to take place.

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,720
But 20 raven teen subtitle, everybody's got ravens. Everybody's got ravens. I like it. I'll tell you

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,600
why. They got long, smooth beaks. Now, the problem, Justin, is going to be educating the masses on the

53
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
difference between ravens and crows. Yeah. Because I think that that's probably a very common issue

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,120
with me and everyone else. Well, it's pretty, actually, it's pretty easy to tell the difference.

55
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,600
If you see a crow, you think there's a black bird. If you see a raven, you think, oh, God,

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
something's terribly wrong. Oh, if you see a raven, it's like, oh, oh, no. Oh, no. What's happened

57
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,040
here? This is very, very bad. I'll tell you what, this is going to be very confusing for raven Simone,

58
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,840
isn't it? Yeah, a little bit. Because she's going to be very motivating. This is my impression of

59
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,720
her in this year at Trader Joe's. Yeah. What did you? Oh, was it? Okay. Sorry. I thought you were

60
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,920
talking to me. It was the bird again. It's okay. It happens a lot this year. Thanks McElroy brothers.

61
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,120
What if in the process of 20 raven team, we discovered that there is actually one raven for

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,000
every human, but you have to find like your one, like maybe your raven lives in like Africa. And

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,440
it's like, well, there aren't, I don't know where my raven is. Where's the raven for Travis? The

64
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,640
raven that is meant to be with you will have to find you because it can fly. Oh, right. I mean,

65
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:50,480
the burden is on the raven for sure to find it's human, but it's not 20 human team. Everyone gets

66
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:58,000
humans Justin. No, that's not, that's no good. That's no good. What about, what about 20 Bevan

67
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,480
team? I like 20 Bevan team. 20 Bevan team is very good because it can be, it lends itself to a party

68
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,440
atmosphere. You know, of course. Yeah, but there's people out there who don't, who don't like to

69
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:17,120
enjoy, but there's a flip side. Nobody's drinking enough water. 20 Bevan team. Are you, are you

70
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,000
watching your water intake? Hey, is it time to cut out those sugary sodas? 20 Bevan team is not

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,040
about indulgence. It's about analyzation and awareness of your beverage consumption. 2017

72
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:39,600
Standrated. How about this one? 20 Serpentine. Stay, stay frosty. Like stay on your, kind of stay

73
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,160
on your toes a little bit. Like keep them, it can be a lot of different things, but like keep them

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,880
guessing. Like they're going to be, they're going to be looking at where you're going and you've got

75
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,480
to juke that expectation at every point. So it's not, it's not even like, it doesn't even have to

76
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,960
be associated with like a, a particularly, you know, paranoid worldview or whatever. It's just

77
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,760
like, keep them guessing. Keep, keep fucking surprising them. Yeah. Put that, put that into

78
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:11,360
like a four or five word kind of summary, Griffin. 20 Serpentine. Keep them guessing.

79
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,640
Keep them guessing. I like that. 20, cause this, it could be so many different parts of your life.

80
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,520
First of all, if, if the authority's trying to keep you down, you can keep them guessing like

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,920
that, but it can also just be like, if things are feeling a little bit stale and you're in a rut,

82
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,160
it's because you've been zagging for too long. It is time to zig. What about weaving and or bobbing?

83
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,920
I mean, I guess if you're playing paintball, I guess if you're playing paintball, then yes,

84
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,680
it's like a very good year name. Cause you're like, hmm. Sorry, I was just going to suggest a

85
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,320
different one. No, I mean, I feel like I nailed it, but let's see what you've got. We'll come

86
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,480
back around, Griffin. Yeah. What about, I know I've seen like, I, this is going to seem like

87
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,680
I'm in a bit of a rut, but what about 20 Rivendine? Let's all appreciate the excellent sequel to Mist.

88
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,800
Yeah. Now here's the thing about 20 Rivendine. Riven's a great game. Sure. Sure. Everybody

89
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:16,080
knows that and appreciates it. But did you know, but did you know 1997 was the original release of

90
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,800
Riven? That's right. We would be marking the 20th anniversary of the excellent sequel to Mist, Riven.

91
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,840
Yeah. And that's something we can do. Yeah, we can do that. That's something we can fucking,

92
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,400
nobody can build a bridge, but maybe we can all get on fucking Steam or GOG or some shit and just

93
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,600
download Riven and appreciate it. I love this, Justin, because there is a very quantifiable

94
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,200
success rate here, and that is if by the end of 2017, we effectively get greenlit a sequel to

95
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,000
Riven. If suddenly the sales on Steam- They've made like 50 other Mist games. So many other Mist games have happened.

96
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,320
Yeah, there's a lot of Mist games. But is there a Riven 2 where it's just like R and then

97
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,960
Roman numeral I I V E N? But then somebody sees it and they're like, Riven? Well, yeah, because it's a

98
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,560
combination of Riven and Soul Reaver. I mean, they're back, Rand Miller's back in the mix. He

99
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,800
made a production this year, so he's still in the game. And they did just release a masterpiece

100
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,440
edition of Mist, like real Mist, a few years ago. Riven's on your iPad now, by the way.

101
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,400
Shit, yeah. Just go get it. Just go play Riven. Oh boy, have I got it.

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:38,480
20-sextenteen. Time to bust one.

103
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,600
We don't need more excuse to talk about sexual things on this program. How about 20-sextenteen?

104
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
Navigating by the stars. Navigating by the stars while busting one.

105
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
No.

106
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
No.

107
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
No.

108
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
20, 20-serv-en-teen.

109
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:05,920
And this can be like, go serve your community, but also like diss somebody out on the playground

110
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,280
when they got served.

111
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Ooh.

112
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Hmm.

113
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
20-serv-en-teen's interesting.

114
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,120
Because it also sounds like you're saying it with some sort of untraceable accent.

115
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
20-serv-en-teen.

116
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
I kind of like that.

117
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
20-serv-en-teen, let's all talk with accents.

118
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I love this, Griffin.

119
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Right?

120
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,480
20-serv-en-teen, yo.

121
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,120
I love 20-serv-en-teen.

122
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,700
I love this, Griffin, because we've never before had a year where you can pick and choose

123
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,880
whether you want it to be a helping others or insulting others year.

124
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,960
Yeah, you're either serving people or serving people.

125
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,400
Okay, but I don't want that level of, I don't want it to be binary like that.

126
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,160
You introduced it, though, Griffin.

127
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,240
You can't put that tiger back in the cage.

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,680
As a joke, because I thought we had nailed it with 20-serv-en-teen, and so I thought

129
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,720
all these other ones were just gonna be goofy-goofy-mops.

130
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Hmm.

131
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Here's the-

132
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,520
I mean, we're just brainstorming right now.

133
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,520
This is just spitballing.

134
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,240
I don't care if it takes a full hour.

135
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,680
I'll do this for an entire hour.

136
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Yeah, fuck it.

137
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
I don't give a shit.

138
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Hey, listen to this.

139
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Let me hit you guys with this.

140
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,160
Like, 20-serv-en-teen, Travis, can you make a Google Doc?

141
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,360
Can you just open a Google Doc, Travis?

142
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Sure.

143
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Sure.

144
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,880
I'll just make a Google Doc, Justin.

145
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,640
Okay, so I should do it?

146
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
Yeah.

147
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Is that what you're telling me?

148
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Yeah.

149
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
Yeah, okay.

150
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,680
Let me just call, let me just call Sergey and have him launch a Google Doc for us, I

151
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
guess.

152
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,280
Okay, so I'm opening up a Google Doc.

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
Hmm.

154
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,920
And put at the top in bold, 20-serv-en-teen, keep them guessing.

155
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
I have another one that I came up with, we put out a tweet too, but I came up with one

156
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
out of my brain.

157
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
Is it in the Google document?

158
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,100
Because if not, it will not be officially considered for consideration.

159
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,480
I'm going to type it in as I say it.

160
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,240
Well, that doesn't sound like an audio product that we can all believe in.

161
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,240
It's 20-slev-en-teen.

162
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
I thought Lucky Number Slevin was an okay movie.

163
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
It was a good flick.

164
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
It was a good flick.

165
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,920
Josh Hartnett did a good job in that flick, and you know who else did?

166
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Yeah.

167
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Bruno.

168
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Hello.

169
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Just subtitle, it was a good flick.

170
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
It was a good flick.

171
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,920
It was a good flick.

172
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,520
A bit confusing there at the end, and I thought Lucy Lou was a little bit underutilized, but

173
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,400
Lucky Number Slevin, also maybe a bad name for a picture.

174
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah.

175
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,000
And via the transitive property, a bad name for a year.

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,360
Or is it such a bad name for a movie that it's a great name for a year?

177
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Oops.

178
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,880
Now, I want to throw something out there and just let me know if this is grabbing you guys

179
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,880
at all.

180
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,480
It's about 20-elven-teen.

181
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:55,280
So that's about just embracing nature, living forever, and sweet bow tricks.

182
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:01,080
So those are the three things, is embrace nature, live forever, sweet bow tricks.

183
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Oh, hold on.

184
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Wait.

185
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
What was that middle one?

186
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Live forever.

187
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
Wait.

188
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,260
Hold on.

189
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,120
Do elves live forever?

190
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
Fuck yeah, dude.

191
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
They're not real, Travis.

192
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
They live as long as I fucking say they do.

193
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:20,680
Like, I can get a good looking windswept blonde braided hair and clothes made out of leaves

194
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,800
and shooting a bow extremely good and never dead.

195
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Ooh.

196
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Never die.

197
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
That's the life.

198
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I like this one.

199
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
That's the life for me.

200
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I like this one.

201
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,800
We put out the tweet.

202
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,320
So Amy suggested, and I like this, 27 clean, cleanse us, wash away the trash here.

203
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,400
But that can be any, that could be like 25th clean, 29th clean.

204
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Yeah, fair.

205
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
That's fair.

206
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
But I like it.

207
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
I do like it.

208
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:51,720
Um, here's, somebody named Tab1Lamo on Twitter just said, dust off them old boots.

209
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Which, let's, don't fucking, don't fucking laugh at our fucking listeners.

210
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,600
Dust off them old boots.

211
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,800
It's not, what year is it?

212
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,320
Dust off them, it's, it's January 2nd.

213
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Dust off them old boots.

214
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm not, like, I cannot consider 27 clean.

215
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,560
I'm sorry, Travis.

216
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,580
I'm removing it for consideration because it does not play on seven.

217
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,360
You can't just leave seven in there.

218
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Okay.

219
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,400
How about Kelsey said, 20 never teen, no teens allowed.

220
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,160
I am, they get everything else, so.

221
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Yeah.

222
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,960
I do like 20 never teen, no teens allowed.

223
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,920
I do think, because I think that's fun because I feel like we've bent over backwards in our

224
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,640
six years to try to bring the teens in.

225
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,240
And I think it's fun to finally turn our backs on them.

226
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,680
You can attract teens to your comedy podcast in one hand, and you can shit in the other,

227
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,040
and at the end of the day, not many teens are gonna, you will not get that demographic,

228
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
unfortunately.

229
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,840
How do you, how do you guys feel about 2011 teen, the year of baking?

230
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
Because I, my, here's my fear.

231
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,120
Here's pluses and minuses.

232
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,680
One, I got a bread machine for Christmas.

233
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Hello.

234
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
That, that's a plus.

235
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Okay, that's huge.

236
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,560
I've already made a crunchy loaf, okay.

237
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,280
I made a good loaf, and you know what, this afternoon, I've got a big block of my Google

238
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,920
Cal, my Gcal, and it just says cinnamon raisin bread, because that's how it's gonna go.

239
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,720
Did Sergei set that up for you, or?

240
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,040
Yeah, Sergei set that up for me.

241
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Now here's the flip on this one, is I feel like Great British Bake Off pretty much kicked

242
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:35,200
off like the biggest baking year ever, like probably 2015, is when that hit in a major

243
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
way.

244
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I feel like I missed the zeitgeist in a major way.

245
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,920
I feel like I missed the zeitgeist on that one, so I'm, maybe 2011 teen, the year of

246
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,720
baking is like not great.

247
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,400
Aaron Keyes suggested 20 Estefan teen, Rhythm is Gonna Get You, which I, I like this, this

248
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:58,200
could just be like, listen to more, listen to more music, especially this specific, very

249
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,160
specific music, listen to it, please.

250
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,800
Without any clarification, Zach suggested 20 Schlepping teen, which I like, because

251
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,480
like, does that mean like, we're moving this year, or is it just like, get out there, walk

252
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,240
around, I'll move this from place to place all year long.

253
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:25,360
Aitsgray suggested 2016 too, which I'm not very happy about, I'm not excited about that

254
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,320
as an opportunity.

255
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:36,640
Jared suggested 20 Kevin clean, so this is the year where we get all our Kevins, our

256
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,760
Kevin hearts, our Kevin Arnold's fictional man, and we get them together and we just

257
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,760
scrub them all down.

258
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
Becky suggested 20 Jepsen teen.

259
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,960
That's, that's every year for me, thank you.

260
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,760
Also, I very much doubt that she's gonna put anything out this year.

261
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,040
I would be overjoyed if she did, but I'm just saying between emotion and then the b-sides,

262
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,400
it is unlikely.

263
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,960
20 Shaven teen?

264
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Like get rid of the beards?

265
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
That's from you?

266
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
No.

267
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
No, Travis needs that beard.

268
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
That's my brand.

269
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,840
Well, I think that's all the suggestions we got, so this was not as rich and deep a vein

270
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,400
as we thought it was going to be.

271
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,280
20 17 Magazine?

272
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,280
That's from Trey Smith.

273
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,960
Okay.

274
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,960
I feel like...

275
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,760
Somebody said 27 B's.

276
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,560
Well, so...

277
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Fine.

278
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Like there's...

279
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,840
That's from a radiated snake on 27 B's.

280
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,800
I feel like some people aren't taking the exercise very seriously and some of those

281
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,240
people are on our podcast.

282
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,120
Oh, I like it.

283
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
I don't know.

284
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,360
Okay, so let's look at what we have on the official list right now.

285
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:58,280
We have, and we may be able to eliminate some of these as we go, 20 servant teen, serve

286
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,120
your community or serve your community, Joseph Gordon Levitt teen, I feel like it's not going

287
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
to fly.

288
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Well...

289
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Are we agreed on...

290
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
All right.

291
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes, I will sacrifice George, but everyone can celebrate it in their own way.

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
It's just not the official year.

293
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
I understand that.

294
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,320
Do we need to settle on one?

295
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,400
Can we just let people sort of embrace whichever sort of...

296
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,520
I feel like this is something that people really rely on.

297
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
You're right.

298
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
You're right.

299
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,720
To help set a path for them.

300
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,440
And that's why it's so important to have something that is...

301
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:35,920
The problem with, okay, let's review, just do a quick recap to bring us up to speed here.

302
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,360
The first was Zolo, right?

303
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
Yes.

304
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Zolo was 2010.

305
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,280
Zolo was 2010 and that was other people called it Zolo first.

306
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,460
That was not in any way ours.

307
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,120
And I guess that just meant like Yolo, like go do the damn thing.

308
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,240
Now in 20...

309
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,680
Did we have a 2011?

310
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,280
I thought we called it Zol, but I don't remember having like a specific...

311
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,800
I remember calling it Zol at least once, but I don't think...

312
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,680
I don't remember if we had...

313
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,480
I don't remember.

314
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,640
Now I do remember...

315
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Now 2012.

316
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
Get it.

317
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Right?

318
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Get it.

319
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,640
That was...

320
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Was that get it?

321
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Doing it in 20 does.

322
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
20 does.

323
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
That's right.

324
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
We do it.

325
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
We do it.

326
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,840
Then it was 20 dirt, dig it up, get it out there.

327
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,360
I feel like we didn't 20 dirt it very well, but that was what it is.

328
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
That was what it was about.

329
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,760
That was what it was about.

330
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
2014...

331
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,760
Was 2014.

332
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,200
No, it couldn't have possibly been...

333
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,840
We couldn't have done that if not for 2013.

334
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,240
2014 was 20 forward.

335
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Right.

336
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
That was just about...

337
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
All about momentum.

338
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Momentum.

339
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
Keeping up.

340
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
That was the theme.

341
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
That was the theme.

342
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,720
2015 was probably the best.

343
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,720
If I could say...

344
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
Yeah.

345
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
Yeah.

346
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,720
That was the best.

347
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,000
2015 was just about grifs.

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,920
2015, 2015 the con is on.

349
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Right.

350
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,120
And what I loved about that year was it definitely was going to happen.

351
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,080
So it did provide a little...

352
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:14,000
It lets you get your own grifs and then acknowledge other grifs that were happening all around

353
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you.

354
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes.

355
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,840
And I remember I married an old person and I got all their rubies and emeralds.

356
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,280
So it was a very successful year for me.

357
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Yeah.

358
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,000
20 grif team was great.

359
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,840
2016 is where things start to go awry, I think.

360
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,720
It was well intentioned building bridges, but the problem was nobody did the dag gun

361
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
thing.

362
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:48,040
You know the problem with 2016 building bridges is that before grifs, momentum, getting it,

363
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,520
digging it up, digging the dirt out, those are all individual activities.

364
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
Right.

365
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,560
Which I think you can do on your own as like a guiding principle for yourself.

366
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:02,920
2016 was like look around, like you have to have another willing participant to build

367
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
a bridge.

368
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Yeah.

369
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,560
You need to build a bridge from both sides.

370
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
You know what I mean?

371
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Here's-

372
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Yeah.

373
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,560
I don't know if that's how bridges work.

374
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,560
I think it is.

375
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,400
I think they start in the middle actually and then they go out to the side.

376
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,600
So here's all I'm saying because we're also getting a lot of suggestions from people who

377
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,760
are like the apocalypse and it's like no we don't, no come on.

378
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
You know we don't fuck with that.

379
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,600
You know us better than that.

380
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,060
And we know you better than that.

381
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,320
And that's a narrative construct guys.

382
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,900
Stop thinking of things in storybook terms, okay?

383
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,960
Live in the real world here with us where we're all just like trying to get fucking

384
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
through it.

385
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
We're all just trying to get through it.

386
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Okay.

387
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,760
And so I don't think there's anything wrong with having a little bit of that, well

388
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,700
last year didn't work out so great so let's just be a little bit on the fucking balls

389
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:58,800
of our feet, on our fucking toes, ready to just oop, ah, oop, tried to get me didn't

390
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
you?

391
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Tried to fuck me again didn't you?

392
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,720
Well 2016 taught me a valuable lesson about getting fucked and oop, oop, you missed me

393
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
a little bit.

394
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,160
That's why serpentine pattern baby.

395
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,520
Keep them guessing.

396
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,760
Okay I'm going to, I want to say I'm on board with 2017.

397
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,840
One, I think it is the most clever wordplay we've done so far.

398
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,460
And two, I like the idea of encouraging dodging rather than like you know like digging in

399
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,760
for a fight.

400
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:33,160
It's like it's, if I might reference the Kingkiller Chronicles, it's you know it's

401
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,000
the leaf on the wind.

402
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What's it?

403
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's Firefly.

404
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,560
You're doing a bunch of nerdy stuff right now and I'm into all of it but.

405
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,600
But it's that idea of rather than like standing your ground just like be the willow, you know

406
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,600
what I mean?

407
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,600
Yes.

408
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,960
Like flow with the wind and like just avoid the, it's that Neo shit.

409
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,360
It could reference another nerdy property.

410
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,160
Just do like, do the Matrix.

411
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,240
Watch all the Matrix movies.

412
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,360
It's that idea of like rather than having to fight you just don't have to, you don't

413
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,740
have to dodge bullets.

414
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,740
But it's not just that.

415
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,800
It's not just about the fight.

416
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,720
It's about trying new things because maybe you'll be into it.

417
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Keep them guessing.

418
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,360
Like yesterday I watched all of an anime in one day.

419
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,200
That ain't me but everybody's talking about this, this Yuri on Ice, ice skating anime

420
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
and I was like I'm gonna watch this whole thing even though it's not my thing.

421
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
And now it is my thing.

422
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
I incorporated a new thing.

423
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Keep them guessing.

424
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,520
Go left when they think you're gonna go right because they try, they're gonna try to fuck

425
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
you again.

426
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
They are.

427
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
I promise.

428
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,520
I don't want to.

429
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
You tried to meet them halfway last year.

430
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
No.

431
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
That's the thing.

432
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,800
You tried to meet them halfway last year and this year they're gonna expect that again

433
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,600
and they ain't gonna get it.

434
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Just watch an, watch an anime.

435
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,640
Kiss it, kiss somebody under a bridge.

436
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,600
That's not you but do it.

437
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,240
I'm gonna take horseback riding lessons this year.

438
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,720
Travis is gonna ride a fucking horse.

439
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,720
What the fuck?

440
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm gonna take Taekwondo, there's a Taekwondo class place near my dojo.

441
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
I don't know.

442
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
I'm not in it yet.

443
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
Yeah.

444
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,360
But there's a, there's a place near my house that does Taekwondo classes and I think you

445
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,800
get two geese for like 30 bones is a pretty good deal.

446
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,840
I think I'm just gonna do that.

447
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,840
Nobody would expect that.

448
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,840
Keep on guessing.

449
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,840
I'm gonna do Taekwondo to a horse.

450
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm gonna invite a horse to the, to my dojo and then I'm gonna spar with him in the Taekwondo

451
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,960
tradition.

452
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
Keep on guessing.

453
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm always gonna see that.

454
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,520
What the fuck is a horse doing in here?

455
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Uh huh.

456
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
Uh huh.

457
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,280
I zigged when you thought I was gonna zag, didn't I?

458
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
Taekwondo!

459
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,160
And that's the noise I make when I do my kicks, my Taekwondo kicks.

460
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,160
I love, okay, I'm totally into this.

461
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,600
I feel like after 2016, this is the year we need.

462
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
Yeah.

463
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:45,000
20 Serpentine is the year that we, and, and it's, 20 Serpentine, keep on guessing.

464
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,880
I'm not saying, I'm not, I don't want to embrace a policy of distrusting everyone.

465
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm just saying, keep on guessing.

466
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Make yourself untrusted.

467
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,280
No, look, here's what I like, here's what I like about this though.

468
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,280
Maybe the guessing, it could also be like, you've always argued with your aunt about

469
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,120
politics and at like, you know, the next big gig together, your aunt brings up politics

470
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,800
and you just say, oh, it's a very interesting point, I'll have to consider that.

471
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,280
And your aunt's like, uh, uh, uh, my whole thing.

472
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,240
I thought we were going to argue about this for two hours.

473
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
Uh, I didn't prepare anything else.

474
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,400
Now we have to just like talk like humans.

475
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Boom.

476
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
And then.

477
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
Keep on guessing.

478
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,880
And then you do Taekwondo to your uncle right, right there in the room.

479
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,560
What are you doing, Jeremy?

480
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,160
Jeremy stop that zigzag, you eat a bunch of peanuts, but they thought you were allergic

481
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
to peanuts.

482
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Boom.

483
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
Keep them guessing.

484
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
That's right.

485
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,160
I am.

486
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
This is the year I get over it.

487
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Hospital.

488
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
Zigzag.

489
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
Keep them guessing.

490
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I like this.

491
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
20 Serpentine.

492
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Keep them guessing.

493
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Delete the rest of the list.

494
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
Erase it.

495
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
I feel like we all keep coming back to 20 Riven team.

496
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,920
Let's appreciate Riven.

497
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
And that, it is such a good game.

498
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:02,320
And I, Justin, if I may, I think that what we should do is we have 20 Serpentine as the

499
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:10,680
official year, but Joseph Gordon Levantine and 20 Riven team as the unofficial like media

500
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,740
representation years.

501
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:18,440
So it's like a play Riven while you watch third rock from the sun and keep them guessing.

502
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,160
Um, I guess, uh, you can still participate in 20 Riven team.

503
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
Okay.

504
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Okay.

505
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:33,480
Now Griffin, I think in an effort to keep us guessing, just dropped a giant picture

506
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,760
of Colin Mochrie into this G doc.

507
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Yeah.

508
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Zigzag, baby.

509
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Y'all just got zagged on.

510
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,760
Hey, are you guys hungry?

511
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,240
Here's a zag nut bar.

512
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,200
Didn't see that Colin Mochrie coming, did you?

513
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,760
I guess Colin Mochrie is a good, the other thing I like about that and our years so frequently

514
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,600
lack this is iconography.

515
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,080
Just having Colin Mochrie is like a visual representation of keeping people guessing

516
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,200
because I did not expect him to pop up, but when he did, I was very, very pleased.

517
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Okay.

518
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,320
Now Colin Mochrie, a different picture of Colin Mochrie has now been inserted into the

519
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,360
name of play Serpentine.

520
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,320
I accidentally spliced the name, uh, so it says 20 Serpentine.

521
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Keep them guessing.

522
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Colin Mochrie.

523
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
In.

524
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
All right.

525
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
This is good.

526
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,360
Just tweet this exact screen cap right now and just tell people it's over.

527
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Yes.

528
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Yeah.

529
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
All right.

530
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
This is how we announce it.

531
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
All right.

532
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Well, wait, no, this will spoil the whole episode.

533
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,360
I feel like, or at least the first half of it.

534
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,360
Okay.

535
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Well, that's fair.

536
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Sit on it.

537
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
So it's a screen gap.

538
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,360
Crap it.

539
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Crap it.

540
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
But let's hold onto it.

541
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,360
Let's go to the money zone.

542
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
We got our year.

543
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,080
We got our year folks, but let's get into the hard.

544
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
It's important.

545
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
Yeah, it's really important.

546
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,100
It's basically one big piece of advice for the next 52 episodes.

547
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,560
So, um, let's, let's do our damn thing.

548
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,940
Oh, that's a picture of Colin Mochrie as a baby.

549
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,800
Travis, you zagged on me, dog.

550
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,820
All right.

551
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,920
That's baby New Year.

552
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,540
That's going to be the baby New Year for this year.

553
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,540
Oh, yeah.

554
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,080
Colin Mochrie is the baby New Year of this year.

555
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
To the money zone.

556
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Let's go

557
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,040
Hey, you're hungry

558
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,200
As it wasn't it wasn't rhetorical Griffin, okay, then no I just ate a big bowl of checks. Oh

559
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,240
Well, could you foresee yourself getting hungry by this evening?

560
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,560
No, do you know how like right after you eat a big bowl of checks you just have like a sour tummy? I don't know

561
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,600

562
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,960

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,080
It's gonna be a good a little autumnal treat with rich cinnamon flavors

564
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,280
I eat it and I get the sourest tummy every time well this week. We're sponsored by checks

565
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800

Or if you only want like one box per month go for it

583
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,520
I can't stress how great that flexibility is we basically

584
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,080
Turned it off for like three or four weeks because we have a newborn and didn't think I was guy

585
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,080
We didn't think we were gonna be cooking very much and our friends were gonna bring us a bunch of meals

586
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,080
And now that we're getting back into it

587
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,020
There's certain things that Rachel can't eat because Henry has a dairy allergy

588
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,880
And so we pop in and like within seconds. We had selected a menu that was dairy free

624
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,940
It's impossible to tell but hey happy birthday whenever it is J-Dog

625
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:38,780
I'm also boys have you been watching a ntm cycle 2.3. I think boys not in the house boys gone boys banished from house

626
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,000
I have not I'm not interested without tie-tie, baby. Not and not interested at all

627
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,080
It's pretty fucking fresh how how present is Tyra?

628
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,440
She's in the first episode and she bounces on him pretty fucking hard, but then Rita Ora shows up along with a

629
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,800
Man named law roach, and he's like he just he is just

630
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,200
Unreserved with his criticism, but everybody's doing their absolute best there are no boys in the house

631
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,160
It is missing a certain heat. I heard that they're there in the judgment room

632
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,060
It's all glass windows, and there's just boys with their faces pressed up against it

633
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:27,700
Like a like an impoverished child staring in a bakery window. Oh wait what crumbs is that accurate more or less?

634
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,540
Yes, they all want to get a sniff of this fashion

635
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:36,540
But they can't because boys have been banished from the house except for law roach law roach is the only boy in the house

636
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:44,480
Griffin do you anticipate like a midseason twist where somebody finally checks like the crawlspace of the house and they've had a bad boy

637
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,360
infestation oh you have boys in the house just eating eating the supporting beams of the house and the house falls down should have

638
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,960
Had boys in the house mm-hmm well

639
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,680
That's the thing is you got it you can't leave your like cardboard stacked up

640
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,960
Or if you have like a moist environment in your basement you have to be careful

641
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,720
Or you'll end up with boys in the house right I do want to point out law roach because I did just Google law roach

642
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,720
His Instagram bio lists him as an image architect

643
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,720
and that is also how he's credited in the show and I would love law roach to just get inside my image and just

644
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
do a quick demo and

645
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,480
Replace it with like some vaulted ceilings and maybe you know just like cooler

646
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,120
Jackets like cool jackets that I can wear hit me up law roach

647
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,040
Boys boys in the house boys in the house Trav or griff do you wanna read this?

648
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,360
I'll read it in this one is for David and it's from why Lynn who says

649
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,720
Hey there city mouse now that you've hopped on to them a boom-bam wagon

650
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:46,920
I can ask our favorite brothers to say things that I'm too emotionally constipated to say in person

651
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,480
Although you may not be able to see it yourself sometimes

Get that dissertation, what is it one of these days boys?

I'm gonna Google what a dissertation is and then whenever like like fancy

656
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,440
You know how some people go to college a few times and for like I don't know why they do it

657
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,840
But then they have to do these things called dissertations every time they say oh, I'm doing my dissertation

658
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,440
I was just kind of like nod my head. Yes. Yes. Is that like a big book report?

659
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
It seems like a big book report

660
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,160
Very big book report, huh? Yeah, it sounds hard. How many pages 20 pages Wow

Flaked on our number one obligation to people well that first question hit that first question J man

671

Okay. All right

Let's see our first question

673
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I

674
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
Knew there was something cuz you were

675
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,360

676
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Squad

677
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,360
Squad

678
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,080
New year, I think I'm gonna try out some new podcasts. Here's one that's lucid as an advice podcast. That might be fun

679
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,400
Hey, hey Deborah. These boys aren't doing any advice at all. This is a weird podcast

680
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,160
Wendy's new spice of sriracha chicken sandwich takes sriracha to a whole new level this fucking thing, huh?

681
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:12,200
No, I'm just like all I know about this is these dumbass commercials where it's like sriracha, how do you even say it? It's sriracha

682
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,560
It's been around for a hundred years. What the fuck are you talking about? People started putting this on everything in like

683
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,560
1991 sriracha

684
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:28,120
So this one is a very special twofer and here's why it's so special in an in an attempt to build

685
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,580
excitement about the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

686
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,720
Wendy's released put out to press release

687
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,720
It's like Pokemon like Pokemon Sun and Moon one's got different words in it collect them all

688
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,080
This is the first calling all sriracha lovers when he's gone all in sriracha on the debut of its new spicy

689
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:57,320
Sriracha on the light on the what if it's what on the debut of its spicy sriracha chicken sandwich available for I know I said

690
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,680
It with a T earlier get this is how this person would say it this character

691
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,400
Available for a limited time the entire sandwich included the bun the cheese and of course the sauce is infused with sriracha

692
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,640
Satisfying even the most die-hard fans of the flavorful red sauce in a way that only Wendy's can what starting with?

693
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,960
Let me finish starting with the toasty sriracha infused bun a dollop of sriracha

694
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:27,280
They only custom sriracha jack cheese and then sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha

695
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,880
sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha sriracha and there's like

696
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,360
That's the end of the fucking press release. You said it enough that it started to sound like Rochester

697
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,480
so

698
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,000
then

699
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Sorry, was that a goof that it spiraled into madness or that was you know, that's literally what it says

700
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:52,340
Okay, that was a 730 December 5th 9 a.m. December 5th 90 minutes later

701
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:56,700
The fucking that the veil of that hilarious bit

702
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,380
Is pulled away. Oh, I need I love it when they have to explain the joke of it

703
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,860
Earlier today as we were overcome with excitement about our new

704
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:11,340
spicy sriracha chicken sandwich and bacon sriracha fries

705
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:18,420
Wendy's got carried away and issued an alert that looked more like the obsessed ramblings of a sriracha fanatic

706
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,340
Anyone with similar love for sriracha can understand. It's just that good

707
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:29,780
We've since pulled ourselves together and have provided all the details about our newest creation below

708
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,500
Thanks for understanding because there's nothing

709
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,740
funnier

710
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,860
Than doing a bit and then 90 minutes later

711
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:44,060
explaining what the bit was right so like now this this was so confusing because I was on as

712
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,040
The weekend editor at snack attack sack

713
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,620
Gov when this press for this first press release came out. It was like

714
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:56,980
Jerry I don't know should I write it up as is because there's lots of key details missing

715
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:00,300
I think it might be a joke, but I think somebody there might have some serious problems

716
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,380
And then luckily I didn't publish it and then that second one came through and it was like whoof

717
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:09,660
Thank God, but it was really unprofessional like they've lost the plot of her at Wendy's. I mean now

718
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,020
Justin I would like to offer a different explanation

719
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,060
Okay

720
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:25,420
picture someone much like yourself working at Wendy's and your job is the social media outreach and then you get handed this press release that

721
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,800
No joke has sriracha like just as a descriptor

722
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:37,460
67 times. Yeah, and this is the last straw for you and you just you just fucking lose it

723
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,780
This is the Wendy's version of all work and play me out a doll boy, okay

724
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,460
That's very that's very possible and they were trying to run interference. Uh-huh. There's a funny joke

725
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:53,600
Uh-huh, so don't take it from me

726
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,740
Let's check in with Munch Squad patron saint Carl Laredo

727
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,260
Vice president of marketing and advertising at Wendy's

728
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,560
What's he named as a baby like this guy's gonna run a fucking dirty ass fast-food company someday

729
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:16,180
We got a column Carl Laredo like there's no way around it this I believe is Carl Laredo second appearance on the squad

730
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,460
Mm-hmm. Don't correct me if I'm wrong sriracha lovers having a rational love for this sauce

731
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:27,540
So we knew we had to find a way to properly honor that devotion with the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

732
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:35,420
Says Carl Laredo vice president of marketing and advertising Wendy's we did more than just spread or drizzle sriracha on a chicken sandwich

733
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,660
Went all in and infused sriracha in the entire sandwich

734
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:46,940
Delivering the maximum amount of flavor from the first bite until the last now. Here's what's enjoyable to me

735
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,980
about the spicy sriracha chicken sandwich

736
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:59,940
There's sriracha in the aioli. There's sriracha in the bun. There's sriracha in the cheese. There's sriracha in the chicken now the one thing

737
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:07,500
Sidebar if I could with you the one thing they left some out put on it. Yeah leave one

738
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,860
There's one element that you missed. I think it it wasn't that that good old-fashioned applewood smoked bacon

739
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,820
Cuz that's in that's that's in it. Yeah

740
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,760
The one thing about it is the sriracha fucking sriracha. Is that right?

741
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,100
What is this stinky ketchup

742
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:36,860
It's fun rooster sauce. What is this rooster sauce? It doesn't smell shit

743
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:39,420
It's got lumps in it unlike smooth. Ketchup

744
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,340
sriracha

745
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,340
idiots

746
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:49,780
People love this stuff. Should we put it on a sandwich? No, no, we should put it around a sandwich

747
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:55,460
We should put it sandwich adjacent. We should put it inside the concept of a sandwich

748
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:03,340
Let's let's harness the power of sriracha but not include any of it

749
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,500
We will tease a sandwich with sriracha

750
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,660
We will tell a sandwich the stories of sriracha

751
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:19,580
The tales of its adventures and hope that its legacy is somehow passed through the sandwich

752
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:26,980
We will not apply the sauce. Can we talk about a sriracha bun cuz god forbid what if you get in a car accident and

753
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:33,500
The chicken and the bacon and the aioli go flying out the window, but the only thing you're left with is hot bread

754
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,500
How's your hot bread?

755
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:42,780
Hey, this bread's hot. It sucks. I know it's spicy bread. I'm sorry. I got in a car accident. I lost the chicken

756
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:50,420
I'm upset with this whole thing because it feels like Wendy's is trying to dunk on sriracha lovers and say

757
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,220
How about this? Is this enough?

758
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:59,720
Do you like that take that like they're trying to burn out your enjoyment of sriracha by giving you so much of it

759
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,860
That you don't want it anymore

760
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,240
But also none of it and also none of it

761
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,660
This is not a thing you do with anyone else like they're not like oh what you like tomatoes

762
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,660
The buns got tomatoes in it. The meats got tomatoes in it. The lettuce has tomatoes in it. Go fuck yourself

763
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,160
it really is by not including sriracha, but also like

764
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,660
absolutely

765
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,660
conceptually destroying sriracha

766
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:30,540
It's like the in it should be called like sriracha is over this. Yeah, it's done

767
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,980
We're like taking the concept of it and not applying any of it

768
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:37,340
Do you think that they had a point where they're like, well, we gotta put sriracha on the fucking thing

769
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,860
and then someone's like you do realize that's actually a

770
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:49,360
Condiment with flavor and I don't think our process can be trusted in applying unless it's like

771
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,980
single serve packets

772
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,620
That are being distributed like this

773
00:46:53,620 --> 00:47:00,880
I don't trust our people to directly apply actual flavorful common too many pranks too many pranks can be made with a sriracha packet

774
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,460
No, thanks

775
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:10,060
Somewhere there is a there's a Venn diagram that perfectly captures someone who really loves the idea of sriracha

776
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,900
But you're not actual sriracha who's going to just love this

777
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,820
Who's gonna be so excited that they get all of the flavor without having to deal with actual sriracha?

778
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,940
I don't want to meet that person, but I guarantee they exist

779
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,100
Hey, can we please do this first advice question?

780
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,460
Because if we don't do any advice this episode we're gonna lose our license, but not only that

781
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:37,540
This first question on this list that Travis has put together that Travis worked so hard to put together for us is such a banger

782
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:43,060
And we would be remiss if we let it fall through the wayside Travis just recite. We'll ask these questions next week

783
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,020
There I do want to say this is a perfect 20 serpentine question for my brother my brother. Yes

784
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:56,580
Okay, this is our this is our first and only question of this episode the first of 20 serpentine

785
00:47:56,580 --> 00:48:04,180
One of my friends is a contact juggler. He hasn't performed for money in years. That's not an option. I don't think that's an option

786
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
$20 please

787
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:18,900
I only do it for the art now. I don't perform for money anymore. That'll be five bucks

788
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,180
One of my friends is a contact juggler

789
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:30,180
He hasn't performed for money in years, but recently the company that makes fushigi balls reached out to him apparently

790
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,180
They're planning on relaunching fushigi

791
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:43,100
And they want this is just that was the best news I could for my brother my brother made that is pretty much the best

792
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
Like and I did not expect it

793
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,300
But big ups, I didn't see that coming

794
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,260
They want him to be in their commercials again. Yeah, this

795
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:58,980
Man is the face by which I mean the weirdly moving hands of fushigi

796
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,620
Problem is the last time he performed in a fushigi commercial. He got called a sellout by all the other contact jugglers

797
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,460
How can I convince him to ignore the haters and get that paper

798
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,460
All

799
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,180
20 of them

800
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,420
That's from fushigi enthusiasts from Boca Raton, Florida

801
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:24,180
You're out of the gang damn

802
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,260
so

803
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,260
There are certain

804
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:30,820
There are certain careers

805
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:36,340
Where the window of success it's so limited right like you two were theater majors

806
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,160
you remember that feeling when you saw somebody go off and then they made it on a fucking episode of psych and you're like

807
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:49,200
Damn it Jeremy and you got so angry and jealous because there's only like two paying roles on psych that you can sort of slot into

808
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,960
If you wanted to eat what Justin I work in the games industry

809
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,720
There's not many paying gigs in the games industry. And so there's there's a lot of beef that arises there

810
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,320
I am going to make an estimation here that the number of paid

811
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,920
positions for fushigiists is

812
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,200
Is one and it is the one who is in the commercial for fushigi

813
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,360
I don't think anybody picks up fushigi thinking like I'm gonna make money. This is my dream now

814
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:20,440
I'm gonna make money doing this someday. Well

815
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,080
Griffin do you think that the same person who's the face of the commercials is also like goes to the trade shows

816
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,440
Goes to like, you know the contact juggling like conferences and like demonstrates the new line

817
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,480
or do you think that they have like a team of people that they have like

818
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:45,920
You know different people that they send to like the Southwest fushigi conference and like the northeastern fushigi conference

819
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,200
the Japan fushigi conference

820
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,360
Fucking shit. Oh, I

821
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Just had the first

822
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,840
Great idea of 20 serpentine. Okay, you better zag on us

823
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:05,680
Yeah, I'm about to zag on you guys and and please seriously. I'm very serious about it

824
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,680
So please brothers let me know if you're okay with this. I

825
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,280
would like

826
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,280
this year for us to become

827
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:22,120
Patrons of fushigi now. Here's what I'm suggesting. Oh boy. Oh boy. We we take when when we get paid in January

828
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:28,400
We will take the first $500 that we make this month and we will set it aside

829
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,880
for

830
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,520
Fushigi patronage and here is what I'm suggesting to you. Uh-huh. What I'm suggesting to you is

831
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,160
People will make fushigi art. Yeah, I did it to us

832
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,440
We will assign a dollar value on the quality of the fushigi performance and please actually

833
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,420
Do some sick fushigi shit because if it's if there's nothing there will you will get nothing

834
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,400
But you will make actual fushigi art and if it is special

835
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,400
We will PayPal you from the fushigi budget that we have set aside

836
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,080
For 2017 which is in total

837
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,200
$500. Yes, we are fushigi patrons

838
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,760
Patrons of fushigi and

839
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,340
If you do some sick-ass fushigi art, yeah, you will and and you can either let's see

840
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:23,480
Probably the best thing is to put it on our Facebook page or tweet at us with hashtag fushigi art

841
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,480
Yeah, that's probably the best

842
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,720
And then we will award this grant. We probably won't do a lump sum

843
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:35,200
We'll probably try to space out a little and also will not be very much money because I really I it won't make sense if

844
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:41,320
We give like 200 bucks to somebody who makes something totally baller. I want to get this shit popping off across the world

845
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:46,060
I want recognition from the fushigi company. I do want to be taken to the fushigi nationals in Japan

846
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,960
And yes, we cannot stress enough once that 500 is gone. It's gone

847
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,840
It's gone. Don't send us this in like December of 2017

848
00:52:54,840 --> 00:53:00,800
Don't get all pissy at us if you work hard on our routine and we decided it is not it is not worthy of our

849
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,280
I feel like if you have a contact juggling routine

850
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,420
Made for us specifically you will probably get some

851
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,400
I'm gonna kick you a little bit but like

852
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,160
Yeah, if you have a sick-ass routine

853
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,440
That's just for us and it has to be clear like in the video

854
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,860
Like I don't know if you have to say something about our show or some sort of you know, it has to be clear

855
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:29,900
It's made boutique content for the my brother my brother me fishy patrons of fushigi

856
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:32,900
Now I will say if you want to score bonus points with me

857
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:39,100
Some kind of like cool runnings ask backstory as to why your contact juggling story

858
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,860
Is like you had to overcome some kind of contact juggling

859
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:48,100
like issue or sell like your friends always told you you could never be a contact juggler because

860
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,580
That's gonna score extra points with me

861
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,980
What I like is if at the end of your routine you destroy your fushigi balls. Oh, yes

862
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:01,140
Just so I know that you did this thing for us and then you have walked away from the craft

863
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:07,420
In fact, if you want to add a little clip at the beginning just a short blip of you buying the fushigi ball

864
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,980
Then do the trick and then destroy it. So we know that it was like bespoke just for this

865
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,180
Yeah, that's probably gonna get a couple a couple checkmarks

866
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,340
Um, so please create fushigi art for us

867
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,340
we're gonna just gonna get some fushigi art into the world five hundred dollars is a

868
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:31,260
Ton of dough though. We should boy. I wish you'd set a lower number to start with

869
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:38,380
Walked it up a little bit, but that's an annual budget. I mean that has to last us all year, right?

870
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:43,300
Does this count as a charitable donation? Yeah, can I can we can we write this off?

871
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,480
Now I know there might be some of you who have who donate to the maximum fun Network

872
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,620
So some portion of your donation will go to fushigi art

873
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:59,340
I don't know how you feel about that. But if you feel bad about it, I don't know what fucking podcast you've been listening to

874
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,860
I don't know what you think we're good with we're good with bucks

875
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:11,660
we're good with your dollar bills if the idea of a few cents of your donation going to fushigi art doesn't fill you with

876
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:18,460
Excitement and delight then I'm not sure that you're a great fit for our business. Okay, this isn't this is a pretty enormous zag

877
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,460
Do we still fucking hate jugglers?

878
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:23,180
No

879
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:30,100
No, we've been very clear about this contact jugglers are okay. We've always been clear about this. Okay, the fish the fushigi arts are fine

880
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Then that's why we're not

881
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:39,020
More is the contact juggling fushigi arts are like that's something we want to try to get out more

882
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:45,340
There's hundreds of videos of juggling. I want contact juggling fushigi art art

883
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:51,720
Please yeah, you don't mind. Oh, oh, oh, if it could be set to music

884
00:55:53,660 --> 00:56:00,380
A silent contact juggling routine with the fuck you talking about the problem is that you're gonna get that copyright infringement

885
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:03,740
You got it. It's got to be copyright free. You gotta get some some

886
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,700
Farmer that's out in there. Yeah. Happy birthday fushigi

887
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,980
I do like Justin that you keep referring it to as fushigi art

888
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:18,060
Because I like that because it implies don't just like film yourself in silence doing a single trick

889
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,580
You know what? I mean? Like I want some kind of artistry to it

890
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:27,900
You know a little story maybe or maybe it's an allegory of fushigi allegory for something

891
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,180
I don't want to put too many

892
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:32,580
Restrictions on people because I think that they're gonna do a lot better with this than we will

893
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,160
The one sort of cholera will add on this is we will make the amount that we award you

894
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:44,820
Extremely public so like do be aware of that going in that that will be made extremely public

895
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:49,180
That that the amount that you will be gifted from the fushigi arts patronage

896
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,960
And you know, this is successful. Who knows 20

897
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,340
2018 maybe it's

898
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,540
$515, you know, it could go the sky's the limit. We'll have to check with our accountants. Oh

899
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:05,420
No, they can't ever know. Please don't tell our accountants, please. Please don't tell Barry

900
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:11,140
Please don't tell Barry Barry's so mad at us all the time for the bad decisions. We made now Justin

901
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:17,620
What's this receipt for $500? You've submitted here on a piece of paper. You've just written for fushigi arts

902
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
Right. It's a gift of the arts

903
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,380
It's an artistic gift

904
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
You put you plebeian

905
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:32,340
Yeah, I'm gonna need to I just need that to be and probably put like

906
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:38,500
Fushigi art in the title of the YouTube video or like hashtag fushigi art just to make it like really easy

907
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,100
I want to just be able to like look at all these and review all of them and enjoy them

908
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:48,240
Yeah, sure in my own time. Let's wrap up because I don't think I can hear that. You say the words fushigi art anymore today

909
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,180
Okay

910
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,320
