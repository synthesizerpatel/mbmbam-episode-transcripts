1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you're all alone, with a pretty verse, I'm gonna be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to me. Happy birthday, dear Travis and Justin. Happy birthday to us.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So unfair.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Best day of the year.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why couldn't they, like, our parents are intelligent people. Why couldn't they have, you know, timed it out so that I would have come out on a...

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have to wait another, like, six months for mine.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Today is Travis and Justin's birthday. Justin, that's me. Me and Travis is our birthday. And we're celebrating in style.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I always kind of found it weak that when we were growing up and, you know, Griffin was still a small wee babe, he would get presents on our birthday because he was one of the three that didn't.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Right, he didn't understand.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Do you know why that happened?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Because you were a baby?

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I would have cried if I didn't.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, because he had a baby chromagnum brain. Baby brains and chromagnum brains are basically the same thing.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But it is our birthday. We're celebrating the only way we know how by taking your ignorance of certain topics, turning it alchemy-like into wisdom.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's just get right into it.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I want to cut through the red tape, cut through all the business, and just really get down into this deep.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So let's start off with an email. It says, I have a cat who is generally a bit standoffish. She doesn't snuggle, doesn't much like being picked up.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The only time she wants to get on my lap is when I'm in the bathroom, tending to secondary biological output.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I have always enjoyed her company as an alternative to reading or staring blankly at a wall. My husband, however, thinks the whole thing is weird,

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that I should leave the door shut, ignore her plaintive meows, and get on with my business myself.

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
She seems so sad when I don't let her in, though. Please give me some guidance here.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Who's that from?

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's from Poop Lap.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sorry, can you slow it down a bit?

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's Poop Lap.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm trying to imagine what the sad meowing of a cat sounds like when it's behind the door of a bathroom where you are defecating,

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and that cat, all it wants is to just come in and just chill with you while you do your business. I'm trying to imagine what that sounds like.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll tell you, Griffin, it sounds exactly like Purple Rain.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm trying to make a concerted effort here to not take this in the scatological territory, so I'm going to talk about the ethics of what's happening here.

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In this modern society, in the society in which we live, we are so connected.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You know, every moment you're on the book, you're on the FB, you're on the Google, you're Googling, you're tweeting, Twoto, on all the services.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Form Spring, Tumblin, Tumblin, you're on the Tumblin, you're on the Tamblin, you're on the Crumping, you're Crumping.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's just so many different outlets for people to stay connected with you.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The B-room is really the one time of the day when you get to just be, that's for nobody else, not for your cat, not for Facebook.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What you're ignoring, though, is that your cat's not on Twitter, your cat's not on Facebook, it's not Tumblin, it's not Smanging.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I am pretty sure no cats are on my Facebook friends.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I actually have a couple.

48
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yeah, I have people who use their cats as their pictures, which, by the way, that's not you.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Stop lying.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Get your baby off there, too, while we're at it.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's not you.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your baby is not you.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are you.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't confuse me.

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The pictures of you holding other people's babies, not cool.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not cool.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's confusing.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You're putting your baby on the grid already, just the babies on the grid.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think that I have to be pretty steadfast in this, Griffin.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I understand what you're saying, but it's about your mental state.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's not about your cat can't track you on Twitter, so now you're going to let it be in the bathroom with you.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But the thing is, it sounds like it's good for her mental state.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She enjoys the cat's company while she's making business.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What does it say about the cat's relationship?

65
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The only time she likes to be with you.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, the cat's a fucking freak.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't get me wrong.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
As long as we can all agree on that.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, the cat's dirty, right?

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That cat is a dirty ass cat.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That cat is some sort of reincarnated scat pervert.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Fuck that cat.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your cat's a freak.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your cat's a pervert.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your cat is a pervert.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But, I mean, if you enjoy her company, then more power to you.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I say, poop away, cat on lap.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think it's okay.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's take a vote.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is it okay?

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's not.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not okay.

83
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is November 8 the best day of the year?

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Majority rules.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's the best.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I work at the most monotonous job ever, and your podcast brightens my Mondays.

90
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I was wondering if you could recommend any other podcasts or activities to make my work days more exciting.

91
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thanks.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are we going to recommend any competitors?

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Get real, StormSpring.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nice try.

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sorry.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Does McDonald's talk about how tasty Whoppers are?

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Never.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They probably do.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Probably.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Probably in secret at meetings.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Our burgers are whack.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You know who's got those dope burgers?

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't tell anybody.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
BK.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
BK.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
BK and DQ.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Me and all my billionaire buddies, we always like to go to just hit the BK at the late

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
night.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You've got to get that BK.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Our chicken select strips are bullshit.

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You get that strip at BK?

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They got that shit in the shape of a crown.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
First off, maybe go get some McDonald's and Burger King.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's fun food, fun to eat, and that can really help to make the days pass.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Just eating fast food?

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Eating fast food.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Just kill the lonely times.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Kill the sad times with the taste of salt and fat.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh boy.

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now I see how I'm hungry.

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oops.

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You did it again, McDonald's advertisers.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think whatever recommendations we could give you depends entirely on what your job

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Because if you're a surgeon, you need to fucking look sharp.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You need to put down the iPod.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Was that a pun?

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It didn't mean it to be, but I'll take it.

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You need to not be distracted when you're cutting into humans.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you, I don't know, scan medical documents into a computer for eight hours a day, then

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
you're going to need some help, some assistance.

132
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
My suggestion, a clipboard.

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know it seems, but it'll let you get away with literally anything.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can put Sudoku on there, you can put some Crossword on there, or just carry it around

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
so no one will speak to you.

136
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How did you just pronounce the word Sudoku?

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think I said Sinoko.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sinoko.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, Griffin, you're confused.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sinoko is that new joint.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hey, have you guys played Sadaka?

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Have you played Neil Sadaka?

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was actually thinking of the gas station Sinoko.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Did you get that new John Sakata record?

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wow.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And the game included inside the CD notes?

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Really fun.

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We play it all day.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Sudoku is that new Sudoku where it makes a picture at the end.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And then the cards bounce around the screen.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
An erotic picture.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's a sexy picture.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Sudoko.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It kind of looks like a boob made of blocks.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We have given this person zero advice.

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Okay, we've got to get, I think the best thing to do is to just, you've got to shut your brain

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
off and let it take you to another far away place.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Like if you can't do something obvious like read or ride a moped or something when nobody's there,

159
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you've got to take your mind and let it take you on a journey.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No one is your boss in your head at all.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And another fun game is to play little games with yourself.

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Like how many times can I slip this word into a conversation before someone notices?

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And how often can I mispronounce words like Sudoku until someone notices?

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
See how long it takes you.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Walk around all day next Monday and walk around saying Sodomcum.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And wait until someone corrects me.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now Travis, I have to ask, do you play that game when you're doing the podcast with us?

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Because you did just say Sudoko in a strange manner.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Of course not, Griffin.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to be on the lookout now.

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Let's do a Yahoo answer.

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah, that would be great.

173
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This one was sent in by Art Santana.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's probably his real name, but wow, that's a good name.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Have you guys noticed how many people with totally fresh names listen to our podcast?

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Like Max Jackman?

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Like Max Jackman?

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's really flattering.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Anyway, this Yahoo answer is from Thomas Schlicher.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Almost certainly I said that wrong.

182
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Not a good name.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, that's a bad name, but he doesn't listen to the show, so we're fine.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He asks, how do I tell my mom, dad, friends, et cetera, that I am a furry?

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have a huge problem.

186
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm 13 and furry.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
My girlfriend is also 13 and furry.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I told my mom about it, and she told me that furry fandom is one of the, quote,

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
most disgusting and horrific things she has ever heard, end quote.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
My dad's reaction was almost the same, but he took it better.

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Now, though, I don't know what to do.

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Please help.

193
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you think that dad's reaction was like?

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey, son.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're what?

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This isn't my jam, but I think your mother really went overboard with her reaction to

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
this news.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So yeah, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
He's just furry like he's going through puberty and starting to get hair in weird places.

200
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's normal.

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That happens to the best of us.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm almost certain he means he wants to dress up like a raccoon and bone down.

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Here's what's troubling.

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait, what?

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yeah, I'm almost positive that's what the furry means.

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Wait, not like puberty?

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No, not like puberty.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I feel like we covered this on last week's show, that animals are fucking sexy, yo.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They're getting sexier every year.

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And he's just trying to capitalize on that movement by dressing himself in furs and pelts.

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah, and try to capture that sex wave, you mean, before it passes all of us by?

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If I were to give this kid some real advice, which I'm not, because yuck, you just got

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
to wait it out because pretty soon furries are going to be the new vampires.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, right.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Is this about a trend for you?

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Or hey, by the way, the odds against you being a 13 year old person who likes to dress like

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
a raccoon and have sex, meeting, falling in love with a person, and then discovering that

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
they too enjoy that sex, it doesn't happen.

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Fucking astronomical.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Also, marry her.

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He met her on a furry website and they hooked up on the fur rooms.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What?

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't.

225
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

226
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

227
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Like forums, but with firms.

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I like it.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I like it.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you.

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going to start calling on that for a week and a half firms.

232
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Have you guys, whenever I read a question like this that has anything to do with the

233
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
furry community, um, I think that I'm an incredibly like open-minded person.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like, you know, I, I'm colorblind.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm age blind.

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm gender blind.

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, I don't know.

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My patience wears kind of thin with furries.

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Like I, I'm not one to hate on any particular group of people because of whatever sexual

240
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
stuff they're into.

241
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Um, and I'll like defend those people and their right to do that.

242
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I just don't have that for furry.

243
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The thing is what you are seeing right now is like this, the furries, the most valuable

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
service that furry provides us is they let you see inside the head of like a conservative

245
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Republican minister.

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And like the way he feels about pretty much everybody outside of his immediate family

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is the way you feel about furries.

248
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So like, and Furbies, but mainly furries.

249
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think this falls under a game I like to play called daddy, how did you meet mommy?

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And I think any store that says, you know, I looked across the conference hall and saw

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
the sexiest raccoon I've ever seen.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I was going to say raccoon too.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's all about raccoons.

254
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah.

255
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think it's because you don't see raccoons a lot in your day to day, so you don't have

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
a lot of personal connection to them.

257
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But so they're like exotic and sexy, but yeah.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let me, let me ask you guys.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I looked across the room and saw the sexiest marmot I've ever seen.

260
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No, that doesn't work.

261
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
All right.

263
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So three years after the furry civil rights movement.

264
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I mean, am I going to be like the bigot?

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Like the back against the wall?

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Like, I'm sorry.

267
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't care how far society has come.

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I refuse to recognize the right to furries.

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will never ever be okay with this.

270
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Zero percent chance of me ever, ever, ever being cool with this.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I would at this point, endorse state mandated castration for all furries.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
How does that taste?

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's up?

274
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm raising the stakes on our comedy program to endorse the castration of human beings.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay, let's go.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Get on it politicians.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's get deeper.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Let's inception what you just said.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Okay.

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is that, is that a punitive measure or is that more of a population control?

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like you don't want them passing the furry gene, that aberration onto their, their children.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It is absolutely spokesman Bob Barker is it's absolutely both.

283
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It works both ways.

284
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Okay, now let's keep one more level.

285
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

286
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If, if two people dressed up as raccoons fuck, what are the odds that they'll give birth to a raccoon?

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh my God.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What, this is the kind of future that I'm protecting you and yours against.

289
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
My bigger fear is, is like a half man, half raccoon, the man-coon, if you will.

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That, that's really terrifying.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And it's, and it's totally possible.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Ask any scientist.

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
My wife's a doctor.

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll ask her.

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
She says yes.

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Look at, look at Steve Buscemi.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Those big rings around his eyes.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Had to come somewhere.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What's up?

300
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Man-coon Buscemi.

301
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I, castrated also.

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Sorry.

303
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That I would, here's the, here's a bigger question.

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I think you get into problem with logistics.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What's the most efficient way to do it?

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I would suggest that all, all furry costumes would come like legally would have to come with a small patch of general burning cream that when, when you put the costume on, it would just send them away.

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Like a, like a hair that got too close to a campfire.

308
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's what I would, that's what I would like to see happen.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Final question on this subject.

310
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you think furries watch Space Jam and just jerk it so right?

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Just get that good clean jerk going.

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Probably.

313
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Lot of anthropomorphic animals in that one.

314
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Problematically though, there's also a lot of sports, which they are not big on.

315
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I've heard of.

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You don't know that.

317
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Unless they're mascots.

318
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yeah.

319
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
They like that.

320
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They don't see why the basketball has to keep interrupting the mascot show made just for them.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Boy, you know what else they can't watch?

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
A banana split.

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
They love that jam.

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I saw, I saw a local furry get so sexually crazed that he pushed beeper down to the ground and just got away with him.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Just got on it.

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Which is weird because beeper is not an animal by any...

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He's anthropomorphized nightmares.

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Like that's, that's something.

329
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a furry costume.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Those people don't care.

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
They'll F anything.

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They just want something with fur.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They just want something with fur.

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't let them near a shag carpet.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yeah.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They'll just work it.

337
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Watch your back Tom Selleck.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hey three of me bros.

339
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I like it.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I work in retail and I'm next in line to be manager.

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
My boss always complains about hating his job, but he just won't leave.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How can I get him to quit?

343
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I want him.

344
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I want a promotion.

345
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Griffin, you know, it's time for Highlander.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What's up?

347
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You gotta.

348
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There can be only one manager of this Denny's.

349
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

350
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Don't cut off his head.

351
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Whatever you do, that's going to be more trouble than you want.

352
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I rule the gap.

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It will be pretty cool when lightning strikes you in the gap.

354
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yeah.

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Filling you with powers.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Filling my last sweater.

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Now I make the schedules.

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Here we are.

359
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Born to be kings of this gap that I now can run.

360
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You should quit.

361
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wait, wait, how could he quit?

362
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He just killed his manager.

363
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Before you kill your manager.

364
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
By before, I mean, don't, just don't do that.

365
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, don't do it and quit.

366
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's the whole purpose.

367
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think you should just quit.

368
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wait, why?

369
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This retail blows.

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It just doesn't sound like it's right for you.

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think we've all worked our fair share of retail jobs and I've had a manager do that.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I would like to cut their head off.

373
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Sure.

374
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah.

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, I've only worked one, but I mean, that was a pretty pleasant experience.

376
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you are like a hundred percent sure.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You got mugged.

378
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Griffin, you got robbed.

379
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I did get robbed.

380
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But that was.

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You got robbed at gunpoint.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That was a growth experience that taught me about myself.

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And I'm sure it taught that person a little bit about themselves too.

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah.

385
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm positive.

386
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Or at least now that they're in jail.

387
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Now that they're in prison.

388
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah.

389
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Do you know that if there is a quickening after a murder, you cannot be legally tried

390
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
for it?

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I did not know that.

392
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yeah.

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If you are a hundred percent sure there's going to be a quickening after you cut someone's

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
head off with a katana.

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I guess that explains why in Highlander the series, I mean, Duncan kills a lot of dudes,

396
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
right?

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But he never has to face any litigatory pressure.

398
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I would never watch something like that.

399
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know why you would reference that.

400
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

401
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No.

402
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What?

403
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No.

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
On USA?

405
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's all good.

406
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's all fun and games to talk about cutting a manager's head off with a katana, but when

407
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
you're talking about actually watching Highlander, I don't know, like the series, it goes a little

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
too far for me, I think.

409
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
FormSpring, let me give you some real advice here.

410
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Uh-oh.

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I know.

412
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Here's what you need to do.

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
The next time your manager doodles something or makes something out of a straw paper, act

414
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
like it's the greatest thing you've ever seen and encourage him to become a famous

415
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
artist.

416
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's pretty good.

417
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I like that.

418
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Tell him that he's too good for retail and he needs to get out.

419
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Exactly.

420
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yeah.

421
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And then after he quits, be like, I was just kidding.

422
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's dumb.

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah.

424
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And then be like, I'm the manager now.

425
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Highlander.

426
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Like, say that.

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Here's another option.

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,200
Ask him to come back to the warehouse and look at something for you while there's a bunch

429
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
of people in there.

430
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
And then just like, as soon as you get back there, shout, no, you can't touch my wiener.

431
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
Like that.

432
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,200
Like you can't rub it and touch it.

433
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,000
And then like run out screaming with your pants right under your ankles and people will,

434
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,440
they will call for his head.

435
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,040
And then after they call for his head, cut it off, Quickening Highlander.

436
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,800
I think I know what the theme of this episode is.

437
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:26,480
A Highlander style Quickening after an empty accusation of sexual misconduct.

438
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
There can be only one appropriate response.

439
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I'm a 28 year old dude and my boyfriend is 52.

440
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,700
My friends are all cool with the gay thing, but how do I approach the age gap?

441
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,480
He's a pretty cool guy and not at all a granddad.

442
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Cheers.

443
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,320
And this comes to us from Yes, I Know It's Weird.

444
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Listen.

445
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Okay.

446
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Listen.

447
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,320
Are you listening?

448
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I am.

449
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,080
It kind of sucks that he's not at all a granddad.

450
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,080
I am not.

451
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,080
You can always have more of those originals.

452
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,000
If I was a homosexual, I would totally want a granddad boyfriend.

453
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,320
Yeah, totally.

454
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Think of the benefits.

455
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Many.

456
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Too many to name.

457
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,120
Yeah, there's, there's uh, uh, using denture cream as a lubricant.

458
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
That's all I got.

459
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
See, I was gonna make-

460
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
That's not-

461
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,000
Were you gonna go around that region or-

462
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,120
Around that area involving dentures and the options that that provides.

463
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
Whoa.

464
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
I was just thinking about that.

465
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Yeah.

466
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Take those dentures out, Papa.

467
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
Yuma, yuma.

468
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
Yuma, yuma, indeed.

469
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,680
I was just thinking about how awesome it would be to roll up to like a hardcore gay club

470
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,600
with like a dude who looks like Andy Griffith in a sweater vest.

471
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Or a dude that is Andy Griffith.

472
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:49,960
What's nice is that you can, uh, you get to eat dinner at like 430, which is good.

473
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,280
That's a good- I guess that's gay, bad, or indifferent, right?

474
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,560
Like either way, I mean-

475
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,160
I could date a grandma and still get that treatment.

476
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,520
Oh boy.

477
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,680
What is age gap these days?

478
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,840
We're living to like 130, 140.

479
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
That's a good, great point, Travis.

480
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Science.

481
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,040
Uh, I mean this, this guy's got 25 years on him though.

482
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,600
I mean that's a, that's a significant chunk of change.

483
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
Yeah.

484
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Um, I, uh, 24, but-

485
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
You know, who's counting?

486
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Who's counting?

487
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Who could do simple subtraction?

488
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
Clearly not me.

489
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Uh, it's not his birthday.

490
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Cut him some slack.

491
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:28,080
Um, I, I think that if your friends are already cool with the gay thing, you gotta understand

492
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:35,200
that like, I, I mean, it's not that they're not understanding.

493
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,800
It's that, and you might love this grandpa very much, but you're, it's still like bringing

494
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,240
an old guy around.

495
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,480
Oh, get him a t-shirt that says world's best grandpa, but mark out grandpa and write boy

496
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,520
club.

497
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
No, come on.

498
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
No, come on.

499
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,280
I was going to go with lover, but, um, come on, let's, let's help this.

500
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,640
Here's, here's the important thing when it comes to an age gap.

501
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
It's not the age that's important.

502
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,520
It's the interests.

503
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,760
If you share the same interests, if you're into the same things, if you get along well,

504
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,100
age doesn't matter.

505
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,000
But if you don't connect on that level, like if you want to go out all the time and he

506
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,680
wants to stay home, if you have different interests and you're not interested in the

507
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,680
same thing.

508
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:24,400
And this applies, you know, for anyone entering in a relationship with an older person or,

509
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,880
you know, in any relationship, if you don't have similar interests, if you don't agree

510
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,480
on things, it's not a good match.

511
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,240
If you do, then who the fuck cares, you know, if you guys agree, if you're happy together,

512
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
then yeah.

513
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,880
And they will get your friends.

514
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,880
I think if you continue in this relationship and you continue to bring him around, your

515
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,360
friends will get acclimated.

516
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Like they really will.

517
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,080
I mean, they will adjust to this guy, and maybe it won't seem so weird to them after

518
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
a while.

519
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
I mean, we're all just people, right?

520
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Underneath the skin.

521
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,320
They'll get along really well with him, especially once he keeps giving them like really old

522
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,920
dry pieces of chewing gum.

523
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:10,240
No, but on the serious though, if you have similar interests with him and you have similar

524
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,280
interests with your friends, they're gonna get along great.

525
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,280
Yeah.

526
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
You just gotta prove it to them.

527
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,360
That being said, be prepared for the fact that you will get that initial like, who is

528
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,480
that guy?

529
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,760
And you just have to be braced for that.

530
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,240
You know, I have a lot of friends that are in relationships with people much older than

531
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
them.

532
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,880
And I mean, it's one of those things where you just have to be ready for that initial

533
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,120
like, wow, he's a lot older than you.

534
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,320
I know, but I love him.

535
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
Oh my God.

536
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,080
Oh my God.

537
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,640
Have him show up and say he is your granddad.

538
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:54,600
And then halfway through the night, just like, you two just tongue kiss like crazy.

539
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:58,240
And then he'll be like, what up fuckers, mind blown.

540
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,040
And I'll be like, wow, you're the coolest guy ever.

541
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
And you say, but no, we are seriously in love.

542
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
And then he breaks into a great guitar solo.

543
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,680
We're very much in love, really.

544
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,660
And they will be so punked, they will love it.

545
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:15,760
When you're looking for the best way to acclimate your group of friends to your older boyfriend,

546
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,640
the best thing you can do is pretend he's your grandpa and then and just bone down on

547
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
him.

548
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Right.

549
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,360
Tung gets him right in the middle of the night.

550
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,280
I hope our dad, who's three years older than this guy, does not listen to this show.

551
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,720
And I was saying that a 52 year old man is like, pretty much dead, he's like a dead guy.

552
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,560
It's like it's like the crypt keeper following you around.

553
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
I need help.

554
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,840
And you've come to the right place.

555
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,160
My friend has a crush on me and has asked me out on numerous dates.

556
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,400
I keep politely saying I'm busy that weekend or I have no money, hoping he'll take a hint.

557
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,120
But he keeps persisting.

558
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,320
Is there a way to let him know there's no way me and him could ever be together without

559
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,880
ruining our friendship?

560
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,840
As friend troubles Gmail.

561
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
Yeesh.

562
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,080
Bad news.

563
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,080
Your friendship's ruined.

564
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,160
It's already ruined.

565
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
But don't don't worry about it, because that's not on you.

566
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
That shit's not on you.

567
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,160
This shit's on him.

568
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,720
He made things weird.

569
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,400
He's the weird one.

570
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,640
He he is attacking your country.

571
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,780
You just got to defend yourself.

572
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,780
That's right.

573
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
That's right.

574
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
He's the aggressor.

575
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,080
Now straight up, though, cut out this hint bullshit.

576
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,320
And you just need to roll up and roll up a newspaper and smack him right on the tip of

577
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,320
his nose.

578
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Precisely.

579
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,180
No, no joke.

580
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,640
Like you've got to be stern with him and be like, listen, if we're going to keep being

581
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,880
friends, you need to fucking cut this shit out because I'm yeah, the longer this goes

582
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,760
on, the less of a chance you have of salvaging the friendship.

583
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,360
You've got to just really straight up say, listen, I don't want this to be embarrassing

584
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,840
or weird, but it's not going to happen with you and me.

585
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,000
I just don't feel about you that way.

586
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,560
And I really like you.

587
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,920
And I want to keep hanging out with you and being friends.

588
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,260
And who knows, maybe for friends long enough, I'll come around and then just like let it

589
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
go at that.

590
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
You got it.

591
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
You got it.

592
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,260
Trust me.

593
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
I will get over it.

594
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,520
I mean, he will get it.

595
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,080
Happy birthday to not me.

596
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,120
It feels like everybody's birthday but Griffin's today, doesn't it?

597
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,440
It's weird.

598
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
That's how I feel every day.

599
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,280
You got, you got to give it to him straight.

600
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Don't leave him any hope.

601
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Like seriously, I know it seems cruel, but there's nothing cooler than what you're doing

602
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
right now.

603
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,480
I promise.

604
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,400
Because when you say these excuses, what he hears, what the guy's brain, what the male's

605
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,200
brain translates that into is, is nothing.

606
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
He doesn't translate at all.

607
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,120
He hears exactly what you're saying.

608
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Yeah.

609
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
We don't take hints.

610
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Oh, she doesn't have enough time.

611
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Okay.

612
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Great.

613
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I will wait until she's more free.

614
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
She has more free time.

615
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
Hey, I have it.

616
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
I have a Yahoo answer.

617
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
Yeah.

618
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,840
It was sent in by jregal21, which is pretty cool.

619
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,840
God, it's a good one.

620
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,360
It's by Yahoo Answers user omgitzal.

621
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
Okay.

622
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,840
All right, and it's one of those answers that's not particularly, or the question itself rather

623
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
isn't particularly...

624
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,880
Is it maybe omgitzal?

625
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,000
It might be what it is.

626
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Okay.

627
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I don't want to do this anymore.

628
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Thank you.

629
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,840
You're so much better at translating internet speak than I am.

630
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:27,160
But it's one of those great questions where the comedy doesn't so much come from the question

631
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,360
itself, rather it comes from the answers.

632
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,880
omgitzal asks, need help with my story title.

633
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,960
Hi, I'm writing a story about a young woman who has three children, and one day she gets

634
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,760
into a horrible accident and the three children die.

635
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,700
Her life changes forever from that moment on.

636
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,720
She ends up falling in love with a man whose brother was driving the car that killed her

637
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,720
kids.

638
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,920
Do you have any ideas for a title?

639
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,160
Thanks, smiley face.

640
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
So that's the question.

641
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
I would call it Yakety Sax.

642
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,920
Isn't that what Family Matters was about?

643
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
Yes.

644
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,440
Family Matters would be an appropriate title for this book.

645
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
What about Perfect Strangers?

646
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
Perfect Strangers?

647
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
Empty House?

648
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
All of these.

649
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Indeed.

650
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,840
Three was enough, but now we're back down to zero.

651
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,680
Guys, fucking trust me, there's nothing we can say that's going to be funnier than the

652
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,360
questions that the real internet turned out.

653
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Okay.

654
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,480
They answered your question.

655
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:41,800
Here's one from Nina, who replies, writing waves, parentheses, emotional waves.

656
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,680
Grace says, the painful reminder, or the reminder, because he reminds her about the kids and

657
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,640
the painful loss, sores my mind.

658
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Fuck you.

659
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
It does not say that.

660
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Didn't plagiarize that one.

661
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
That one came right from her dump piece.

662
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Right from the noggin.

663
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,000
This is noggin cream that I made just for your problem here.

664
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,520
Sakura Shaughnessy has a bunch of really good ones.

665
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,520
Here we go.

666
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Okay.

667
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,600
Loving the dead.

668
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,600
The day they died.

669
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Okay.

670
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Whispy memories.

671
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Whispy memories.

672
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,240
I'm trying to solidify this memory in my head, but I can't.

673
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
It's just ephemeral.

674
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
It's right there.

675
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
It's wispy.

676
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,240
Coping with the pain.

677
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
Coping.

678
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Coping.

679
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Coping with the pain.

680
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I like it.

681
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
It flows.

682
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,360
Coping with the pain?

683
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Huh?

684
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,360
What?

685
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
Grieving Mom.

686
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,200
That's pretty straightforward, I guess.

687
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Book.

688
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Grief.

689
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,900
Book book.

690
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,140
Grief, tears, and love?

691
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,440
There is a question.

692
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:52,120
That's like, that's like, that's like, they're best friends, but one of them's a cat.

693
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
Linda.

694
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
She sits on her lap.

695
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,360
Diane asks, or replies, sorry, fatal crossing, maybe the children are killed crossing the

696
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,080
street or at a crosswalk or at a railroad crossing.

697
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Bitch, don't try to rewrite this book before it's wrote.

698
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,960
This is coming from my heart.

699
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,280
Source my mind, trust me.

700
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,040
Trust on the fact that you're not going to help me in the edits.

701
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,160
This is a titling project only.

702
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,080
I am creative enough to come up with a whole book, but not a title for the book.

703
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,640
Percy Jackson 127, who is a top contributor to Yahoo, we haven't seen one of those in

704
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:39,840
a while, responds, taming soul, taking flight, burning memories, love with the murderer's

705
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
boy.

706
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,840
What?

707
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,320
Love with the murderer's boy.

708
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,160
This guy has a fundamental misunderstanding of what this story is about, not like we do,

709
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,320
he didn't get it.

710
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,720
Here's my title.

711
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,360
A book about a woman who falls in love with the dude that killed her kids.

712
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,800
Let me hit you guys with there can be only none.

713
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,360
We got to have a better title than these people.

714
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:13,600
I do like writing waves of emotion, emotional waves, emotional waves, source.

715
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,280
There's no source on that one, but I'm going to go ahead and assume it was also her mind.

716
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,320
No, that was her heart.

717
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,000
How about moving out?

718
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,600
Whoa, I like it.

719
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Music man.

720
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
What about my hero?

721
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:38,800
Am I to believe that this story is that she falls in love with the brother of the guy

722
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,480
who accidentally killed her kids?

723
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Yes.

724
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,480
This is not-

725
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,480
Sorry about my brother.

726
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,880
That's not a very good book, it doesn't sound like a very good, like a very interesting

727
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,880
story.

728
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,280
Like it seems like that conversation would kind of be like, isn't that, yeah, oh well.

729
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,280
What can you do?

730
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Right?

731
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Oh, that's a good title.

732
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
What can you do?

733
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,280
What can you do?

734
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Oh well.

735
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,960
How about, how about just, uh oh, whoops, whoops.

736
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
My bad.

737
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,720
Also, Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.

738
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,640
I had college class that got on early.

739
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:20,200
I ended up asking the girl I have a crush on and who I usually talk to during class

740
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
out to grab something to eat.

741
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,400
I don't consider her a date, but I wanted to get a sense of where I stand with this

742
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,400
girl.

743
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:31,320
Overwhelmingly, I kept her laughing and entertained and she kept telling me how funny I was.

744
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,000
I consider myself a handsome gent and I have good manners and there was never any breaks

745
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,600
in conversation or awkward pauses.

746
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,840
My question for you, is keeping being the funny guy enough to give me a viable chance

747
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
with this girl?

748
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,560
Clearly, Pagliacci, the sad clown.

749
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,980
I like it.

750
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,980
I like that very much.

751
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
That's the dopest.

752
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,840
That is a really dope name.

753
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,440
College, huh?

754
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,640
That's my official, that's my official response to this question.

755
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm really weighing this one out.

756
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,960
I'm trying to piece this together.

757
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:11,460
I think if I was a girl, the number one thing I would look for is to be continually surprised.

758
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,280
So maybe tomorrow you go in all business.

759
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,080
Is that the opposite of funny to you?

760
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,200
I would say like just depressed.

761
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,480
Like really sad.

762
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,160
Oh, you mean like, love me.

763
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Not like that.

764
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Not needy.

765
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Don't do that.

766
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Not needy.

767
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,120
Just like, just like look at her and be like, we're all just walking dead people.

768
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
Think about it.

769
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,120
Yeah.

770
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,120
And then like, look at your desk.

771
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,680
Like, and she'll be like, wow, you are multi-layered.

772
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,600
I would like to have some sex with you, please.

773
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:48,960
And then the next emotion, you could be like really envious of things.

774
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
That's an emotion.

775
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm not sure.

776
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,800
I saw you talking to that guy in the coffee shop today.

777
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,680
I thought we were, we were exclusive.

778
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
It wouldn't even have to be about her.

779
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,280
It could be like, oh, guy's backpack is better than mine.

780
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,660
Want it.

781
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,160
The next day you could be listless.

782
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,520
I just, I think that you need to mix it up.

783
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,800
Go on Live Journal, right?

784
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:15,240
They have a big list of emotions there whenever you're like, oh, today I'm quixotic.

785
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Today I'm highlandery.

786
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
God damn it.

787
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Today I'm quickening.

788
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Being funny, no.

789
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,240
Being funny is not enough.

790
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
It's not enough.

791
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Yeah.

792
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,240
What, what do you have to be?

793
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:33,480
It's, well, it's one of those things where, you know, you always, when it, if you ask

794
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,400
any woman what's the number one thing they look for in a guy, the answer is always a

795
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
big penis.

796
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
Penis, penis width.

797
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,880
Penis, and penis, and penis width.

798
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Penis diameter.

799
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Yeah.

800
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,760
And there's actually a sliding scale of penis diameter versus sense of humor that I'll have

801
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
to show you guys sometime.

802
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,920
Let's just put it this way.

803
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,080
I'm very funny.

804
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,640
That's, that's your, that's your BMI, right?

805
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,800
That's, yeah, that's your BMI, that's what BMI is.

806
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:03,360
But the problem is with that is like, that is the first thing women look for, but not

807
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,360
the only thing.

808
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
It's true.

809
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,160
The first thing women look for, then every guy who writes in and says, I like my friend,

810
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,680
I want to ask her out, would totally be dating that friend.

811
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,680
Sure.

812
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
I think there's-

813
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,120
You have to have a sexual edge to the relationship.

814
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
I'm sorry.

815
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm sorry.

816
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:27,600
I didn't mean to laugh when you just said sexual edge.

817
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,480
That's a powerful turn of phrase, Travis.

818
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,720
That's like a linguistic challenge you've put up there, I think.

819
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,920
That's actually the name of my erotic sword company.

820
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,160
Why did you even start that?

821
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
It's floundering, you know?

822
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,120
Did you hear about Travis' sword company?

823
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,720
It's not doing well.

824
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
It's all erotic.

825
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,520
They have a, they have a very nice selection of novelty, uh, of boner katanas, but other

826
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
than that.

827
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,840
It's, it's a good, I mean, like his business plan was good.

828
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,520
I don't know why the guys from Shark Tank invested so much in it.

829
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,920
Our clothing line, Horny Highlander, is really not working out.

830
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,080
I'm putting a blockade on any more Highlander references this episode.

831
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Okay, sounds good.

832
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,360
I'm putting an embargo on them.

833
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:22,480
I think the, uh, being funny, I think it shows confidence, which may be more at the source

834
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,840
of the attraction.

835
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:30,840
It's, it's, and it makes the girl feel, um, safe, because if you're joking about that,

836
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,640
then, if you're joking about anything, then, you know, you're feeling confident and secure

837
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
in the situation.

838
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:45,040
I think you need to bring, there, there's a fine line between funny and goofy, and I

839
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,640
think once you get to goofy, you're in a weird place where you are just an entertaining thing.

840
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:00,960
You're not like, you're not showing stability or, pardon the phrase, sexual edge.

841
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,480
That's a great phrase.

842
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,960
Can you be goofy and have a sexual edge?

843
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,560
Can you be like a wacky, sexy clown?

844
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,400
It seems like Gowder's been doing okay for himself all these years.

845
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
It just, it depends on her.

846
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,920
Like, what is she looking for?

847
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,160
Like maybe she is looking for a sexy clown.

848
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,520
Hey guys, can I just suggest something here and just like lay it out there?

849
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
Maybe this will be revolutionary.

850
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,880
Maybe this will start a huge wave that will sweep across the nation.

851
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Just be yourself.

852
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
How about that?

853
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,880
And if she doesn't like it, you are cool enough to listen to My Brother, My Brother, Me and

854
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,240
write in with the name Pagliacci the sad clown.

855
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,980
I think you're pretty cool.

856
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,960
So maybe she should just get, get on with it, get it, get down with it.

857
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I don't mean like sexy.

858
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,000
I mean like get the hint that you are really dope.

859
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You're a really dope guy.

860
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,360
Yeah, just have her listen to this episode of the podcast.

861
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,080
Have her listen to this right now if she doesn't believe how dope you are and, and you know,

862
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,400
I think it'll do a pretty good job of convincing her.

863
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,040
You might want to fast forward back to the part where we cut off a bunch of people's

864
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
heads.

865
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Yeah.

866
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,440
And also the parts about fucking raccoons, the part about fucking grandpas.

867
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Sexy grandpas.

868
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Sexy grandpas.

869
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,440
That part.

870
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Pooping.

871
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,440
We talked about pooping with a cat in your lap.

872
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,440
There's-

873
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Don't, not this shit.

874
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,040
Don't play our podcast for her.

875
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
I want to-

876
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
Not necessarily this one.

877
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
Well, any of them.

878
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,680
I just want to rejigger that advice real quick or recalibrate.

879
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,960
Griffin, I'm a professional songwriter.

880
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,840
I don't know if you know, but professional songwriter.

881
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,640
I mean, I play off in empty clubs with my band for free.

882
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,080
I've been having a hard time writing songs lately.

883
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,840
Can you give me ideas for things to write about?

884
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,000
Yours truly, Musically Constipated.

885
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,360
There seems like one right there.

886
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:47,920
I really, I wish I could, but I've, I can't write songs.

887
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,160
Like I love playing guitar and I love listening to songs.

888
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,760
I've never, I actually, I wrote one song in college, but I swear there's nothing you guys

889
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,480
can say that would make me talk about it on the show.

890
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,300
Don't even like, not joking.

891
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,480
Don't even try to make me talk about it on the show because it was, it was the worst

892
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,480
thing ever.

893
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
And it was for a girl.

894
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,640
Uh, it may have had references to Superman and that's all we're going to go into about

895
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
it.

896
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,640
Okay.

897
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Go ahead.

898
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,640
Just give us a few chords.

899
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,640
I can't.

900
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,480
Justin, but Justin, I think that you are a more prolific songwriter than I am.

901
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Yeah.

902
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,320
I, I think you got to write about, here's, here's what you do.

903
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,640
You take the, you take out your songwriter's microscope.

904
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,520
If you pull it out all the way back and you look at everything, then it's more of like

905
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,120
a magnifying glass or a telescope.

906
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:43,960
And you see real, real general things like, like love and the sun, but everybody's written

907
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,960
about those things.

908
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,560
So what you got to do is you got to take that off that microscope and just get really deep

909
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,460
and find the things in your life that you think that no one else does.

910
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,600
And I bet that you're going to find some honest stuff there.

911
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,280
Things that you don't think happened to everybody, just to you.

912
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,020
And those are the things that when people hear them, they really relate to them jerking

913
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,360
off to space jam.

914
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,120
I wasn't going to say that, but yeah, I mean, for example, can I, can I counterpoint that?

915
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Is it possible that maybe all the songs have been written?

916
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,000
I think that's totally possible.

917
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,080
Every idea has been thought.

918
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,400
Every song has been written.

919
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,200
There's no more room for any more music in the world.

920
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,360
You got to find a song that you like and then write the opposite song of it.

921
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,360
Right.

922
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,360
Do you know what I'm saying?

923
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,200
Like take a song like, let me think.

924
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Good Sunsetting.

925
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,200
How about that?

926
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,400
Good Sunsetting and write Bad Moonrise.

927
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,640
Son of a bitch.

928
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
What's up?

929
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,600
Who then now?

930
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,480
I think that, I think that the greatest thing you can do musically is not write a song and

931
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,160
then tell people that say, I'm a songwriter, but I'm making a powerful statement by not

932
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,180
writing any new music.

933
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,640
This is my song, Four Minutes of Silence.

934
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,240
Why don't you go the Sigur Ros route and, and write songs in a gibberish language?

935
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,560
I mean, there's, it's still challenging.

936
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:11,880
You have to write pretty chords.

937
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,940
Is that what you're asking?

938
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,000
Maybe he's not asking about lyrics.

939
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,040
Maybe he's asking, asking about chord progressions.

940
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,280
And if that's the case, E, E diminished, F sharp minor, F sharp minor diminished.

941
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
You're welcome.

942
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
You're welcome.

943
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,860
It's a recipe for success.

944
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,920
You know, you could set yourself up a project.

945
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,960
John Linnell has a project called State Songs where he just goes to the states and writes

946
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:32,960
songs about each of them.

947
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,640
You could set yourself up something like that, like do the periodic table of elements or

948
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
something.

949
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
Oh, I like that idea.

950
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,640
Wouldn't that be good?

951
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,800
I would listen to that album.

952
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,360
How about the food pyramid?

953
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,280
That's a, that's a, that's like a, that's a six song EP.

954
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,600
You have your song about wheats and grains.

955
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
The organs of the body.

956
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,600
Ooh, I like that.

957
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:54,640
What about an EP about the different levels of terror alert that we could be in?

958
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I like that.

959
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,640
What about the different levels of hell?

960
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
That's not bad either.

961
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,160
See, it sets you up a structure like that.

962
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,760
I think you're going to do real well.

963
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,840
I wouldn't read this Yahoo answer.

964
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,160
It was sent in by Louis Dog, who has sent in a few things before.

965
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Thank you, Louis Dog.

966
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,300
Uh, it's by Yahoo Answers user Michael Jean, who asks, should I tell my wife that I want

967
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:21,560
to join a nude men's yoga group?

968
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,960
I have been interested in learning about the benefits of practicing nude yoga.

969
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,120
I have been practicing it at home in the nude for a year now.

970
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,640
Online I have read about nude yoga groups practicing in a heated room and I would like

971
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,140
to do it.

972
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,280
These groups are generally filled with men.

973
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,640
I'm not sure I should give my wife all of the details of what I want to do.

974
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,120
I'm not gay, but I like the idea of being nude with other men.

975
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,640
I don't know.

976
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:56,280
I'm not so sure you know what gay means.

977
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,800
Maybe that is a bigger, it's not.

978
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,000
Maybe we need to define some terms here.

979
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Yeah.

980
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,580
Do you like being nude with a bunch of other dudes?

981
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,960
Is it fucked up that like I totally don't, I wouldn't have seen this as like a gay thing

982
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,200
at all if the room wasn't heated?

983
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,880
You know what I feel bad for?

984
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Who's that?

985
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,700
I feel bad for the one dude in the group that rolled up like nude yoga, yeah I want to check

986
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,960
out those girls bending around.

987
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh no.

988
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,240
He rolls up and it's just a room full of dudes, but he's already committed.

989
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
He can't leave.

990
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:36,560
I mean, I am, I am, can you read to me the part where he says it's, these classes are

991
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,920
usually what?

992
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,200
These groups are generally filled with men.

993
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,200
Filled with men.

994
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,920
There's not like five or six, it turns into a big game of Twister.

995
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:57,120
You are, listen, I don't care, gay, straight, bisexual, trans, you are going to see.

996
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:07,080
If the room is literally filled with men, this heated ass room filled with men.

997
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,600
It doesn't matter if you're not, if you're not gay, like first sunrise salutation that

998
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,000
you do, you're going to get it.

999
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You're going to get it.

1000
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It's like a furry quilt made of stinky pretzels, just a nightmare.

1001
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,360
It would just be the worst.

1002
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,000
I am, I, I have a couple of gay friends that I'm pretty sure would describe that as the

1003
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
gayest.

1004
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
The gayest.

1005
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,360
Like, and that's cool.

1006
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,940
Like just like accept that.

1007
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,320
Just accept it that you were the first down downwards facing dog.

1008
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
You're going to get it.

1009
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,320
That's not, no, no, no.

1010
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,440
He's going to be downward facing balls.

1011
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,440
I'm a, I'm a straight guy.

1012
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,600
I don't say, God, I wish it was just a big swimming pool filled with vaginas that I could

1013
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,600
jump into.

1014
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,720
Like that's the, that's what you're equating it to.

1015
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
Right.

1016
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,280
It's not really gay and like, it's not gay or straight, it's not a gay or straight issue.

1017
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,680
It's the fact that it's just gross, like it's gross.

1018
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,680
It's not like gay.

1019
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,600
Like I'm attracted to other guys, which means that I want to stretch it around with them

1020
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,680
and have them, some guy spraying his butt cheeks in front of me.

1021
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,000
Like I don't, let's, let's, let's redefine terms here.

1022
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,200
Instead of calling it a nude yoga class, let's say you're walking down a hallway and you

1023
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,080
turn to your friend and say, hey, Bill, do you want to go into that heated room filled

1024
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,080
with naked guys?

1025
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,080
It's heated.

1026
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,400
It's so hot in here.

1027
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,080
I am sweating so much.

1028
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,080
I would say glistening.

1029
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,080
Yeah.

1030
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Thank you.

1031
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,080
You're a very gay man.

1032
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,080
He was comfortable with that.

1033
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,040
I'm uncomfortable with the fact that I'm so very gay.

1034
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:44,680
This is weird because it's like the, it's like a scorched earth policy to being gay.

1035
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:49,200
Like you can't have sex with guys because you're married, so you do something gayer

1036
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,560
than have sex with men.

1037
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,560
It's like, we found it.

1038
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:58,560
We just broke the world.

1039
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,560
Eureka!

1040
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:12,480
Now, now, if you did yoga in a heated room with a bunch of people dressed up like animals,

1041
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
how does that rate on the scale that we've created?

1042
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,680
It rates on the scale of, why did Justin go to jail?

1043
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,280
Did you hear he burned that building down?

1044
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,840
He burned a building full of other people in it to the ground, but I heard they're furries,

1045
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
so it's okay.

1046
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
Okay.

1047
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,880
I do want to hear Griffin's last question.

1048
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,400
I don't know how he's going to top that last, Jim, but we got a couple of quick housekeeping

1049
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
things.

1050
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,360
The site mbmbam.com is live and new.

1051
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:43,120
If you like new sites, check out annafurlaxis.com, she's a friend of the show.

1052
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:47,560
She's a burlesque knife thrower, she just relaunched her site.

1053
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,080
We are going to have new gear.

1054
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
It's fresh, by the way.

1055
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
I checked it out.

1056
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
It's fresh.

1057
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,080
Yeah.

1058
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,080
It's awesome.

1059
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,080
New gear is going to be up.

1060
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,080
Gear.

1061
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
No, I like it.

1062
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,080
Okay.

1063
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,080
New gear.

1064
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,080
New mbmbam gear is going to be up.

1065
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,080
New equipment.

1066
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Probably the next week or so.

1067
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,080
Got the coffee mug.

1068
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,080
Got a girl's shirt.

1069
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,080
Got a pack your bags and move away shirt.

1070
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,080
Not a girl size shirt.

1071
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,560
We just, we got a girl's shirt.

1072
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Yeah.

1073
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
We got it.

1074
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,280
We're auctioning it off to the highest loanless bidder.

1075
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,280
Smells so great.

1076
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,280
Wow.

1077
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,280
Still smells like girl.

1078
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,280
Smells like a girl.

1079
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,880
We vacuum sealed it.

1080
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,880
So do that.

1081
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Get on those forums.

1082
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,280
There's great discussions going on there.

1083
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Really is.

1084
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:28,200
I'm seeing a lot of people talking about like books that they like and music that they like

1085
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,720
and other podcasts that they listen to.

1086
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,880
Like it's a community.

1087
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,880
It's a real community.

1088
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,880
It is a community.

1089
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,200
It's such a specific thread.

1090
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,480
I'm going to have, you know what, I'll just tell Craig now.

1091
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,360
We need a thread for people to introduce themselves.

1092
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,360
We're making.

1093
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,360
No, that exists.

1094
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,360
It's stickied.

1095
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,360
What's up?

1096
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,360
It's stickied.

1097
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,360
Is it?

1098
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,360
What's up?

1099
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,360
God.

1100
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,560
I don't know if that was Craig or not, but good on you, Craig.

1101
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,000
And I know we've got some new designs coming up.

1102
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,360
Actually I just got them in the mail.

1103
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,360
They look dope.

1104
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,360
Oh, I didn't know that.

1105
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,360
Yeah.

1106
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,360
I know.

1107
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:02,360
I'm going to have to show them off.

1108
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,360
Yeah.

1109
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,920
And then, you know, just, oh, Twitter.

1110
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,200
You can tweet about us.

1111
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Use the hashtag NBNBAM.com.

1112
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Just use hashtag NBNBAM.

1113
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:19,520
Oh, I was just going to say we started something on Twitter in the middle of this week that

1114
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:26,160
if you go on iTunes and review and rate the show, I'll give you a personalized compliment

1115
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,080
and I'm enjoying it way more than you are.

1116
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,080
So do it.

1117
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,080
Cause I like complimenting people.

1118
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,800
So basically you review the show, either the show or the experience, and then you tweet

1119
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,880
about it.

1120
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,400
Make sure you use either the NBNBAM hashtag or at Travis.

1121
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,840
Don't just at Travis cause we want everybody to see that you're your dedication.

1122
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,880
But Travis will give you a personalized compliment just for you.

1123
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,120
And tell a friend, tell a friend to give them Bern OCD with a couple of shows on it.

1124
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,120
Cause you know what?

1125
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,160
Next week is our 30th episode and I think that the best way that we could celebrate

1126
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:03,240
is by reaching out to a whole new generation of listeners.

1127
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:07,240
If you listen to the first 29 apps, you are officially on the ground floor.

1128
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,960
I know we keep pushing that bar back, but you, if you're listening to this now, congratulations,

1129
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,960
you're on the ground floor.

1130
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,960
It's time to evangelize.

1131
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,960
Awesome.

1132
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,440
Okay guys, well Griffin hit me with that last big question.

1133
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,440
Sure.

1134
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,360
This one was sent in by Jonathan Bartram, who's got a two show streak going.

1135
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,360
It's by Yahoo!

1136
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:33,120
user Arianna, who asks, poll, should I get high today?

1137
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:40,160
This is Justin McElroy, I'm voting yes.

1138
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,040
This is Travis McElroy, I'm voting yes.

1139
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
I'm Griffin McElroy, I'm gonna say no.

1140
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,720
This has been my brother, my brother and me, Mr. Dianis, going to wear on the lips.

1141
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,760
Keep your heart, three stacks, keep your heart, hey, keep your heart, three stacks, keep your

1142
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,760
heart.

1143
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,280
Man, these girls are smart, three stacks, these girls are smart.

1144
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,780
Play your part.

1145
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,760
The best answer on that last question, it was by Yahoo!

1146
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:21,240
answers user Geeks or Freaks, who responded, if you do, this might happen, with a link

1147
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:31,400
to Afro Man's Because I Got High music video, and then she adds, lol, listen to the lyrics.

1148
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,680
The cautionary tale that is Afro Man's Because I Got High.

1149
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,760
Hey, don't just, don't just absentmindedly play this in the background, you gots to listen

1150
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
to those lyrics.

1151
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:55,400
You just got to listen to them.
