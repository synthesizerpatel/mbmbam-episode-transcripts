1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:49,840
Hello everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me, an advice show for the

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,400
modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,320
And I'm Hollywood hitmaker, Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, boys, just got back from another meeting with the producers and director.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,560
Oh, of our podcast?

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,720
Of our podcast. They have some big notes, especially as they're heading into Max Fun Drive.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,400
Last week, it was my heel turn. This week, they want more storylines. They said not enough

12
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,240
storylines.

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,440
Okay.

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
Some more, it could be behind the scenes, it could be in front of the scenes,

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,520
it could be in the middle of the scenes.

16
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
Well, this is great news because I've just become like a sexy doctor.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,760
Like I've just become a sort of sexual doctor.

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,200
That feels like two different things, Griffin, a sexy doctor versus a sexual doctor.

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,480
Okay, so yeah, that's good, Trav. I don't like diagnosing give medicine to help people sexual.

20
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:54,800
Do you know what I mean? It's just like my body looks good and all the patients are like,

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,480
please. And I'm like, I can't. I am happily married.

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,680
Okay.

23
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
But I'm also, I'm pretty darn good at it. Like I can do an IV. Oh my God, guys,

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,080
I had to get some blood work done yesterday, not COVID related, do not sweat.

25
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,360
I'm going to continue to sweat as your brother because I don't know why you got blood work done.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,880
Yeah, just for funsies or?

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,120
Yeah.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,880
It is an allergy panel. It's like the nerdiest imaginable reason to get blood work done.

29
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah. Anywho, the person who was taking my blood was quite chatty,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,960
and that's their prerogative. I'm not here to, you know, shame them for that.

31
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,240
But they were doing a lot of characters, I'll say. They were doing a lot of skit work,

32
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,480
let's say. And at one point they were looking for my vein and they said,

33
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,200
Ooh, that's a nice big juicy vein. Gonna get a lot of blood out of that.

34
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
And started to do a vampire thing. And like for the remainder of,

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,560
from the moment the needle entered my arm until the moment I left the room,

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,400
she spoke in a vampire voice and she did, I swear to God.

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
And it was one of the top five worst things that's ever happened to me,

38
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,800
because can you two imagine a more sort of hostage scenario

39
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,640
than having a needle in your body and you just can't, you can't move.

40
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,360
And also they're going to try out some new SNL audition tape tactics on you.

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,280
This is the difference between Griffin and I, because Griffin's,

42
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,160
Griffin's, let's say fear here, Griffin's discomfort

43
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,240
comes from him seeing this as this person trying out new material on him,

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,960
where I would be thinking like, if I was a vampire,

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,880
the job I would get would be drawing blood from people.

46
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,920
Well, no. And so who's to say that

47
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,920
this isn't the reveal? This isn't the prestige.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,240
I don't know how, it's a fair point, Travis,

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,520
but like I can actually not imagine a worse job for a vampire

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
because you're going to be so tempted by this shit.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,880
And I hope that this lab has their shit on lock enough

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,040
that like if blood goes missing,

53
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,560
I want my stuff on the books somewhere. I only have so much blood.

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Well, maybe they just take a little bit extra, you know,

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,200
the juice is running and in this case, the juice is your blood.

56
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
Sure. The juice is also running on the MaxFun drive,

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
which we're going to talk about a little bit later on this episode.

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,560
With this MaxFun drive has very chill vibes.

59
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
That's the feedback we've been getting is a lot of people say that like,

60
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
when we ask for money, it's like going on a beach vacation,

61
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,760
which is so cool. And if you want to join the network now,

62
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,520

So go to maximumfun.org slash join.

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,160
It's me, the head of the network, Reggie Big Shot.

67
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
I heard you need a little drama to spice things up.

68
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,000
Boy, here's some for you. Sorry, the cigars are catching up on me.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,560
Here's some.

70
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
Please don't say that again.

71
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,080
The cigars are catching up on me.

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
They're catching up on you?

73
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
Catching up on me.

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Listen, that's not the point. My personal health,

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,960
that's not the point, kids.

76
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,720
No, but I am worried about you. Are you okay?

77
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
Yeah, I love you.

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
I loved it when you were going to bring it at the beginning

79
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,200
and the old days of ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,640
I loved at the farm, farm jokes and you did a lot of blue stuff

81
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,960
about lots of different marginalized groups of people.

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,840
I love that.

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
Loved that, yeah.

84
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
You gave us a lot of positive feedback.

85
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
I'm not so crazy about the new stuff.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,080
And honestly, boys, the well's running a little dry.

87
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
So here's the deal.

88
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840

okay it's been a pleasure um kind of turning into beetle juice a little bit so i gotta listen i i

154
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:22,240
gotta go yeah get the fuck out of here hey you know what i miss him like it's weird because when

155
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,080
he was here like i didn't he didn't go down he didn't go down the stairs he just shut the door

156
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:36,320
he's listening there okay great he kind of he stood there he fell well he tripped a little

157
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,800
bit which is kind of does confirm my suspicions that he was quite drunk um during his appearance

158
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,920
on this show should we do questions yeah that would be nice i was i was kind of enjoying just

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,560
you know freeform a little bit but uh i'd love to i'd love to get in you know justice right

160
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:04,800
fuck this show now the show can begin also my third i have a trip planned once things return

161
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:14,960
to normal optimistic once things return to the new normal perhaps to go on once we've established a

162
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,480
new society yeah uh once to go on a bachelor party on a houseboat as a prank we have purchased

163
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,440
a dissolving swimsuit however we are at a loss as to how we can get the groom to wear in the

164
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:38,400
water without him becoming suspicious what should we do that's from bear bummer in canada well good

165
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,040
news is you've probably given yourself i don't know 36 months uh head start on this show we'll

166
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,840
get the whiteboard out and we'll uh we'll start devising a an intricate an intricate plan now i

167
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,720
am going to say i have not done any research into this perfect um but based off of things i know

168
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,680
about things that dissolve i'm willing to bet that perhaps the quality of material of this swimsuit

169
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:13,120
may be noticeably different dead giveaway situation yes standard swimsuit material

170
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,400
not i'm going to live in fear every time i enter a body of water that i have been pranked and now

171
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:26,320
my meat and two veg is about to pop out and that is no good i do think what it boils down to is

172
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,720
uh of of top of my head presents to give i can think of i got you this swimsuit

173
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:44,080
is uh it's a real left fielder that's a real curveball as they say uh i i can think of maybe

174
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,000
two friends of mine but if they got me a really cool looking swimsuit but even then if i was a

175
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,680
company that made dissolvable swimsuits i don't think i'd put a lot of time into the design

176
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,240
process we gotta strike gifting the swimsuit like that's not gonna work and so now we're

177
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,280
getting into a scenario where you have to steal all of his swimsuits and then when it's time to

178
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,880
swim you're like oh don't worry you can borrow my pair actually that's it that's a fucking great

179
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,400
idea and that's gonna work you can borrow my paper thin like pair of syndrome hey it's the

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,720
your friend naked in the pool huh shorts can be worn as normal but within seconds of bin in water

swimming someone's got a lifeguard yes now i am watching a video of this happening oh trav trav

200
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,800
and uh it's this poor man appears to be in the middle of a hotel like a very public place yeah

201
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,480
as his clothing is actively failing him all right and i would say that this goes very quickly from

202
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,760
oh he's got kind of a smirk on his face what is happening to i'm gonna get arrested i'm i'm in a

203
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,440
public place and my all my bits are gonna be out we should probably make it clear the three of us

204
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:06,240
are having a lot of fun here this is uh it sort of ethically reprehensible and genuinely uh should

205
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,640
be a legal sort of uh thing and you shouldn't get your friend's privates out um as a joke uh

206
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,960
that's that seems like that's we're all on the same page i didn't want people to write in and

207
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,200
be like so you like this particular like this uh no it's inappropriate to get anyone's bits out

208
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:34,240
without their explicit consent i will say they have a few more safety recommendations here

209
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:44,880
oh boy how well mentioned first off is this at the end it says keep dry which yes iron iron on

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,160
of a problem with the shorts they must be returned for inspection that's a cool it's a cool gig yeah

216
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,400
because just all of his friends laughing and it's like get it your dick and he's like i yeah i guess

217
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,120
so this youtube video is i'm now looking at a man's whole balls on youtube i didn't know you

218
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,960

219
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,840
option i'm glad we all got there together uh can i do a yahoo you know what would be fun

220
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,960
what's that you wear them and under those you have another slightly smaller pair of swim trunks

221
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,640
that say like happy bachelor party they're not today friend but even that's a that's an even

222
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,360
longer walk isn't it travis because it's like you have to make them think you're wearing dissolving

223
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,720
swim trunks which they may not know is a thing so that's a hard seller just like boy i hope these

224
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,880
don't dissolve when i get in the water like some swim trunks are named to have you guys heard about

225
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,600
those dissolving syndromes these aren't them right you guys would tell me right yes these aren't my

226
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,560
normal swim trunks but um do they feel funny here i go cannonball i don't know i'm gonna get i feel

227
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,520
terrible i can't believe you my friends will do this to me when we're here to celebrate derrick's

228
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,720

229
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,520

230
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:52,240
though um what are you talking about you pranked yourself chris yes and i almost had me here's a

231
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,480
here's a yahoo that was sent in by several folks thank you everyone who sent this in it's yahoo

232
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:05,280
answers user josh who asks what's next for knives yes knives are completely useless in this new age

233
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,360
of guns and drones in my opinion they are going to have to change the designs of knives and add

234
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,280
interesting and useful new features to compete with guns and drones what do you think is the

235
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,880
next evolution of knives i enjoyed this question more before i read this additional information

236
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:26,720
because i like knives more in the abstract rather than as hurting hurting tools tools for hurting

237
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,200
i i would also argue that um knives still do things that guns and drones don't do

238
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:42,400
oh sure yeah stab for one yeah cut yeah point poke poke that's a that's about a slash slice i

239
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:51,120
mean that's about it no you like you use it to uh you know what if you are a a person who is lost

240
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,040
in the wilderness it's a lot easier to use a knife to like cut down stuff for shelter than a drone

241
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:04,560
uh or a gun yeah or a gun totally i think if you were ordering them knife would be easiest to cut

242
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:13,280
down some branches then gun then drone in that order i think that the issue here is if you if

243
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,560
they want to make cooler bigger better gun they can just make a bigger gun problem with knife

244
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:25,600
you make a knife too big it's sword it's a sword so it still does need to be a knife

245
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:31,040
um that's all proportions though isn't it hmm oh you're saying if you're a bigger person

246
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,960
if the hilt is also gargantuan then you could still say that it's a knife yeah or you could

247
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,400
have uh if if paul hogan's around you could if he says it's a knife he gets to indicate basically

248
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,400
what's not a knife and what is a knife he's really busy yeah he is pretty busy i you know what i like

249
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,520
you know what i like when they have those knives that do other things but they're not just knives

250
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,360
it's like here's knives in here and also uh it's a bottle opener and also it's got like a little

251
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,520
wrench in there that's fun to me but maybe they take it further and it's like it's a knife and

252
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,360
it's a sandwich right or like it's a knife and oh god oh wait this is topical let me try again can

253
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,160
i try again yeah please it's a knife the knife sandwich thing was uh pretty stupid okay but let

254
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,880
me try let me try let me try again this is really topical with uh a lot of viral stuff that's been

255
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,920
going on on the internet right now so uh okay it's it's a knife but then you go to pick it up it's

256
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:38,400
cake what okay this is actually a perfect thing is it yeah this is a perfect time for me to stop

257
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,520
the entire show and at i missed it the thing that the inception of it and i only caught the after

258
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,720
shocks of that particular meme and it has it before i i couldn't piece together that it was

259
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,920
some sort of meme and i thought i was kind of losing it for just a little bit so what's going

260
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,840
on there with that go ahead and walk me through that please well it all began that sounds pretty

261
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,360
boring are you sure you want him to do that if he could do it in 12 seconds it began with a viral

262
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,760
video where it's like oh this looks like a roll of toilet paper no we're cutting into it it's cake

263
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,400
this looks like a bottle of lotion oh we're cutting into it it's cake but at no point did

264
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
they say look at this it looks like cake no it's actually a roll of toilet paper that would have

265
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:28,160
been way more impressive to me that's true i can wipe my butt with a kick uh i'm sorry i'm gonna

266
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,560
stop the podcast i'm gonna stop the stopping the podcast to say griffin walk me through that real

267
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:39,760
quick i don't want to fuck this this episode in particular has been like here's a funny awesome

268
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:47,680
badass thing that i just said and you're like show your work fuck that i think uh we've danced

269
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,440
around what's next for knives and what we can do is sort of knife innovators sharper i think you're

270
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,800
you eventually you reach a sort of like atomic like limit there like a sort of a sort of like

271
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,640
you can split an atom right and that's dangerous because those motherfuckers are all over the place

272
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:14,960
uh so second like a second blade but oh i've got it like a but but running perpendicular

273
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,680
to the first blade or like coming out the side of the hilt or back on the back like you're uh

274
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:26,880
like you're um uh the freaking red the guy the gentleman from uh phantom menace yep

275
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:37,840
ms mr maul i believe is his name dr maul esqire i knew he was a zebrack but i couldn't remember

276
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:46,480
his name that's fucked up now i i let me pitch this i i and i'm gonna picture it try to describe

277
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,080
it and i don't understand how the inner workings would you know work but imagine a tube right and

278
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,280
you load the knife into it and it is pressurized in some way that you can release that pressure

279
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,800
and the knife shoots forth from the tube and bears itself into whatever you're pointing it at

280
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:09,600
i mean i'm again i was more thinking about kitchen innovations but i have had some trouble

281
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,560
with sweet potatoes that i imagine knife gun would help me out with damn you think whoever

282
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,200
invented the bayonet was like i'm gonna take the rest of the year off this is the best guys guys

283
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,120
guys guys guys check it out you know how we since we got gun and like we've just been sort of rolling

284
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,720
over like hulk me has been going wild since we got gun but we all kind of still miss sword

285
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,880
check it the fuck out i did a kick-ass job today uh i i enjoyed that in the movie the old guard

286
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,200
did you guys see that flag with charlie's throne and a bunch of other people in it no no um yeah

287
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,160
it was good and they they they've been alive for a very long very long time and they're very good

288
00:27:52,160 --> 00:28:00,960
at murder and they always bring gun but then also ax is with them they bring ax too and it

289
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,000
seems weird sitting point out like gun can't do everything they need to do they they need

290
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,320
ax still to to come to come to the party i wonder if it's like a security ax like it just makes you

291
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,920
feel better i guess well if gun acts up and turns against you it's like a little old lady who used

292
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,080
an ax to chop up all her guns exactly there's not a lot of moving parts in ax you know it's hard

293
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,480
there's not a lot of points of failure for ax gun who even knows how that who knows what the fuck's

294
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:42,480
going on in there it's like my computer stick heavy part sharp edge done we love it you know

315
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,760
about to it's so funny i was about to say it and then you can i can i get a hand on the ball yeah

316
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:05,840
trap yeah i desire another question to be delivered to me upon a platter of gold it can never just be

317
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,640
the thing the finest questions no humanity bring me up a spoke question uh my mom texted me today

318
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,480
and said she wanted to get into bitcoin she asked me whether it was a good investment and she started

319
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,200
small i don't know why she wants to get involved with this stuff and i'm pretty sure bitcoin is a

320
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,160
scam my question is is it ethical to help my only mother invest in investing cryptocurrency and that's

321
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:39,200
from cryptoskeptic all money is a scam when you think about it guys go off because it's all just

322
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:49,120
made up bits and boops bullshit oh this piece of paper is worth this much metal go off go off it's

323
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:58,880
fucking nothing that said i think bitcoin is even more so bitcoin is absolute i mean yes but okay

324
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,720
i can answer some of these questions i i know the exact right time to get into bitcoin was three

325
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,600
months ago every single time at any point in history the right time to do it was before you

326
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,800
ever started uh doing it right so so that that is that was a challenge bitcoin is one of those

327
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:26,400
blind spots for me where if someone who was older came to me and said so justin what is

328
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,800
the deal with bitcoin i feel like i would have to just sort of freeze in this and remain perfectly

329
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,560
still and silent until they thought i was something was wrong with me and they left the room because

330
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,440
that would be so complete would be my ignorance that i think it would lower my stock sort of

331
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,960
permanently in there like when their internet broke right they wouldn't come to the j man they

332
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,640
wouldn't listen to my recommendations on tv shows like any well and the problem is is even if you

333
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,680
were able to explain it to them they would believe you less it would they would it would

334
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,920
seem more like you were fucking with them than if you just stood there silent like a statue

335
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:13,120
because the truth is bitcoin basically boils down to um i'm gonna send you a jpeg and i'm gonna tell

336
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,000
you how much that jpeg is worth then someone else is gonna say hey give me that jpeg and then i'm

337
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,120
gonna tell you how much that jpeg is worth it's it's it's all based on like perceived i'm actually

338
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,480
feeling more calm listening to you talk makes me feel more confident yeah right i actually travis

339
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,920
thank you i do feel like thank you for cheering me up i do feel better uh listening to you try

340
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,280
to explain that's all it is it's all perceived desperately clutch at any sort of cognizant

341
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:46,640
thoughts about bitcoin perceived value because the irony is as we these three goobers sit here

342
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,000
and even just say every time we say the word bitcoin bitcoin becomes a little more valuable

343
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,360
it's just it increases a little bit because it's like i've heard about bitcoin that's something

344
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:03,840
right that is something that is all it is i can't get your mom into it now she'll be rich in five

345
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,520
days i uh heard through the grapevine about the uh very serious twitter hack that happened last

346
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,680
week where uh a bunch of different big accounts got got and those big accounts did ask people

347
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:26,560
to send them bitcoin and it's bad it's a terrible uh it's a terrible invasion of privacy and given

348
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,200
twitter's sort of uh global political importance i guess that's like a harrowing thing but i do

349
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,440
just want to dial in uh-huh that this probably did work on some people some people were uh

350
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,680
successfully bamboozled by this and i do wonder if barack obama's tweet president barack hussein

351
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:51,040
obama a lot of people forget about these things important to me if he got anybody with i am giving

352
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,200
back to my community due to covet 19 all bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back

353
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,280
doubled if you send back one thousand dollars i will send back two thousand dollars then there's

354
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,480
the bitcoin link then president barack hussein obama said only doing this for the next 30 minutes

355
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:13,440
enjoy why really why does me why does barack have all of this bitcoin saved up why does he do that

356
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,000
why is he doubling it why is it just for the net why is he doing a supermarket sweep

357
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,160
bonus round why did he tell me to enjoy sending him the money so he can double the money how

358
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,360
why would that be the only exchange why not just i'll send you let me hey say hey and i'll send

359
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,680
you some bitcoin why is the exchange part necessary at all i am giving back to my community

360
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,800
my community of people who have and know what bitcoin is enjoy for 30 minutes i'm your president

361
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,360
barack obama and your former president and i do want you to send me the bitcoin but do not sweat

362
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,960
because i'm going to send back twice as much as you send me i know what bitcoin is you see these

363
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,560
swordfish sunglasses i'm wearing and i want you to enjoy this and my cousin doug has a great

364
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,280
investment opportunity that he says is a sure thing so all i need is your bitcoin and then i

365
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,800
will invest in this slug racing circuit and then i oh shit we're broke ah damn it fucking billy

366
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,320
gates tweets it fucking elon musk tweets it and is like hey i have bitcoin come and get it

367
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,520
for 30 minutes enjoy then i think like those fucking nerds probably know what's up president

368
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,800
barack obama swooping in and being like i also have bitcoin come get it 30 minutes baby i've got

369
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,440
30 minutes worth of bitcoin travis um i'd love to dive more into your knowledge of an understanding

370
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:54,560
of bitcoin um so griffin do you understand bitcoin mining uh it's where they use graphics cards to

371
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,160
get the bitcoin and keep me from being able to find the graphics cards travis can you tell me

372
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,400
how computers make bitcoins with bitcoin mining and i griffin yeah i want you to judge and i want

373
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,040
i want you to hear travis's and then i want you to hear the real answer and then you judge which is

374
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,400
just fucking wild now okay i want everyone to know i could do the thing where i'm like i don't

375
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,280
fucking know i'm a cool jock but i'm going to do my best purely yes please from context yes

376
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,360
i'm going to say bitcoin mining is when there's like some ai just searching around the web looking

377
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:36,720
for just it's kind of like the loose change of bitcoin wherever there's like point zero zero

378
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,240
zero zero zero zero zero one percent of a bitcoin or whatever that someone has like forgotten about

379
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,040
or maybe while they were doing a transaction it got rounded down or up or whatever and that

380
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,680
that ai just scoops it on up and saves it for this sounds fucking wrong okay so here's the right answer

381
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:06,080
here so you get a there's all these really hard math problems okay on the bitcoin network there's

382
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,240
all these really hard math problems and they're so hard that the computer has to both work very hard

383
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,480
but also get lucky to solve it and the the um the chances against them doing it is like one in 13

384
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,640
trillion so it's very unlikely that they can solve this very hard math problems but if they do they

385
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:37,840
win a prize okay wait so hold on so there's a computer goodwill hunting its way through a

386
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:47,280
website and like standing before the whiteboard and trying to get lucky which what that even means

387
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,800
in the terms of computing is both baffling and terrifying to me and the computer is trying to

388
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:01,280
get lucky and if a computer solves a math problem a very hard yes thank you really can't very hard

389
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,040
math problem it gets some the computer gets some with the prize yes well i mean technically belongs

390
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,520
i'm sure i mean the computer does not have rights whoa all right all right but so its owner would

391
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:24,720
own the uh um you know the bitcoin but yes that is that is how i understand it is that the computer

392
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,680
the computer doesn't really does a bunch of hard math and eventually gets it right and gets a

393
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:38,960
little prize that's a bitcoin huh i think amazingly and i i this is of course uh completely subjective

394
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,840
but i think my answer made more sense than the thing you said justin's envisions a world that

395
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:51,360
makes me much happier because is there some sort of deranged mathematician trillionaire somewhere

396
00:39:51,360 --> 00:40:00,080
that's like i i cannot die until these impossible formulae have been um discovered who this is

397
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,720
who makes the question bitcoin makes the question no okay they only really they only release

398
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:17,360
a few but okay this is not fuck this is fucking true they only release a little bit of extra

399
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:24,080
puzzle bonus puzzles they release the puzzles on the back of their menus they release the

400
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:31,760
puzzles in what's called a block reward and the block reward is halved every uh 210 000

401
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:41,040
blocks around every four years so in 2009 it was 50 in 2013 it was 25 in 2018 it was 12.5

402
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,920
and uh somewhere this year it'll be 6.25 right so they only release a few puzzles

403
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,320
a few new puzzles they're releasing less puzzles just to get the bitcoin out there but who's

404
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:03,360
making up the puzzles justin the the computer creates the so the computer creates a puzzle

405
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,120
it can't this is this is probably the creator can be surprised i can't solve and also the

406
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:13,920
puzzles get harder every two weeks they just throw an extra three in there i didn't know there's

407
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:30,640
three in okay this was an x but now it's a z fuck you you are you are 44 000 times more likely to

408
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,760
win the powerball jackpot with a single lottery ticket then you are to pick the correct hash

409
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,360
on a single try which is the correct putt to solve this fucking puzzle you will not solve

410
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:50,640
this puzzle do they have any word searches no it's all jumbled but it's hard but it's hard ones

411
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,000
they're like this is like nine letters so hopefully that helps hey just let your mom listen

412
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,760
10 minutes she's out just just in case our investments in bitcoin don't uh pay out i would

413
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:22,720
like to invite us all for a quick sojourn to uh to the money real quick before we do ads folks

414
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,800
this just occurred to me that you might have listened to that whole cryptocurrency section

415
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,280
and thought you know that's not like a cry for help from the macro so i should explain how

416
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,680
cryptocurrency works to them and uh you you would be wrong oh wow what a swing and a miss that

417
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,880
interpretation would be you could not be further off my friend nope actually you know what i'm

418
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,120
perfectly happy where i'm at i'll say i'll say this if you do you do need those just dump them

419
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:51,840
in my mentions and this is a service i can begin to provide to you justin and travis because i

420
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:58,560
i ain't popped in on those bad boys in a bit i do i i send it to me and i will i will send the

421
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,120
information out to my brothers i can be point of first contact i i'd actually rather use this as

422
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,680
a test because if you send it to us we'll know you skip the ass yeah oh yeah and that and it

423
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:17,040
makes you a an immoral thief yeah basically so please do not send it to us we don't want to know

424
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,720
how it works please uh you know who else isn't welcome in my mentions is uh plaque and uh tartar

425
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,560
build up and these guys are my teeth's worst enemies but do you know who my teeth's best

426
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,680

428
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,920
to guide a dentist recommended two minute routine and uh if you got a little kiddo smaller mouse

429
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,280
smaller teeth they got a little quip and it's right it's the right size for you uh i don't

430
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,280
i i don't like that that assumption was made griffin because just real quick baby dot even

468
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,640
where the crime is where you it says click here to do crime uh-huh and when you click it you go to

469
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,400
a page that is heinz creams and um if you let's say you wanted the mayo cream and i and i don't

470
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,520

471
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,480
it's actually heinz seriously good mayonnaise but the seriously is in brackets so i took it

472
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,240
upon myself to leave it out for comedic effect relish the creamy taste of heinz you can't say

473
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,280
we're talking about toppings you probably shouldn't use relish no as a as your okay relish

474
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,880
the creamy taste of heinz seriously good mayonnaise in an ice cream this make your own heinz creams

476
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,320
mayonnaise sauce a branded gift box a recipe card what if it didn't have that yeah it's like i don't

477
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,960
know you fucking figure it out here's some mayonnaise and a win and it's not pre-measured

478
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:00,560
let's be honest it seems like portions are way off it's wild i feel like the person writing this

479
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:06,720
press release had benjamin button disease and jack disease because it's like with each paragraph

480
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:12,880
they're sort of like age seems to be going backwards put good mayonnaise in cream sauce

481
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:21,360
in ice cream yay it also includes a reusable ice cream tub uh that's profane so you make mayonnaise

482
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,960
ice cream in it then you're like don't don't don't toss that vicki i'm gonna save that i

483
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,400
want to use it again for anything else and lastly a limited edition engraved golden scoop and spoon

484
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,760
it doesn't say what's engraved on it but i'm assuming it's the word perfect

485
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,480
i can only imagine um so let's go back to this press release here uh i will let you

486
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:53,360
know i'm looking at the website and the bad news is that the heinz ketchup creams

487
00:49:53,360 --> 00:50:01,840
is sold out i can't get that anymore you can get bbq creams huh you can get saucy sauce creams

488
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,360
these are all challenging there's a saucy sauce creams and then there's heinz salad creams what

489
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:15,120
is salad cream it's a tangy taste it's like uh salad dressing no i think i put that together

490
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,800
but like there's lots of different types of salad dressing well this is salad cream you get it it's

491
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:28,000
it's like it would be a good ice cream is is the good way to imagine it um so they've they've

492
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,880
listed the it says the tangy taste of salad creams makes it one of britain's most loved sauces and

493
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,600
now it's a heinz creams that zing we all know and love can be paired with the delicious sweetness

494
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:47,760
of summer strawberries on top of refreshing ice cream huh um heinz bbq creams is sweet sticky and

495
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:54,960
tongue tinglingly delicious oh water and flavor of classic heinz bbq sauce in a heinz creams

496
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,680
teamed with maple syrup pecans and perhaps a sprinkling of bacon bits and this sweet and

497
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,520
smoky ice cream will really pack a punch hey just real quick when i put something on my tongue

498
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:14,800
if the reaction my tongue has is to tangle that is body that is poison that is bad body to reject

499
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:22,320
it that is a bad thing to happen oh it's my whole mouth is buzzing um david chalbert the senior

500
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:29,120
brand manager at heinz sauce says this summer is looking different for many of us and while we might

501
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,160
be staycationing or staying at home more than in other years it doesn't mean you have to miss out

502
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,320
on the joys of a good ice cream heinz sauces are here to help hey david honestly you're right about

503
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:46,320

507
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:08,640

508
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,440

513
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:50,640
mixed with ice cream stop it we might we know it might seem like a bit of a crazy combo to some

514
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,720
but with heinz always at the forefront of innovation anything is possible hey david if

515
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:05,280
if anything is possible could i request a vaccine could that be first on your list

516
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,960
you fucking ketchup wizard you think if anything is possible you think when david turned in the

517
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,800
first draft of this press release press release somebody said like do we want to add any qualifiers

518
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:22,400
here where you just said forefront of innovation do we want to put like forefront of like dressing

519
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:30,400
innovation or something yeah sauce innovation no innovation no anything is possible we're the

520
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,640
bleeding edge of all technology both food and medical and we're gonna make this summer work for

521
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:45,280
you if you this is just like the bud light um the bud light asking robin robin things if if i call

522
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,120
you and i'm like hey this has all been really hard for everybody i'm just checking in to see

523
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:57,520
how you're doing what are you up to and you say i'm making mayonnaise ice cream i'm going to call

524
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,080
the authorities to come like check on you yeah because i'm worried that something has gone

525
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:09,760
terribly wrong i bet it's good though it's probably good is the one where you said the

526
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:17,760
bacon bits that got me a little bit the bbq ice cream with some bacon bits and pecans yeah i mean

527
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:24,560
yeah i'd be pretty good listen if i could order these to america i probably already would be

528
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:31,760
i find that i find the idea like the ketchup and barbecue sauce i can almost i can almost see my

529
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,680
no i'll see you away there we're into like it's mayonnaise like that's hard that gets a little

530
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,520
more challenging if it's like mayo creams and just the number of z's on this page guys it's

531
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,080
quite a it's tough there's a there is a lot of z's in this in this i bet a thousand island ice

532
00:54:50,080 --> 00:55:00,480
cream 45 z's on the page um hey can i do another yahoo yeah yeah of course um geez i got a two

533
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:08,560
here i'm debating which one's the best i mean i don't know that this one is the most sort of gut

534
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,720
bustingly funny but it is a conversation that i'm curious about that i feel like justin's going to

535
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,760
have a lot to say uh sent in by several people again it's by yahoo answers user misty who asks

536
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:26,800
what is the best place to work in at the mall huh well the answer i think is obvious but

537
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:31,120
i just want to fucking talk about this i just kind of want to send jokes out yeah can we just

538
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:36,480
send jokes out of the room for about 75 minutes earlier in the episode so i think there's a

539
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:44,000
precedent established okay you know what let's just say i was in all i a jokes fuck off yeah

540
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,480
fuck off we're gonna settle this i have worked a couple mall jobs do you call your phone jokes

541
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,080
no i don't call my phone jokes that's a very good idea though if i could program it to be like hey

542
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:05,280
stop it i i've worked several mall jobs and i think right now don't need your bonafides

543
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,720
just need an answer if i was going to pick a mall job i think it would be

544
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:18,800
like a cell phone case kiosk whoa what yeah it feels low impact like i don't think you're dealing

545
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,960
with customers left and right it's a very narrow window of information you have to be briefed on

546
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:32,000
you get to sit down for a lot of it very little oversight over what you do most of the time when

547
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,520
i see people working there they're like on their phones or in some cases even like you playing

548
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:42,400
games travis you've just hit the you've just hit the biggest issue with it when i see people working

549
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,240
there if you put yourself into the cell phone kiosk what you've basically done is put yourself

550
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:52,000
into a human zoo yeah you are an exhibit at the mall museum constant constant scrutiny everyone

551
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,240
looking at you what are they looking at the phone what are they up to and it's that thing of like

552
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,160
that judgy thing that people do where it's like i can't believe they're on their phone when they

553
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,080
were just on their phone like 15 seconds ago and they just don't happen to be on their phone right

554
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,400
at that exact second they're it's an incredible level of scrutiny it'd be a terrible job you've

555
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,240
picked arguably one of the one of the most stressful i mean i disagree only because i

556
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:21,280
stand by the low oversight thing like that for me and any job i've ever had is a boss who is looking

557
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,200
to make themselves especially in a retail environment looking to make themselves feel

558
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,160
essential and so they are just looking for things to point out so that they feel like they're doing

559
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:35,600
their job if you're at the cell phone kiosk or the hillshire farms kiosk or any kiosk your boss

560
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,000
is going to be able to fucking clock you from a hundred yards they can monitor your progress

561
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,040
without you even there are no corners there's not the telltale like who's what what kiosk boss is

562
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:49,840
like checking in if you own a kiosk i think you didn't buy it because you were ready to be super

563
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:56,320
hands-on travis they're the face of super sterling silver of course i'm going to check on them they

564
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:01,520
are the front line of customer interaction and i'm i'm in charge of making sure that our customers

565
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:07,360
always walk away with silver and a smile there is a chaos whatever engraved gift as the uh at the

566
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:14,320
uh kinwood town center here in cincinnati where the product that they sell is glass cubes where

567
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,720
the center of them has been laser etched with some kind of photograph of perhaps a beloved pet

568
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:27,520
or a child or a memaw that you want to remember and i see that every time i go to the kinwood

569
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:33,120
mall and i think that's a front for something there's no way that they sell enough engraved

570
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,400
what are you doing today going to the mall cool can i come along sure i guess if you want to watch

571
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:45,760
me stand around and look at cubes for an hour well i'm trying to i'm trying to pick the perfect

572
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:53,280
grandma tesseract uh i'm trying to i'm locking my grandma in this in this holocron she's wronged

573
00:58:53,280 --> 00:59:03,360
krypton and i need to yeah yep haven't seen memaw since i banished her to the phantom zone all that

574
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:10,160
that's my memaw's horcrux 29.99 at the kinwood mall believe it or not uh okay so that's incorrect

575
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:16,320
griffin i mean here's what's here's here's what's making this tough for me uh i feel like uh like

576
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:22,800
an auntie ans is is thrilling you see an auntie ans and then you probably do i assume you get to

577
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:28,240
eat some auntie ans at some point or at least you get like a dope discount but at at what point i

578
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,400
love the smell of an auntie ans down the you know wafting down an airport terminal or something like

579
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:40,480
that sure but that smell i imagine after i'm gonna be really generous and say like three weeks is

580
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,440
going to be like a complete nightmare i'll see any any any restaurant any food service you are

581
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:51,920
going to run into that definitely happen at the og uh love the breadsticks love the chicken scampi

582
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,600
love so many of their offerings could not stand it after you know and not only while you're there

583
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,440
the problem is especially with something like that pretzel smell it permeates eventually gets

584
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,360
in you that's right it's it's gonna get in your clothes which will then get in your car which

585
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:12,240
will then like you take you change you'll have your uniform at home and like your home will

586
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:17,840
smell faintly of pretzels it will haunt you my friend tommy red used to work at fazoles

587
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:24,640
and if he stored his uniform in the cab of his truck when he would give me a ride to school i

588
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:31,680
would insist on riding in the truck bed so so vibrant was the smell of this fazoles uniform

589
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,280
this this bizarro uh anti-air freshener um it's gonna make you hate if you work at a

590
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,840
food you love you're gonna hate it a few weeks in if you work at a place you hate you're gonna

591
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:48,000
hate it more so food service is incorrect i'm gonna give you my hot take and you got you all

592
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,680
can you've had approximately 400 jobs so i'll i will defer to you this is not one i've had

593
01:00:53,680 --> 01:01:00,320
but it is i'm pretty sure of what the the best job would be and that is the vape shop at the mall

594
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,960
so vape shop is fucking cool because you just sit around and vape and if you're and your boss

595
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,600
opens the door and they're like what are you doing just sitting around and vaping you'd be like uh

596
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:16,720
yeah i am i'm both advertising our product and becoming more knowledgeable about it and i'm

597
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,880
sitting here cranking some major fucking cotton yeah and spooking the the the guy over at macy's

598
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:31,760
uh uh uh i think that the vape shop would be a very chill place to work morally i don't know the

599
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,560
science is out yes when you're loved but that's it that's the perfect fix is when your loved ones

600
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,840
are like uh the science is out but what science we have you know it's it's i'm i'm worried about

601
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:52,800
you you can be like hey it's for work they actually made a rule at the vape shop at the

602
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,960
honeyton mall at first they were allowed to crank cotton 24 sev and then they made a rule that you

603
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:06,000
couldn't crank cotton at all and to watch the the discrepancy in employee satisfaction was

604
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:12,560
so palpable it could be felt at the american cookie factory it was so so distinct did this

605
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,800
go from like wow this is a fucking very good job to i've got to get the fuck out of here and indulge

606
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:26,640
my addiction to aerosolized nicotine um boy between the bitcoin and vape chat this episode
