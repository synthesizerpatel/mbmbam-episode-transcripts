1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,880
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:24,160
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,160
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:12,880
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, main advice show for the modern era, I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

6
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:29,040
And I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,640
That was pretty even, thank you.

9
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
Good balance, everyone.

10
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:46,160
I assume when everyone screams as loud as they possibly can, it all works out the same, because there's a cap on pure human joy.

11
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:54,800
Do you want to clarify before we go on, you may be looking at me and think, did Travis change clothes between shanners?

12
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,440
No, this shirt is reversible.

13
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,920
I just want to make that clear.

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,440
He called Levi's and he's like, I'm doing two in a row, is there anything you can do for me?

15
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,440
And those fucking fashion wizards.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
They did it.

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
I feel very good.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah!

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
And you may be asking, why?

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Is it the energy of Nashville?

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Is it to our life?

22
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Is it just that we've gotten good at this?

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Is it the excitement of Nashville crowds, which I tell everyone are the best crowds in the world?

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
It's not.

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
It's not that.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
It's salad, baby.

27
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
You're looking at three genuine salad boys.

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Oh, and I know what you're thinking.

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Certainly someone made them get salad.

30
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Nope.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Or did it on their own?

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Completely voluntary.

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,400
This is not a cookie points transaction or investment situation.

34
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,400
This was three adults who said, do you know what would be good for my human body?

35
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Right.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Salad.

37
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
And everyone in the room went, oh.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
We've been on the road for two days.

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
It's taken a serious toll.

40
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You're joking.

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm not.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
Road Griffin makes choices that home Griffin would not.

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:32,400
This morning I had two big, big muffins, a bag of Skittles, and a whole can of Pringles before 10 a.m.

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,400
If I was sitting in my living room watching Teen Titans go with my child and wife,

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,400
I would not say, you know what would be good breakfast?

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
It would not involve Skittles and a whole can of Pringles.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I can guarantee you that much.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Now, I don't know about you guys.

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
I don't want to speak for you, but the sort of arc that I went on this evening was intellectually saying,

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I should have a salad.

51
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
The poops have been strange today.

52
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
And then intellectually saying that.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
And then when dinner arrived, I went on a spike like this, oh, hell yeah, dinner.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
And then I was like, ah, shit.

55
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
That's right.

56
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
I got a salad.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
But then at my lowest point, which was one of the worst things to ever happen to me,

58
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
because I could have gotten anything and I did get salad.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,400
As I started to eat it, my body was like fucking Wesley and Buttercup emerging from the lightning sands.

60
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Oh, thank God.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Vitamins, nutrients, thank you.

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
The amazing thing about this is I actually.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Wait, hold on.

64
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,400
That was really funny.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Just let him finish laughing.

66
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Now, okay.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I experienced the exact inverse of this this afternoon, Griffin and I.

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Travis made some fucking decisions at Puckett's.

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I went to Puckett's and I ordered for appetizers.

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
No, F-O-R.

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
But I did.

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
And F-O-U-R, actually.

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
F-O-U-R for appetizers.

74
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
I got fried green beans, fried green tomatoes, fried pickles.

75
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,400
And then we also got the sausage and cheese.

76
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
He did that.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
He ordered that trio of literally everything in the appetizers menu that said fried on it.

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
And I instinctively went like, holy fuck.

79
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
And I said this out loud in a restaurant I've never been to.

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
No shit.

81
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
I ordered those three things.

82
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Rapid fire.

83
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
The server went, wow.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
She actually said, awesome.

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
It was probably the first time.

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
And so I was very excited spiritually to order these things.

87
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:48,400
And then I started consuming them in my body like the other father in Coraline just like melted.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,400
My body started to consume this earthly decadence.

89
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
What we are saying is that these were prescription salads.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
These were medicinal salads.

91
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
So this is an advice show.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
And what does that mean?

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Well, we tell you what to do.

94
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Now, if you've never listened to this before and you've just heard this bit, you might be thinking,

95
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
I probably shouldn't do what they tell me to do.

96
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Chase that instinct.

97
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Follow that.

98
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Don't lose sight of that.

99
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Let's hear from someone who supposedly is in the audience tonight.

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Supposedly.

101
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
A lot of liars listen to our show.

102
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
We'll see.

103
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I don't know. Plans change.

104
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Sure.

105
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I don't know what would be more important.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Life finds a way.

107
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Let's read the advice question.

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm trying to.

109
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
You guys are talking.

110
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm a poor college kid working the graveyard shift in a big office building.

111
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
During the night, many of the office floors aren't used.

112
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
I'll hide on money.

113
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I'll grab some of the food from the other floor's fridges.

114
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Most being from corporate lunches, not personal lunch boxes.

115
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Am I good?

116
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
This isn't stealing, technically, right?

117
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
What do I say if someone catches me one night?

118
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
And that's from raccooning in Kentucky.

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
And you said most.

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Yeah, that's a critical most.

121
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm going to rewind that most.

122
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I steal food.

123
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Most being from corporate lunches, not personal lunch boxes.

124
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
So you said most.

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,400
So, like, usually, but sometimes, it's Gerald's lasagna.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,400
And now that we've voided out your evil, are you here?

127
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Yes, yes, yes, you are here.

128
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay.

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
You're just a little sheepish about it, and I get it.

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Is Gerald here?

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Because we got the guy.

132
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
We got him.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
We got him, Gerald.

134
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
We got him.

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
You know the thing I love about Gerald's lasagna?

136
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
What's that, Justin?

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,400
The cheese is so nice and bubbly, and his mom made it for him.

138
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,400
And also, it's Gerald's, and not yours.

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,400
The cheese tastes great, and the fact that you're depriving Gerald of his motherly gift is...

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I've always said lasagna stolen is sweeter than lasagna earned.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Indeed, Travis, indeed.

142
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I've never heard the question phrased, this isn't technically stealing right, where the answer was, yeah, you're fine.

143
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Right.

144
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Because what it should be, it's actually the reverse is true.

145
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
It is technically stealing.

146
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,400
You are taking something that's not yours and making it yours.

147
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
That's stealing.

148
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
But what you're asking is, what isn't stealing?

149
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:40,400
You also used the term raccooning to refer to yourself, and nobody's ever seen a raccoon going through their garbage or picnic basket and thought like, aw, tight.

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Right.

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Aw, thank God, now I don't have to worry about that sandwich I was gonna eat.

152
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Right, no one ever sees a raccoon combing their yard and thinks, man, I hope he found the rotten turkey I saved for him in my trash.

153
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Like, you didn't save it for the raccoon, the raccoon is taking what they want.

154
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,400
But it's not even that, because like, this isn't food someone was discarding.

155
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Indeed, true.

156
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
They were saving it for later, and you said, no you're not.

157
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Well, maybe.

158
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
You were saving it for me.

159
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Maybe the Quiznos party platter was a little bit too much party than this office can handle, and it would end up in the dumpster.

160
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:28,400
That's what I'm saying, I think there's an arc that goes through when you're buying food in bulk, and you bought too much, and there's like, one of the containers of like, soup doesn't get even opened.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
You feel really bad about it, and you're like, I'm gonna save this and figure out something to do with it.

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,400
And then the fridge does its grim work, and a week later, it is trash, like, oh, I gotta throw this away.

163
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:45,400
And you can feel great about it, because the fridge sort of babysat, like, the fridge is sometimes like food hospice.

164
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
It's a trash incubator, is what you're saying.

165
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:57,400
The fridge, carefully, gradually, lovingly, and in an appropriate setting, where family are welcome, shepherds the food to death.

166
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:06,400
And then you can feel great about throwing it away, because, well, it's done its job, and I didn't throw it away when it was good and edible.

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,400
So what was the question?

168
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
I think it's a victimless crime, except Gerald.

169
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Gerald is a victim.

170
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Gerald has been victimized.

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Otherwise, I think you're good.

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
It's just, it's corporate food.

173
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
Steal from, eat the rich's sandwiches.

174
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,400
I guess what I'm saying.

175
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
That is a power move.

176
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
If you're like, hey, CEO, your pastrami was great.

177
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
But you don't say it.

178
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
Oh, don't say it.

179
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
But you know it.

180
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:46,400
How about a Yahoo from the great Yahoo Answers service?

181
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
This one was sent in by Gina Invieri.

182
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Thank you, Gina.

183
00:10:49,400 --> 00:11:13,400
It's by Yahoo Answers user Morgan, who asks, how do I sell a single potato?

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:19,400
I managed to grow only one big potato in my yard.

185
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Just wondering where I could sell it.

186
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
How much can I get for it?

187
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:28,400
The type is a King Edward potato.

188
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:37,400
You know, it's wild to me that you would work all that time and get one potato, and your first thought is, I gotta sell this bad boy.

189
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Like, did you, you really didn't want a potato, huh?

190
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,400
Because you just got one, and you're like, I have to divest myself with this potato.

191
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,400
The skill level of your horticulture game is not apparently awesome, because you only got the one.

192
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,400
I can't imagine it's the most luscious potato ever grown.

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
To be fair, they do say one big potato.

194
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
How big?

195
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I mean, if you let a potato grow, it can get, as far as I understand, infinitely large.

196
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Perhaps they are amazing, they have a really green thumb, but this one big potato consumed all the other smaller potatoes.

197
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Yes, it's an Akira potato!

198
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I feel bad for this cat the first time they saw The Martian, though.

199
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Because, like, that's gotta be demoralizing, huh?

200
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:37,400
He grew that, this guy went to space, grew potatoes in his shit from nothing on space in Mars, and then he got, like, enough to live forever on them.

201
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,400
This guy did one in his yard, with presumably potato food and special seed.

202
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Where potatoes belong.

203
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,400
The Martian benefited, those potatoes benefited from having Matt Damon's dookie all over them.

204
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Which is, as we all know, the most wonderful fertilizer around.

205
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:04,400
He might also have been disheartened just because he's a really big Matt Damon fan, and the idea of Matt Damon being trapped on Mars really fucked him out.

206
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Because he can't make a lot of movies up there.

207
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Just the one.

208
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Yeah, everything you just said made a lot of sense, to me.

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Here's the thing, you can't go to a farmer's market, and somebody walks up to your booth, and you have one potato sitting on some sort of column with a velvet cloth on it, with a spotlight shining down on the potato.

210
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,400
Like you're a fucking, like, vendor in Legend of Zelda, like, 90 rupees for my only potato.

211
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Sold out, bye, we'll never talk again.

212
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
You're wrong, Griffin, and let me tell you why.

213
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Let me tell you why you're incorrect.

214
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,400
What people love these days, farm to table, locally sourced, small batch.

215
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah.

216
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Imagine if you were walking through a farmer's market, and someone caught your attention and said, would you like to be the only human to ever eat one of my potatoes?

217
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Because you could, you could, like, the next day, like, be talking to your friends, like, I mean, I had the most amazing potato last night, and they said, oh, that sounds great, we're gonna get one.

218
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Prove it.

219
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
And you're like, you can't.

220
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
You can't.

221
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
It was mine.

222
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,400
I call them Bo-tatoes, and yes, as you've guessed, my name is Bo.

223
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Ah.

224
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
And it's the one, it's the only one.

225
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'll ever grow in my life.

226
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
This is a bespoke potato.

227
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,400
As you can see, I wrote 2017 on it to help me remember that this is my, this year's potato.

228
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You just take small slices off it every day?

229
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
A potato this good, you don't eat how it was.

230
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Yeah, this is Bo to table, and I made it just for you.

231
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Apparently, if you buy it, it's $35.

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
I know you're asking, is it magical?

233
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Will it make a big potato stalk into the heavens?

234
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I can't legally say yes, but my lawyers have been very clear.

235
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Also, they've made some very competitive bids for the potato.

236
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You should act fast.

237
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
How about another question, Justin?

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Okay, gotcha.

239
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Hello, my, I was locked.

240
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Hello, brothers.

241
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
It wasn't.

242
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I was up there, you saw I was lying, and I just spaced out for a second.

243
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,400
But for you down here, the illusion was perfect.

244
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:18,400
See, you thought you had bad seats, but apparently you had the fucking investigative seats up there.

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Where you can catch me in all my dirty tricks.

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Anyway, and stop reading ahead.

247
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
It's very small down here.

248
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
You can't see, but it's very small.

249
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
The tight, I'm having a hard time actually.

250
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Yeah.

251
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Do you think the salad's turning on you in some way?

252
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Oh, God, you washed the salad before you ate it, right, Justin?

253
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Dun, dun, dun.

254
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Hello, brothers.

255
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,400
With candle lights fast approaching, my mother gave me some diamond earrings to give to my

256
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
fiancé, because she does not wear them anymore.

257
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Somebody in the audience went, mmm.

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
And wanted for me to pass them down through the family.

259
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,400
My question is, should I tell her that they were nice earrings that my mother wanted me

260
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
to give her?

261
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Let me, yes.

262
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Or, can I pretend that I spent money on real diamond earrings?

263
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,400
For one of the best candle lights gifts ever, that's from Candle Lights Confused in Coopersville

264
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
and you're not confused.

265
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
That's not what that word means.

266
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
You know the answer already.

267
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
What is your fucking long game here?

268
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
Are you here?

269
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,400
You can't, yes, good chase, also chase that instinct to not identify yourself.

270
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
You may be here with me.

271
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
This is how this vignette plays out.

272
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Honey, Merry Christmas.

273
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Oh, these are beautiful.

274
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Pop, pop, puts them in.

275
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Thank you, honey.

276
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Mom walks in room.

277
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,400
Oh, I see you got the earrings I gave my son to give you.

278
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Boom, wedding's off.

279
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah.

280
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
There's only one answer and I'm certain you've already guessed it.

281
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,400
If your head's stuck in 2015, you got to bring your mom in on the grift.

282
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Hey, can your mom hang?

283
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Mom, I have a grift?

284
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
No, I told you I was out.

285
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm out.

286
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I ran my last one.

287
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Once you were born, I was out of the game.

288
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
It got too hot.

289
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,400
We lost too much on the Biloxi job.

290
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Hey, Dylan, I love your new girlfriend.

291
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,400
She's really nice and we have similar interests and she seems like a fucking patsy.

292
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm going to take her down.

293
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Seems like an easy mark.

294
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you bringing Susan to Thanksgiving?

295
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
That chump?

296
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
That fucking chump.

297
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Does she own any land we could...

298
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Keep the con going.

299
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
We're just getting started.

300
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
We're in too deep, Dylan.

301
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You can't back out on me now.

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,400
The danger, of course, is that your mom gets deep in the grift and then she can't get out the grift.

303
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,400
And then it's like every two weeks she's texting you, like, found another fucking mark.

304
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
This guy's such an idiot.

305
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,400
He works with me at Amazon.

306
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Zebra and Accounting just got an inheritance.

307
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I've got another pair of diamond earrings.

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,400
Oh, this must have just slipped right off your ears.

309
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
How would that work?

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Yeah.

311
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Mom, is that a gun?

312
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Are you carrying a gun all the time now?

313
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
It's just...

314
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
It's hot out there.

315
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
It's hot out there, you know.

316
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
What?

317
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Get hot out there.

318
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
How...

319
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400
We've got to change the subject.

320
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Also, are you hungry?

321
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Do you want a sandwich?

322
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
First one's free.

323
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Oh, no.

324
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
I lost who sent this.

325
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
Yahoo in.

326
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I'm going to find it by Googling.

327
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,400
It's also by Gina Enviere.

328
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Thank you, Gina.

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,400
It's Yahoo Answers user Paul T. asks,

330
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,400
how does wearing khaki pants make you feel?

331
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Should I have said that like more breathy, like...

332
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,400
How does wearing khaki pants make you feel?

333
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I can tell you...

334
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
How does it feel?

335
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I can tell you how it makes me feel.

336
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Like I'm ready for anything,

337
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
because you can get out into the jungles

338
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
and have khaki pants.

339
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
You can go to a nice dinner and have khaki pants.

340
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Those are the two things.

341
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,400
Not the same...

342
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I have to...

343
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm almost done cutting through these branches,

344
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,400
and then I'm going to go have a nice burger.

345
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,400
At Applebee's.

346
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,400
Yeah.

347
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,400
When you wear...

348
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Say they're flexible garments.

349
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Khaki is the bridge pant, right?

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,400
It takes you from maybe I'm going to mow the lawn

351
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
to maybe I've got to attend

352
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
some kind of fancy religious ceremony.

353
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Khaki pants go from day to evening, exactly, Travis.

354
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Thank you.

355
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah.

356
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
That's why you always see James Bond in them.

357
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I mean...

358
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I like your pleat, Mr. Bond.

359
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
They don't go from day to evening

360
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
as much as they go from your house

361
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:01,400
to your shift at Best Buy.

362
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,400
99% of my khaki wearing took place

363
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,400
at some sort of retail job where it was required.

364
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,400
And by the way, I only had the one pair of khakis, by the way.

365
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,400
So if you saw me, it wasn't for a fancy event,

366
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,400
because those boys were probably not so...

367
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Bad boys.

368
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
Probably a bad stink.

369
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I've always called khaki pants the shrug of pants.

370
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,400
He always says that.

371
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
He says that all the time.

372
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Because when you put on khaki pants,

373
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,400
you're basically going, I don't know, pants?

374
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,400
There are very few situations where khakis would be in a...

375
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,400
Either if you go to something casual,

376
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
it's like, well, look at you.

377
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Dressed up, huh? Khakis.

378
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
And then if you're at a funeral, it's like,

379
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
oh, look at you, thank you for coming.

380
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Because they wouldn't mention it.

381
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Because it's a funeral.

382
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
What are you thinking?

383
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
We're all going to miss Greg so much.

384
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
But also...

385
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
But also, sweet pants.

386
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Nice khakis.

387
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Thank you.

388
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
He would have loved those.

389
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
How I feel when I wear khakis

390
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,400
is constantly worried I'm about to drop chocolate on them.

391
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Yeah.

392
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
You don't get that with a G.

393
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I don't.

394
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I've never...

395
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
If I'm wearing jeans and I drop something on them,

396
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
it's like, I'll wash these.

397
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Drink it, soak it in.

398
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Yeah, that's what jeans are for.

399
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Jeans catch that stuff, lick it up and love it,

400
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
and they just look better.

401
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
You get one drop of khaki...

402
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Maybe that's why Best Buy and Associated Retailers,

403
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
by which I mean all of them,

404
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
want you to wear khakis,

405
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
because they can tell if you're a sloppy boy.

406
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Yeah.

407
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
If you're getting into some nasty stuff,

408
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
they can keep tabs on you.

409
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I will say the other side of that is true, though.

410
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
Because if I worked with someone at Best Buy

411
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
and their pants stayed perfectly crisp and clean

412
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
at the end of the day, I'm like, you're not living.

413
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,400
You're not doing anything.

414
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
You're not doing it.

415
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Get out there.

416
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Make some mistakes.

417
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
At Best Buy?

418
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Well...

419
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Like what?

420
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I mean, you're basically talking about steely DVDs.

421
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
It's all you mean.

422
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Yeah.

423
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Yeah.

424
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Okay.

425
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
That's fine.

426
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I got another question.

427
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Here, let me get it open.

428
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Now it is really locked.

429
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
This time...

430
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Thank you, Griffin.

431
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Thank you for having my back

432
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
for fucking once in our miserable lives.

433
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I really appreciate you.

434
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Not combative.

435
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay, here it comes.

436
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
He closed it.

437
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I didn't close it.

438
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
It's the new iOS.

439
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Did it.

440
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
We still live at home,

441
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
as does our 87-year-old grandmother.

442
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
We live in harmony.

443
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
That's nice.

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
For the most part.

445
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Don't most people live at home?

446
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Fair.

447
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
My gran...

448
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
But, uh...

449
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
But, uh...

450
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Uh...

451
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Uh...

452
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Uh...

453
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Uh...

454
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
Uh...

455
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
Uh...

456
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Uh...

457
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Uh...

458
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Uh...

459
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Uh...

460
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Uh...

461
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,400
Uh...

462
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Uh...

463
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,400
Uh...

464
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Uh...

465
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,400
Uh...

466
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,400
Uh...

467
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Uh...

468
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
Uh...

469
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
Uh...

470
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Uh...

471
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Uh...

472
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Uh...

473
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Uh...

474
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Uh...

475
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Uh...

476
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Uh...

477
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
Uh...

478
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Uh...

479
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Uh...

480
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Uh...

481
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Uh...

482
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Uh...

483
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Uh...

484
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Uh...

485
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Uh...

486
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Uh...

487
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Uh...

488
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Uh...

489
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,760
She also chooses to have every conversation in a whisper from about two inches from your face.

490
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,360
She'll sneak up behind us and whisper things like,

491
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:20,240
there's ham in the bottom drawer or do we need some more toothpaste?

492
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:27,360
Our home is turning into a jump scare factory and it's only a matter of time before she scares one

493
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,360
of us so bad we come out swinging.

494
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,120
Fucking hair trigger, man, it's your grandma, all right?

495
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,000
Pump the brakes.

496
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,320
There is no court of law that will let you go for that, you realize, right?

497
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, she scared me so bad.

498
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it scared them.

499
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,280
That's from should we put a bell on our grandma?

500
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,800
All so bad.

501
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,960
Neither of these things are acceptable.

502
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,920
And that's from should we put a bell on our grandma and please say no

503
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,560
from Beckley West, by God, Virginia.

504
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
What's up?

505
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,880
Are you here?

506
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,320
Currently chilling in Nashville.

507
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,520
Yeah, what's up?

508
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,160
What's up?

509
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,400
Oh, yeah, glad the home state is represented here.

510
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,480
Don't hit your grandma.

511
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,680
Hey, your grandma can be as scary as she wants.

512
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,960
That's not a fucking invitation.

513
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,240
It's your grandma.

514
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:30,440
You can't you can't make her stop sneaking up on you because you can't make anybody older than 70 do anything.

515
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,560
I do. I like that in your mind.

516
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,920
This is just a random happenstance of a conflagration of things that she does.

517
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
She's doing it on purpose.

518
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fucking funny.

519
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah. Your grandma's hunting you.

520
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
That's obvious. Yeah.

521
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,400
You're not accidentally silent like she's sneaking up on you to scare you.

522
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,320
This is a hot. This is a past time.

523
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,160
She was she was born before the Xbox.

524
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,760
She can't just go play Halo and hang out with Master Chief and all of her friends.

525
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,840
Right. This is the game that she played.

526
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,320
She was born in the dark.

527
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:14,720
Right. And you want her you want her to go from sneaking behind the Huns enemy lines to collect intel to just like watching Mori Povich.

528
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,240
She was a spy. Your grandma was a super sneaky spy.

529
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,320
Duh. That seemed obvious to me reading the question.

530
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,680
So she was a super sneaky spy.

531
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,360
And how are you guys caught up on the Americans or I don't want to spoil anything.

532
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:38,080
I haven't watched it. So if you were expecting some sort of joke relevant.

533
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,440
Thank you, Travis. That's the word.

534
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,160
I have a thing I want to suggest, but I also don't want to suggest.

535
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,760
Well, let's take a poll.

536
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:54,520
If you if you if you spook your grandma just once in a similar fashion.

537
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,480
Fine line.

538
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,360
Immediately retracted, immediately struck from the record, immediately edited.

539
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,840
Also, your grandma will hit you.

540
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,320
You could do that. She will give you one chance at that.

541
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,200
She might be training. Like, why is it?

542
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,320
OK, I don't want to get combative.

543
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,800
But you know, your grandmother lives in the house and she does this.

544
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,520
How is your head not on a swivel at this point?

545
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,640
24-7, 24-7.

546
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,560
How are you not just like, ah, your grandma's like sneaking up behind you.

547
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,240
Ah, she's like, that's what the world is like.

548
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,320
Oh, she's trying to make you hard, strong and hard.

549
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,200
Yeah, you got to be tough because one day it won't be me sneaking up on you.

550
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,680
It'll be the Batman.

551
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,400
One day it'll be Zorro.

552
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,760
What? What are you talking about?

553
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,920
It'll be the Shadow.

554
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,000
Stop it. It's really old stuff.

555
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
It'll be Fibber McGee and Molly.

556
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,120
Come on, Grandma.

557
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,960
You're just making stuff.

558
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,360
It was the I had a bug on my iPad.

559
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,520
Let me see.

560
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,440
You're going to. It's that new iOS, man.

561
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,160
Oh, shit. We have a haunted doll wash coming in hot.

562
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,680
This is rough. This is rough.

563
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
This is Rose.

564
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,680
Sorry, Mr. Reddit.

565
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,840
It would be weird if their posting started with, this is rough.

566
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,680
This is rough.

567
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,320
It would be weird pretty much anyway it started because

568
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,960
it's eBay listing for a doll that is haunted.

569
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,600
But let's just see what this one says.

570
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,880
Haunted dolls found in the storage after Grandma passed away.

571
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
What just happened?

572
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,560
Oh, shit. Are you with us right now?

573
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,040
I am having paranormal activity after bringing these dolls home.

574
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,360
At first, I was very scared,

575
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,240
but now I'm spending more time with each doll in order to get

576
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,160
a sense of their energy and give the buyer as much information as possible.

577
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,240
I love this phrase. I am what they call a sensitive.

578
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,400
Therefore, I'm able to use all my senses and feel spirits.

579
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,240
My grandma was a kind loving spirit and my Aunt Angelica was

580
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,680
a healer and a psychic in her country.

581
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,000
Family business. Love that.

582
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,040
Just like this podcast.

583
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,760
She was fake and not real.

584
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,640
She was a psychic. She was a psychic in her country.

585
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,640
She got over here and was like, I can't see shit.

586
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,000
I don't know. I don't know, man.

587
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,040
I'm not getting the signal. I got direct TV now.

588
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't know.

589
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,320
I only do metric.

590
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I was taken care of by my aunt,

591
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,400
so I learned how to perceive and work with energy from an early age.

592
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,080
I'm using different forms of communication as a pendulum and automatic writing

593
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,840
in order to give my buyers as much information as I can about my spirit dolls.

594
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,000
If you decided to buy any of my dolls,

595
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,080
you need to establish your own way of communicating with your spirit.

596
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,560
It's like, listen, it's not that it doesn't work.

597
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,960
You just need to find, like, your thing.

598
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,680
Yeah, go your own way.

599
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,800
My Aunt Angelica, a renowned psychic and healer in Costa Rica.

600
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,920
By the way, in case you're keeping track,

601
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,640
we are not yet to the item description.

602
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,800
These have just been bona fides at this point.

603
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,320
So here's the doll vessel.

604
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,880
It's five inches tall, porcelain brown eyes.

605
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,760
That is quite little. That is quite a tiny doll, actually.

606
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,840
Not so scary.

607
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,320
It's a McDonald's Beanie Baby.

608
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,680
This, this person got pretty buck wild with capital letters.

609
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
So I'm going to try to emulate it as best I can.

610
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,280
Rose is the embodiment of pure love.

611
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,360
Her aura is pink and she is able to transmit her loving energy

612
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,560
with beams of light. Sure.

613
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,720
She has come through to help someone find their soulmate

614
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,720
and bring loving people into recipient's life.

615
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,920
She is an angelic spirit that should be given respect

616
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,200
and care. Recipient should place her on a nightstand

617
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,640
with a pink candle where prayers should be made.

618
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,920
A good, good night. Have a good night.

619
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,800
My personal experience with Rose.

620
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,960
She emits a pink warm glow and warm sensations on your body.

621
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,800
When you hold her, you're filled with love.

622
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,400
Angels are the intermediates between God and humans.

623
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,560
They are able to help us send and receive messages from God.

624
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,480
They are pure love and light and always by our side to help us.

625
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,000
Disclaimer.

626
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
No returns is the disclaimer on that.

627
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,040
So that's Rose. You can just catch Rose on eBay right now.

628
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,320
You can go get Rose. Why? Why? Why would you need that disclaimer?

629
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,680
You just spent like four paragraphs saying

630
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,440
if you pray to this doll, God will put cool people in your life.

631
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,480
But no returns. If you touch this doll,

632
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,800
you'll feel love for the first time and warm sensations over your body.

633
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,200
And God will talk to you through the doll.

634
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
All transactions are final.

635
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,520
Holy shit. Yeah.

636
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I, I will say I like a haunted doll that is actually an angel doll.

637
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,560
Right. I like that. That's nice.

638
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,880
It's not spooky. It's not spooky. It's nice.

639
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
Yeah. We like to ignore the fact that angels are just ghosts

640
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,440
that you do want around.

641
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,240
But I'm glad. To help you cheat at baseball.

642
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,680
To help you cheat at baseball. Exactly.

643
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,720
You want to know, I have a regular question.

644
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,920
How about a regular question?

645
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,440
And then maybe depending on how long the regular question goes,

646
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,080
maybe we can kick it to audience questions after that.

647
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,920
Okay. Got it. Perfect.

648
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,960
Here we go. Here it comes.

649
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,000
I need your help. I love my job.

650
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,360
Unlock the iPad and then you want to go to the Google drives.

651
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,840
I love my job, but there's one problem.

652
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,920
My boss is obsessed with Taco Bell.

653
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:18,120
He forces everyone on my team to eat there every week.

654
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,600
Forces? Forces.

655
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,640
Open your fucking mouth.

656
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,360
It's a kiss. Don't get down.

657
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,480
Any time one of us even suggests the different restaurant,

658
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,720
he threatens to fire us.

659
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,280
I used to actually enjoy the bell,

660
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,560
but after three years of eating under duress,

661
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,920
it's lost its flavor. I have died.

662
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm dead. And I'm in a doll.

663
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,160
I'm writing to you from hell.

664
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,440
How do I escape this Taco Friday trap,

665
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:54,080
but also keep my job that's from Southern Bell and Taco Hell?

666
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,520
Are you present? Are you with us?

667
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,400
Benevolent spirit. Are you with us, spirit?

668
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,640
No. Dead person.

669
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,200
Okay. Now, there are many things that I am not.

670
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,720
And one of them is like a legal expert.

671
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,320
Sure. But I'm pretty sure he can't fire you for that.

672
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,440
Yeah. Do you have an HR- Is the HR person just a mop

673
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,440
with glasses on it that this boss created?

674
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Just wearing a sign that says Taco Bell Yum Yum?

675
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,920
Let me get a number nine with three softies.

676
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,760
That's what we call soft tacos in Austin, Texas.

677
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,320
It's not catching on.

678
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,560
I would love this.

679
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,760
No. Because basically,

680
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,040
whenever somebody asks me, I want to eat,

681
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,480
the answer in my heart is Taco Bell.

682
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,920
And then there are other things in my body,

683
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,960
social, mental, economic, physical, sort of existential,

684
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,640
things like that, snares that I put in place

685
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,400
to keep myself from eating Taco Bell at every meal.

686
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,880
Is it beans is the first step in the flow chart?

687
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,120
Beans are a good stopgap

688
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,880
because there's no room in the tummy for nothing else.

689
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,840
But if I had a boss that forced me to eat Taco Bell,

690
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,440
I think that would give me permission to sort of be like,

691
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,720
well, I need this job.

692
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,600
Wait, question asked was looking at this, all wrong.

693
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,880
What you have is the shortest path to promotion ever.

694
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,720
Why?

695
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,360
Because like on Thursday, you look at the boss like,

696
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,840
you know what I'm craving?

697
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,080
Hey.

698
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,600
Little Taco Bell.

699
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,440
Little T-Bell.

700
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,720
Hey man, brought in, I went to Taco Bell.

701
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,960
I know, again, love it.

702
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,800
Had some extra, do you want some?

703
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,160
I know you were considering Marsha for the big promotion,

704
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,280
but you know what I heard?

705
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,400
She is thinking inside the bun.

706
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,780
So one thing about her is that,

707
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,300
could you start taking your boss out to lunch more?

708
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,120
And it's always Taco Bell.

709
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,800
See if you could burn him out.

710
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,360
Oh, what are you in the mood for?

711
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,880
Just kidding, I know what you want, Taco Bell.

712
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,040
We just left the Taco Bell.

713
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,160
I know.

714
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,000
I know.

715
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
Oh my, I thought you liked Taco Bell.

716
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,960
Weird, I guess I like it way more than you, huh?

717
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,080
Weird.

718
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,920
I thought you were the number one T-Bell fan.

719
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,600
How is the, by the way, smoking crater of a bathroom

720
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,840
at this fucking office building?

721
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,440
Hey.

722
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,000
Not to get blue, but you are in a science experiment

723
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and you don't know it.

724
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm gonna be working from home every Friday afternoon

725
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
for the rest of my life.

726
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,000
So I'm never coming to this building on Friday afternoons.

727
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,160
I wonder if it's reached the point

728
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,040
where the boss walks into Taco Bell

729
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,440
and the employees are like, no.

730
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
No, dog.

731
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,760
Please, we care about you.

732
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,880
Taco Bell doesn't make its employees eat Taco Bell

733
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,840
once a week.

734
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
Like, seriously.

735
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,480
Yeah, we've had a lot of turnover.

736
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,360
We've had to outlaw the eating of the food.

737
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
How about one more Yahoo?

738
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,920
This one was sent in by Level 9000.

739
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,680
Yahdrew, Druid, Drew Davenport, thank you, Drew.

740
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,360
It's from Yahdrew Answers user, Alex, who asks,

741
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:15,320
what would happen if you put pets in virtual reality?

742
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,440
Like a cat or a dog?

743
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,200
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

744
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,000
Those are common pets.

745
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,520
If they somehow figured out a way

746
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,120
to transfer your nervous system and apply animals translate,

747
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,360
would that mean people could talk to their pets

748
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
and would they be able to act like humans?

749
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,760
Okay, like, stop.

750
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,800
Did you see the new season of Catfish?

751
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,000
It was wild.

752
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,040
A catfish got in the virtual world

753
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,280
and pretended to be a human using the mind link.

754
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,200
We are talking, these are two wildly different questions.

755
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,440
Could my dog play super hot?

756
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,560
And also, can I talk to my dog with my mind?

757
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,040
Are you fucking with me?

758
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,960
One question is about putting a helmet on a dog

759
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,840
and the other one's about fucking creating dog language

760
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,800
and community, like, we are probably gonna need

761
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,840
to pioneer that before we get into VR

762
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,840
rather than trying to back into dog communication.

763
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,040
Yeah, that would be a weird, like, thing to fall into.

764
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,800
Like, yeah, we were all thinking,

765
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,000
what the fuck, you want what?

766
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,920
He just said he wanted a bone, this is great.

767
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,000
I think this is a dog.

768
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,800
He looks like a virtual dude, but I have my suspicions.

769
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,160
Could I put my pet in VR?

770
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,960
And also, could I talk to my pet?

771
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,560
And also, if I ate Fritos, would it make me fly?

772
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,080
And this is in a world where Fritos make you fly.

773
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,560
So those are the other questions that are corollary on it.

774
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,280
Though we do need to work that technology out first.

775
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,560
Dog would bite it.

776
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Not enjoy the helmet experience for a bit.

777
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,040
You would need to do the helmet and the cone.

778
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,160
I have actually found that if I do FaceTime with my wife

779
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,000
and the dog is around,

780
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,440
the dog does not respond to me whatsoever.

781
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,240
So my thought process is,

782
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,960
if you put the helmet on the dog,

783
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,160
the dog would just sit there like,

784
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,000
I don't know what to do with this.

785
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,920
This smells like nothing to me.

786
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,200
Until a million balls come flying at them,

787
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,640
holy shit, I just turned the corner

788
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,880
and I'm very into dog VR.

789
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,200
I think dogs should be able to use virtual reality.

790
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
There, I think we should set it.

791
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,640
Because imagine you're a sweet pup

792
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,640
and just a billion bones fall down from the sky.

793
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,520
I can't make that happen for a dog,

794
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,000
but like dog's second life could ostensibly make that happen.

795
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,440
Dogs, you've been keeping your dog prisoner for years.

796
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,160
This is the least you could do,

797
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,200
is to let them have a peek at the outside world.

798
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,680
My dog would not do well in the outside world.

799
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,320
She is institutionalized, she is happy where she is.

800
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:57,000
Your dog would look at you with some amount of betrayal,

801
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,320
like, this is what you've been doing the whole time?

802
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,920
And you kept this from me?

803
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,240
Like, of course, why wouldn't you share this with me?

804
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,080
This is fantastic.

805
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,560
This is incredible, there's a water slide, this is great.

806
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
This is fantastic.

807
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,560
And I can't die here?

808
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,720
Whoa, hold on.

809
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,520
Okay, wait, stop, no, stop.

810
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,840
Your dog does not know they're going to die.

811
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,360
That's why they're so jized all the time.

812
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,840
Jized.

813
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,680
Don't, okay, you get VR.

814
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,920
The first thing you do in VR is just you learn dog language

815
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,720
and then you use that to communicate

816
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,960
the idea of mortality.

817
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,680
And then your dog's gonna be like,

818
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,840
and I can shoot a bow and arrow in here too?

819
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,480
Amazing, thank you for the goggles, I love it.

820
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,400
And again, what about seven, one seventh as long as,

821
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,000
okay, dog ears, I finally understand.

822
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,640
I've been wondering what you guys meant by that,

823
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,720
but thank you so much for clarifying.

824
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,280
This is fantastic.

825
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Hey everybody, this is Griffin McElroy.

826
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,680
Thank you so much for listening to our live show

827
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,040
from Nashville, from our tour that we did this past weekend.

828
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,720
We had a lot of fun down in the southeast

829
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,680
in Nashville and Atlanta.

830
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,280
Thank you to everybody who came out to those live shows.

831
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,800
We were hoping to be able to record another episode

832
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,640
while we were there so we wouldn't have two live shows

833
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,720
go up back to back again,

834
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,920
but unfortunately we did not have time.

835
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,360
The next episode that goes up will be a regular episode.

836
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,320
We'll probably sit on the Atlanta live show

837
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,600
for a little while, but yeah,

838
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,680
that's just kind of the way that it shook out.

839
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,320
But thank you all so much for listening.

840
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,200
Real quick, if you live in Chicago or around Chicago

841
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,400
and you wanna come see us,

842
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,000
we added another date in Chicago.

843
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,960
That is Thursday, November the 16th,

844
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,200
and we still have a bunch of tickets available for that.

845
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,120
If you wanna come see us, please do.

846
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
Just go to mcroyshows.com slash tours

847
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,840
and you can find links to all the info there.

848
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,560
I think we still have some tickets available

849
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,200
for the Milwaukee show on that tour as well.

850
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,940
All those are at mcroyshows.com slash tours.

851
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,360
I wanna tell you about our sponsors this week.

852
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,920
Our first sponsor is stamps.com.

853
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,440
You know stamps.com from podcasts.

854
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,240
Stamps.com allows you to easily buy and print

855
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,520
official US postage for any letter, any package,

856
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,720
and any class of mail using your own computer and printer.

857
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,840
They'll send you a digital scale

858
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,620
which automatically calculates exact postage,

859
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,480
so there's no need to lease an expensive postage meter.

860
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,560
Right now you can enjoy the stamps.com service

861
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,320

862
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,440
plus postage and a digital scale

863
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,480
without any long-term commitments.

864
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,600
Just go to stamps.com, click on the microphone

865
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,960
at the top of the homepage and enter my brother,

866
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,120
all one word.

867
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,120
That's stamps.com, click the mic and enter my brother.

868
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,080
Stamps.com, never go to the post office again.

869
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,640
Also wanna tell you about Squarespace.

870
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,520
Squarespace allows you to create a beautiful website

871
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,960
that you can use to turn your cool idea into a website

872
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,460

First message is for Ray and Kristen,

900
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,720
and it's from Rob, who says,

901
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,940
"'Happy first anniversary, Bear and Mrs. Bear.

902
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,520
"'May you have many happy hibernations to come.'"

903
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,960
And that's from Brother Bear.

904
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,600
I don't know how these bears got a laptop in the forest,

905
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,680
unless, of course, it is those wonderful bears

906
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,600
from Wee Bear Bears who do have a laptop in the forest

907
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,060
and, oh my god, cartoons are real.

908
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,460
All cartoons are real.

909
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,600
Congratulations on your anniversary, Bear and Mrs. Bear.

910
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,180
Or Ray and Kristen.

911
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,820
I don't know if this is for humans or bears,

912
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,860
but it warms my heart either way.

913
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,800
This next message is for Scott,

914
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,320
and that's Scott with one t,

915
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,180
and it's from Ty, who says,

916
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:31,020
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,

917
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,160
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,

918
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,120
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott,"

919
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:36,960
like 40 times.

920
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,800
"'Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott, Scott."

921
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,940
And that's the end of the message.

922
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,640
I don't know if I said enough Scots.

923
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,520
I hope I did,

924
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,320
because I don't wanna get in illegal hot water.

925
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,800
Scott, Ty is just really enthusiastic about your name, and we're really enthusiastic about

926
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,120
just sort of your whole life.

927
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:57,000
Thank you again to the Tennessee Performing Arts Center for having us.

928
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,400
Here in the next chunk of the show is the audience questions, and I wanted to preface

929
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,280
that by saying we tried something new.

930
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,520
We are sort of looking for a way to make the audience questions segment be a little bit

931
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,400
more based around the audience actually asking questions instead of sort of saying like a

932
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:19,600
funny thing or anecdote, which is very enjoyable, but it's not maybe the best launchpad for

933
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,280
what we do in a live environment.

934
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,960
So we try something new in this next segment where we have two people ask questions and

935
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,840
then we pick the one that we think we can help the most while still trying to help out

936
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,080
the other person just in a much more brisk manner.

937
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:39,200
I think that it might come off as like mean or overly competitive at first, but I promise

938
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,240
you that is never going to be the intention of it.

939
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,640
It's just like a way for us to really hone in on the questions that are sort of best

940
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,160
suited for this to make sure that we can answer the stuff that I think we can do the most

941
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,000
good for or have the most fun with.

942
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,400
I think it went really, really well, and I think we're probably going to do this moving

943
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,640
forward because I think the audience had a lot of fun with it too.

944
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,940
So I just wanted to preface that because I didn't want you to hear what we were doing

945
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,080
and think like we had turned super shitty and wanted our live shows to turn into some

946
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,900
sort of blood sport or anything.

947
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,200
So yeah, I think that's probably it.

948
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,480
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for theme songs that depart you off the album

949
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,520
Putting the Days to Bed.

950
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,720
Thank you to Max Fun for having us.

951
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,600
Go to maximumfun.org, check out all the great podcasts there, and yeah, I'm going to let

952
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,680
you get back to the rest of the episode, and the next one will be just a regular episode

953
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,360
that is going to go up October 30th.

954
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,240
All Hallows Eve Eve!

955
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I'm a ghoul.

956
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Bye.

957
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,040
Hello, I'm Kerry Poppy.

958
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,240
And I'm Ross Blatcher, host of maximumfun.org's Ono, Ross, and Kerry.

959
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,600
We wanted to tell you the good news that our podcast is now weekly.

960
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,600
Yeah, weekly!

961
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:51,400
On Ono, Ross, and Kerry, we don't make extraordinary claims.

962
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
We investigate them.

963
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,600
We go undercover with fringe religious groups, investigate paranormal claims, and participate

964
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,240
in pseudoscientific medical treatments and report our findings to you.

965
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,560
In a time where alternative facts reign supreme, we cut through the murky spin to give you

966
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,240
the real deal on topics like UFOs, the anti-vaccination movement, Scientology, and even apocalyptic

967
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,240
churches.

968
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,080
We're even undercover for some very exciting investigations right now.

969
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,400
Well, not right now, right now.

970
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Yeah, that would be unwise.

971
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,320
That's Ono, Ross, and Kerry at maximumfun.org.

972
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,280
We show up so you don't have to.

973
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
Fantastic.

974
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,240
On that uplifting note, should we turn it over to the audience?

975
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
We should.

976
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,400
All right, some ground rules.

977
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,360
Please don't get up and line up in front of the mics.

978
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,280
We're going to try some different stuff out.

979
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,320
Who was at our Atlanta show last night?

980
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,680
It was a lot of fun.

981
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,720
Got a little out of hand on the audience questions part.

982
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,440
We have some new stuff we want to try out.

983
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,980
Justin came up with the idea.

984
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,080
It might be a little mean, so I want to let Justin explain what the rules of it are.

985
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
It's not mean.

986
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
It's not mean.

987
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,080
It's fun.

988
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
First, let me check on something.

989
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,080
Do we have two microphones for audience usage?

990
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,080
Yes, we do.

991
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Stage left, stage right.

992
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,080
Stage left, stage right.

993
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,080
Fantastic.

994
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,080
Here's what we're going to do.

995
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,080
We're going to have two people come simultaneously.

996
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,560
Amp versus amp.

997
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,560
No.

998
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,960
In the program I've devised, they'll both tell us-

999
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,280
Do you want to play a game?

1000
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,480
They'll both tell us their questions.

1001
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,200
Then I will choose- No.

1002
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,720
We will hear your questions, and again, questions, not anecdotes, if you don't mind.

1003
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,680
I saw a cool kite at the park yesterday.

1004
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,680
Am I good?

1005
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,800
No, you're not actually, because I asked for a question.

1006
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,000
So questions, and then we will choose who we can help the most.

1007
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
The other person we will appreciate, but their life is-

1008
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,480
A trap door will open immediately below you.

1009
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
They will be killed.

1010
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,400
They will be prestiged.

1011
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,600
We're going to choose the person we can help most, and the other person will kindly take

1012
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,480
a seat, but we will very much appreciate them sharing their life with us for that brief

1013
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
moment.

1014
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,120
But that is how we are going to try to- We only have a limited amount of time to do audience

1015
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:03,440
questions, so we want to make sure we help people who need it the most, or we can do

1016
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
the most good.

1017
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,440
And you know the other main role?

1018
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,440
No bummer.

1019
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,440
Cool.

1020
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,240
Can we get even more house lights?

1021
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,240
It's kind of scary.

1022
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,240
Yeah, it's a little hard to say.

1023
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,240
Maybe a little less us-like.

1024
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
It kind of looks like a million ghosts.

1025
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:18,540
And I'll let them pick while I go pick- Oh my God.

1026
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,540
That is fantastic.

1027
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,540
Thank you.

1028
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:21,540
All right.

1029
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,080
I see a guy in a hat, and somebody else is pointing to somebody.

1030
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,680
I see a shadow with a hat on, and somebody's pointing.

1031
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1032
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,680
You're waving your hat in the air.

1033
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,680
You're good.

1034
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,680
Travis, somebody on the left.

1035
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,680
I'm looking.

1036
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,680
Hmm.

1037
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Okay.

1038
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,680
I see a guy in a long sleeve shirt.

1039
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,680
Yep.

1040
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,680
Yep.

1041
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,680
That person.

1042
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,680
We're good.

1043
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
All right.

1044
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
Way to go.

1045
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,680
Here we go.

1046
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
Left and right.

1047
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,680
Let's start with you.

1048
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,680
What's your name?

1049
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,680
Zach.

1050
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:45,680
What's up, Zach?

1051
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
What's up?

1052
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,400
And what's your name?

1053
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
My name is Allen.

1054
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Sorry?

1055
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Allen.

1056
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Allen.

1057
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,400
Allen.

1058
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,400
Allen with an E.

1059
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Allen.

1060
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,400
Thank you.

1061
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Degenerate.

1062
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
All right.

1063
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
Zach, here's Justin.

1064
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,400
All right.

1065
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,400
So we had wireless mics.

1066
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,520
We could do the whole show from the can.

1067
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,600
And that is the ideal.

1068
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,840
Zach, what is your question?

1069
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,160
We'll start with you, because you were at the mic first.

1070
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,160
Okay.

1071
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,160
First thing, Justin, thanks for coming back.

1072
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,160
Appreciate it.

1073
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,160
No problem.

1074
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,000
So pretty soon going to become an uncle.

1075
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Nice.

1076
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,960
My brother and his wife are going to have a baby.

1077
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,960
That's typically how it works.

1078
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,960
Yes, yes.

1079
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Yeah.

1080
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Ran the numbers.

1081
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:28,960
That's how it works.

1082
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:34,280
My parents have started to do the whole, like, we're coming up with, like, what our grandparent

1083
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
names are going to be.

1084
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,280
Sure.

1085
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:48,680
And so for whatever reason, my dad thinks it's a good idea for his name to be Tarzan.

1086
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:49,680
Extremely good.

1087
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,760
So please, for the love of God, how do I tell my dad that that's an awful idea, and I do

1088
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
not want that.

1089
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
That's a pretty good one.

1090
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,760
Okay.

1091
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Exactly.

1092
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,760
Ellen.

1093
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:02,760
Bring the heat.

1094
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,760
Okay.

1095
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,880
So I literally work at my dream job, and it's wonderful, except I have a co-worker who

1096
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:15,880
has worked with this company for 17 years, I believe, and he doesn't understand things

1097
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,800
like how to load the printer.

1098
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,840
How do I deal with that?

1099
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,000
I'm tempted to go with Tarzan on this one.

1100
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
All right.

1101
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,720
Because the answer to that one is just to talk to HR.

1102
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,680
I feel like I've run out of good office etiquette once, because there's, like, a person who's

1103
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:42,160
like a my brother, my brother and me person personified, except they can actually do shit

1104
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,360
who works at the company.

1105
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
So we can help you both.

1106
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,800
Ellen, just talk to that person and try to get them either fired or helped.

1107
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Either one is fine.

1108
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:50,800
It's fine.

1109
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
It solves your problem.

1110
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
So thank you, Ellen.

1111
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,800
Thank you, Ellen.

1112
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,800
And we're going to kick it over to you, Zach.

1113
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:57,800
Tarzan.

1114
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,960
Tarzan's very good is the only thing.

1115
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,400
The thing is, you need to get really comfortable with Tarzan very quickly.

1116
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,680
How about instead, how about instead you convince your dad to just go with Lord Greystoke?

1117
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,000
Because that is Tarzan's actual name and title.

1118
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,600
Convince your dad to go with Christopher Plummer, who, of course, played Tarzan.

1119
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:25,000
It's just buck wild what your dad has done in that you can't, a good grandpa or grandma

1120
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,800
name is GG, or PP, or poop, poop, booboo, booboo, if only we had made this joke before

1121
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,800
at some point.

1122
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,800
No, no.

1123
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
But it can't.

1124
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,800
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1125
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:37,800
We'd fuck.

1126
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:38,800
But it wouldn't.

1127
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,320
What it can't be is like Darth Vader.

1128
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,200
Okay, so I'm Pac Man.

1129
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,600
So even worse is my mom wants to be Lulu.

1130
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,600
That's good.

1131
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,600
That's good.

1132
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,600
Yes, that's cool.

1133
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,600
But like, what the fuck is Tarzan?

1134
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,920
Yeah, it is.

1135
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,240
That is an excellent point.

1136
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
Yeah.

1137
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,680
Because if this kid, okay, here's what you do.

1138
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,840
In public, start loudly calling your dad Tarzan.

1139
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,100
Yeah.

1140
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,120
Make him introduce himself to people.

1141
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,120
Oh, me?

1142
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
I'm Tarzan.

1143
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,120
Rub his nose in it.

1144
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:14,120
You know what I mean?

1145
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,440
Yeah, shake the old no-no can of life at him.

1146
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,320
Just make him introduce himself as Tarzan.

1147
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,560
Because that's the thing.

1148
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,320
What he's not picturing is a four-year-old in Walmart like yelling two aisles over, Tarzan!

1149
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,320
Tarzan!

1150
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:31,840
And him having to look at someone and go, that's me.

1151
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
That's me.

1152
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,200
That's mine.

1153
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,240
I came up with that one.

1154
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,040
So does that help?

1155
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,040
It doesn't help you.

1156
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,040
No.

1157
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
It doesn't help you.

1158
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
No.

1159
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,480
It helps me knowing that this situation is going to be out in the world somewhere.

1160
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Yeah.

1161
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,880
Makes you feel a little bit better about the state of things.

1162
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,880
Thank you, Zach.

1163
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,880
Thank you, Zach.

1164
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,880
Thank you, Zach.

1165
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:54,880
You've helped, Zach.

1166
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,880
All right, Justin, you get to pick this time.

1167
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Okay.

1168
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,480
I'm going to say this person who's being pointed at would be excellent.

1169
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,480
Yes, it's you.

1170
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
In second row?

1171
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,480
Both of you.

1172
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:09,480
Yeah.

1173
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
Both of you.

1174
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,480
You go right.

1175
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,480
You go left.

1176
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
That's it.

1177
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Yes.

1178
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,480
Oh, this is great.

1179
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,480
Yes.

1180
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,480
No longer do we have to make the choice.

1181
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,480
Frank will choose.

1182
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Oh, my God.

1183
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,480
Your shirts say...

1184
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,560
Okay, real quick, stand up, reverse.

1185
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,560
You got to reverse so they won't get it.

1186
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,680
Fucking throw five stooges, so you can figure it out.

1187
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,680
Come on.

1188
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,680
We, we, move to the other side.

1189
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:33,680
We, we, you're on the other side.

1190
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,680
Are you kidding me with this?

1191
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,680
This is so good.

1192
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Yeah.

1193
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:45,920
There are five people in the front row wearing custom shirts that say, we horny for this

1194
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,920
one.

1195
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
Thank you.

1196
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,920
Now, also, that is unlicensed.

1197
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,920
My brother and I are going to need you to burn it.

1198
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:52,920
Perfect.

1199
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,160
Thank you.

1200
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,160
It's very good.

1201
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,160
It's a very good shirt.

1202
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,160
Perfect.

1203
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,160
Thank you.

1204
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Thank you.

1205
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,160
Thank you.

1206
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
We'll start on this side this time.

1207
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
What's your name?

1208
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,160
My name is Amanda.

1209
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,160
Hi, Amanda.

1210
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,160
What's your name?

1211
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,160
I'm Sandy.

1212
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,160
Hi, Sandy.

1213
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,160
Hi, Sandy.

1214
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Amanda, we'll start with you.

1215
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
What's your question?

1216
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Yeah.

1217
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:13,720
So, I'm going to be ending my graduate school experience and I'm...

1218
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,680
Just quit and just fuck this place.

1219
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:16,680
Bye.

1220
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,680
Yeah.

1221
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,680
Fuck graduate school.

1222
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:24,920
I'm starting a real person job and it's Monday through Thursday and so that's four days,

1223
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,400
but I only have four dress shirts and one pair of pants.

1224
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,800
Is that okay if I wear the same kind of outfits throughout the week?

1225
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,640
Just sort of, just sort of dug it right there.

1226
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,640
Yeah.

1227
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Is that okay?

1228
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,680
Like, how many clothes should I have?

1229
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
I really don't know.

1230
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
Okay.

1231
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
Thank you.

1232
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,880
I do see a lot of room for us to help here.

1233
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,880
Yeah.

1234
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,880
Sure.

1235
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
What's...

1236
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
And what is your question?

1237
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,880
So, I have a lovely two-year-old daughter named Sonia.

1238
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,600
At least I thought she was lovely until I went to the Y to pick her up from childcare

1239
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:04,880
last week and got a full-page report of how she has been stealing toys, pulling chairs

1240
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:15,200
out from underneath other kids and I'm wondering, is my daughter destined for prison or is there

1241
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,080
something I can do to help her?

1242
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Okay.

1243
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:25,400
I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna rule here and we're gonna go this way and I'm gonna tell you why.

1244
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,360
There's a very slim, slim sliver of daylight with child-rearing questions and it's just

1245
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,760
where it's like the could go just off the road.

1246
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,760
It's the Kobayashi Maru.

1247
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,760
The Kobayashi Maru.

1248
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,760
Thank you.

1249
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,840
Or the Star Wars whole bomb in there, explode the big, the big one?

1250
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
The round ship?

1251
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,800
The one with the ship and it's got the big moon, but it's not a moon.

1252
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,800
Yeah.

1253
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,160
I'm about three horses next in and I'm not gonna find this sliver.

1254
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:57,320
I'm not gonna be able to find it, so my prayers are with you and your family and I super do

1255
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,920
hope that works out for you, but I'm gonna take the grounder over here if you don't mind.

1256
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,920
I hope you understand.

1257
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,120
If yours could be answered with buy one more shirt, we would go with it.

1258
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
No spoilers.

1259
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,120
Don't listen.

1260
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,120
If we could tell you, oh, just buy one more shirt and then your daughter will do better

1261
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,280
in daycare, we would do yours.

1262
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,280
Yeah, but seriously.

1263
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,280
Thank you.

1264
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,280
Thank you.

1265
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:19,280
Yeah.

1266
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,280
Thank you.

1267
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
Hey, what's up?

1268
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,360
So four shirts, one pants.

1269
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,960
And also one pair of flats.

1270
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,080
Oh, we gotta revise the math then.

1271
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,080
Okay.

1272
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,080
Hold on.

1273
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,080
You've changed the whole calculation.

1274
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,080
Okay.

1275
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,080
You say real person job.

1276
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,880
Does that mean five days a week?

1277
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,880
Because we're already hitting a snag.

1278
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,880
Monday through Thursday, four days.

1279
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,880
Oh, then you're fine.

1280
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,160
You got a shirt for each day.

1281
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,520
Is there a casual day?

1282
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,520
No.

1283
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,520
Oh, shit.

1284
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,040
You do need one other pants.

1285
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,560
Not because of like the mix and match kind of thing.

1286
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,560
But for chocolate emergencies.

1287
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,560
Yeah.

1288
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Yeah.

1289
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,480
If something goes terribly, terribly wrong, you don't want to be sitting there both embarrassed

1290
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,720
because you got to stand on your pants and also at a loss for what to do tomorrow.

1291
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:02,720
Right.

1292
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,400
If you spill spaghetti sauce in your pants, your first thought can't be, well, I can't

1293
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,400
go to work.

1294
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:08,400
It's not a good-

1295
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,400
Gotta fake sick.

1296
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
Gotta take some PTO.

1297
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,280
I mean, you could cut them off and make jean shorts, of course, but that trick works once.

1298
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,960
And while people may not notice you wearing the same pair of jeans every day, they will

1299
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,360
in fact notice you wearing the same pair of jean shorts every day, which is kind of a

1300
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,480
paradox, but it is true.

1301
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,160
I actually think maybe lean into this a little bit and like you have four different shirts.

1302
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,000
Make one the Monday shirt, one the Tuesday shirt, one the Wednesday shirt, one the Thursday

1303
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
shirt.

1304
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,240
But then, two years in, new shirt in the mix.

1305
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,160
Everyone's going to compliment new shirt.

1306
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,880
Everyone knows it's new shirt because you only got four.

1307
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,660
There are very few people in anybody's life who notice when you buy new clothes as evidenced

1308
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,680
by the fact that when we were in Atlanta yesterday, I bought this shirt at J. Crew and none of

1309
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,800
my family members have said anything about it.

1310
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,600
Thank you.

1311
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:12,480
So you're probably good no matter what because people don't care what folks are wearing to

1312
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,240
work most of the time unless you work at a Best Buy and you're not wearing the very specific

1313
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
thing that they request.

1314
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,240
No.

1315
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,240
That is an excellent point.

1316
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,480
I've worked at Best Buy, Sears, and Petsmart and I wore the same thing every day to those

1317
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,480
jaws.

1318
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,880
And no one was ever like, hmm, blue polo again, huh?

1319
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,840
Well, that was a legally mandated blue polo.

1320
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,160
And if you start to get nervous, you can kind of punch it up with like maybe a fun brooch.

1321
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,160
A kicky shawl.

1322
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,240
Kind of a kicky shawl would be nice.

1323
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,240
Kind of punch it up.

1324
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:44,240
Did that help?

1325
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,240
You're good.

1326
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,240
Yeah.

1327
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,240
New pants, probably.

1328
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,240
Yeah.

1329
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,240
You're good.

1330
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,240
Ride it out.

1331
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,240
All right.

1332
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:54,320
Let's do some a little bit further back.

1333
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,240
On the aisle, sitting on the aisle in a blue shirt, waving both their hands, pointing at

1334
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,240
your shirt.

1335
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,240
Blue shirt in the aisle.

1336
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,240
Yep.

1337
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,240
Yep.

1338
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
And then left side.

1339
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,240
Left side.

1340
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,240
Left side.

1341
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,240
Left side.

1342
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:07,760
Somebody's wearing what looks like a pink cardigan over a black shirt.

1343
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:15,120
And I remember we used to do like 50 seat venues and we could just be like, Todd.

1344
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,440
Welcome to Terror Dome.

1345
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,440
What is your name?

1346
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,440
You were here first.

1347
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:20,440
Oh shit.

1348
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,440
Oh no.

1349
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,440
My name's Faith.

1350
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,440
Disqualified.

1351
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Faith?

1352
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,440
Sorry.

1353
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,020
Those are the rules.

1354
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:31,020
What was your name?

1355
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,020
Faith.

1356
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,020
Faith.

1357
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,020
Hi.

1358
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,020
Sorry about all of this.

1359
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,020
And what's your name?

1360
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,020
My name's Lake.

1361
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,020
Like the water.

1362
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,020
Hi, Lake.

1363
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,020
Like the water.

1364
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,020
Faith, we'll start with you.

1365
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,020
Hold on.

1366
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:43,020
Faith's having her microphone adjusted.

1367
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:44,200
Let's start with Lake.

1368
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,520
My stepmom, in her spare time, she makes crafts.

1369
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:54,400
They're usually like designs on pillows or blankets or shirts.

1370
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,080
The problem is she likes to put like a signature on them.

1371
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:04,160
And what she does is my parents' initials.

1372
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,560
And so it's S and M.

1373
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:26,080
Faith, yours better be fucking good.

1374
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:29,120
But it's also, I don't think there's much advice that we could do here.

1375
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,040
And now you're both just sitting on the edge of the stage, which I'm very into, a very

1376
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,000
casual vibe.

1377
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,760
Was there a question there or was that just a fun anecdote?

1378
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,280
How do you change their names?

1379
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,280
What do I do?

1380
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,280
Okay.

1381
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:41,280
I figured that might be you.

1382
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,280
Faith.

1383
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Very, very good.

1384
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,280
Faith.

1385
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,280
Hi.

1386
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,280
Hi.

1387
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,280
Hi, Faith.

1388
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,280
I have a roommate.

1389
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,280
Okay.

1390
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,840
She does this thing where she'll start a conversation with me in the living area.

1391
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:56,080
And as she's speaking to me and I'm invested in the conversation-

1392
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,520
She stays there, just doesn't go anywhere because that's-

1393
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,520
No.

1394
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,480
She'll do the opposite, actually.

1395
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,720
And she'll go into her room and she'll talk to me and close the door as she's speaking.

1396
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,720
Okay.

1397
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,720
God, that's miserable.

1398
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,720
And she'll go, oh, yeah.

1399
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,720
I had a chemistry test today.

1400
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,720
It was really hard.

1401
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,520
And I was wondering, and I'm just left there wondering, does she want me to seek her out?

1402
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,520
Right.

1403
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:22,520
Is that her?

1404
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:23,520
Are we done?

1405
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:24,520
Is that her saying, I don't want to talk anymore?

1406
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:29,280
I thought you were going to say she goes into the turlet and keeps on rocking like nothing's

1407
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,440
going on there.

1408
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,520
I feel tempted to go with the S and M quill.

1409
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:38,560
But I don't know that we're going to say anything funnier than the very concept.

1410
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,560
Nothing just happened.

1411
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Ooh, this is a toughie.

1412
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:46,640
Yeah, I think you just stop talking to your roommate whenever they do this because if

1413
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:52,080
you can't see them, the conversation has ended, and that just seems like a good sort of protocol.

1414
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,080
Is that okay?

1415
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,080
Yeah, that'll work.

1416
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
Okay.

1417
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
Thank you for your honesty.

1418
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,080
Thank you for your honesty.

1419
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,080
I know it wasn't the best.

1420
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,080
Yeah, you didn't sugarcoat it.

1421
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,080
I appreciate that.

1422
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,080
Now, about these S and M quilts.

1423
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,080
Yeah.

1424
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:10,120
We actually don't have anything funnier to say than the quilts, so you may actually be...

1425
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,880
Was the question, what is your address so I can send you one of these awesome quilts?

1426
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,040
Also, is your concern that someone will get this and be like, oh, this is lovely needle

1427
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,040
point.

1428
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,040
Flip it over.

1429
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,040
What?

1430
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,040
That explains it.

1431
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,800
Like, I'm pretty sure people won't be confused.

1432
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,160
What are some of the other things that S and M are stitched onto?

1433
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,160
I mean, the problem...

1434
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,160
Thank you, Paul.

1435
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:40,760
Paul's the best.

1436
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,760
Other crafts.

1437
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
What else are we talking about?

1438
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:48,120
I mean, the problem is I got rid of it, but at one point I had a sweater with it on it.

1439
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,120
That fucking rules.

1440
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,120
I'm sorry.

1441
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,440
Everything about your life owns bones.

1442
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,840
You do not need our help.

1443
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,720
You just wanted to brag and I love it.

1444
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,720
I'm into it for sure.

1445
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,280
It's very good, but it makes me feel bad and small because your life rules.

1446
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,280
Yeah.

1447
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:07,840
I'm scared because she goes to farmer's markets with quilts that say S and M on them.

1448
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,720
And she's incredibly successful because her shit rules.

1449
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:18,760
She makes so much money, even more than the bespoke potato guy down the hall.

1450
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:19,880
We have nothing else for you.

1451
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:20,880
Your shit rules.

1452
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,880
Congratulations.

1453
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,880
Congratulations.

1454
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,880
Well done.

1455
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,240
Our mailbox addresses are listed on the website.

1456
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,720
I will make sure to send something if I can.

1457
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,720
Thank you.

1458
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,720
Thank you.

1459
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,720
All right.

1460
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,720
I'm done picking people.

1461
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,720
I've done a lot.

1462
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,720
Yeah.

1463
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
You've done good.

1464
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm going to say this person over here with the hat from Mario, come on down.

1465
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,360
The clothes from Mario also, I think.

1466
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,360
Yes.

1467
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,360
Just a Mario outfit.

1468
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Thank you so much.

1469
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,360
I'm very into that.

1470
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,360
All right.

1471
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,360
From the left side.

1472
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,360
Okay.

1473
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,040
I think it's the Adventure Zone purple shirt with maybe gray hoodie over it, brown hair.

1474
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,040
You just look sad.

1475
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,040
I'm pointing at you.

1476
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,040
Yeah.

1477
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,040
Yeah.

1478
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,040
You.

1479
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,040
Yeah.

1480
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
The person I'm describing.

1481
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,040
Whoa.

1482
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,040
Okay.

1483
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,040
Oh, it's that whole Mario Odyssey cosplay.

1484
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,520
I'm so into that because I'm very excited for Mario Odyssey to come out on Friday.

1485
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,520
Same.

1486
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,960
And you're cosplaying for it like it's like E3, which seems weird, but also I'm so into

1487
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,880
it because I saw you and I was like, oh shit, Friday's going to be a very good day.

1488
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:16,880
I work at GameStop.

1489
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:17,880
Thank you.

1490
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:18,880
Oh, cool.

1491
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:19,880
Excellent.

1492
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
What's your name?

1493
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,880
I am Rebecca.

1494
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:22,880
Hi, Rebecca.

1495
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:23,880
What is your name?

1496
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,880
My name is Brianna.

1497
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Hi, Brianna.

1498
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
Rebecca.

1499
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
Let's go.

1500
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Here we go.

1501
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
Like he says.

1502
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:30,880
Here we go.

1503
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
Yes.

1504
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,880
All right.

1505
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,880
My name is Rebecca and I work at GameStop and unfortunately I am very small.

1506
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:36,880
Okay.

1507
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,480
And sometimes I have to close alone and while I do live in a pretty safe place, one time

1508
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,520
we got burgled while I was there alone.

1509
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,520
Hey, I hear you.

1510
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,120
Let's talk after this.

1511
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,000
I was scared pantsless while I was wearing a skirt.

1512
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Doesn't matter.

1513
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:59,320
Well, I'm not, I'm not very large and scary like someone that should be.

1514
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,320
I wish I was so that I wasn't burgled.

1515
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,320
It was only like 50 bucks.

1516
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,320
Well, you need to understand.

1517
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,320
You weren't targeted.

1518
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,720
They weren't like, we're going to rob her.

1519
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,840
Even big, strong, tough people who look very scary and intimidating can get robbed working

1520
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,160
at GameStop.

1521
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:20,200
It happens to even the toughest, surliest looking bad dudes.

1522
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:24,840
I feel like we could solve this pretty easy Good Will Hunting style by, it's not your

1523
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:27,320
fault that you got robbed at GameStop.

1524
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,080
You need to understand that.

1525
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,400
It is also your job to not be intimidating and then it's your job to be like, you got

1526
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,400
it.

1527
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,400
You got it.

1528
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Whatever you need.

1529
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,400
Absolutely.

1530
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1531
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Now your question.

1532
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Okay.

1533
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,400
How do I bulk up fast?

1534
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,520
I'm going to go rob a GameStop lane.

1535
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:51,120
Where are some easy ones?

1536
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,480
I can tell you one that's a pushover guaranteed.

1537
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,200
So what is the question?

1538
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:04,640
I was going to ask, how do I become intimidating without changing my physical self?

1539
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:05,640
No, you don't.

1540
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:12,040
You're approaching this from a, okay, let's do, we'll do yours, but what's, what was your

1541
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,040
question?

1542
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
Okay.

1543
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,160
So ever since me and my friends got to our hotel room, weird things have been happening.

1544
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,160
Here in Nashville?

1545
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,160
Yes.

1546
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,160
Okay.

1547
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:26,360
Lights flickering, elevators stuttering, doors getting stuck, and we would just think this

1548
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:31,400
is a sign of a shitty hotel, but there's literally a graveyard across the parking lot.

1549
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,720
Hell yeah.

1550
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:35,360
Our hotel room is haunted.

1551
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:39,240
What is the protocol for dealing with this ghost?

1552
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,560
Move hotel rooms.

1553
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:41,560
Yeah.

1554
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,560
Ask for it.

1555
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,560
That's money.

1556
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:47,520
Well, that's money is a really good, that should be a catchphrase of my bim bam for

1557
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,640
like the thing you've said won't work.

1558
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,640
That's money.

1559
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:52,640
That's money.

1560
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,640
Hmm.

1561
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Okay.

1562
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,680
Which, who can we help?

1563
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,680
Shit.

1564
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,680
Shit.

1565
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,680
Ghosts are real.

1566
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,680
Ghosts are real.

1567
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,680
Burglary is also wicked real.

1568
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,280
Burglary is also real.

1569
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:04,880
It's like a mad real.

1570
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,480
I feel like though, if we give advice, anything burgle related that we could be called to

1571
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,640
testify at some point in the future.

1572
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,800
There is no ghost court, right?

1573
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,200
Like we're not gonna, we're not gonna be held liable.

1574
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,280
Uh, I don't know.

1575
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:27,480
Anything burgled sucked a lot and, but there's like nothing you, you, all joking aside, there's

1576
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:30,160
nothing you could have done about that.

1577
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,800
There's nothing you should have done about that.

1578
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,280
So you're like good.

1579
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,680
There is no amount of intimidating I think an employee can be that someone who is decided

1580
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:45,540
to rob a store will walk in and go, no, you know what, actually I'll come back tomorrow.

1581
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,520
They've already decided to rob it.

1582
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,520
Yeah.

1583
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,000
Uh, yeah.

1584
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,480
Is that, is that okay?

1585
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,480
You're all right.

1586
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:54,480
I hope you're doing okay.

1587
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:55,480
Genuinely.

1588
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,480
Yeah.

1589
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,800
I just, I don't care if they rob it.

1590
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,800
Just not while I'm there.

1591
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
Well, that's not a great.

1592
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,800
Okay.

1593
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,800
Thank you so much for coming.

1594
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:02,800
Okay.

1595
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:03,800
You're really embodying the spirit of Mario.

1596
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:04,800
As long as I get to mine.

1597
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:05,800
As long as it happens to Greg.

1598
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:22,680
It's a not me, it's a not me.

1599
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,680
Mario it happened again.

1600
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:25,680
Okay.

1601
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,080
I was at home.

1602
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,940
Go to the cafeteria or whatever at the hotel.

1603
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,760
Get some salt, circle of salt, duns out.

1604
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,760
Okay.

1605
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,800
Because even if it doesn't work, the ghost will see the circle of salt and be like, they

1606
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,800
know what's up.

1607
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:46,080
You do not want an active player as a ghost, even if the stuff doesn't work.

1608
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,520
You don't want someone who's engaged in battling you.

1609
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:49,520
That's the last thing.

1610
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,740
Because if you live forever as a spectral form, I think you're probably going to walk

1611
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,680
pretty cautiously when it comes to like, oops, I could get banished.

1612
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,520
You're probably pretty careful about that shit.

1613
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,000
You see a circle of salt, you're like, not worth it.

1614
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,040
So you have to kind of pity a hotel room ghost, because human beings are their absolute worst

1615
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,400
in a hotel room.

1616
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,280
You would think like, no, at home they're most comfortable.

1617
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:10,280
No, no, no.

1618
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,760
I walk in, I throw my stuff around.

1619
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,960
I just drop shit, half empty cup, I just fuck it.

1620
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,520
It's like not quite rockstar parting, just so much as just like human animal.

1621
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:23,560
Ghostbusters is so buck wild.

1622
01:09:23,560 --> 01:09:28,080
Because if you are a spiritual being that can live forever, and you want to probably

1623
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,520
protect that, the last thing you're going to want to do is go fight or spook or pull

1624
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,200
pranks on the only people that can kill a ghost.

1625
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:42,280
Sorry, that has nothing to do with what you said.

1626
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,280
It is true.

1627
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,280
It is very true.

1628
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:50,380
It's like, it's weird because any ghost that you see stay to do battle with the Ghostbusters

1629
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:52,680
is fucked up beyond belief.

1630
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,960
That's actually like the baddest ghost that you do not want to mess with.

1631
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:00,360
Because there's like four people on earth that can fuck with them, and they are choosing

1632
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,600
to pick a fight with those four people.

1633
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,600
Just leave.

1634
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:08,720
Just go to like another room or another, just another anywhere.

1635
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,080
There's only four of them, and you're in New York.

1636
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,080
There's plenty of space.

1637
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:13,080
There's plenty of places to haunt.

1638
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,080
Fly up into space.

1639
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,080
You're a ghost.

1640
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,080
Forget about it.

1641
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,280
Do you think the first, like a big group of ghosts like stood against the Ghostbusters?

1642
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,920
They're like, we're asking you now.

1643
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:30,200
And then like they busted the first ghost, and like the other six, you were like, shit.

1644
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,000
This is not anything.

1645
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Circle of Salt.

1646
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
You're good.

1647
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
You're good.

1648
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
That's fine.

1649
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Thank you so much.

1650
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Glad we could help.

1651
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Want to wrap up?

1652
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Yeah.

1653
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Let's wrap up.

1654
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Thank you all so much.

1655
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,000
That was very fun, by the way.

1656
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,440
I think we're going to do that from now on, but we're going to wrap the show up.

1657
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,440
Thank you all so, so, so much for being here.

1658
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,440
You all have been so cool.

1659
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,400
A couple of things real quick before we go, we forgot to mention this last night.

1660
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:57,000
We'll mention it tomorrow night, too.

1661
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,960
But as long as we have a captive audience, we are putting out an Adventure Zone graphic

1662
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:01,960
novel.

1663
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,960
Yes.

1664
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,960
It's theadventurezonecomic.com.

1665
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:11,560
You all don't know what the Adventure Zone is, but the crowd tomorrow is going to fuck

1666
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,560
up.

1667
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,560
Yeah.

1668
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,640
Also, we do want to say, we already thanked him once.

1669
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,640
We'll thank him again.

1670
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,640
Paul Seborn.

1671
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,640
Thank you, Paul.

1672
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,640
Amazing.

1673
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,480
Paul should go check out Paul and Storm.

1674
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:23,900
If you aren't already fans, you should become them.

1675
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:25,920
We assume that you are already.

1676
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,320
Thank you to Schmanners for opening for us today.

1677
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,320
Thank you, Schmanners.

1678
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:32,480
Thank you to the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.

1679
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,360
This place is very cool, and I'm very excited that we are doing another show here tomorrow.

1680
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,360
Thank you, Nashville.

1681
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,360
Thank you, Nashville.

1682
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,360
Thank you, Nashville.

1683
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,000
Thank you, John Roderick and the Long Winters for the Use Your Theme Song.

1684
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,600
It's a departure of the album, Putting the Days to bed.

1685
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
It's very good.

1686
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
Thank you to Max Funner for having us.

1687
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:49,200
We mentioned posters by Louis Armstrong.

1688
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Thank you, Louis.

1689
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Thank you, Max Funner.

1690
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
Thank you, Max Funner.

1691
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Yeah, that's...

1692
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,480
Oh, we wish we could, but we are unable to do a meet and greet after the show because

1693
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,580
we have another show to do tomorrow, and we have babies and children.

1694
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,920
I took a nap backstage.

1695
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:04,320
My body is dead.

1696
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,760
That salad revived me, but the salad juice is just gone.

1697
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,200
So we won't be able to do that, but you're all great.

1698
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,280
We're so sorry that we're old and boring and waxed.

1699
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,280
We suck.

1700
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Idiots.

1701
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:17,280
How about that...

1702
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,280
Half dead.

1703
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,280
Thank you.

1704
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,960
Thank you. How about this finally a bunch of you met our dad at Walgreens?

1705
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,720
That's something right

1706
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:34,000
Like dad wasn't just waiting at Walgreens just like getting band-aids and free nose

1707
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,960
whatever the fuck you get just saying zone of truth out loud like somebody might hear that and like

1708
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:46,800
Tomorrow's gonna be fucking cool. Yeah, okay. Go ahead Griff
