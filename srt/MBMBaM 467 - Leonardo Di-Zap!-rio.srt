1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,520
Hello everybody, welcome to my brother and my brother's main advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,680
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middlest brother, Travis.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
I need you guys to keep in mind that I edit the podcast, and when you introduce these just

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
delicious delectable pauses, it's hell. It is hell on earth.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
But it's fun for people at home because they get anticipation tingles.

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,760
They don't get anticipation, they don't get ASMR,

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
they've listened to 500 fucking episodes of this.

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,520
I'm building off of what we have said already about this, so you can't remove it from the show.

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:21,920
Okay.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,760
This is- Griffin, do your thing, baby.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
Everyone, I want you to meet my youngest brother.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh boy, howdy. It'll be really confusing,

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,600
because that sentence is going to sound really normal once I do my sick stuff to it.

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:39,920
Okay.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,160
Oh shit, oh my god.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
Can you say your name?

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,520
This is Griffin McElroy.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,640
Can I tell y'all something?

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,600
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
Something I just found out looking up, listen.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,880
What was that?

27
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,080
We're recording this on the 3rd, so this is topical when I say it.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,040
Of course, of course, the 4th of July in the United States is in Penis Day.

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,760
Now it is also National Barbecued Spare Ribs Day.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:06,800
Yeah.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,160
It's okay, cool.

32
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,040
It's also National Caesar Salad Day.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,800
Well, that's for the spare ribs.

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,760
It's a foil to the spare ribs people.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
That was the one actually organized by Caesar Salads,

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,480
because for a day they could just fucking relax.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Yeah.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,040
Because nobody's going to come eat one of them.

39
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
Not that day.

40
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,160
No.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,160
No one's eating the Caesar Salad.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
And if you have been tempted in this, the year of our Lord,

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
to tweet at me a picture of the grody Caesar Salad that you ate on the 4th of July,

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
I am not interested.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
No, no, don't do it.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,720
No.

47
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:42,880
No.

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Wait a minute, is that the stinky salad?

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,800
Because I think it is.

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
The one with chokes?

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,240
You got the stinky salad going?

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,880
I mean, I don't want to...

53
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,120
Throw your hot dog eating contest in the garbage can.

54
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,040
Pick up Joey Chestnut from the armpits,

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,520
lift him into the big garbage can, and release him.

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
Squeeze gently, because he's full of wet buds.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,160
But do place him in the garbage can,

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,440
because I want to have that Caesar Salad eating contest.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,240
To celebrate the birth of the Statue of Liberty

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,440
from the womb of independence from those mean Europe ones.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I mean, it's all one, right?

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,720
It's just one.

63
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,120
It's just everybody at the table does one,

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,800
and then they go home as friends.

65
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,200
Is it the biggest salad or the most salad?

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,440
I think that you make a bet on the weight of salad you can consume.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,960
And then it's like whoever gets closest without going over kind of deal.

68
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:43,840
Yeah.

69
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,400
Now you would have to not weigh, like you couldn't have a weight running during it, right?

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
You'd have to say like, I think I will eat 10 pounds of salad, right?

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,320
And then you just start eating.

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,840
And then you say, and I'm done.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
I think that was 10 pounds.

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,520
And make it about guessing how close you can get to the weight that you said.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
I am getting really excited about this.

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,960
This year's eating competition is going to be huge.

77
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,000
The exact same people win every year.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,680
So it's thrilling for me.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,880
The same man has won the men's competition every year since 2007.

80
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,720
Of course, Chestnut who sort of took the torch from Kobayashi after it was his turn to win.

81
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,520
When he exploded.

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,880
He exploded like Mr. Creasel.

83
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,720
And then and now it's Joey's turn.

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,400
And one day he'll explode and I'll step in.

85
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,680
2015, sorry.

86
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,440
I want to give credit to Matt Stoney who bested Joe in 2015.

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
But that's been it.

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,560
It's been pretty uneventful since then.

89
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:03,600
This year, Joey is going to be looking to top a record 74 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,120
If you guys had to take on Joey and bring him, take him, take him down, take him out.

91
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,720
What would be your strategy?

92
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,240
Oh, I think you're going to say how many hot dogs do I think I could consume in 10 minutes.

93
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Because I think my strategy would be to tap out really early.

94
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Oh, interesting.

95
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,360
So not eat as many as you can.

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
And I have stuff to do on the 5th.

97
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,360
I would argue that Joey's got stuff to do on the 5th.

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,920
I would guess Joey keeps a clear calendar on the 5th.

99
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,480
He's got a clear calendar and a clear path to the bathroom.

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,480
He's got a completely just non-existent Google calendar.

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,720
I would say from the 5th to the 12th.

102
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,000
He's got Clippy like I see you're trying to schedule something on the 6th.

103
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,040
Are you sure?

104
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,280
He's got his iPad plugged into the charger in the bathroom.

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,200
Netflix ready to roll, baby.

106
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,840
He probably already has Shazam downloaded.

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
He's ready to watch Shazam, yeah.

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,360
He's ready to fire it up.

109
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,560
Poop all day, I mean.

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,080
Hey, can I ask you guys a question?

111
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
It's the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest.

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,480
What?

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,200
You're the worst.

114
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,320
What's funny about that?

115
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,680
You're thinking about his big poopy?

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
The whole thing.

117
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,200
The whole thing is the worst.

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,000
So Nathan likes to make people hurt and so obviously Nathan loves this.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,520
Nathan loves watching Joey Chestnut and his weird bad throat just destroy all these dogs,

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,080
right?

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,200
And everybody gets so excited from Nathan's when they see this and they celebrate the

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,560
nation's independence when they watch a man eat 74 hot dogs, which is terrible.

123
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
In 10 minutes.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,600
In 10 minutes, but let me ask this.

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:59,680
Do you think the company that makes the buns is as psyched to watch their creation get

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,840
besoiled in a big nasty cup of grime and then slurped down?

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
That's not even a gnarly enough onomatopoetic sort of creation.

128
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,400
Slurped.

129
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,440
It gets slurped down the throat.

130
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,840
I bet you the bun makers are like, ah, fuck.

131
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,200
That's not good promotion.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,640
No one's gonna see that and be like, you know what?

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,000
I could go out and eat some regular hot dog buns with nothing on them.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
Well, that's the thing.

135
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,200
I think maybe this will be the end.

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,960
This is my side bet for the hot dog that Nathan's goes, hey, you know what?

137
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
This might be the least advertising way to try to advertise our product.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,200
The least.

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,360
It's like if they were trying to fucking advertise Shazam by showing a movie theater where they

140
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,200
have locked in 100 people for four straight days watching nothing but Shazam and then

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,240
they walk out of the theaters.

142
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,920
I want to hear what their review is.

143
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,760
That's the thing.

144
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,800
So that's it.

145
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,960
Hey, if I was Nathan's, you know what the hot dog eating contest I would propose is?

146
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,880
Watch somebody eat one hot dog for 10 minutes and try to act like they're enjoying it as

147
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,720
much as possible and then judge you won by a round of applause.

148
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,760
Yeah.

149
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,880
Who most artistically savors a hot dog for 10 minutes?

150
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,440
Yes.

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,800
Who can dress it with the best condiments?

152
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,840
Who can savor it the most?

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,400
And who had the most orgasmic enjoyment of a single Nathan's hot dog?

154
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,240
No, if you moan in the daytime Fourth of July contest, you are out.

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,000
You save that for Nathan's after dark.

156
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,640
Nathan's after dark, we can get pretty raunchy on these dogs and these buns.

157
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,400
I'll have what he's having.

158
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,360
And that's my secret.

159
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,120
A lot of people focus on dog-based sexual humor.

160
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
Let's talk about that bun though.

161
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
Lots of opportunities for Nathan's after dark though.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,760
Don't get kicked out of the daytime.

163
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,680
It's kind of like a butt in some ways.

164
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
You could say that.

165
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
A butt or a fanny or whatever.

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,800
Do you guys know that there is another title held by Joey Chestnut?

167
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,560
World's greatest lover.

168
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
World poutine eating champion.

169
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,480
I mean, can you fathom it?

170
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,600
Can you fathom those delicious, those little pillows in the gravy,

171
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
those little pillowy cheese gravy curds

172
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
flown down a river right into fame and success?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
He talks to a scheduler.

174
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,280
Hey, what day is the poutine eating one on?

175
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,040
The poutine eating one is on July 5th.

176
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
Is my will up to date?

177
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Am I good to go?

178
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,040
Can you tell Mrs. Chestnut that I love her?

179
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,880
Here's some other Joey Chestnut world records he holds right now.

180
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,160
Grilled cheese sandwiches.

181
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
He did 47 in 10 minutes.

182
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,440
Pulled them right down.

183
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
Yamadama.

184
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,680
Horseshoe sandwich.

185
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,840
That's an open face one.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,840
That seems a little specific.

187
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,720
I think he's just finding some things that people probably don't eat a lot of.

188
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Joey Chestnut's grandma's special goulash.

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,440
He ate one bowl in 10 minutes.

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
He's got the Poisson record, baby.

191
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,880
That's 7.5 Poissons in 10 minutes.

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
Oh, I could do that.

193
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Could you?

194
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,840
No.

195
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,880
Interesting.

196
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,480
I could do 6.83 Poissons.

197
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
He did 53 soft-beat tacos from Taco Bell in 10 minutes.

198
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
Oh, now that's a day.

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,320
That is a day.

200
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,200
That next day, Valerie, clear my week.

201
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,720
It's gonna be tough.

202
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
Yeah, I mean, I think Juice, I think we can just assume that he's gonna have bad shits

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
for a long time after any of these.

204
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,720
And probably has some before, right?

205
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Because he's probably taking some stimulants to clean the pipes out a little bit.

206
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
Where's the, like, national celery eating day?

207
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,640
The national, like, roughage eating day.

208
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,920
That's probably the day before the national hot dog contest, isn't it?

209
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,160
Okay, and that's my limit.

210
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,080
We hit it.

211
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,640
There it is.

212
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
Oh, wow, we found it.

213
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
Cool, everybody.

214
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Mark it down.

215
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,160
We've just broken the world record for yucking out Griffin.

216
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,400
And this is, as you've almost certainly guessed, an advice show.

217
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,480
We are going to help you, the common person, with your queries for wisdom.

218
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,720
And this is how we do it, just like this.

219
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,080
My mom wants to start a YouTube channel about cooking.

220
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,600
She told me she, quote, plans on it going viral.

221
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,080
I've tried explaining that it doesn't work that way, but she doesn't listen.

222
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,760
She does not even have a camera or a space to record videos,

223
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,480
but she already has her channel and she bought a domain name.

224
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,360
This is good.

225
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,440
She also wants me to edit her videos.

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I don't know how to edit videos.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,120
How do I stop her before she throws a bunch of money into the black hole called YouTube?

228
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,840
There it is.

229
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,880
They don't have a funny name.

230
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,240
They're just desperately trying to get help.

231
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,080
That's what the username is for that one.

232
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,000
Ooh, I mean Chewbacca Mom didn't have a fucking studio set up, did she?

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Yes.

234
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:06,580
Chewbacca Mom didn't have a, you know, Sure S500 whatever the fuck microphone.

235
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,940
Getting that GoPro 4K shit.

236
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,100
I don't know how YouTubers do it, but, you know, all she had was a cell phone,

237
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,140
a dream, and a plastic mask of Chewbacca that talked.

238
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Are you suggesting that she wears the Chewbacca mask while she does cooking?

239
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:22,920
Yes.

240
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,260
That could be funny.

241
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,700
Chewcooka, that's all I've got.

242
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,500
Chewbacca.

243
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,000
Damn it.

244
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,900
Chewbacca is good.

245
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,400
Lubega.

246
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,100
Wear a Lubega mask while you cook.

247
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,020
Lubega presents Chewbacca, and Lubega pays for it and does live music in the studio

248
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,180
while you cook wearing the Chewbacca Mom mask.

249
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,300
This thing writes itself.

250
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,620
That's viral right there.

251
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,340
That's viral.

252
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,180
That's max virality.

253
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,980
You don't need a camera because she has a phone, right?

254
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,580
We're halfway there.

255
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,900
A space to record sounds like a kitchen to me.

256
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,660
Yeah, like a kitchen.

257
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,380
She's gonna film in her kitchen, and you don't know how to edit videos?

258
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,500
Cut out the curses.

259
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,780
It's that easy.

260
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,580
Just take out the boring parts and only leave the good parts.

261
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,540
I've seen YouTube.

262
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,380
They have tons of edits.

263
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,780
You cut out anything where the person isn't talking or making noise,

264
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,060
it'll be 30 seconds long.

265
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,420
She'll make a million dollars.

266
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,700
Or leave the curses in.

267
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,060
That might be viral.

268
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Like, if she's like me and burns her hands on the oven a lot,

269
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,980
leave that in, that's gold.

270
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,620
Imagine you had a YouTube video and it started like this.

271
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,580
My mom, my mom asked me to edit her YouTube videos.

272
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,660
She never said if I should leave anything in besides the curses.

273
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,220
And it's just like two minutes of your mom being like,

274
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,980
fuck, god damn it, shit, the fucking batter,

275
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,180
these goddamn eggs, motherfucker.

276
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,180
That's gonna be a good vid.

277
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,540
It would kill.

278
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,340
Make a ton of money.

279
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,940
It's good to put your V on Fallon.

280
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,100
Listen, it's good to put the secret out there, right?

281
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,540
It's good to put your vision board out there.

282
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,660
You want it to go viral.

283
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,700
You plan on it going viral.

284
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,460
That's probably half the thing.

285
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,260
But sometimes you don't have to plan on it going viral.

286
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,580
Sometimes it's a case of the less you want it, the more you'll get it.

287
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,020
When I was in high school and for my TV news class,

288
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,340
I choreographed a lightsaber fight with my friend Cory Jackson.

289
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,500
And then we did a whole sort of light side, dark side lightsaber fight skit.

290
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,140
I didn't think, hey, in 20 years,

291
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,420
people are gonna fucking drag me for this so hard.

292
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,740
They're gonna drag me for this and they won't ever let me go.

293
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,980
They're gonna drag me and drag me and drag me until I'm bones.

294
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,300
And it happened for me.

295
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,500
So it can happen for your mom.

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,260
Have her do a lightsaber fight.

297
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,100
This happened to me.

298
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,380
I was at the Huntington Pride Parade last weekend.

299
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,300
It was a lovely, lovely affair.

300
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,140
And I was filling in on Mamma Mia.

301
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,780
And I was wearing one of those fun, big costumes.

302
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,820
You know the ones?

303
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,100
They call them super suits.

304
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,300
I don't know, the ABBA costumes.

305
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,100
You know what I mean?

306
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,900
And I had a pair of gold Lemay pants on

307
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,980
and it made the front page of Reddit, which is so exciting.

308
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,780
The picture of me in these pants.

309
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,420
I mean, the front page of Reddit, I went viral.

310
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,740
Then I just went ahead and took a cruise on down to the comments

311
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,420
and pretty much two-thirds of them were,

312
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,380
hey, I can see this guy's whole dick.

313
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,140
Hey, hey, your pants are too tight.

314
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
We can see your entire penis, Justin.

315
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,700
Or stranger, because I don't know you.

316
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,260
They just made fun of me because my pants were too tight in the crotch.

317
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,940
And I think that's why I did good on Reddit.

318
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,460
I don't actually understand Reddit that well.

319
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,020
Where's the bad butt?

320
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,140
Just looking for this.

321
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,020
Just gonna find it.

322
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,540
Just find it.

323
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,060
I'd rather- Oh, wow.

324
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,340
My manzy.

325
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,900
Wow, bud.

326
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,020
Can you see his whole hog?

327
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,300
Hey, bud.

328
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,220
Now I've got to look it up.

329
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,940
Hold on.

330
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,380
I'd rather you guys not look at my hogs and report it, but that's okay.

331
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,260
It's an unconventional podcast.

332
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,020
Should I just search like gold pants?

333
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,460
Reddit.

334
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,300
Cool hog.

335
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,260
It doesn't matter.

336
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,060
Cool hog.

337
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,700
Doesn't matter.

338
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,340
There it is.

339
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,060
Okay.

340
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,580
I mean, the pants were tight.

341
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,380
The pants were tight.

342
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,740
The pants were tight.

343
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,580
I can see your whole dick, dude.

344
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:16,980
Yeah.

345
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,340
It's like not a good.

346
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,060
It's fun.

347
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,940
It's all fun.

348
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,140
Hey, it's good.

349
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:21,380
All right.

350
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,540
I got a Yahoo here sent in by Adrian.

351
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,660
Kels thinks it's Adrian.

352
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,620
It's an anonymous Yahoo answers user who I'm going to call.

353
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,980
Asks, why don't we just crush our trash?

354
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,980
Why don't we just crush our trash?

355
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,020
We got all this trash.

356
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:42,820
I've seen it.

357
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,220
It's bad, Wally, but real.

358
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,020
Can you imagine?

359
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,620
And it's taken up a lot of space, right?

360
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah.

361
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,980
Well, when I have food on my plate and I want like,

362
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,340
if I have a big piece of bread and I can't fit it in my mouth,

363
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,660
what do I do to it, Travis?

364
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,620
You crush it up.

365
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,780
I crush it in my hand and I put it,

366
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,780
I squeeze it as hard as I possibly can.

367
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,420
And I make a little bread gumball and I just just pop that in there.

368
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,660
So let's do that with trash, except we do not eat it.

369
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,340
Do you mean-

370
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,540
Griffin, I'm sorry.

371
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,580
I'm going to save you from having to get this on Twitter.

372
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,780
Do you mean like Wally?

373
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,860
No, because that was a fun-

374
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,140
I think you're confused again,

375
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,260
because I literally just said this, but that was a fun movie.

376
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,900
This would be a real crushing of trash.

377
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,340
A real trash crush.

378
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,660
Yes.

379
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,940
They do do-

380
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,220
The truck does this.

381
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,860
Yes.

382
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,380
We don't need to do this in our home.

383
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,020
The truck does it.

384
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,300
Well, I-

385
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,100
That is true.

386
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,780
I live in fear of that.

387
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,020
That's the thing, but we can say that.

388
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,460
It's sort of a, oh boy, it's sort of a Schrodinger's cat,

389
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:52,580
because nobody's been inside to confirm that the trash is getting crushed inside the truck.

390
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,500
But if somebody did go inside to confirm it, they wouldn't be able to get out.

391
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,580
That's a Catch-22 and a Schrodinger's cat.

392
00:17:59,620 --> 00:17:59,860
Yeah.

393
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,540
That's what happens with Schrodinger's cat is until you look in the box,

394
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,700
you don't know if the cat has been crushed or not.

395
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,660
But when you do look, it's made it crushed.

396
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,460
Okay, it's not a Schrodinger's cat, it's just a Catch-22.

397
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,340
I take it back.

398
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:12,900
I think a lot of-

399
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,780
It's just a crushed cat.

400
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,740
Yeah, it's a, yeah.

401
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,460
So-

402
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
Don't put your cats into trash.

403
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,380
This is obvious, thank you.

404
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,900
The trash truck, we don't know if it's doing what it's supposed to be doing.

405
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,140
It makes a lot of noise, but nobody actually gets in there.

406
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,780
So-

407
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,020
But here's the problem, if you crushed it, Griffin,

408
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,820
and then you delivered it to the sanitation workers all crushed up already,

409
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,460
they're like, well, what do I do?

410
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,140
What are we gonna do?

411
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,900
I love making the trash a small.

412
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,140
Yeah, like that's gotta be the best.

413
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,740
When you get like a gnarly crunch from like, I don't know,

414
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,620
a big bag of like light bulbs or something.

415
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,420
Yeah, I threw-

416
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,780
Or like they left some of those air pocket packing materials

417
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,940
that Amazon does sometimes, you know what I mean?

418
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,660
Oh, yeah.

419
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,500
Left Joey Chestnut in the can and he got made real little.

420
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,780
Oh, I forgot to get him out.

421
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,260
Oh, no.

422
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,740
I mean, I tried to answer your question.

423
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
You scrunch it up, get it tiny.

424
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,780
Better for environment.

425
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,540
You ship it on off to your garbage town.

426
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,340
What do they do?

427
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,780
They crush it even tinier, man.

428
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,740
Whoa.

429
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,900
Can you imagine eating Joey Chestnut?

430
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,820
This is a wild gastrointestinal episode.

431
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,500
This episode is a just sort of journey through the GI tract.

432
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,420
If you ate him, it would be an unreal-

433
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:30,900
Okay.

434
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,940
An unreal flavor.

435
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,220
All right, I'll explain this game.

436
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,540
It's 9 p.m. tomorrow, July 4th.

437
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,140
You eat Joey Chestnut.

438
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,540
There's no way.

439
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay, no.

440
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,460
Wait, let me finish the question.

441
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,380
There's no way I'm eating Joey Chestnut

442
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
when he's all fucking full of chewed up hot dogs.

443
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,940
If you did it in nine minutes and 59 seconds,

444
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,580
you automatically become the winner.

445
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,260
Are you now the winner of the-

446
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,620
Yes, thank you, Travis.

447
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,900
And this is not a bore thing.

448
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,180
Shut the fuck up.

449
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,820
If you ate Joey Chestnut at 9 p.m. tomorrow,

450
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,260
have you now eaten 71 hot dog soup disgust?

451
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,140
Yes.

452
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:07,300
71 hot dogs, plus all the hot dogs he's ever eaten

453
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,540
to become the person he is today.

454
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,460
He is more hot dog than man.

455
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,540
That's what I'm saying.

456
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,380
It's like dry-aged.

457
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,420
Mm-hmm.

458
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,220
He is foie gras.

459
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,580
Dry-aged.

460
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:22,340
It's like corn-fed, except it's poutine

461
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,860
and grilled cheese sandwich-fed.

462
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,380
Okay, so can we crush our trash though

463
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,060
and make it littler, better for-

464
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,100
You know, I'm pretty sure that the Big Bang happened, right?

465
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,220
Yeah.

466
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,740
And then everything's expanding out,

467
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,260
and then eventually everything will retract back in.

468
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,380
So let's help it out by squishing our trash down.

469
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,060
I don't think there's a reason not to.

470
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,260
I'd rather risk it being true and not need it.

471
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,060
You know what I mean?

472
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,380
And it's better for me now to squish my trash down

473
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,940
because I don't have to take the freaking stuff out as much.

474
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,980
So it's better and better and better.

475
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,100
But then when I do take it out,

476
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
it's gonna weigh about 700 pounds.

477
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
There's that.

478
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,580
Because I've crushed it down so tight.

479
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,980
Right.

480
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,900
I do this with milk cartons.

481
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,740
Oh, la-dee-da, Justin.

482
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,180
I do this with milk cartons,

483
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,020
and then after I squish all the air out of them,

484
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,460
I put the cap back on so they can't re-inflate.

485
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,580
Ow, these fucking tricky milk cartons always.

486
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,260
And the trash-

487
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,180
Us millennials will try anything.

488
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,820
The trash people love to make balloons out of these things.

489
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,340
Justin won't let them with his-

490
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,700
You know what I do?

491
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,420
What I do?

492
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,980
I use my milk cartons to make bird feeders.

493
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,260
Oh, that's so good.

494
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,180
And then when the birds are inside it, I crush them.

495
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,940
Okay, not good.

496
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,220
Gotta stop talking about crushing animals.

497
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,180
We just gotta talk about-

498
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,060
Here, let's talk about-

499
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,580
Hey, don't crush animals.

500
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,380
Let's make a rule.

501
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,860
No more talking about eating Joey Chestnut

502
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,780
or crushing animals in this episode.

503
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,020
If we can just go for the rest of them.

504
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:44,900
I will try.

505
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,700
I take my soda cans and I cut them into shuriken.

506
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:48,820
Okay.

507
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,100
Okay.

508
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,580
So I can use them-

509
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,940
Now crush those shurikens.

510
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,980
Yeah, when I'm done with the shurikens,

511
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,100
they will also get crushed.

512
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,460
I was at work at a donut shop.

513
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,740
God, that was a seamless transition.

514
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,900
I thought you worked at a donut shop and I never knew it.

515
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,700
No, I was at work at a donut shop.

516
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,420
That's a wild way of putting that, by the way.

517
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,380
That's like you work and you just happen to show up

518
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,500
at a donut shop and say,

519
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm gonna do the work here today.

520
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,260
I was at work at a donut shop when a customer asked me,

521
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,100
what is the best donut for a 14 year old?

522
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,060
After studying the menu a long time,

523
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,700
I said the first flavor that came to mind, blueberry.

524
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,020
But I'm afraid I may have led her astray

525
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,100
and not given her the correct recommendation.

526
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,820
Help me, brothers.

527
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:35,060
What is the best donut for a 14 year old?

528
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,420
That's from Donut Dilemma in Dallas.

529
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:39,780
Blueberry's not bad.

530
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,300
Yeah, I appreciate that you think we know

531
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,580
what the best anything for a 14 year old is

532
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,780
because I think you can look at our body of work

533
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,580
and know that that is not true.

534
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,420
I don't think we know, as evidenced by the fact

535
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,700
that we keep making these fucking Fortnite jokes, fam,

536
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,180
and there's nobody playing this thing anymore.

537
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,860
Everybody's back on Minecraft again and ding dong ditch.

538
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,940
It's Minecraft and ding dong ditch now.

539
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,420
Oh, man.

540
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,060
Sorry, I stepped away from the computer for 35 seconds.

541
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,340
How about a Fortnite donut?

542
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,020
Maybe a Joey Chestnut flavor.

543
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,580
Damn it.

544
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,380
Damn it.

545
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,020
Karishika Dog.

546
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,100
This show sucks.

547
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,620
Maybe that's an ironic donut.

548
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,380
Yeah, maybe.

549
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,740
Blueberry's really good.

550
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,240
I just...

551
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,380
14, start in high school, body.

552
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,380
I'm trying to put us in the right head space

553
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,260
to talk about the donut.

554
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,500
Okay.

555
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,300
Let's everybody get, everybody, it's Griffin.

556
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,100
Get 14!

557
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,900
Okay.

558
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,980
Body's changing, high school.

559
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,020
Things are changing on the body.

560
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,460
And driving a car soon, scared of that.

561
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,140
But not yet.

562
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,860
Not yet.

563
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,900
And friends going away, friends coming back.

564
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,340
And what am I gonna-

565
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,940
Wait, where'd they come back from?

566
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,060
What am I gonna be?

567
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,700
And the changes are so, there's just changes

568
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,620
on changes of the body on top of changes.

569
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,180
And real quick, what's the best donut?

570
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,220
Donut holes.

571
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,720
Joey.

572
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,780
I didn't get you in the right head space, did I?

573
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,660
No, I don't, I mean, I liked them all.

574
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,340
I liked them all.

575
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,260
A Pokemon donut.

576
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:17,960
Okay.

577
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,520
Okay, collect them all.

578
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,040
You know what, I got it.

579
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,920
I fucking got it.

580
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Donut stick.

581
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,160
Some kind of one-handed stick-based donut.

582
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,720
This is the donut the teens are gonna crave.

583
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,800
It is easy to hold with one hand.

584
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,880
Unlike your ringed donuts that make me exhausted

585
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,920
to eat with both hands.

586
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,760
This is one sleek, sleek, pocketable donut.

587
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,360
A donut you can start working on

588
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,760
and then maybe you wanna talk to your friends

589
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,920
over FaceTime, like the youngs do.

590
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,200
Then you slide the donut right into your pocket

591
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,560
and you don't even sweat it.

592
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,880
It has a cap.

593
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,380
Yes.

594
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,440
It has a cap on it and you can save it for later.

595
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Don't worry about it.

596
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
We can all agree, no jelly filled,

597
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,560
that's just gonna get on your jinkos.

598
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,160
No, of course not jelly filled.

599
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,760
The jinkos are gonna facilitate pocketing

600
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,440
this big donut, sure.

601
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,560
It's got millennial flavors like paprika and coriander.

602
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,680
Coriander, yeah.

603
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,200
And there is bacon on it for certain.

604
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,120
Choc-a-block with CBD.

605
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,480
Gotta get it in there.

606
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,960
Oh yeah.

607
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,000
Gotta get it in there.

608
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,320
And oh boy.

609
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,320
And maybe they're collectible.

610
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:40,200
It looks and printed on it is the face of Billy Eilish

611
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,120
or Eilish, I've never heard someone say it out loud.

612
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,920
Nailed it.

613
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,240
Yeah.

614
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,560
One of those two is on there.

615
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,120
That's cool.

616
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,000
That's cool.

617
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,760
And maybe inside of every 10,000th donut is a ticket

618
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:05,480
and you can exchange that to FaceTime with Billy for one minute

619
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:11,640
because everybody wants to get a touch of this new kind of fame

620
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,920
that's been going around.

621
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,600
A touch of the Eilish.

622
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,960
And that's all, oh that's good.

623
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,480
So that's a good donut.

624
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,680
Is it gonna taste good?

625
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,800
Who the fuck cares?

626
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,320
No, it's ironic.

627
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
Teens are not tasting things these days.

628
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,960
It's about being seen.

629
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,840
They've burned their tongue on all their lattes.

630
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,560
No, I'll tell you what.

631
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,280
I'll tell you what's gonna help get this over

632
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,800
is if we have a promotion with every teacher in every school ever

633
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,840
and like school superintendent, president, all the faculty

634
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,440
that these donuts are not allowed in the school.

635
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,880
Yes, ban them like pogs.

636
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,480
Ban them like pogs.

637
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,840
And more recently, little vapes.

638
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,960
But let's do pogs.

639
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,160
And then these are gonna be so fucking hot.

640
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,280
You're gonna be in the bathroom taking a whiz

641
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,880
and you're gonna hear pop.

642
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,520
And you know that's the donut cap coming off.

643
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,160
And you know somebody's breaking the rules in there.

644
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,440
Oh, that's fucking cool.

645
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,520
That's so fucking cool.

646
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,800
Man, that's a cool donut.

647
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,840
I wish I could eat it.

648
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,320
Also, it's a tech deck.

649
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,160
It's got wheels on it, this donut.

650
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,960
Whoa.

651
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,240
You don't like tech decks.

652
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:21,800
Are you kidding me?

653
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,920
And it's gigantic.

654
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,680
They're so over.

655
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
Tech decks are over.

656
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,360
Tech decks are back.

657
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,160
Minecraft's back.

658
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Fortnite's out.

659
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,640
Vaping is out.

660
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,560
Soap carving is out.

661
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,000
Roller skates are in.

662
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,160
And being not-

663
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,920
I'm gonna try to buy a tech deck right now.

664
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,800
Okay.

665
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,360
How, Griffin, is soap carving in or out?

666
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,280
Soap carving's way in.

667
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,200
Candle making is out.

668
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,700
Damn it.

669
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,480
I like both of those things equally.

670
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,480
Yeah, they're on Amazon.

671
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,960
You're right.

672
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,600
Are they back?

673
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,360
They're back, motherfucker.

674
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,880
Grind one out with your fingers.

675
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:01,800
My cool donut.

676
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,080
Are you buying a tech deck right now?

677
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,240
No, I googled it.

678
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,480
It said, are tech decks worth money?

679
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,000
I mean, they're worth something.

680
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,240
Are you talking about they're collectible?

681
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:22,440
There is a story from as recently as March 14th, 2019, titled, Are Tech Decks Cool Again?

682
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,920
So I guess they are coming back.

683
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,720
Fuck yeah.

684
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,920
There is a chance, yeah.

685
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,200
Instagram fingerboarder SpookyFB said, fingerboards are not toys.

686
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,680
They are professional things.

687
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
They're professional things made of wood.

688
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,480
Big trucks and professional wheels.

689
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,000
Big trucks?

690
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,160
Fingerboards are not toys.

691
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,680
They're professional things made of wood, big trucks and professional wheels.

692
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,280
Are we talking about different things?

693
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,080
This is like the fucking fushigi contact juggling thing again, I bet.

694
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,400
Where we talked about fushigi and a bunch of dope contact jugglers were like,

695
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,160
fushigi is bullshit.

696
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,280
They tried to steal our whole thing and brand it.

697
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,120
And maybe that's how tech deck did.

698
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
You know what I'm saying?

699
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,320
Maybe it's that same situation.

700
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,800
I also am really excited because this video I just opened

701
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,120
starts with a person sitting there with two tiny skateboards in front of them

702
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:30,280
and what appears to be a miniature rail that one might grind upon.

703
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,760
Hey folks at home, this is Griffin.

704
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,480
This is the edit.

705
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,120
I just wanted to hop in here and say that I cut out 45 minutes of us talking about tech decks

706
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,280
and tech tech tech tech technology.

707
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,360
So I'm just going to hop forward and drop you back in at the point where

708
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,560
Justin has just spent $150 on tech tech blind bags.

709
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,600
So here comes that.

710
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,760
I just don't know what I'm going to do.

711
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,040
I mean, I have a family to support.

712
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I can't be doing this just to prove a point.

713
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,520
That was your grocery money for the week, Justin.

714
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,400
To prove a point, I'm going to buy $150.

715
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I'm going to have a lot of fun, sure.

716
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,640
But you can't feed your family with tech techs.

717
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,280
You can.

718
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
Wait, there is one thing I could try.

719
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,480
What's that?

720
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:22,200
We could go to the money zone.

721
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,320
Hey, I did a funny thing on Wonderful with Zip Recruiter this week.

722
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,920
Can I try and do it for you guys?

723
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,320
Sure.

724
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:27,880
Zip it.

725
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,520
Sure.

726
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,080
You remember?

727
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,880
Rachel hated it, but I was like, you can zip it.

728
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,640
Did you say that to your wife a lot?

729
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,000
I always said that to her.

730
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,400
You said that to your wife, who you love?

731
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Yeah, I love her.

732
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:40,920
And she didn't like it.

733
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,160
The mother of your child, your life partner?

734
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,000
Hated it, hated it, hated the thing.

735
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,640
And you know what?

736
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,720
You know who else I don't know if they liked it or not?

737
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,000
Zip Recruiter.

738
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,120
I don't know if they like that heat of me yelling zip it

739
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,920
and have a suckle in my zipple to the love of my life.

740
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,480
I don't know if they like that, but you know what they do like?

741
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,880
Fucking helping you hire good people for your jobs.

742
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,240
That's cool.

743
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,200
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

744
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,640
If you have a job opening and it's hard to hire people

745
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,320
because you have to go through a billion resumes

746
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,080
and check out all of these different job boards

747
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,200
all across the globe and you have to fly to the boards

748
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,360
and it sucks, don't do that anymore.

749
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,440
Zip Recruiter will send your job to over 100

750
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,960
of the web's leading job boards.

751
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,760
And then they use this powerful matching technology

752
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,720
created by the hive mind AI that actually controls

753
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,520
all world governments.

754
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,440
And it scans thousands of resumes to find people

755
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
with the right experience.

756
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,480
And then it invites them to apply for your job.

757
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,480
It is so effective that four out of five employers

758
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate

759
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,080
through the site within the first day.

760
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,240
Right now, our listeners can try Zip Recruiter

761
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,000
for free at this exclusive web address,

762
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,960
ziprecruiter.com slash my brother.

763
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,720
That's ziprecruiter.com slash M-Y-B-R-O-T-H-E-R.

764
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,880
Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire.

765
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,640
I've just had an idea for a superhero

766
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,120
that is Leonardo DiCaprio as himself.

767
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,200
But now he has electricity powers

768
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,320
and I call him Leonardo DiCaprio.

769
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,120
And I would like to promote this new superhero.

770
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,440
And I'm gonna need a web presence to do that.

771
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,520
So I've decided to set up Leonardo DiCaprio.com

772
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,840
using Squarespace.

773
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,320
Hi friends, my name is Justin McElroy

774
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,080
and I'm a podcaster on the popular podcast, Sawbones.

775
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,800
I'm here to talk with you about an important problem

776
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,200
facing the internet today and that's Squarespace.

777
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,040
Squarespace started with the noblest of intentions

778
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
but now enables any idea,

779
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,200
no matter how fucking dumb, to have its own website.

780
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,920
Squarespace randomly and without any sort of background check

781
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,120
will allow anyone to showcase their work,

782
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,600
announce an upcoming event or special project,

783
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,360
even a very stupid one,

784
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,840
or promote their physical or online business

785
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,840
despite the fact that it may be really, really stupid.

786
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,360
Leonardo DiCaprio is free.

787
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,200
They'll let you sell things from their website.

788
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,560
They'll help anyone 24-7.

789
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,480
They've got award-winning customer support

790
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,400
that again does not check for the sort of stability

791
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,280
of your idea, the advisability, anything.

792
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,400
They'll just let anyone make their own website

793
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,240
and I hope that you'll take the chance

794
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,680
to speak out about this to anyone who will listen.

795
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,440
And if you could, please go to squarespace.com

796
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,880
slash my brother.

797
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,560
You can do a free trial

798
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
and then put up a website that's not dumb.

799
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,880
A good one to help counterbalance

800
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,160
some of these real turds that my brother's posting up,

801
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,440
these utter bricks.

802
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,360
Use the offer code my brother

803
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,600
when you're ready to launch and save 10%

804
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,520
off your first purchase of a website or a domain.

805
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,840
Squarespace, they must be stopped.

806
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,640
I purchased it.

807
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,920
Hey folks, this is Griffin, just another edit point here.

808
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,480
Justin and Travis had a really nasty argument

809
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,080
about Leonardo DiCaprio here

810
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
and I didn't want you to hear it

811
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,320
because it lasts a long time

812
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,560
and horrible words were exchanged.

813
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,920
So I'm just going to cut you in

814
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,280
and drop you back in at the point

815
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,600
where Justin now loves Leonardo DiCaprio

816
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,280
and thinks it's the funniest shit in the world.

817
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,240
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

818
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,360
Listen to this.

819
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,560
He loves fast food.

820
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,880
He's the craviator.

821
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,200
Okay?

822
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

823
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,080
Hey, I'm Janet Varney

824
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,680
and like many of you,

825
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,360
some more recent than others,

826
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,360
I used to be a teenager.

827
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,680
In fact, just about all of my friends were too,

828
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,960
including wonderful women like Alison Brie.

829
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm dead center on the balance beam

830
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,800
and this is like a big gym.

831
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,280
All the kids' parents are there watching.

832
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,480
I have to stop, like, you know,

833
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,240
when you have to pee so bad and you can't even move

834
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,600
and then I just go.

835
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,120
I just pee right in the middle of the high back.

836
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,800
So join me every week on the JV Club podcast

837
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,080
where I speak with complicated, funny, messy humans

838
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
as we reminisce about our adolescences

839
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,560
and how they led us to becoming who we are.

840
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,800
Find it every Thursday on Maximum Fun.

841
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,760
Here's another question.

842
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,000
Some drunk lads just peed through

843
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,000
the mail slot of my front door

844
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,960
and into my living room.

845
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,240
I live alone, so opening the door

846
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,400
and confronting them was not worth the life risk.

847
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,960
Very smart.

848
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,960
What door modifications should I make

849
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,360
to ensure this doesn't happen again?

850
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,360
And that's from Camp Pee-tained in Ireland.

851
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,040
Now that I'm reading this,

852
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,520
you know who would be perfect for this

853
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,240
is Jesse Eisenberg.

854
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,280
Let me see if I can get him on the line.

855
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,880
You always just have the right, the perfect person

856
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,320
just at the front of the line.

857
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,520
Bring, bring, bring, bring Deborah, Deborah.

858
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,160
Deborah, he's got a Ray Romano ringtone.

859
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:51,720
It's so strange.

860
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,120
Is that him?

861
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,080
Hey, Jesse.

862
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,200
Yeah, hey, everybody loves me.

863
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,440
Yeah.

864
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,720
Hey, everybody loves Jesse

865
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,800
coming to Crackle this fall.

866
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,840
Jesse from the Art of Self-Defense.

867
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,680
It's such a pleasure to have you here on our show.

868
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,720
I introduced everybody that way

869
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,560
from their next feature film project.

870
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,480
It's really polite.

871
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,880
Yeah, that's how we introduce my family at Thanksgiving.

872
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,680
We just go around the room

873
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,960
and talk about our next feature film.

874
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,000
This is Justin's demo reel

875
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,880
for the next Late Night Host spot.

876
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,200
And so far, I think it's going fucking great.

877
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,440
So Jesse, this listener of ours,

878
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,520
someone peed in their mail slot into the living room

879
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,680
and they didn't want to open the door

880
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,800
so they didn't get beat up.

881
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,520
But they want to,

882
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,480
do you have any ideas for how to keep people

883
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,680
from peeing in your mail slot?

884
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,360
I bet this happens all the time in Hollywood.

885
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,400
This has got to be...

886
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,440
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

887
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,200
It's a major deal over there.

888
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,680
Yes, well, a few things.

889
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,560
The first thing is get an external mailbox.

890
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,360
You know, have it out by the street.

891
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,680
Don't have this kind of immediate access to your house.

892
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,440
The other thing I wanted to say is,

893
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,200
well, first of all, you don't really need mail anymore.

894
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,800
You can do everything paperless, okay?

895
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,280
That should go without saying.

896
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,480
And the third, though, this exact thing happened to me,

897
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,480
but it was not pee.

898
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,240
A guy used to kind of defecate outside my house

899
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,680
in New York City almost nightly.

900
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
And I didn't know what to do.

901
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,840
I knew who it was because I would see him.

902
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,440
I didn't know how to confront him.

903
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,480
So I was so nervous.

904
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,920
And then my friend came over

905
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,320
and we were looking out the window

906
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,840
and I saw that was the guy.

907
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,960
So my friend said, oh, hold on.

908
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,320
I'll go out there and talk to him.

909
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:39,880
I was shocked.

910
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,520
So I watched from the safety of my window

911
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,360
as my friend walked up,

912
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,000
shook this guy's hand and started talking to him.

913
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,080
He was like a homeless guy in the area

914
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,520
and he needed some new shoes.

915
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,880
So my friend came back in my house and said,

916
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,160
hey, do you still have that pair of shoes?

917
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,680
Because I had a pair of shoes that were given to me

918
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,200
because actors sometimes get clothing.

919
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:58,840
I said, I do.

920
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,520
So he brought him the shoes.

921
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,480
They talked for like 15 minutes

922
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,320
and the guy never did again.

923
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
And also my friend was like able to help him out

924
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,680
and met up with him again.

925
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,120
It turned out to be this, you know,

926
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,200
from this kind of scary situation

927
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,520
to this like really beautiful reconciliation

928
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,840
with somebody who I would not have otherwise spoken to.

929
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,200
Jesse, do you find,

930
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,520
cause this is something I find in my day-to-day life.

931
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,680
I find that people who can directly communicate

932
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,320
with other people about issues in their lives

933
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,920
in these sorts of situations

934
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,600
seem to have a sort of superpower

935
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,040
that is unfathomable to me.

936
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,200
The idea that you would just go out and ask the person,

937
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,640
it would be great if you would not do that.

938
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,920
It would be excellent for me.

939
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,640
So this is my best friend, Lee.

940
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,480
He's taught in the juvenile justice system

941
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,800
for kids who are incarcerated for the last like 22 years.

942
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,960
He just celebrated his 22nd year of teaching.

943
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,680
And he has this magical way of speaking with people.

944
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,200
Now this is a guy who's like my level of like social confidence,

945
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,360
which is to say like not soaring.

946
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,680
And yet when it comes to like talking to people

947
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,440
who are in need of some extra help in society,

948
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,960
he is unbelievable.

949
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,200
Like he couldn't even teach in a regular school

950
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,040
because he kind of felt like intimidated by the kids,

951
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,880
but working with incarcerated kids

952
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,280
who are in need of some extra attention, he thrives.

953
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,000
That's amazing.

954
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,600
Now see, this is good because my answer is going to be

955
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,760
put some fake teeth on your mailbox

956
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,440
to make it look like a monster

957
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,600
so people won't put their genitals near it.

958
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,640
But yours is nice.

959
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:27,960
Yeah.

960
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,760
Yours is a nice-

961
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,520
Yeah, my answer is better.

962
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

963
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,920
So just to summarize, the answers,

964
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,520
the advice here is exterior mailbox

965
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,120
because nobody can pee in that.

966
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,600
And then I think the mail slot in the door

967
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,320
is just that era is over.

968
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,520
Doors are there for a reason.

969
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,680
We can't put fucking holes in them.

970
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,160
That's the fortress gate.

971
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,960
And then the third thing is when some drunk lads come

972
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,640
and pee right into your house,

973
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,800
the first thing is pay it forward right then and there.

974
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,200
That's right.

975
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,120
You have to have an extra pair of shoes on hand.

976
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,080
That's important.

977
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,200
Jesse, I'd like to talk about your new movie, Art of Soul Defense.

978
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,320
We've all watched it,

979
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,720
which I know people in these sorts of situations

980
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,680
are always supposed to say, but we really did.

981
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,480
We actually did.

982
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:15,960
Okay.

983
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,120
We really did because we talked about it afterwards

984
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,600
and we just adored it.

985
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,640
It kind of reminded me of the first thing I ever saw you in,

986
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,240
which was Roger Dodger,

987
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,560
which was in and of itself sort of this exploration

988
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,480
of masculinity.

989
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,320
It's about an uncle teaching his nephew

990
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,960
how to, quote, be a man, unquote.

991
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,320
And I would say it subverts it towards the end somewhat,

992
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,240
but I think in the Art of Self-Defense-

993
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,840
It gets into the underlying sadness.

994
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,200
Yeah, it gets into the sadness of it.

995
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,080
I feel like this is a much harder subversion

996
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,640
of the idea of masculinity.

997
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,080
Yes.

998
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:55,320
Wow.

999
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,120
And thank you for putting my oeuvre into context.

1000
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,040
I actually never thought about it that way,

1001
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,320
but you're exactly right.

1002
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,440
It does, yeah, that other movie, Roger Dodger,

1003
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,920
is kind of like a naturalistic kind of funny drama about that,

1004
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,520
whereas this movie is like this very subversive,

1005
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,680
harsh, blunt kind of take on a kind of commentary

1006
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,640
on masculinity.

1007
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,720
I mean, the movie is hysterically funny,

1008
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:27,160
but also displays men talking about masculinity

1009
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,680
in such absurd ways.

1010
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,440
I feel like it almost has to be as sort of outlandish

1011
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,760
and nearly surreal as it is,

1012
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,960
just so the people that took Fight Club seriously

1013
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,000
don't watch it and be like,

1014
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,040
yeah, this is good.

1015
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,240
I'm loving this.

1016
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,800
This is a live fact.

1017
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,680
That's exactly how I should act.

1018
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,800
This is the way I want to go.

1019
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:47,560
Right.

1020
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,120
I'd be really surprised if somebody took it

1021
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,280
as a kind of sincere how-to guide on masculinity.

1022
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,040
Jesse, it's 2019, bud.

1023
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,880
Yeah, so much is happening.

1024
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,840
For sure.

1025
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,000
All that smart stuff's real cool, and I get it,

1026
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,160
and it's good, and it makes the movie good.

1027
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,440
But like, also, dude, just some badass fights in here.

1028
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,480
You kick some, dude, Jesse, Jesse, bud,

1029
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,800
you kick some major tush in this one, man.

1030
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1031
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,000
Thank you for censoring yourself right at the end there.

1032
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,720
Yeah, yeah.

1033
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,200
We have like some, it's a martial arts movie,

1034
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,240
so there's like amazing,

1035
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,920
and we also have like some of the best martial artists

1036
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,680
in the world like acting in the movie

1037
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,160
who also like happen to be actors.

1038
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,840
And so there's some amazing stuff,

1039
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,520
but we were kind of just like shocked every day

1040
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,880
that these people can do this.

1041
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,680
I was watching like Cirque du Soleil

1042
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,400
in front of you every day.

1043
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,240
Oh yeah, that's radical.

1044
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,600
Jesse, as you certainly know,

1045
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,160
I am a blue belt in Tae Kwon Do,

1046
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,800
and I have to say it is unnerving the extent

1047
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,160
to which a lot of your experience,

1048
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,640
especially in the early parts of the film,

1049
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,200
not so much later as the story unfolds,

1050
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,360
but like certainly early on,

1051
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,080
it did reflect some of my experience

1052
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,440
walking into a martial arts class.

1053
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,960
How method did you go for this?

1054
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,200
Did you go take some classes

1055
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,440
and try to experience that for yourself at all?

1056
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,720
Yeah, I had like very strict classes for the movie

1057
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,200
because karate in general

1058
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,120
is just much more strict than I'm used to.

1059
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,280
I was like broken down after 20 minutes.

1060
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,120
I mean, it was just incredibly rigorous.

1061
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,640
And then I'm only a yellow belt in the movie,

1062
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,600
which I kept trying to tell her,

1063
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,440
you don't understand, I'm not supposed to be that good.

1064
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,080
But she was so intent on making us as good as possible

1065
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:27,960
that it was exhausting.

1066
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,320
The only difference in my experience

1067
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,720
was that I did have to fight the kids.

1068
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,240
I had to spar against the...

1069
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,400
There was not an adult white belt class.

1070
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,400
The adult white belts fought the child white belts,

1071
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,840
so I would spar against children.

1072
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,040
Wait, really?

1073
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,920
It's the worst possible scenario

1074
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,720
because the kids just kick you in the nuts.

1075
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,320
It's the only move they know it works 100% of the time.

1076
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,720
And there's not a reality of what you could be like,

1077
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,880
you know what, I'm gonna punch this kid in the face.

1078
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I wanna give him one good slug.

1079
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,800
You can't, it's simply not doable.

1080
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,320
It's a terrible fight to be in.

1081
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,240
This is such a surreal experience to talk to you guys.

1082
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,480
It feels like one person is interrupting himself.

1083
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,600
It's such a surreal experience.

1084
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,880
You've discovered the joke,

1085
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,600
the entire conceit of our podcast.

1086
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,040
Jesse, this film, The Art of Self-Defense,

1087
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,080
it will be in limited release July 12th

1088
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,200
and then wider release on July 19th.

1089
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,720
Do you think people should see it?

1090
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1091
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,040
I mean, this is like my favorite project I've gotten to do,

1092
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,960
so I'm so happy I got to do it.

1093
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,880
And the reaction to it has been

1094
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,760
kind of beyond what we could have imagined.

1095
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,440
It was like a kind of modest movie

1096
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,080
that is now, by virtue of the movie being really good,

1097
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,600
but also by virtue of people talking about masculinity

1098
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,920
in the same way the movie talks about it,

1099
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,040
it feels like it has some relevant thing to say.

1100
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,640
It is a rollercoaster of a film.

1101
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,160
Travis was texting me like,

1102
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,760
holy shit, I said, did you finish it?

1103
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,480
He said, no, I got about 30 minutes until the end.

1104
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,360
I was like, you have absolutely no frame of reference

1105
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:07,000
for how wild things are getting.

1106
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,680
So Jesse Eisenberg, thank you so much

1107
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,280
for coming onto our podcast.

1108
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,120
We really appreciate it.

1109
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:11,960
No, thank you.

1110
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,800
Thank you so much for having me.

1111
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,920
How about a Yahoo?

1112
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,720
Yeah.

1113
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,200
Okay, this one is from several people sent this in.

1114
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,960
Thanks, it's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1115
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,760
who I'm gonna call Leonardo Zapprio.

1116
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,600
Who asks, how do I tell my hermit crabs apart?

1117
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,320
I got two hermit crabs around the same size

1118
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,000
with similar shells, but I can't name them

1119
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,200
because I can't tell them apart.

1120
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,280
Paint them.

1121
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,360
Paint them cool colors.

1122
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,080
The shell part or the skin part?

1123
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,920
I mean, the shell part, right?

1124
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,720
That's gotta be-

1125
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,640
But they can change shells, can't they?

1126
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,360
That's a good point.

1127
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,480
They can swap on you.

1128
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,960
You thought you were going on a date with me,

1129
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,840
but actually you're going on a date with Paul, the crab.

1130
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,480
We switched.

1131
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:57,720
Sorry, Rince.

1132
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:00,600
That's the name.

1133
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,640
That name is Rince?

1134
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:04,600
The name of the character is Rince, R-E-N-C-E, Rince.

1135
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,080
Okay, cool.

1136
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,440
He sounded like a hermit crab owner.

1137
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,200
He would wanna date his hermit crabs.

1138
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,600
Yeah, I mean, can you get a witch or wizard

1139
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,960
to turn you into a hermit crab

1140
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,360
and get to know these things a little bit better?

1141
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,080
You know what I mean?

1142
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,640
Thank you.

1143
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,040
Get in.

1144
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,120
You could hear their laugh and know them apart instantly.

1145
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,960
Yeah, get to know their mannerisms.

1146
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,920
Like, oh, he's being a little standoffish.

1147
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,840
That must be Rince, too.

1148
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,800
Rince Jr., my son.

1149
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,320
That must be Rince Jr.

1150
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:34,040
He's the one who prefers romantic comedies

1151
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,120
where Paul likes comedies that have an element of romance to them.

1152
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,960
Yeah, that's how I tell them apart.

1153
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,960
Hermit crab's a strange pet, yes?

1154
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,480
It is, it is.

1155
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,640
Good if you have too many bugs lying around.

1156
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,520
Do they love these things?

1157
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,280
But they love bugs.

1158
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,880
That's what they eat, are bugs.

1159
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,760
Or maybe leaves?

1160
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,080
Hermit crabs on leaves, huh?

1161
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,160
Alexa, what do hermit crabs eat?

1162
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,360
They eat high quality commercial hermit crab food.

1163
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,120
That's not at all helpful.

1164
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,640
Okay, there's vegetables and non-citrus fruits.

1165
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,080
Mangoes, spinach, carrot, coconut, papaya as treats.

1166
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,960
Oh, cool, cool.

1167
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,920
Yeah, this is turning into sort of a hermit crab

1168
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,640
caretaking podcast a little bit.

1169
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,040
Not so much one with jokes anymore.

1170
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,000
How about like 100%, not a caretaking podcast,

1171
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,720
how about 100% complete guide to hermit crab ownership?

1172
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,840
I'm done now.

1173
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,280
They're seashells that come to life and eat the coconut

1174
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,840
that you leave them, end of story.

1175
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,080
They are magical wish pets.

1176
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:42,360
Yeah, I think you probably have to get rid of one of them.

1177
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,120
If you can't tell them-

1178
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:44,440
Why?

1179
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,160
Well, because you can't have two identical hermit crabs.

1180
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,160
And to be fair, it's a lot of responsibility.

1181
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,440
Two hermit crabs?

1182
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,680
A hermit crab, first of all, is like totally fine

1183
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,680
if you just set it outside and say like, go with God.

1184
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,640
Like they will find their way.

1185
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,440
They can eat all, apparently all vegetables,

1186
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,600
all non citrus fruits and all bugs.

1187
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,360
So like they're gonna find their way downtown.

1188
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,000
Don't worry about it.

1189
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,600
Something, you know, a big predator comes in,

1190
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,880
what, oops, my hard shell can't get in there.

1191
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,200
Wait, what are they going downtown for, Griffin?

1192
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,560
You know, finding love in the big city.

1193
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,080
But anyway, you can't have two identical hermit crabs.

1194
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,760
That's like having two dishwashers.

1195
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,040
It doesn't make any sense at all.

1196
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,560
Do you guys wanna know the red flags of owning a hermit crab?

1197
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,320
The things that really should make you sit up

1198
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,600
and call your veterinarian and say,

1199
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,440
hey, I got a real hermit crab emergency.

1200
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
I don't think I'll ever need to know this information,

1201
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,080
but now that I've said that, I will need it at some point

1202
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,680
and feel like a real dickhead.

1203
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,040
The first one is lethargy.

1204
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,840
You know, this hermit crab used to have a lot of get up and go.

1205
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,760
Yeah, now he's dragon ass, he must be dying.

1206
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,880
The second one is abandoned shell and doesn't return.

1207
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,400
Which, yeah, I would think that would be a huge

1208
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,040
red flag since they don't even have an ass,

1209
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,000
as far as I know.

1210
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,800
And they're just gonna crawl around same shell.

1211
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,480
They have no ass.

1212
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,240
Here's the last one that they have listed here

1213
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,600
at the Petco website.

1214
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,040
Loss of limbs.

1215
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,600
No shit.

1216
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:11,800
Yeah, these are not good tips.

1217
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,160
Really, loss of limbs is a problem.

1218
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,680
What are the signs that they're about to become lethargic

1219
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,040
and run away and lose their limbs?

1220
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,320
Because I need to know the step before that step, ideally.

1221
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,920
There is no warning before that.

1222
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,360
They just seem chill and happy and then they'll abandon

1223
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,000
their shells.

1224
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,040
That's life, huh?

1225
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,600
I guess, I guess in a way, Griffin, I guess it is.

1226
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,520
Hey, I want to do another Yahoo.

1227
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,000
Is that okay?

1228
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:36,840
Sure.

1229
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,480
Evan sent it in.

1230
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,280
It's Yahoo Answers user joez51 who asks,

1231
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,200
a hair salon used my cut hair for a wig.

1232
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,240
If they sold it without telling me, is that legal?

1233
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:48,780
Huh?

1234
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,240
Ooh, okay.

1235
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:51,800
Would you know?

1236
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,440
You're walking around downtown looking for love in the big city

1237
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,600
and you turn the corner and who greets you?

1238
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,680
Ah, it's, how can you be me?

1239
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,480
I'm me.

1240
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,800
But no, it's just your hair on someone else's head

1241
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,440
because you got, your shit got wigged.

1242
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,120
I would definitely know and I would definitely love it.

1243
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,480
I would love it too and I would definitely know

1244
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,680
if it was Travis's.

1245
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,640
And I think I could honestly tell if it's Justin's.

1246
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,880
My hair is the most nondescript bullshit.

1247
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,960
Like, my hair is just like, it's just in the dictionary.

1248
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,280
It says hair, it's not fun.

1249
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,320
This is hair.

1250
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:25,800
This is hair.

1251
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,240
This is the default choice on the character creator.

1252
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,880
When you turn it on.

1253
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,400
I don't know, there's some hair.

1254
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,160
You know how on all the Bethesda games,

1255
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,960
like the hair just looks like hair

1256
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,480
and there's not much character or excitement to it,

1257
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,280
but you can make your dude have hair?

1258
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,200
That's kind of what I'm dealing with.

1259
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,280
And I don't think that it's going to be recognized.

1260
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,200
And I don't think that it's going to be recognizable

1261
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,080
in any way.

1262
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,640
Yeah, who knows how the hair in video games

1263
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,680
when you're in the character creator

1264
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,680
always seems to be floating like a half an inch

1265
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,800
off their head.

1266
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,760
That's kind of like Griffin.

1267
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,600
If Griffin turns his head too fast,

1268
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,560
his hair doesn't keep up.

1269
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,040
It's true.

1270
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,640
So would you, but if you saw your hair, Justin,

1271
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,480
on the street, on someone else's head,

1272
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,120
what'd you do?

1273
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,760
This person knows.

1274
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,640
Like they're for sure that they saw their hair on a wig.

1275
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,400
The question is who has the legal ownership of that hair?

1276
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:20,680
My argument would be if at the end of your hair cutting,

1277
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,440
you don't get down on your hands and knees

1278
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,280
and scoop it all into a Kroger bag.

1279
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:24,760
Right.

1280
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:30,840
And that is then the legal property of the barber.

1281
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,640
Yeah, once it's off your body, man, that's trash.

1282
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,960
And another man's trash is another man's treasure

1283
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,920
is another man's wig.

1284
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,960
That's what they say.

1285
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,800
It used to be one of my favorite prank calls

1286
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,480
when I was in college to call barbershops

1287
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,160
to ask if I could come by and collect all the hair

1288
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,480
for an entire day to keep deer out of my vegetable garden

1289
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,920
because I had read that that worked.

1290
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,640
And it was a very pleasant, there's no punchline to it.

1291
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,320
It was just a pleasant conversation

1292
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,040
where I would try to see if they would let me come in

1293
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,480
and scoop up all the hair.

1294
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:07,640
Cool, man.

1295
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,240
And what did they say, Justin?

1296
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,560
You've got me on the hook, reel me in.

1297
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,240
They wouldn't let you from when I,

1298
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,080
a lot of them wouldn't let you.

1299
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,880
One guy did suggest that I add a little lime in there.

1300
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,920
I remember him saying that.

1301
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,760
Maybe if you add a little lime,

1302
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,960
that would probably work pretty good to keep the deer out.

1303
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,080
Do you think that he meant like the fruit?

1304
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,120
Yeah, probably.

1305
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:28,600
I don't know.

1306
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,040
Mix some fruit in your human hair.

1307
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,520
I don't have it.

1308
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,480
I didn't have a real deer problem, actually.

1309
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,160
Yeah, Travis, it was a funny sketch.

1310
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,240
A funny sketch like Mad TV.

1311
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,240
That's how Mad TV found me, actually.

1312
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,400
I actually called the Mad TV barber

1313
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,320
and he said, I've got to get you in

1314
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,960
with Alfred E. Newman and the whole gang.

1315
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,360
Hair donation is a thing.

1316
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:49,400
It's cool, right?

1317
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,720
And that's a nice thing to do.

1318
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,760
I just can't wrap my mind around,

1319
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,800
at what point does the hair stop being mine?

1320
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:03,560
Because is all the hair on my head fucking forfeit

1321
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,480
from the moment I walk into the barbershop?

1322
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,480
I think you have a window before they scoop it up.

1323
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,360
That's what I'm saying.

1324
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,640
You have a window.

1325
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,280
If their broom touches it, it's theirs.

1326
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,520
Oh, if you can, no, how about this?

1327
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,080
If it touches the floor, it's theirs.

1328
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,680
So now it's like you're in one of those

1329
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,640
money whirlwind machines at the mall.

1330
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:26,040
And it's like, they're buzzing it, buzzing it fast.

1331
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,960
And you're like reaching out with your fucking

1332
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,200
great dexterity, snatching all the hair up

1333
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,040
and putting it right in your big pocket

1334
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,640
or your fanny pack that you've got.

1335
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,760
Then they see what you're doing,

1336
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,560
start trimming it even faster because they, you know,

1337
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,560
they want to get some of that fucking hair.

1338
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,600
That's where the money is.

1339
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,480
Hello, my name is Travis McElroy,

1340
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,160
and I'm here to pitch an invention to you this evening.

1341
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,640
It's like an umbrella, but it's upside down

1342
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,400
and it fits around your head.

1343
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,240
And then when it cuts the hair, it catches in the umbrella,

1344
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,240
and then you just walk right out with it.

1345
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,640
I need $8 billion.

1346
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,520
Yeah, yeah, to turn some umbrellas upside down

1347
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,160
and punch holes in them without losing the sort of

1348
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:08,760
umbrella-ness of the machinery inside.

1349
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,840
That's what I love the most about that, Travis,

1350
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:14,440
is that you're going to have your own dead ass hair

1351
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,280
all over your mouth, chin, and nose for a bit there.

1352
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,960
Yes, but it'll be worth it to know

1353
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,280
where my hair is at all times.

1354
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,760
Hi, I'm Travis McElroy, and I've invented

1355
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,280
the 360 degree full wrap around beard.

1356
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,160
This, you're going to wear this motherfucker

1357
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,080
like a necklace, but it's a beard.

1358
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:39,880
Only loose, and awful, and no food.

1359
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,800
No food, forget about food.

1360
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,640
I feel like we set a record for introducing ourselves

1361
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,480
and each other on this episode.

1362
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,880
I feel like this is probably number one

1363
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,520
in terms of introductions.

1364
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,800
Folks, that's going to do it for us.

1365
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,440
Thank you so much for listening to the program.

1366
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,320
I want to say a huge thank you to

1367
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,480
Jesse Eisenberg.

1368
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,560
Holy shit, that's wild.

1369
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,360
Yeah, that was fun.

1370
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,440
Go see The Art of Self-Defense,

1371
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,200
and you can see that, I guess, in theaters.

1372
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,440
I don't actually know, I should've checked on that.

1373
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,000
That's going to be in theaters,

1374
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,680
select theaters July 12th, everywhere July 19th,

1375
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,440
The Art of Self-Defense.

1376
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:30,600
Go check it totally out.

1377
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,120
Thank you to, gosh, John Roderick in The Long Winters

1378
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,720
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1379
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,400
off the album Putting the Days to Bed.

1380
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,840
Cool track, cool track, man.

1381
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,080
And thank you to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1382
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,280
They have a bunch of great shows

1383
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,720
like Beef and Dairy Network, and Reading Glasses,

1384
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,240
and Switchblade Sisters.

1385
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,600
Check them out, MaximumFun.org,

1386
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,680
and we have a bunch of other stuff at McElroy.Family,

1387
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,960
including a new Monster Factory episode

1388
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,560
that I think is really fun.

1389
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,840
It's really funny.

1390
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,880
We played a game called Bless,

1391
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:03,880
and holy shit, it turned out wild.

1392
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,760
And we have a bunch of new merch, too,

1393
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,640
including new Monster Factory merch for the first time.

1394
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,320
Very true.

1395
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,000
All right, folks, that's going to do it for us.

1396
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,760
Griffin, do you have a final Yahoo to kind of take us out on?

1397
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,560
Yes, let's load that up right now.

1398
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,240
This is sent in by Merritt Palmer.

1399
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,720
Thank you, Merritt.

1400
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,360
It's Yahoo Answers user Lamberto, who asks,

1401
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,960
did you cry when your plumber died?

1402
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,160
My name is Justin McElroy.

1403
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,200
Travis McElroy.

1404
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1405
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,080
This has been my brother, my brother.

1406
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:54,760
And may you kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1407
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,880
Maximumfun.org.

1408
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,920
Comedy and culture.

1409
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,040
Artist-owned.

1410
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,080
Listener-supported.

1411
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,640
Listen, we already know that you love genre movies,

1412
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,560
film craft, and female filmmakers.

1413
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,000
So if you love all those things, then by transitive property,

1414
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,240
you love my podcast, Switchblade Sisters.

1415
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,760
Hi, I'm film critic April Wolfe.

1416
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,200
Every week, I have a conversation

1417
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,560
with a different female filmmaker

1418
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,920
about their favorite genre film.

1419
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,920
Each episode covers the filmmaking process,

1420
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,080
working in the film industry, and just, like,

1421
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,160
general geeking out about awesome movies.

1422
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,480
I've had such great guests like the big sick writer Emily

1423
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:29,960
Gordon.

1424
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,800
To me, indie movies, as of late,

1425
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,640
have come to be a catchphrase.

1426
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,960
Have come to be a catch-all term for a movie that

1427
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,720
kind of defies genre.

1428
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,120
Billy Madison and half-fake director Tamra Davis.

1429
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,680
When a comedian comes and enters onto my set,

1430
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:45,000
they're just there to be funny.

1431
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,640
And we're all ready and waiting for them to be funny.

1432
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,200
Horror industry veteran and actor Barbara Crampton.

1433
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,120
That's where real drama lies for me.

1434
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,240
What's between you and I speaking right now?

1435
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,240
Where are we meeting?

1436
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,560
And what's the energy that we create between us?

1437
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,760
And so many others.

1438
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,920
So check out Switchblade Sisters every Thursday

1439
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:09,400
