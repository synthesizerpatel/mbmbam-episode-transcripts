1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:49,200
Monday, back where we belong. Monday, Monday.

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,240
For those tuning in that didn't hear all the pre-pro we just did, this is our third take

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,040
at kicking off this show. Griffin, can you recap for me the last two takes?

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
The first one was a botched attempt to make a joke about Earth Hour,

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
and the second one was a far too soon joke about the passing of Elizabeth Taylor.

10
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
It wasn't a joke, it was so immoral.

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,840
What kind of show is this? I checked on iTunes and it said comedy.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,240
I was laughing. This is My Brother, My Brother Meets an Advice show for the modern era. We take

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,480
your questions and we turn them into wisdom. My name is Justin McElroy, I'm your oldest brother.

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
My name is Travis McElroy and I'm your middlest brother.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:40,000
My name is Griffin McElroy and I'm the baby. You're adorable, just couldn't be cuter.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Pinch these cheeks.

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,120
Let's get right into it. Hey question, is it acceptable to secretly eat my roommate's

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Hot Pockets if I do more than my fair share of the household chores? Thanks for your help.

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,640
Always hungry.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,600
I like that she lives in an economy where like work equals Hot Pockets. I did a lot of work,

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,440
that's about two and a half Hot Pockets. Travis, can you explain to me why

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,560
you assume this Hot Pocket burglar is female? How did you make that joke?

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,600
I don't know, it's like in Spanish where certain words have like an inherent

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,360
second order, that's what this is.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
And you're saying, you're saying it's Hot Pockets, right?

26
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,200
Hot Pockets is the, I don't get that at all.

28
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,520
Is Hot Pockets what gets, are you saying, are you saying women are, are genetically

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,040
steal Hot Pockets, just steal?

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,360
I forgot that Travis also refers to vaginas as Hot Pockets.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,800
Almost exclusively.

32
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,600
Don't get me started on lean pockets.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,840
When I, when I scanned this question, I read it as my mommy's Hot Pockets.

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,880
It was way better.

35
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,040
Mommy's Hot Pockets tastes the best.

36
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,480
Here's the thing, if you live with this person and I'm, I'm, I understand your relationship

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,800
just by reading this question, like you can tell the, the tenor of, of this relationship.

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,160
How could you possibly, he, he is overworked and the other person

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,720
has a surplus of Hot Pockets that he may not notice?

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,520
No, no, no, no.

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,120
That old chestnut.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,320
You gotta get deep, I, I do more than my fair share of the household chores that, that the,

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,680
the anger, uh, the, the vitriol is there.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,720
It's present.

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
And I gotta tell you, if you have that kind of relationship, your roommate already thinks

46
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
you're eating the Hot Pockets.

47
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,920
Oh, they do.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Whether you are or not.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
Make the punishment fit the crime at least.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,680
Get up on the Hot Pockets.

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,720
Eat her, her what?

53
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,000
Her breakfast pastries?

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Her toaster strudels?

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh man.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,160
If someone ate my last strudel, I would be pretty, pretty PO.

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,480
What if they ate the icing, but left the strudel?

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,320
What am I supposed to do with this?

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
What am I supposed to do with this fruit plank?

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,200
Get it out of here.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,320
I can't get this plank in the garbage disposal.

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
Deborah, go clean up the garbage disposal for once.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
I think, what do they say about like alcoholism and it's like, it's not alcoholism unless

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,400
you're secretly doing it.

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,240
I think once you get, reach a point in your life where you're secretly jammed, like very,

66
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,480
very, uh, discreetly slam jam in Hot Pockets, like you've reached a point where you need

67
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,280
help, I think.

68
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,960
Yeah, that's a good point.

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:24,400
The first step in admitting you have Hot Pocket abuse is admitting you have Hot Pocket abuse.

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,920
It's really the only step too.

71
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,520
Wait, are you saying they should, they should do this in public?

72
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
Like just wait till your roommate's in the living room and then just loudly-

73
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
How is your roommate going to learn?

74
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
Because your roommate's not going to learn anything if you just slam jam while they're

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,480
not there and also-

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,920
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.

77
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm slam jamming your Hot Pockets.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,480
Yeah, he's like, um, Martin, uh, I asked you to carry the trash out and you didn't.

79
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,080
So now watch me eat this.

80
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
This was yours.

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,760
You need to feel it.

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,480
Don't blame me.

83
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,600
I have a disease.

84
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,960
I have a disease.

85
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,920
It's Hot Pockets.

86
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,680
They are delicious though.

87
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,560
Who can-

88
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Is there a flavor dependency here?

89
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,640
Like is it, are there some flavors that's acceptable?

90
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,800
Like for me, if you got meatballs and mozzarella, it might as well, it might as well be stolen

91
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
already.

92
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,560
I recently moved cross country from Michigan to Texas.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
I left my friends and family and go live with a person I've never met.

94
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Which brings me to my question, which I feel only you brothers can answer.

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,240
When telling you where I'm from at the end of the email, do I tell you where I currently

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,160
am or where I'm originally from?

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
Thanks, Jim from-

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
Oh God, I don't know yet.

99
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,400
Um, I think when we ask people to do that, to, to name their locale at the end of the

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,880
question, it's, it's mainly for like a census.

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
It's, it's mainly so we get a good idea-

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,440
Not for tracking purposes.

103
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,800
No, we're not going to hunt you down, but I, we would like to know the, the cultural

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
smattering of this great country or world of ours because we're international.

105
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,600
Right.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,640
Internationally known.

107
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,960
This is a good question though, because someone was telling me a story the other day that

108
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,360
they worked with this person who said that they were from Long Island, New York.

109
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,440
And they had lived there to the age of two and then moved somewhere else.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,920
Bad news.

111
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,840
You were not.

112
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,640
It's not where, where were you conceived?

113
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
Like that's not it.

114
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,760
No, that's not it whatsoever.

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,040
That's not even close to it.

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,240
I think that the most important thing is which one sounds funnier with whatever the

117
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
problem is that you have.

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,600
Like if you, if you're originally from some place that rhymes with my roommate smells

119
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,640
bad and your question is about how your roommate smells, then I think you go with that one.

120
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,880
I think it's all about, it's all about alliteration is the number one issue here.

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
I think he's the bigger question.

122
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,160
The bigger issue here is where do you say you are from in general?

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
Well, in general, just like in life and stuff.

124
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
I grew up in West Virginia.

125
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
I went to school in Oklahoma and now I live in Cincinnati.

126
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,160
Where the hell am I from?

127
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
Well, you're West Virginia.

128
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,200
You're a citizen of the world.

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm in Cincinnati now.

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,960
So like I'm, I might be from West Virginia, but when I meet people outside of Cincinnati

131
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,360
and they ask where I'm from, do I still say West Virginia?

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Travis, when I go to King's Island and people ask where I'm from, I'll say King's Island.

133
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm here now.

134
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
Look at me.

135
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,240
Well, if you lived at King's Island though, wouldn't you?

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,160
Like if you took up residence in King's Island, if you lived in the Tomb Raider ride.

137
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
If you guys had, yeah, I was, God damn, Travis, you're in my mind.

138
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
I was about to ask which ride you guys wanted to be on so I could say Tomb Raider.

139
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,160
Cause it's obviously the best one to build a residence.

140
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
Tomb Raider's gone.

141
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,480
Is it really?

142
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah.

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,080
They no longer have the affiliation with Paramount.

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,000
They gutted it, but it's still a ride.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080
It's just like the most boring ride.

146
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,160
Swing chairs, the ride, the adventure.

147
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,200
I think that whatever place you lived in the longest is your, is your, where you're from.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,800
I hate, I fucking hate it when people are like, yeah, I just got back from Jamaica.

149
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
Uh, I'm Jamaican now.

150
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,680
It's like, I'm pretty sure you can't just do that.

151
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,840
I'm pretty sure no one does that.

152
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,800
I don't think that happens.

153
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
I know nine or 10 people who came back with dreads and steel drums and they're like, this

154
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,360
is who I am now.

155
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,760
Love it.

156
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,560
They're like, listen to the sound, feel the sound of the steel drum.

157
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,280
Feel this rhythm.

158
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I'm from Jamaica. I can feel it. You can listen to this rhythm, but I don't think you can

159
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
hear this rhythm.

160
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
Does that make sense?

161
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,600
Cause you're not from, from the islands.

162
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Hey, hey, it's a Jamaica thing.

163
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,280
If you're not from, if you're not from sunny high maker, just get out of here.

164
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,960
You wouldn't get it bald head.

165
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't understand.

166
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,560
Uh, Hey, listen, I, I, uh, I want to hear a Yahoo answer from Griffin.

167
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,120
Oh, okay.

168
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm from Jamaica.

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,800
I'm from Jamaica.

170
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,360
I'm from Griffin. Oh, okay.

171
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Let me do that for you.

172
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,320
We, uh, we have access, uh, we pay a subscription fee to the Yahoo answer service.

173
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,360
It's pricey.

174
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,920
It is rich, but you're, it's worth it.

175
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,920
So we can find a random strangers questions there and try to, uh, help them make fun of

176
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,280
them and help them, help them, help them.

177
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
Um, let's help this person.

178
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,600
This one was sent in by Gali Ayali.

179
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,200
Thank you, Gali Ayali.

180
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
It's by Yahoo answers user oxymoron.

181
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
I like a nice lemongrass.

182
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Gali Ayali.

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,840
You ever have that?

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
It's my very favorite.

185
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,400
Uh, oxymoron asks, would it be disrespectful to bring birthday cake to someone's funeral?

186
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,920
Well, gosh, like only in the way that that's exactly not the thing.

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,040
Are there additional details where it just happens to work out that

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,920
it's a funeral for someone who's also it's their birthday?

189
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,480
Okay.

190
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
No, but that's like the saddest thing I've ever heard.

191
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,160
That is really depressing.

192
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,280
Blow these candles out.

193
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,480
You can't, no breath.

194
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,160
Push his, push his tongue.

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
Maybe there's one more breath in there.

196
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,720
We could use the last one.

197
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,440
Make a wish.

198
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,200
I bet I know what you're going to wish for.

199
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,760
There's no gift.

200
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,160
You can get somebody who's dead that isn't insensitive unless it's like, unless it's

201
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
an extra pillow, a pillow.

202
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,160
Yeah.

203
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,880
That's about it.

204
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,560
Um, sunglasses, a weekend at Bernie's.

205
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
Thank you, Travis.

206
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:25,360
I don't, I mean, but think about it this way.

207
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
Those people at that funeral, they're so sad.

208
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,640
They're so sad.

209
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,440
And what, what makes you happier than anything in the world?

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,520
Then when somebody is like, Hey, there's cake.

211
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,360
The question is where you put it at a funeral.

212
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,640
Cause you got the line, right?

213
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,000
Going to the coffin, obviously.

214
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:44,960
I don't know.

215
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,160
It might be kind of a jam to put it at like the foot of the coffin, like resting on the

216
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,400
top.

217
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,240
Cause I'm like, they say their tearful goodbyes, uh, but then like there's cake like instantly

218
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
afterwards.

219
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,600
Yeah.

220
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,280
And you can't let it, uh, you can't put it on the other side of the room because people

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,040
spend the whole day, like come up with excuses to not be near the casket.

222
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,480
The way, Oh gosh, that cake.

223
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,240
I got to just get over there.

224
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,040
Whatever you do, just be really, um, delicate and sensitive in the decorating of the cake.

225
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah.

226
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,040
You might.

227
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,320
So what do you, what do you think?

228
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
Race car, obviously.

229
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
Cause it's a race car is fine.

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,280
Um, I would avoid a zombie themed cake.

231
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,560
No zombie themed cake.

232
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,560
A dragon is good.

233
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,640
Maybe like a Phoenix would be appropriate.

234
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,360
Oh yeah.

235
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,080
Sort of emerging, especially if they're being cremated.

236
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,000
Who boy, that would really get them.

237
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,280
You probably shouldn't write on the cake.

238
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
You're not one year older.

239
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,120
You're one year closer to death because they already done.

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,640
They already done hit that.

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
They are actually one year further from death.

242
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
Like they're getting actually further from it.

243
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Negative one year.

244
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah.

245
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,920
This is my negative first birthday.

246
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,080
It's, it's pretty cool.

247
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,240
I can't wait till my negative 16th birthday so I can buy smokes and porn in the, in the

248
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,840
afterlife and afterlife.

249
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah.

250
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,360
Afterlife smokes.

251
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey, I got a question for you.

252
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,320
How do I incorporate a quirk into my personality?

253
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,840
I work at an advertising agency, a naturally quirky environment, but I don't know how to

254
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,240
start acting thing, start acting quirky.

255
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,600
What if I wanted to be the guy who works barefoot?

256
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
What if I wanted to be the guy who exclusively started wearing neon t-shirts?

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,600
I feel like certain people can get away with these things and certain people can't.

258
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,840
How do I become one who can Nathan?

259
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,920
Nathan, I have a suggestion.

260
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Maybe your quirk should be the guy who never says quirk.

261
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,720
Can you do that for me as like a step one?

262
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
You got it.

263
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
The, the thing is with so many things in life, the answer is one word and that's commitment.

264
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,480
You gotta, if you're not going to wear shoes at work, if it gets cold in the office, you

265
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,000
gotta still, you're still no shoes.

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
Nathan got me.

267
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,440
No shoes.

268
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,960
Nathan can't pack up on that.

269
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,720
And you got, if you wear neon t-shirts, you're neon Nathan that don't change.

270
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,760
You've got to commit.

271
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Neon Nathan is good because then if you become like a professional athlete, then that name

272
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
will carry over quite well.

273
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,080
I imagine.

274
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,120
Yeah, I, I would like to give some advice to everybody who's looking to pick up a quirk

275
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,120
and all those kids who want to define their personality by coming up with something.

276
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,960
If you want to decide if you're the type of person who can think about if you're the type

277
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,200
of person who does, and if you don't already do it, don't start doing it.

278
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
If you are a person who already does a weird thing, keep up with it.

279
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,240
Don't pick up a quirk.

280
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
Violating the premise of the question.

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,600
I understand that.

282
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,720
It's just like the most frustrating that I'm going to be the dude who only drinks Boons

283
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
farm.

284
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,480
I'm going to be the guy that plays, you know, a double neck mandolin.

285
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
Don't do it.

286
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,000
I do think that if you're going to pick a quirk, you should pick something that's useful.

287
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,800
Like be the guy who his quirk is.

288
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,920
He knows how to pick locks.

289
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,160
Like then you go from like quirk to talent or like special skill.

290
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,520
You know, I think everybody on the planet should pick locks.

291
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,960
I think everybody should possess that knowledge.

292
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,320
I don't think that's quirky.

293
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I think if you don't believe in boundaries, if Nathan wore a candy necklace every day,

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
think about that.

295
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,600
There's Nathan with his candy necklace.

296
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,160
That helps you because you get that sugar boost throughout the day.

297
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,200
If somebody else wants to come and nibble on you, they can do that.

298
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,640
What if Nathan was the guy with a prehensile tail?

299
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,440
Okay.

300
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
Don't know how you get that.

301
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,240
That's a little late.

302
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,240
It's an outpatient surgery these days.

303
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
Like you're in your out tail.

304
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
I think that no matter what, people are very perceptive.

305
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,880
If you try to pick up a quirk like this, people are going to know what you're doing.

306
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,520
And for like the first month that you do it, they're going to judge you silently.

307
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
They'd be like, Nathan has a cane now?

308
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
That's, that's weird.

309
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
And after that, you're going to, you're going to break through it.

310
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,000
And people will be like, oh, this is Nathan.

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,960
He just, he has a cane.

312
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,560
He doesn't have a limp or anything.

313
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,520
He just carries a cane around.

314
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,720
The thing is, it won't be cool until everyone who currently works there has quit and been

315
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,240
replaced with someone else.

316
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,080
That's when, that's when it will know.

317
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,760
It will be like a, a worthwhile, valid thing to do right now.

318
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,720
It's tough sale, tough sale.

319
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Don't do it, Nathan.

320
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,600
You're a beautiful flower.

321
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,640
Nathan, you're better than that.

322
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,520
How about your, your quirk is you're the guy who can't stop talking about

323
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,640
my brother, my brother and me.

324
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,680
And if I show for the modern era, it never stops.

325
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,400
It's always extolling the virtues of podcasts.

326
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,680
I should give it a listen.

327
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,400
Maybe you should.

328
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,200
Hey, I've been wondering if I should start wearing cologne when I go out or dress up

329
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,000
any recommendation on what I should start at, what I should look for to start smelling

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,680
like a classy dude sense and sensibility.

331
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,920
And that name was created by Travis.

332
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,680
You can't do that anymore.

333
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,520
That's, that's perjury.

334
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,160
I like it.

335
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
I like it.

336
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,080
What do you felonious?

337
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,640
What do you guys wear me?

338
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,520
Yeah.

339
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,560
What's your smell?

340
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm Oh, natural.

341
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,600
I used to do that.

342
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,400
I used to do acts, but that, that made me smell like the inside of an air conditioner

343
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,040
after a while.

344
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
So I stopped.

345
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,080
Well, what I imagined the inside of an air conditioner is smelling like rusty.

346
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,280
It made me smell rusty and I hated it kind of rusty.

347
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Yeah, now I just slap on deodorant and I, I use Irish spring soap and keeps me fresh

348
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:17,600
all day.

349
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,200
I love it.

350
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,480
I don't like to overpower people.

351
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,920
I fly under the radar.

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,360
I go with a, an old spice trifecta of old spice, body wash deodorant and little bit

353
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,640
of old spice cologne.

354
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,960
And then, and then a dash of actual old spices.

355
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,600
Like, oh, this, this coriander is ancient.

356
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,640
Let me get it on my skin.

357
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,720
That's good.

358
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,840
Oh, that's really nice.

359
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,400
Uh, I wear, um, uh, Burberry.

360
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,960
I think, I think Burberry, they make like bags, right?

361
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,760
Burberry.

362
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,480
Sure.

363
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,200
Bags.

364
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,680
Yeah.

365
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,160
Yeah.

366
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,440
So like I wear Burberry.

367
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,480
I think it's called Burberry.

368
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
The fragrance or smell like Burberry.

369
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Do you smear that right on your cummerbund or do you like a little ring around your monocle

370
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,520
or how does it work?

371
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:05,840
Can you explain that?

372
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
I have to.

373
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:06,960
Yeah, sure.

374
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,760
I have to, um, uh, first I soak it, soak my ascot in it overnight.

375
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,200
Ladies love that shit.

376
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,760
Yeah.

377
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,680
And then I, I take the deed to the boathouse and I soak it in that and I keep that in my

378
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,800
pocket as sort of like a.

379
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,320
What's that smell?

380
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,240
Um, let me check my pockets.

381
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
Oh, it's this boathouse that I have.

382
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,440
Here's the deed to the boathouse.

383
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,360
It smells like Burberry right now.

384
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,720
Uh, just make sure when you, when you apply it, uh, the rule is that, uh, your, uh, cologne

385
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,800
should only be powerful enough to be smelled in the embrace of a lover.

386
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
So you're saying what's the perimeter?

387
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,600
That is a good rule.

388
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,160
It just makes me sick when you put it like that.

389
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,080
I know I two sprays.

390
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,000
The point was, I thought the point was to get the embrace with the smell.

391
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,880
Like the people get.

392
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,200
If your, if your stink is attracting people from across the room, a attracting people

393
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,040
like I got to go embrace somebody right now.

394
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,840
What you've never like, you've never like hunted a smell down like, Oh fuck, what's

395
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,400
that smell?

396
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Got to get to it.

397
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
And then you find it.

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,320
And at the end there's a, there's a beautiful lady or a beautiful man or like a beautiful

399
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,040
dog or something.

400
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,200
Like it's something I'm saying your smell influence shouldn't reach that far across

401
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,920
the room.

402
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah.

403
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
That's your, your reach.

404
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,800
Your throw is too big.

405
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
You're going to affect the taste of people's food.

406
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Like in other rooms, it's not a good way to go.

407
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,120
Yeah.

408
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,520
And don't forget bloodhounds.

409
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
You don't want to throw them off.

410
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,160
It's just, it's cruel.

411
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,360
They're trying to solve crimes.

412
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,440
I don't, I, I, I just don't know what smells good anymore.

413
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:39,920
You guys.

414
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,800
Well, I, as to what, how to pick a fragrance, we gave you some fragrance tools.

415
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,360
Just go to your local department store and they, and it's fun, man.

416
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,760
Just go and start smelling, say, Hey, this is the kind of fragrances I'm into.

417
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,400
Well, you probably won't know that, but maybe some notes that you'd like.

418
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,920
I'd like something with some notes of old leather and sandalwood.

419
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,720
Can you hook me up?

420
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,240
And they will, that sounds delightful.

421
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
They will generate a smell for you.

422
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
I would like to smell like an old book.

423
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,360
Can I have that?

424
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
I bet you they do.

425
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,080
Make sure you say that has to exist.

426
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,480
Right.

427
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,760
Notes of whiskey.

428
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,640
That's always good with campfire.

429
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,120
I want to smell like an old hobo.

430
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,160
Can I smell like an old hobo with campfire whiskey?

431
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,920
Do you guys have midnight hobo in?

432
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,920
Oh, that's right.

433
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,800
I was trying to drink my chai tea and you just got me right, right there.

434
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,720
Oh, so nice.

435
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
Hey, this is nice.

436
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,680
But are you guys, you guys want to do some, some eco-tourism and take a journey with me

437
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,360
for Earth Hour?

438
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,640
Turn those lights off and come with us.

439
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:59,040
Turn those lights off and come with us on the journey to the money zone.

440
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,080
In the driver's seat is our listener, Ryan Shrout.

441
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,360
What are we driving?

442
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,680
We're driving a car, an eco-car called Very Small.

443
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,240
Yeah.

444
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,440
And it's taking us to a place called PC Perspective.

445
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,560
That's Ryan's company.

446
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,840
Now Griffin, tell me about it.

447
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,640
Hit me with it.

448
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,160
What is PC Perspective?

449
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,600
Listen, the world of PC.

450
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
It's very confusing.

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,720
Can you?

452
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
I need you to explain what PC stands for.

453
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,080
I got a pussy control.

454
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
What's up, Ryan?

455
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,640
Your business rules now.

456
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,440
Go ahead.

457
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,720
Hey, Ryan, you can use that.

458
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
He never explicitly says, I'm going to imagine it stands for personal computer,

459
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
which we all have.

460
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,920
Or pussy computer.

461
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,200
Or a pussy computer.

462
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,080
I need more RAM.

463
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,800
I bet you do.

464
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
Anyway, personal computers are confusing.

465
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,240
Who knows what's going on in there?

466
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,040
I don't.

467
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,320
Did our wizards activating diodes?

468
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,040
Who knows?

469
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,200
Nobody does, except for PC Perspective.

470
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,480
It's a great spot.

471
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,920
If you need info on PCs, if you need in-depth reviews on PC components,

472
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,520
I didn't know there were components in there.

473
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
But apparently there are.

474
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
And apparently they have varying degrees of quality.

475
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,960
And that is something that PC Perspective can elucidate for you.

476
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,800
I'm thinking about building a new computer, Griffin.

477
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,920
Do they have anything for me?

478
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Or should I just go screw off?

479
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,680
No, they'll help you right there.

480
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,320
If you want to toss together a fat rig to use the parlance of the hacker community,

481
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,520
if you want to access cyberspace on the baddest rig around, then-

482
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,160
If you want a real information superhighway hot rod.

483
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,840
Vroom, vroom.

484
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,600
You pull into the hardware leaderboard, which is the thing that they have on PC Perspective.

485
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,400
Where is that?

486
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
PCPer.com first slash HWLB.

487
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,240
It's right there.

488
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,000
Which is shorthand for all those things we just said.

489
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,920
And it'll give you recommendations for building your PC.

490
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,640
Which I actually built a PC one time.

491
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,880
And I just bought a bunch of shit off Newegg.

492
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
I was like, oh, I need a RAM.

493
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,520
Let me just slap that on there.

494
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,800
I need six diodes.

495
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,160
And the computer blew up, took one of my legs.

496
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,000
So it can be avoided.

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,800
They got forums where you can chat it up with other people who are searching for perspective.

498
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,880
And they talk about PC gaming, which I'm sure a lot of our audience is into.

499
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
I didn't know you could game on this other than Jezzball.

500
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,040
I'm pretty into Jezzball right now.

501
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
PCPer.com first slash podcast.

502
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
They have a show.

503
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,520
It's probably better than ours.

504
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,600
At least we'll teach you more about computers.

505
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,160
We literally know, I know nothing about these things that I do my work on every day.

506
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,840
I'm on a computer nine hours a day.

507
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,000
No fucking clue what's going on in there.

508
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,840
That's PCPer.com.

509
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,240
PCPer.com.

510
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
And they got reviews, community, podcasts.

511
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,600
Check it all out.

512
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,440
And while you're going, you can make sure to hum this jingle that Griffin has crafted.

513
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,480
Gotta be honest with you.

514
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,880
I tried to do some pre-pro on this one earlier because I was nervous.

515
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,640
And I could not, for the life of me, turn PC Perspective into a song.

516
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,440
So let's see.

517
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,280
Let's see how it goes.

518
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,080
It's lively hot.

519
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,960
I got the chord progression down.

520
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,760
But gotta get those parts.

521
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Gotta snatch that RAM up.

522
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,480
Gotta snatch that RAM up.

523
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,600
Gotta get a cooler chassis for my big fat rig.

524
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,680
Gotta be a cyberspace wizard on PC Perspective.

525
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,120
That's not the URL.

526
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm gonna take another stab at it.

527
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:16,960
Nope.

528
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,040
Don't clap for that.

529
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,600
Oh, good.

530
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Remix.

531
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
What I thought was, I wanna hear that again.

532
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Hey, dad.

533
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,360
Whoa.

534
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,400
That took a weird turn.

535
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
What's wrong with your rig?

536
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,400
I think that it needs more RAM and bits and bytes.

537
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,720
What else do you dig?

538
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,760
Let's get together on something for once.

539
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,760
PCPer.com.

540
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:58,800
There.

541
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,080
You nailed it.

542
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,000
That one had overtones of family in it.

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,040
It's been strife.

544
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,160
There was some strife there.

545
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,000
It's like, dad, I love you, but we just can't get together on it.

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,880
Let's unite on this one thing.

547
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
Let's talk about PCs.

548
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,400
I should have just sung Pussy Control.

549
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
I really missed my opportunity there.

550
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,200
Can I look up the tabulature to Pussy Control really quick?

551
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,400
Yeah, maybe if PC Per takes us to the money zone again, which they most certainly will,

552
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,680
we'll do a riff on a spoof.

553
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
A hot spoof on Pussy Control.

554
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,880
A spoof on Pussy Control.

555
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,680
I live by myself, and like Griffin, I've been on a Lady Siesta internet fist bump.

556
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,640
Sometimes, after a long day at work, I like to-

557
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,480
I actually just fist bumped my monitor.

558
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,880
Like, why did I do that?

559
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,960
I'm alone in a room.

560
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,600
Sometimes, after a long day at work, I like to have a beer.

561
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,360
A beer?

562
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,760
Come on.

563
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,600
I go to my favorite bar after work once a week, occasionally more than once,

564
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,640
if I've had a particularly bad day or rough bus commute.

565
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,800
Very rarely do I drink enough to be drunk.

566
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,480
At most, I leave a bit tipsy.

567
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,640
I always tip well and never leave my glass sitting at a table for someone else to clean up.

568
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,560
My question is this.

569
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,720
Is it okay to do this?

570
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,400
Should I feel ashamed for bevving out by myself?

571
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,400
That's from single dark beer.

572
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,520
Absolutely not.

573
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,320
Absolutely not.

574
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,280
It's totally cool.

575
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,120
It's totally fucking cool.

576
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,400
Like, you're not getting sloshed and, like, I don't know, hitting on your neighbor.

577
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,800
You're just having a- you're having a relaxer.

578
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,080
Just relaxing.

579
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,240
Yeah.

580
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,480
Alcoholism is just a label that society puts on you.

581
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,040
I don't subscribe to labels.

582
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,320
You've already- you've already eschewed their expectations for you

583
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,840
in terms of pursuing and securing a life mate.

584
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,600
Why not just shrug this one off too?

585
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,680
You're living the life you want like a herpes ad.

586
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,240
Just do it.

587
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,080
Just drink it up and you're not going to meet anybody nice in your house.

588
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm just saying.

589
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,760
I mean, I know, like, you're taking a break right now, but-

590
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,680
That's why he goes out once a week.

591
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,400
I do the same thing.

592
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
It's like, maybe tonight, maybe tonight, I'll find that special somebody.

593
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
I'll have one beer and I'll clean up after myself.

594
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,000
He's helping someone notice that part.

595
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
They will see that.

596
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,240
Ladies will see that from across the bar like, did he just bust his own table?

597
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,320
Get over here.

598
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,200
Get over here.

599
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,880
I'm just- make sure you bring your own rag and your own coaster.

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,360
And really just take care of business.

601
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
I brought these pretzels myself.

602
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,200
You can just get me a little bowl or something.

603
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
I need a bowl for my rolled gold.

604
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,420
Listen.

605
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,240
I've got a paring knife.

606
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
If you could just give me the lemon, I'll just sort of carve it myself.

607
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
Keep on living.

608
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,380
Okay.

609
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,120
This is what Matthew McConaughey says and he likes to party.

610
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,440
I think- just don't party as hard as Matthew McConaughey.

611
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,520
That's my barometer.

612
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,880
And nobody should party that hard.

613
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,920
I don't think you can handle it.

614
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,360
I've had to reskin my bongos three times trying to live as hard as Matthew McConaughey.

615
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,040
Have you been- do you oil them?

616
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,680
What?

617
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,080
Yeah.

618
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,360
You know, I was oiling them.

619
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,280
I was using that- I was using that sandalwood oil for the longest time and it did help.

620
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,760
You're right.

621
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,720
It helped with the tone.

622
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,800
I'd say it brought it up a good half step.

623
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,200
But the problem is afterwards, there was a lot of residue.

624
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,480
Yeah, it's hard because once your hands get slippery, it's hard to break out a good paradiddle

625
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,560
once your hands get that slippery.

626
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,440
I would always get as far as like- I was getting like, does the goosh.

627
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,200
And when I would get to the goosh, like, my hand would stick for just that fraction of a second.

628
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,160
I noticed.

629
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,640
Like, in my earlier bongo years, I probably wouldn't have, but I need that responsiveness.

630
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean, what model are you working with now?

631
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,760
Is it a Rickenbacker?

632
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,440
No, it's a bongotron 3000.

633
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,520
It's pretty big in Europe.

634
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,080
I'm kind of surprised you haven't heard of it.

635
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,200
I think that that was a game that you and I just played and I think I lost.

636
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,440
I think we just played bongo conversational as chicken.

637
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,800
We all lost, I think.

638
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,560
In case anyone was wondering, bongotron was my favorite transformer.

639
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,480
He didn't do much, but when he did, it was mellow.

640
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
He transformed from a robot into bullshit.

641
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
Hey, do you want a yahoo?

642
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,480
Yeah, redeem yourself.

643
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
This one was sent in by Andrew Binder.

644
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,400
Thank you, Andrew.

645
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,200
It's by yahoo answers user LOL, who asks,

646
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,960
is it normal to be sexually attracted to- anybody want to guess?

647
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
I want to guess my answer, no.

648
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,160
I want to guess my answer, no.

649
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,720
Numbers.

650
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
Numbers.

651
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,800
Is it okay to be sexually attracted to numbers?

652
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,200
He adds, I admit I am gay.

653
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,680
Well, okay, but there are some nights where I take the algebra book back into my room

654
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,040
and jack off to the numbers.

655
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,680
Number three is my favorite because it's so sexy.

656
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,120
Well, yeah, it looks like a sideways, but yeah, it makes sense.

657
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,160
It adds up or maybe ups like sideways balls.

658
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,960
There's a lot of things that that three could be and sideways boobs.

659
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,080
It's not okay.

660
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,960
Three is pretty hot.

661
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,680
Let's break this question down.

662
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,760
The first, my biggest problem with it is that he says, I admit that I am gay

663
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,040
as if that has any bearing on the situation whatsoever.

664
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,240
If you're straight in the numbers, then that's cool.

665
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
Yeah.

666
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,920
Or like, is he saying that that's like a side effect?

667
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,400
It's like one out of every 100 people who like people of their same gender

668
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,160
also would like to fuck a number.

669
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,120
What's the sexiest number, everybody?

670
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,640
See this, listen, we're not ready to have that conversation yet.

671
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,920
We'll get to that, but I think we need to come up with some rules.

672
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,080
First, are we talking about fucking the idea of a number?

673
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,400
Are we talking about, I have the important thing is not to fuck anything under 16.

674
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:10,480
Well, we're not going to think of anything funnier than that.

675
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,000
God, are we, are we, but I mean, are we talking about like fucking an actual,

676
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,160
like if we could manifest this number into, I think you have to pick which shape would

677
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,520
be like the most pleasurable to like rub up against a numeral, a numeral or cause like,

678
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,280
there's so many combinations beyond that.

679
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,880
I'm saying what is the hottest numeral.

680
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:35,920
Well, we have to set a limit because I could just say like 16,783,492.

681
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,280
And then that's a fucking orgy.

682
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,640
Once you get that number, let's say between zero and a hundred.

683
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,920
No numeral, a numeral between one, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine.

684
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,360
Oh, I see what you're saying.

685
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,600
Yes.

686
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,800
It's zero.

687
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:49,680
Nope.

688
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,880
Nope.

689
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,360
You're wrong.

690
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
Zero is mysterious.

691
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,080
Travis, you're a fool.

692
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,280
Justin, do you want to guess?

693
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,000
Well, zero is, zero is not bad.

694
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,080
I think seven is the sexiest number.

695
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,400
Travis.

696
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:00,800
What is it?

697
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,360
Second guess.

698
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,320
Eight.

699
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,840
Yup.

700
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,360
What's up two holes.

701
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,080
How did you get there?

702
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,640
Two holes.

703
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,520
Which one tonight?

704
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,560
You know, he's down.

705
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,520
Do you want the top?

706
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,040
You want that solid, that solid hefty bottom, or do you want the narrow, the slightly narrower

707
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,280
top?

708
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,240
Sounds good.

709
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,440
And also it recalls, it recalls snowmen, which we can all agree.

710
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,440
Always hot.

711
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,560
I shouldn't impress my, my feelings on people.

712
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,640
Here's if I were to defend eight, I were to say it's obviously not three.

713
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,920
Right.

714
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,400
Because the three is just half an eight.

715
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,560
You cut it sideways right down the front already.

716
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,120
Sure.

717
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,320
Why have a, why have, you could have two threes already.

718
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,120
It's called an eight.

719
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,920
A number one.

720
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,080
How are you supposed to fuck that?

721
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,400
Really?

722
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,200
Yeah.

723
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,560
Zero.

724
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,720
That cavity is gigantic.

725
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:50,960
No.

726
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,120
Yeah.

727
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,280
That's just a, you're just begging to feel inadequate.

728
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,520
Two, I think you could make a case for.

729
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
It's got a nice curvature, which you guys know I'm a fan of.

730
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,360
Yeah.

731
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
You do like curvatures.

732
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,560
The problem with two and five and seven.

733
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,000
Yeah.

734
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,560
And that's it.

735
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,520
Where, where do you put it?

736
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:12,640
Yeah.

737
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,600
I see what you're saying.

738
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,760
Where do you have to have intercourse with the numeral?

739
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,720
And that is what we're saying.

740
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,840
Right.

741
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,720
Then eight.

742
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
Three would be tricky, but I think you could, I think you could do it.

743
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,280
Yeah, I think so too.

744
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,560
I would like to know when this person discovered this problem because it, it could have made

745
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,080
for like the most awkward math class ever when he's sitting there and the teacher's

746
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,240
like, say I have 12 apples and I take five away.

747
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,360
What do you have?

748
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,480
And the answer is boner.

749
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Hey, hey, Griff, are there any answers?

750
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,120
Do you want to help him out at all?

751
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,200
Uh, Diana Quimby says, I like 69.

752
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,960
Oh, that's cool.

753
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
Nice try, Diana.

754
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Um, so many, so many.

755
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:01,920
Okay.

756
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,960
Says yes.

757
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,920
Completely normal.

758
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Have fun.

759
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,080
You're not hurting anyone.

760
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:06,800
I disagree.

761
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,560
Now I agree with the second half of that sentence, but let's not throw around terms like completely

762
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,800
you rob the words of their power.

763
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:17,840
Yeah.

764
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:23,040
I think that I'm a Gleek says everyone has their quirks, I guess.

765
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,560
So neon Nathan, guess what?

766
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,600
Number Nathan.

767
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,720
Hey, number Nathan.

768
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,920
What's up with number Nathan?

769
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
He's over there.

770
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,840
He's playing math blaster and he's fucking jerking.

771
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,480
It's so right to math blaster.

772
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,200
Number nookie.

773
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:37,840
Nathan.

774
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,640
Number nookie.

775
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,360
Nathan jerks it to math blaster.

776
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,400
I heard on the end.

777
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I heard he is the math blaster.

778
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:52,720
He said, hey, listen, I have a, I have a sister who gives the best presence for Christmas

779
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,440
and every birthday.

780
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,560
She comes up with something so ridiculously amazing that I just can't think of how to

781
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,280
top her.

782
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
I know the idea of presence is not to top the other person.

783
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,120
Just one time.

784
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,240
I would like to win.

785
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,880
She's giving me things like a robotic butterfly in a jar.

786
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,040
How do I retaliate in the present war?

787
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,840
Thanks guys.

788
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,800
Presently stumped.

789
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
I didn't know that was a thing.

790
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,960
How do you got to quit?

791
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,080
You think?

792
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,960
Yeah, I think you got to stop the present world altogether.

793
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,960
Really lower expectations and then in 10 years get a decent present.

794
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,920
And they're like, wow.

795
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,400
So you're saying like, give someone like a gift certificate that says like, I donated

796
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,760
a tree in your honor for like 10 years in a row.

797
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,840
I got you a goat in a village far, far away.

798
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:42,720
I think, or you could just bow out by getting like the shittiest present ever.

799
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,360
Just race to the bottom is what I'm saying.

800
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,760
Top yourself that way and top yourself below it.

801
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,880
Cause it's not going to hurt you.

802
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,600
She'll pretend that she loves it still, but then she'll be like, Oh, um, Michael,

803
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,760
Michael just like got me a, what is this?

804
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,480
Barnes and Noble gift certificate, but they're closed down.

805
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,360
Like give her whatever gift certificate for 250.

806
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,000
Okay, great.

807
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,720
Thank you.

808
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
Just take her present that she gives you the next year.

809
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,080
Give it back to her with a $5 bill tape too.

810
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,240
Yeah, it's like, what's up now?

811
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
I guess it's a little better this year, huh?

812
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,640
I guess it's pretty good.

813
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,400
And it's, it's a crude interest.

814
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,280
It's a crude value.

815
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,600
Um, over, over the, over the passing year.

816
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,280
Um, this is why I don't like presents because it is a competition.

817
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:31,680
Guess what?

818
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,960
It is a competition.

819
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,400
And you're probably, if you have to ask, you're probably losing.

820
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,480
Hey, by the way, it sounds like your sister's secret might be ThinkGeek.

821
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,680
So maybe you should go to ThinkGeek and, and, uh, check out some of the gifts they have there.

822
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,120
Cause then you might be able to beat her that way.

823
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Ooh, instead of buying the shittiest present ever, just make it.

824
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,280
Then she really can't get mad at you.

825
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,240
Yeah, she really won't see that coming.

826
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,160
What have you done with these clothes pins?

827
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,080
I, I, Michael, I'm looking at it and I honestly can't tell.

828
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,440
What is this supposed to be?

829
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,720
Is this an ashtray?

830
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,600
Because there's a lot of cavities in it.

831
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,400
For ash.

832
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
For air ash to slip through.

833
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,440
I'm a hotel housekeeper in Australia.

834
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,760
Whoa.

835
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,680
We have to try it.

836
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,720
I should try an accent.

837
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
Should I do an accent for this question?

838
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:20,720
Yeah.

839
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,160
Oh, I was racially cleaning the room of gas to wash from the states.

840
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,040
Is that good?

841
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,360
Perfect.

842
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,840
It sounded like you were like time traveling and you're like talking to us like in a time

843
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,560
vortex.

844
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,040
He opened up his wallet and asked me what the usual tipping rate is every year.

845
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,600
I told him that unlike in the US, hospitality workers here are paid enough by their employer

846
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,280
that they don't rely on tips as income and that it isn't necessary.

847
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,960
He said, oh, and put his wallet back in his pocket.

848
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,240
I thought tipping was a sign of appreciation for providing a good service.

849
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,760
Should I take this personally?

850
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,200
Should I not have told him the truth?

851
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,960
Or have I just encountered a cheap dick scrape?

852
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,640
Jen, I actually have a theory on this.

853
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:16,240
I think that anytime you go to another culture, more important to you than money is that you

854
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,760
don't look like a dipshit.

855
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,160
Yeah.

856
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,800
So when this guy got his wallet out and you said we don't really do that so much, he probably

857
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,400
felt like a dipshit so hard that he just put the money away for fear of sounding like a

858
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:28,800
dipshit.

859
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,360
That would be my guess, at least.

860
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,120
You definitely humiliated him.

861
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,920
He was embarrassed.

862
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,080
What I don't understand is why you didn't take this guy to the fucking cleaners.

863
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,120
Oh, my God.

864
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,920
How much is that?

865
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,720
120%.

866
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,280
Yeah, like over a hundo just because that's how we do it in Australia.

867
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,240
Money means nothing here.

868
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,360
We just give it away.

869
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,160
Yeah.

870
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,920
So give me some of it.

871
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
It would mean a lot to me, though, if you gave it to me.

872
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,640
This is why I don't travel.

873
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,640
This is it?

874
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm serious because I would do this.

875
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,080
I would be that guy and I'd never recover from that shame, ever.

876
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,160
But here's what I've learned from traveling.

877
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,120
Like you think that someone who is I used to think when I was younger that if I traveled

878
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,720
a lot that things would make more like there is a culture sort of inherent to travel where

879
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,360
like a worldwide culture, you know what I mean?

880
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,880
Like something that if you've been in enough places, you just kind of grok what's going

881
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,280
on.

882
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,680
Griffin and I stayed in a hotel last I guess earlier this month where every night when

883
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,080
we would come to the back to the hotel room, there were floor mats that said sleep well

884
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,160
and and slippers.

885
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,840
It wrapped up in plastic.

886
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,200
We had like we had nightly debates about whether those slippers were free.

887
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
There's no rules.

888
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,800
And since you're in Australia, there's no rules just right.

889
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,720
Like like at the outback.

890
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,440
That's what you should tell him.

891
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,560
There's no rules to tipping.

892
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,240
There's just so you're saying just just embrace your ineptitude.

893
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,800
Yeah, at international affairs, just like if I'm going to have another if I'm going

894
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,320
to have enough shrimp to put on the barbie, I need you to tip me right now.

895
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,200
Why are you wearing why are you wearing a Hawaiian shirt?

896
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,480
You you do realize that not all islands are like the same.

897
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,880
This isn't like a tropical resort for you.

898
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,760
Like we live here.

899
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,240
You're wearing sunscreen.

900
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,000
You're indoors and you're wearing sunscreen.

901
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,960
My advice is don't screen on your nose.

902
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,160
Is be careful not to use the word necessary because I think that people only tip because

903
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,440
it is necessary.

904
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,800
And if you say that's not necessary, that translates to don't do it.

905
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,040
So maybe say like, well, you know, if you really appreciate the service, then we accept

906
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,000
tips, but it's not required.

907
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
Tipping is such a sensitive thing.

908
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,760
I don't know why this guy would would breach that sensitivity and be like, hey, do you

909
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,320
need this?

910
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,560
Like wave it in front of you.

911
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,160
Do you have some troubles?

912
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,840
Well, how much of what I have do you need to be happy?

913
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
I've got it to give.

914
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,160
Do you need it to have like I've got a vein open.

915
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,800
Come drink.

916
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,000
I think next time to say 10 percent and go about your business.

917
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,640
I think that's that's that's also that's kind of a dick move, by the way.

918
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,360
Don't ask this person what the usual tipping rate is.

919
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,120
What are you thinking?

920
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:25,040
Ask like the somebody, somebody else, your cabbie or literally anybody else tips.

921
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,560
No, I'm having trouble thinking of people that she would interact with that that would

922
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,680
not require tips.

923
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,440
I could be impartial.

924
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,840
Nope.

925
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,160
Tips.

926
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,960
Have you ever seen the secret of my success story?

927
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,840
Not in too long.

928
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,800
Yeah, I tipped a soda machine in a hotel once.

929
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,640
I just put another dollar in.

930
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,600
I was like, that's for you.

931
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,080
Good job.

932
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,880
For a second, I thought it was it was going to turn into a real like Bret Michaels story.

933
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,680
Like you tipped a soda machine and then you kicked it down a flight of stairs.

934
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,120
But no, I would never hurt a soda machine like that.

935
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,120
Do you want to answer?

936
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
Yeah, I was just about to ask for one.

937
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,880
This one was sent in by America's favorite person, Jacob Blocker.

938
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,800
There was a time poll and he won it for that thing.

939
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,800
It's by Yahoo Answers user Bowler, who asks, I need tickle fetish help.

940
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,640
So, I have a tickle fetish and I was wondering if there is a tool I can use to tickle my feet,

941
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,480
such as an electric toothbrush or something.

942
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,600
That's it.

943
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
It's really a question of reach, isn't it?

944
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,960
I mean, I imagine when you have a tickle fetish, I can't tickle myself.

945
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,640
Like, I don't know how you're supposed to do it without the help of some sort of tools.

946
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,480
I didn't think this was a thing.

947
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,840
I have a boner to tickle myself.

948
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,880
Boner, do you?

949
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,040
Stop, stop.

950
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,600
Don't stop.

951
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,040
Don't stop.

952
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,840
Do stop.

953
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,960
I have a boner.

954
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,760
No, please.

955
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,720
It's uncomfortable now.

956
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,400
You have been tickling me for too long.

957
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,120
I have a fetish.

958
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,400
It doesn't mean I'm not a masochist.

959
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,080
You should really, I think that if you have a tickle fetish, you need to become the person

960
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,520
who warns every single person you come across that you have a tickle fetish.

961
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,960
You're getting a job interview.

962
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,800
They're like, is there anything else you need to tell us?

963
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,440
Well, I have a tickle fetish, which I need you to know because you can't ever come up

964
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,600
to me in my cubicle and be like, hey, Johnson, come here.

965
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,480
Fluffy fingers.

966
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,120
And then it's like, boss man, I have a boner now that I have to deal with for the rest

967
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,040
of the day that you gave to me.

968
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,520
And I have to like-

969
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,640
Because I'm rock hard.

970
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,600
I got to go home to my wife and kids and they'll be like, how's your day?

971
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,240
It was pretty good.

972
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,920
My boss gave me a tickle boner.

973
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,360
So I guess actually what I said about it being pretty good was wrong.

974
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,360
It's the opposite of that.

975
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,440
I'm still chewing on that factoid.

976
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,760
Um, I guess a backscratcher.

977
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,960
Like would that work?

978
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:51,440
Or a broom?

979
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,680
Like one of those long ones with a foot- a broom?

980
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:55,520
How about-

981
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,920
Most witches just have tickle fetishes.

982
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
A lot of people don't know that.

983
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,960
Are there- is this a thing?

984
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,400
I guess I'm just surprised that this is a thing.

985
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:07,760
Like, are there people who like go to prostitutes and they're like $50 for a BJ Hundo for a

986
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,720
Minnesota pincher?

987
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,920
And you're like, how much just for like a- how much for fluffy fingers?

988
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,640
How about you just tickle me?

989
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,560
Do you want- I'll tickle you.

990
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,320
I will tickle you to titter but not to full chuckle.

991
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,960
And then they'll get confused and be like, like your penis?

992
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,000
Like you want me to tickle your penis?

993
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,960
Like, oh no, no, no.

994
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,840
I'm not ticklish there.

995
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,080
I'm ticklish on my- on my tummy.

996
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,320
If you could just give me tummy honks.

997
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,960
If you can get up under my armpits and maybe my big toes.

998
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,800
I have- here's what I have.

999
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,840
I have tummy honks.

1000
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,720
Those are on the table.

1001
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,360
That's $25.

1002
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,880
I'll give you- I'll give you pit pushers where I get up in there and really squeeze and tickle

1003
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,280
you.

1004
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,240
That's no problem.

1005
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,120
Fluffy fingers.

1006
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,000
That's gonna cost you.

1007
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,640
Oh man.

1008
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,160
And also kissing on the mouth.

1009
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,880
$150.

1010
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,040
So if you want to add that service.

1011
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,680
We also offer a nice- a nice relax afterwards because you need to cool down from the tickle.

1012
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,920
You get a oolong tea and a time life.

1013
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,640
Time life book about the old west.

1014
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,800
You sit and drink your oolong and read your time life book about-

1015
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,320
Stellar tickle.

1016
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,760
I'm gonna learn about cowboys.

1017
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,000
Good, good, good tickle.

1018
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,440
Uh, I wonder what Apache, uh, relations were like.

1019
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,440
Diane, you were worth every penny.

1020
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,200
I am- I am giggling like a schoolboy over here.

1021
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,120
Can you be a dove and nuke my oolong?

1022
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,960
I got so into this part about, uh, hatchet crafting.

1023
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,400
Do you know what the nice thing is about going to a tickle prostitute?

1024
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,880
What's that?

1025
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,640
Um, you get a happy beginning, middle, and end.

1026
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,720
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1027
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,080
But first quick housekeeping type stuff.

1028
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
You've been listening to my brother, my brother, and me.

1029
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,440
As always, the nicest thing you can do for us is tell a friend.

1030
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
We have a lot of people who do that, you know, in meat space.

1031
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,720
Just say, hey, listen to this.

1032
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,160
And then they jam like a USB drive or a disk.

1033
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,160
And then we have people who do it on the internet.

1034
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,080
Uh, like Joe Patrick, uh, 116.

1035
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,120
Mike Tartt is up on there.

1036
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,600
Anybody- anybody else really been killing it this week?

1037
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,200
Uh, Jeff Grubb.

1038
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,120
Uh, Jeff Grubb.

1039
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,760
Uh, there's Alsmane Mariko.

1040
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,640
Always killing it.

1041
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,240
A hundred percent of the time.

1042
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,080
Uh, tech monkeys.

1043
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:36,800
Oh, Christ.

1044
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,240
Cory Dutson.

1045
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,600
C Dutson on Twitter created- well, we created griffinspacejam.com with a rough-

1046
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,080
a rough draft, I would say.

1047
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,600
The first installment.

1048
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,880
C Dutson turned up the fucking heat.

1049
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,480
It is now a full sensory sort of experience.

1050
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
There's- if you want sight, there's sight.

1051
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,360
If you want read, which is one of your senses, there's read.

1052
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,800
You can read there.

1053
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,440
Sound, he's got the- he put the jingle on there.

1054
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,680
It's- it's such a fucking delight.

1055
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,040
I'm so happy that I made it.

1056
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,000
Thank you, C Dutson.

1057
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,120
Try that.

1058
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,240
So you should follow him.

1059
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,920
Man, that- that is a good website.

1060
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,360
It's like the best website.

1061
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,000
I can't believe that somebody made that.

1062
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,120
My dream is that it continues to be more productive.

1063
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,320
Like, it's more useful until it passes Google.

1064
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,200
Do you think maybe-

1065
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:28,480
That's everybody's homepage.

1066
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,480
Everybody has a secret, like, love of the Space Jam franchise in their heart,

1067
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,080
but they- they don't know, like,

1068
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,680
I need a safe place where I can go and talk about how much I love Lola

1069
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,040
because she's so- she's just so feminine and delicate.

1070
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,720
You can do that here.

1071
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,720
By the way, everybody, here's a fun little-

1072
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,680
little interactive adventure you can go on right now.

1073
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,120
Uh, if you get on YouTube and search Bugs and Lola, and then just, like, go on a journey.

1074
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,840
Just, like, watch the videos that come up because you are going to love them.

1075
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,160
You're really- um, also, if you are in the Chicago land area or you can get there,

1076
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,360
uh, you need to go to MaximumFun.org.

1077
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,240
You need to look for that link about our show that we're doing live there.

1078
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,520
Uh, and- and- or you can just go to the Second City website, uh, April 17th.

1079
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,800
We're going to be there with Jordan Jessica.

1080
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,480
Um, we're going to be opening for them, and then they're going to do their thing.

1081
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,200
And the whole night will be hosted by Dan Telfer, who is fucking hilarious.

1082
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:31,920
He's so funny.

1083
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,920
If you watch his, uh- he's got a video on YouTube called The Best Dinosaur.

1084
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,440
Jesus Christ.

1085
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,000
Go watch it.

1086
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,520
It's the fucking funniest thing.

1087
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,400
Uh, so Dan-

1088
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,040
And as an added bonus, um, April 17th,

1089
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,080
is Griffin's birthday, so we'll probably be going out afterwards and doing, like, a meetup thing.

1090
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,920
We're going to get fucked up Sunday night.

1091
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:50,960
Yeah.

1092
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,920
Don't tell Jesus.

1093
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,640
Don't tell Jesus Griffin's drunk guy's birthday.

1094
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,440
Um, so- so make sure you get tickets for that.

1095
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,000
Uh, we cover Twitter.

1096
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,080
If you have questions for us, nbnbam at MaximumFun.org.

1097
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,880
Um, and you follow us on Twitter.

1098
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,840
We- we're- we're- we're climbing the ranks here, but we still need more of you to- to join us.

1099
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:13,840
So, uh-

1100
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,080
We're all on Twitter separately, too.

1101
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,280
It's just that I think we-

1102
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,520
Hey, we broke three- we broke 3,000.

1103
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,480
Hey, all right.

1104
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,040
Yay.

1105
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,600
Pretty good, right?

1106
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,640
Um, if you want a promotion, if you want to take us to the Money Zone,

1107
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,600
and we'll take you to the Jingle Zone, uh, you can email Teresa at MaximumFun.org.

1108
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,360
Uh, this is Teresa with an H.

1109
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,400
I know some people- some people like to eschew the H.

1110
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,840
Uh, Travis, you're dating an H-less Teresa.

1111
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,680
I gotta say, I can't- I- I don't know how I feel about that.

1112
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,680
You didn't console us before that.

1113
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,240
Me neither.

1114
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,560
If you guys get married and she has to change her name, can she just pop that H in there?

1115
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,680
Just very-

1116
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,560
I'll see what I can do.

1117
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,560
I mean, I'll definitely bring it up.

1118
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:53,600
Thanks.

1119
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,160
Um, so I- I believe, uh, that is- that is everything.

1120
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,320
Thank you guys, as always, so much for hanging out with us.

1121
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,880
Um, we will, of course, be back.

1122
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,720
Sorry we missed a couple Mondays there, but we're back on- on the regular schedule now,

1123
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,200
so make sure you- you check that out.

1124
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,040
Check us out.

1125
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,440
Check- check our show out at Archives.

1126
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,200
Go ahead, Kevin, whenever you're ready.

1127
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,240
I'm gonna call this out.

1128
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,400
Travis just, uh, wrote us a message on Skype.

1129
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,680
Sometimes he does this whenever he does things during the show, uh, that he wants me to edit

1130
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,560
out in- in post, uh, and it says, I farted at 54 minutes, so I'll make sure to stop back in

1131
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:41,120
and cut that- cut that flatulence out, but I am leaving this in so that people know what you did.

1132
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,960
I could've sworn I heard it.

1133
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,320
If you go back and play, I don't know if you could edit it in,

1134
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,040
but he made a sound afterwards, like, what happened?

1135
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,280
Let me just-

1136
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,160
What did I do?

1137
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,840
Let me highlight that waveform, amplify 20 dBs.

1138
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,680
Sorry about your speakers.

1139
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,000
For a half of a second, I forgot where I was,

1140
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,360
which happens to me quite often and once happened to me on the bus,

1141
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,960
but it's one of those moments where it's just like extreme comfort fart.

1142
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,440
Oh, no.

1143
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,120
And then I try to cover it up with a throat clear.

1144
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,240
Time traveled for a second.

1145
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,840
You just got lost in the moment.

1146
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,360
This is the grossest podcast.

1147
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,560
I hate it.

1148
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,720
How about this one was sent in by Kevin Frida.

1149
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,360
Thank you, Kevin.

1150
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:23,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, The Casual Fan Rises, who asks,

1151
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,760
Ladies, imagine this.

1152
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,560
I have X-ray vision and I can see through your clothes.

1153
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,200
What now?

1154
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,200
Justin McElroy.

1155
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,320
This is Travis McElroy.

1156
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,840
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1157
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,760
This has been my brother, my brother, and me.

1158
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,480
Kiss your dad.

1159
00:51:42,480 --> 00:52:01,680
It's all right on the lips.
