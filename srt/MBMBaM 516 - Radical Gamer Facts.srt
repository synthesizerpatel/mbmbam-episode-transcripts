1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,080
Hello and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me, an advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. Let me check my notes real quick. Oh,

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,560
yep. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy. You say that, you do that a lot these days.

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,480
Well, I have to write a lot of stuff down.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm just curious why you keep forgetting your name or even why you have-

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,160
I've got a lot going on, Griffin.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,200
So much that you forget your own name and you need to refer to notes to look at it?

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
I don't have to explain myself to you. You're not my boss.

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,480
Check this out. I'm sure I'm Griffin. Positive.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
I wanted to do one of our great watch segments, you know, where we talk about

15
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,280
the latest and greatest in cinema entertainment. So I just loaded up

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
Marquee Cinemas over in Huntington over at the Pullman Square Plaza.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,600
Okay.

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,000
16 screens of pleasure there.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,320
Oh, wow.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,760
I was just going to run down-

21
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Hey, just real quick, Justin. 16 screens of pleasure doesn't sound great.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,200
No, it sounds like they're showing a lot of smut.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, let's take a look because I thought this would be a good way of figuring out what to do

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,040
a watch on.

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,280
Okay.

26
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
Because like, if you think about it, it's weird because there's- there ain't movies.

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,680
No.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
You know what I mean?

29
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,320
No.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,080
I mean, there's no movies, but they are opening up the theaters to show-

31
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,720
I mean, there's no movies. Here's the great news.

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,120
Movies gave us Scoob, and they're like, that's going to tide them over for a while.

33
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Yep.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,320
First type Trolls World Tour.

35
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,640
Gotta get it.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,080
That's- I mean, got it.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,400
Got it.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,360
That was the last movie. We were in the last movie, which seems huge.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,320
Bloodshot. Great. Love Vin.

40
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,320
Invisible Man and Sonic the Hedgehog.

41
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
Now those-

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,000
Hold on tight.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Those I know I've seen at my house. Those have been at my house for a little bit.

44
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,320
Gripping tight.

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,200
As well as Fantasy Island.

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
Gripping tight to the edge. Not letting go.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,320
So this is what- then they're like, well, man, we got a lot of screens.

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Dang, I wish we hadn't put up those many screens.

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,160
Maybe Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is going to play three times.

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,640
Thrice.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
And once you finish that screening, you can go check out Jurassic Park.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
The original Jurassic Park.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Those dinos are back.

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
You thought they were extinct, but they're back.

55
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,080
Listen, here's the thing.

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,560
That is simultaneously ridiculous, but also there's a part of me that's like,

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,160
ooh, back on the big screen, huh?

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, do you feel that way about this?

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,160
Maybe you'll go, Travis, and you'll have the time of your life,

60
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,440
which is deliciously appropriate because we're going to head on over

61
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
and check out Dirty Dancing at 530.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,640
Oh, wow.

63
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
Really make a day of it and enjoy.

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,680
Let me risk my health, life, and lung capacity

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,720
to catch a big, big, big performance of Dirty Dancing.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,240
Sounds cool.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Just to clarify, Justin, are they charging money for this?

68
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,440
Yeah, just the regular prices.

69
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,600
Griffin, you may risk your life and limb, but you will never say die

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,080
because at 820, we're going to go over and see a screening of The Goonies.

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,520
The Goonies, let's make it a double feature of adventure

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,480
with Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,760
showing six times today.

74
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,520
You will have six opportunities to see Indiana Jones

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,440
and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.

76
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,840
Now, Justin, I'm now looking at the website, too,

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,680
and I see on one of the screens they're showing

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,520
that black and white silent movie

79
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,960
where the train came out the screen and everyone dove out of the way.

80
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
You ain't that fucking far off, Trav,

81
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,080
because the last movie showing is The Wizard of Oz.

82
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,880
Wow.

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:17,120
Yeah, if you've just been 80 years too late on this one, on this 1939 flick,

84
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,720
you can finally check out The Lion and the Scarecrow

85
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,400
and all of their great adventures.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Metal Man.

87
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,000
You can have three chances to see Wizard of Oz.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
I mean, I guess we could do Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets watch.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,160
It feels bad.

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
It feels bad.

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,200
This is a national chain.

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,240
There is going to be someone who is like,

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,440
well, I got the COVID.

94
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,840
Dang it.

95
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,720
I got the COVID.

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,280
And someone's like, how did you get the COVID?

97
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,240
It's like, well, I just wanted to enjoy all two hours

98
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
and 41 minutes of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

99
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
on the big screen as it was intended.

100
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,520
You know, I've never gotten into Harry Potter before.

101
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,720
Never been a fan.

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,040
But now it feels like the best time to do it.

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,280
And you forced both your grandpas and grandmas to go to it with you.

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,680
Fuck you.

105
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,280
It's got Kenneth Branagh.

106
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't know.

107
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,920
They need this.

108
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm taking Meemaw and Peppa to see The Goonies.

109
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,400
They didn't even start.

110
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
They didn't even show Sorcerer's Stone.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
They were like, oh, you know what?

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,920
People are just going to start right here.

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
We'll start them at two.

114
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,480
The one with Kenneth fucking Branagh in it.

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
Travis, there's a global pandemic.

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,800
No one's going to sit through the first Harry Potter movie.

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,840
You got to skip to two.

118
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
This is an advice show where we try to help you.

119
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Here's my advice.

120
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,400
Don't go to the fucking movies.

121
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
No, you know what you should do instead?

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,480
You absolute maniacs.

123
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
You know what you should do instead?

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,680
What, Travis?

125
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
Get my brother and me on streaming or on iTunes or wherever you want.

126
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:50,880
Well, that.

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Watch that TV show.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,920
Also, I was about to give my brothers a quiz,

129
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,760
so you could just play along at home.

130
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,400
Oh, my God.

131
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,640
This is heartbreaking.

132
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,400
You guys, because you can play along at home

133
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
in the safety of your own home.

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,120
Travis, stop.

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,520
It's the way he does it now, Juice, where he's like, oh, shucks.

136
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,360
Yeah, it's like you can tell he's not actually cranking it,

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,280
but he would if he fucking could.

138
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,720
Do you want to hear something monstrous?

139
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,800
Travis is the one that finds the questions

140
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,000
and sends them to me to ask, and he hasn't done it.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,920
So I have no recourse.

142
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
I have him sitting right here.

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,880
I'll send him to you.

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,760
I have nothing.

145
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,800
I have no recourse.

146
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,800
But first, I thought maybe we could play along at home.

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,360
No, we don't.

148
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:35,840
Just do it.

149
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,320
Just start.

150
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,440
Yeah, you keep saying it,

151
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,000
but it's just making that bit longer every time you say it.

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.

153
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Do you guys like video games?

154
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:44,880
I do.

155
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,840
He just got me there.

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,880
He got me dead to rights.

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,600
I love me a video game.

158
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,560
You like video games?

159
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,600
I picked some video games questions

160
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,160
because I know in the past they've been a little too tough

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,480
and I wanted to give you guys a chance.

162
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,200
Now I'm worried.

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,560
I will say that as I did this,

164
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
both of you are video games aficionados,

165
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,480
and there's a part of me that's worried

166
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,840
that you'll know all the answers,

167
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
but I thought it would still be fun for those at home.

168
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,760
Probably not.

169
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,640
Let's try it, though.

170
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,080
And let's just make a new Google promise.

171
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,360
I always make a new Google promise.

172
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,600
Travis, please talk as fast as you possibly can.

173
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,360
Justin, same to you, because I'll be doing the same.

174
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Okay, well, I'm killing time now

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,320
so I can send the questions to Justin

176
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
because I forgot to do that.

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,080
But here we go.

178
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,720
So, let's see.

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Who wants to go first?

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,880
Who wants the first question?

181
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
It doesn't matter.

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
Okay, Justin.

183
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,360
Before settling on the name Sonic,

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,720
what was the name proposed by Sega

185
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,800
for this iconic blue hedgehog?

186
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
He was originally called Mr. Needlemouse.

187
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,120
That is correct.

188
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you.

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
How the fuck do you know that?

190
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,680
I read a book, Console Wars, if you ever read that one.

191
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,400
Okay, fine.

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Where they talk about the design.

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
He originally was also much more radical

194
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
and had a lot of toot.

195
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,020
Yeah.

196
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,040
And he wasn't inherently fast.

197
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,120
It was his sneakers that were fast.

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,400
He had no inherent superpowers.

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
Who cares?

200
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,480
Needlemouse is,

201
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,440
if you literally translate the Japanese word for hedgehog,

202
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,960
that's what it is, Needlemouse.

203
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,200
Now, Griffin, this is a more recent game.

204
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,560
Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot.

205
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
Well, hold on, hold on.

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,620
Okay.

207
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,920
I could ask you a Crash Bandicoot question, but I won't.

208
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,000
How'd you say that?

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,500
What?

210
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Well, do you know what Crash Bandicoot

211
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
was originally meant to be?

212
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Say the second word in his name.

213
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,480
Crash Bandicoot.

214
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,520
I'm pretty sure you were saying Bandicoot, which-

215
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,600
Bandicoot.

216
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:33,920
Okay.

217
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,720
See, he's doing it.

218
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,000
He's doing it intentionally now.

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,720
Assassin's Creed was originally set to be part

220
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,800
of what video game franchise?

221
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,840
He's got this.

222
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,600
It's not funny or good.

223
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,080
I don't know.

224
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Prince of Persia.

225
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
Yeah, Prince of Persia.

226
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,640
It was originally going to be

227
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,000
Prince of Persia Assassin's.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,680
This is the worst one yet, guys.

229
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,520
That is an interesting fact.

230
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
Very interesting.

231
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
You didn't know it.

232
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,520
Interesting gamer facts.

233
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:58,880
Justin.

234
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,280
We're talking about fucking, no, we're talking about

235
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,800
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets

236
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
and giving out gamer facts.

237
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,960
How far are we into the episode?

238
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,000
Scrap it.

239
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Justin.

240
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,280
Scrap it.

241
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,320
Yeah.

242
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,920
In transferring Super Mario Kart-

243
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,360
This is the best of episode week.

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
I'm going to pull some of the best episodes

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
from episode 200 to 250 and you guys do 250 to 300.

246
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,320
We'll pull some funny fucking clips

247
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,880
and we'll put up a-

248
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,840
In transferring Super Mario Kart to Western markets,

249
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,520
what censorship was done on Princess Peach and Bowser?

250
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
They removed, they made Bowser's dick smaller.

251
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,400
Well, they did do that,

252
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,680
but also the answer I was looking for

253
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,680
is they removed champagne from their victory celebrations.

254
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,520
Oh, okay, and the dick thing.

255
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,480
And the dick thing.

256
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:38,880
Griffin.

257
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,240
Huge scaly hog.

258
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,680
Griffin.

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,240
Big fucking Koopa balls.

260
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,800
The entire game of The Legend of Zelda,

261
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
A Link to the Past, takes up how much memory?

262
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to say 16 megabytes.

263
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,120
What?

264
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
Less than one megabyte.

265
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,760
Wow.

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,400
Cool.

267
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,040
Wow.

268
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,760
Justin.

269
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,320
Fuck yeah.

270
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,200
The UK versions of-

271
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,480
Fucking cool.

272
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
Fucking cool.

273
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Fucking radical, baby.

274
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,000
Justin.

275
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
The UK versions-

276
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,320
Fucking gamers rise up and eat these fucking facts.

277
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,640
Fucking E3's not dead.

278
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,400
Gamers, it's right here in the fucking studio, baby.

279
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,840
This sucks shit.

280
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,720
The UK versions of FIFA 2001 and Gran Turismo 2

281
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
shipped with what peculiar feature?

282
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,600
Wings on both.

283
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
There's wings on the cars, wings on the players, lots of wings.

284
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,880
They had scratch and sniff discs.

285
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,640
If you scratched FIFA's disc, you could, quote, smell the pitch.

286
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,080
The stink of the pitch.

287
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,800
And rubbing Gran Turismo's 2 disc would deliver an authentic pit stop smell.

288
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,080
I wish you could scratch and sniff this episode of Mabim Bam

289
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,320
and it would smell like a dead body.

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,760
Because it sucks and reeks.

291
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,120
This question is for both of you.

292
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,720
For both of us, Griff.

293
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,360
In a guerrilla style marketing campaign-

294
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,480
Killzone.

295
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,360
Spoof prostitute-style cards were placed in phone boxes around Soho in London

296
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
to advertise the original Crash Bandicoot.

297
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,360
What did they read?

298
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
Randy the Dandy, Randy Coot.

299
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,480
Not too far off.

300
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,280
They read, quote, new in town, young Randy Bandicoot.

301
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,680
That was fucking close.

302
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,520
And then it had a phone number you could call

303
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,760
and a picture of Crash in his underpants.

304
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
I think you should get a half point for that.

305
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
Yeah, I'll give Griffin a half point for that.

306
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
Okay, what's the final score, Travis?

307
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,160
Justin wins.

308
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,080
Yay!

309
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
When I was in my junior year of high school-

310
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,520
Oh, we can celebrate longer.

311
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,840
Hold on, I don't feel like we really celebrated as long as we could.

312
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
When I was in my junior year of high school,

313
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,680
I went on a camping trip with some of my class.

314
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,000
On one of the nights, I woke up having to pee

315
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
more than I've ever had to piss ever.

316
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,840
I mean, breaking of the Hoover Dam piss.

317
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,560
Okay, we know how much piss is.

318
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,600
God, you have to pee.

319
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
I tried to wake a friend up-

320
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,200
No, stop, we're gonna tear this up.

321
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
If you had to piss the breaking of the Hoover Dam,

322
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,800
your body would be torn apart by the internal pressure.

323
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
So don't say shit unless it's real.

324
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,800
This is my favorite thing about starting an episode

325
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,840
with Play Along at Home, is Griffin gets real feisty.

326
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,640
Yeah, real worked up.

327
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,240
For everyone else's questions.

328
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,320
We actually cut out Play Along at Home,

329
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
but we just harnessed Griffin's energy

330
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,720
for the rest of the episode.

331
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,440
You cut it out?

332
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,040
I tried to wake a friend up, but she didn't get up.

333
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
So I barely made it to a teacher's tent

334
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,160
when the moment she answered me, the dams broke.

335
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,880
I pissed my pants in the middle of the woods

336
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,320
and everyone knew about it.

337
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
Literally everyone.

338
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,640
That being said, it's currently three eventful years later

339
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,640
and I'm talking about recently the best friend

340
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,080
and he told me he forgot about it.

341
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,280
No, he didn't.

342
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,320
Nope, he didn't.

343
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
So my question is, how do I ask people

344
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,840
if they remember this without reminding them

345
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,200
of the terrible accident?

346
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,760
I think about this every single day

347
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,880
and that's Pee Pee McGee.

348
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,200
Remember when you shit your pants during Papa's funeral?

349
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
Nah, man, I forgot.

350
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,520
That's funny, I forgot about when you shit your pants

351
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,800
at my Papa's funeral.

352
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,840
That's weird.

353
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,120
Yeah, it did happen, didn't it?

354
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
No one would forget.

355
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,120
The things I remember in my life

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
with perfect clarity and will until the day

357
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,920
I pass off this mortal coil.

358
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,920
One, every time I've seen someone pee their pants.

359
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,400
Two, every time I've seen someone fall down

360
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,520
and I mean really fall down.

361
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,960
Really get a good fall going.

362
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,600
Even saying it,

363
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,680
you're thinking about a treasured memory you have

364
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
of watching someone absolutely pee fit.

365
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,080
Dude, I saw a serious bonk one time

366
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,800
that I just think about all the fucking time.

367
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,200
It's hard trying to do comedy, a comedy podcast,

368
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,600
and realizing you're never gonna do anything as funny

369
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
as just seeing someone fall.

370
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,680
Really eat the cheddar.

371
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,120
Not get hurt, not get hurt.

372
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,840
Not get hurt.

373
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,920
A little hurt, but not like they break something

374
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,840
or like they get up right away,

375
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,360
but maybe they were running too fast with a backpack on

376
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,920
and they don't calibrate.

377
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,840
It needs to be bad enough that they,

378
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,680
for a second, aren't a person.

379
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
Do you know what I'm saying?

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,880
For a second, they're just like,

381
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
oh, did you plan that?

382
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,200
That was cartoonish.

383
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,880
I was like, no, I didn't plan it.

384
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,760
I'm bleeding.

385
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,840
I was running down a short grassy slope

386
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,400
outside of a Waffle House on my way to King's Island once

387
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,720
and my feet just, whoop,

388
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,280
and I landed ass first on a metal grate

389
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,120
and had to go to the emergency room

390
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,080
because I couldn't move

391
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
and I didn't get to go to King's Island,

392
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
but I do, like I know my friends were worried about me,

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
but I do hope while they were enjoying

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,280
the King's Island rides and stuff,

395
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,960
they thought about the truly spectacular spill that I took

396
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
and hopefully will never forget about it.

397
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,560
And that's a sacrifice I'll make for my friends.

398
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,320
One time I was coming home from Sidney's parents' house

399
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
and I brought my Xbox, original Xbox,

400
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,880
original ass Xbox over there.

401
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,400
And then I was going up the stairs to walk into the house

402
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,280
and I tripped on the stairs and sent the Xbox flying

403
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,760
and also hit my knee so bad

404
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,320
that blood started coming out of it

405
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,040
and I live in perpetual sadness

406
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,320
that I could not see that amazing sight.

407
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,120
You know what I mean?

408
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,360
Like if I could ever astral project

409
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,880
just to see that one moment

410
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,000
because I think I would,

411
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm sure Sidney treasures it.

412
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,920
She denies it, but I would love,

413
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
I would just love to have that captured

414
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,400
in America's Funniest Home Memories

415
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,520
up there in the bank.

416
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,960
Can I ask you a question?

417
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,360
Yeah, buddy.

418
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,920
Did you make any kind of like audible vocal noise?

419
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
Yeah, how many do you think you did?

420
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
Like, whoa!

421
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Were you like, Master Chief, no!

422
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,720
My bandicoot!

423
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,640
Nah, not on the Xbox.

424
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,960
It's a funny word.

425
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,120
Come on, maybe Blink's the time sweeper.

426
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Yeah, that's what you tend to do.

427
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,480
I've never fallen down.

428
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,240
Ever, yeah, that's true.

429
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,360
I don't know.

430
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,640
I've never seen Travis fall down.

431
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,840
Let me just put this out there

432
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,040
and let people-

433
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,240
What if we've been like,

434
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,240
why do we fall down, Master Bruce?

435
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
And he's like, I never fucking fell down.

436
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,680
I'm unfallable, dude.

437
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,320
You tell me.

438
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,400
You old bastard, why you fall down?

439
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Why do you fall down?

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,160
No, I was saying, Master Bruce,

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
no, why do you fall down?

442
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,560
I gave you a,

443
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
I had to give you a portable basketball

444
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,080
for when you fell down in the kitchen.

445
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,400
I had to go down for fighting the Joker

446
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
to come help you back up.

447
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,680
Do you fall down so many times, Alfred?

448
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm bad at it.

449
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,920
If I fall down, I just put my arms out

450
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,960
and boom, I'm out.

451
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,520
You know what I mean?

452
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,040
Do you know how bad it is?

453
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
I gave the penguin my home address

454
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,160
so if I'm ever out of town,

455
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,840
he can come help you stand back up, Alfred,

456
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,600
because you fall all the time and I hate it.

457
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,840
I'm gonna put this mantra out there

458
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,520
and whoever needs it, use it.

459
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,280
So you pissed your pants.

460
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah.

461
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,720
So what?

462
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,160
So what?

463
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,480
You make a mess in someone's car,

464
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,040
you clean it up.

465
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,240
That's like worst case scenario.

466
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
So you piss your pants.

467
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:52,960
It's just water?

468
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
That is one thing that I'll never forget

469
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,520
is when our friend Justin

470
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,400
drunkenly had a very large-

471
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,120
I'm your brother.

472
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,920
No, not my brother.

473
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,320
Let's have like an extra large 7-Up

474
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,480
from McDonald's in the back of Griffin's car

475
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,480
and dropped it,

476
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
spilling the entirety of it

477
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,040
and just said, I made a nut-o.

478
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,480
Yeah, that sucked, man.

479
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,880
That was a-

480
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,760
I do think about that.

481
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
But we have a good time talking about that.

482
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,080
No, we didn't.

483
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,960
There was a fucking half inch of standing Sprite

484
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,720
in the backseat of my fucking car.

485
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,360
It was terrible.

486
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,280
There is a certain-

487
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,120
I've learned this since I've had kids.

488
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
I've had a lot more time to think about this

489
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,760
and a lot more opportunity.

490
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,960
There's a certain drink size

491
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
where if it spills in your car,

492
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,960
it's kind of unfathomable.

493
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,040
Like there's a certain drink size where

494
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:41,760
if that's-

495
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,640
I think there's something like,

496
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
if that spills, that's it for me.

497
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
That's the car.

498
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,560
That's no-

499
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Yeah, no, I don't have this car anymore.

500
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,720
It belongs to the Mr. Misty Slush at this point.

501
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
Hey, can I do a Yahoo that was sent in?

502
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,480
Can we help this person?

503
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Yeah, don't worry about it.

504
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,400
It's not a big deal.

505
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,080
So you pissed your pants.

506
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
So you pissed your pants.

507
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,880
Hey, I have a Yahoo here.

508
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,520
And this one was sent in-

509
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,320
You do?

510
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,560
Okay.

511
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,360
Oh my goodness.

512
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,680
All right.

513
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,120
This one was sent in by a bunch of people.

514
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,480
It was sent in by Adrian Cowles first.

515
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,120
Thank you, Adrian.

516
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,960
It's Yahoo Answers user iam,

517
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,440
which is like ian, but with an m.

518
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,160
Who asks-

519
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Or like Liam, but without an l.

520
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,920
Or like Liam without an l.

521
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,880
Or like Chris without the Chris and plus iam.

522
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,840
Yeah, sure.

523
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,240
So anyway, he says,

524
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,440
why are old books so boring?

525
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,480
Thank you.

526
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,120
Books from several centuries back

527
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
are objectively less entertaining

528
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,760
and fun to read than modern books.

529
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
I would think that few people would consider

530
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,560
Shakespeare actually interesting

531
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,200
if they thought he wrote his plays 10 years ago.

532
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,840
Why is that?

533
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,000
Were people simply bad at writing in the past

534
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
the way we were bad at medicine?

535
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Did people not care to make their books enjoyable?

536
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
Is there a rational explanation for it?

537
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,920
A update two days ago.

538
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,960
Shakespeare is a bad example of what I am trying to ask.

539
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,280
Think of Dickens or Russian classics.

540
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
So they definitely like walked it back just a little bit.

541
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,520
Okay, I'll relit on Shakespeare.

542
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,480
Okay, all right.

543
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,040
Here's the thing.

544
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,440
Shakespeare's got some murder, stabbing,

545
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
all kinds of witchcraft, dope shit, sex,

546
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
jugs, dingle dangles,

547
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,080
all kinds of fucking dope shit.

548
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,080
But Dickens, snalore.

549
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,280
I do feel like they walked it back too soon

550
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
because the point of if Shakespeare

551
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,400
was like publishing these works 10 years ago,

552
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,680
I do think there'd be people like,

553
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,640
what is this shit?

554
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
I don't fucking understand this at all.

555
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
I was reading Dostoevsky and my nuts fell asleep

556
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
because of how I was sitting.

557
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,680
I was so fucking bored reading this dumb book.

558
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,600
Now Dickens is a bad example too though

559
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,400
because there's ghosts and there's an old lady

560
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,120
in a wedding dress with some old ass cake sitting around.

561
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,960
Orphans!

562
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,920
There's orphans.

563
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,800
That's interesting.

564
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
I think there's a guillotine.

565
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,600
That's so cool.

566
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
Crime orphans?

567
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,040
Come on, that's cool though.

568
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,400
I mean, if you can make a movie with singing dogs

569
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,920
with songs by Billy Joel in it based on the work,

570
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,560
I don't think you can be like, that dude's boring.

571
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,520
All right, we've had a lot of fun taking the piss.

572
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,800
Out of this Yahoo Answers user.

573
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,360
But I can mention Dostoevsky in here

574
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,000
and say that name because I think it makes me sound smart.

575
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,320
Have I read Crime and Punishment?

576
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,600
Fuck no, it's boring.

577
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,120
Have I read Animorphs?

578
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,160
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

579
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,880
Yup.

580
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,760
I've read a lot of Animorphs.

581
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
I just wanna, can I applaud you for twice saying that name

582
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,920
with the confidence that you're pronouncing it correctly

583
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,600
in a way that I simply could not.

584
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,100
Yeah.

585
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,800
I bought the Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky.

586
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,360
Nice.

587
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
And my wife and I were gonna read it together

588
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,080
as part of this thing.

589
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
This is even before I have kids, so no excuse.

590
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,160
We're gonna read it as part of this book club,

591
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,280
online book club deal.

592
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,680
Nerd.

593
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,640
And we met, we bought two exact same copies

594
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
and we both made it like exactly 40 pages in

595
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
and then promptly put it back up on the shelf

596
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,160
and they sit next to each other.

597
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,920
And it's worse because it's twice,

598
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,000
it's twice the book.

599
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
It's the twin Brothers Karamazov.

600
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,760
It can't just, because there's two,

601
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
they can't just fade into memory

602
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,560
because every time I look at the books,

603
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,120
there's two of these fuckers next to each other

604
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
and I had to take that walk back or I'm like,

605
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
fucking, what was I thinking?

606
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,960
40 pages.

607
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,880
And to this day, some 15 years later,

608
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
Sydney and I'll be looking at books

609
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,200
and I'll still be like, we gotta get back to Brothers Karamazov.

610
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,760
You remember where we were when we left off, right?

611
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,720
What was happening?

612
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,520
I still, there is like a couple of points that are raised.

613
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,800
I'll say, I'll give an example.

614
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,440
One of the characters in Brothers Karamazov says,

615
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,160
the more that I love humanity generally,

616
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,320
the more that I find that I cannot stand individual people.

617
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,040
That's fucking so dope and fresh.

618
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
And it's powerful.

619
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,800
It stood out in my mind.

620
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,640
That's in the first 40 pages.

621
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,480
I don't know what incredible power,

622
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,960
what life-changing nuggets beyond that lie before me.

623
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,040
I couldn't do it, so many nicknames.

624
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,080
No one has read, I would pause it.

625
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
The thicker the book,

626
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
the less chance there is that anyone has read it to completion.

627
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,200
And the thing is that they keep selling

628
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
so that people will, like yourself, put them on shelves.

629
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,600
I've been in a lot of Zoom calls lately

630
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,000
where I've seen a lot of bookshelves in the background

631
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,800
and there's a lot of unbroken spines in there

632
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,480
with big fancy names on them.

633
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,200
I mean, no one has actually read Dostoevsky to completion

634
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,960
because reading that fucking dude's books

635
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,240
makes my nuts fall asleep.

636
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
But I couldn't even finish.

637
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,200
If you know what I mean,

638
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,480
now you know who gets me every time,

639
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,760
he's K.A. Applegate.

640
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
I'll tell you what I remember,

641
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,480
Tobias turned into a fucking hawk too long.

642
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,040
Yeah dude, that's cultural touchstone.

643
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,440
Thank you.

644
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,080
So I've read a lot of them.

645
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,880
You know what I love?

646
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,640
R. L. Stein.

647
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,360
Yes.

648
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
He's got the puppets,

649
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,360
the puppets talk can come alive in the spooky.

650
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,960
I saw the movie Count of Monte Cristo

651
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,680
with Jim Cavieviso and I thought,

652
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,840
what a cool, this is a cool thing.

653
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,360
I need to read this book.

654
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
I started reading the book

655
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,200
and I got about 100 pages in and I was like,

656
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,080
wait a minute, this isn't the Dante that I know.

657
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,600
This isn't, what is happening?

658
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,560
This is boring.

659
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,040
This book is quite different from the movie

660
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
that I enjoyed so much.

661
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,440
Now here's the thing, I will tell you,

662
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,480
I finished it.

663
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
I read that book and I am impressed with myself

664
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
and you should be too.

665
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,920
But it is, in many ways,

666
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,520
way more boring than the Jim Cavieviso movie.

667
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,020
Sure.

668
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
And way longer.

669
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
I did the Jim Cavieviso movie in like an hour 50.

670
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,800
Cranked it up.

671
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,600
The book, that was like six months of reading.

672
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,840
Yeah.

673
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,520
That's the problem.

674
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,680
Okay, I'll give you an example, okay?

675
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,720
Leather Stocking Tales, right?

676
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
James Fenimore Cooper's Leather Stocking Tales.

677
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,480
You got Deer Slayer Last Mohican.

678
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,200
Sounds sexy.

679
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,560
Yeah, the other ones, right?

680
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,240
You try to read that, it's unthinkable.

681
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,160
It's unthinkable.

682
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,600
It's so terrible.

683
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,680
I'll give you an example, okay?

684
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
Leather Stocking Tales is about Natty Bumppo,

685
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,280
which rules, I'll give him that.

686
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,040
Natty Bumppo is fucking good.

687
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,440
But then he's known in these books as

688
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
Leather Stocking, the Pathfinder, the Trapper,

689
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
Deer Slayer, Le Long Carabine,

690
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
which is Long Rifle in French, and Hawkeye.

691
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,680
Those are all names for him.

692
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,160
You know how many names Judge Dredd needs?

693
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,480
One.

694
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,600
Right.

695
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
Because he kicks ass and he's just Judge Dredd.

696
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,600
And that's what his name is.

697
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,960
And then he goes out there and rules.

698
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
He doesn't need eight other names.

699
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,920
They're not like, oh no, the Mr. Bigelaw.

700
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,600
No one has to call him Mr. Bigelaw.

701
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,680
Because he doesn't need a bunch of names.

702
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,400
Right.

703
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,440
I remember, I think it was Deer Slayer,

704
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
having to read that for a summer reading program.

705
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,360
And the first page is, as far as I can recall,

706
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,040
a nonstop run-on sentence that is just one date.

707
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,400
There was a war on this date, and it's just so dense

708
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,160
that I had to reread that one page 18 times.

709
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,120
And I specifically remember, at 17 years old,

710
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,200
being like, oh, OK, not setting me up for success here,

711
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
James Pinnimore Cooper.

712
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,680
Oh, boy, you couldn't start off with, I don't know,

713
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
a sunrise or something.

714
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,920
Give me some kind of, no, you're just starting off

715
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,760
with a history lesson.

716
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,800
Oh, boy.

717
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I remember reading Wuthering Heights,

718
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,560
and it just kind of ended.

719
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,240
And I remember being 16 and being like, this sucks.

720
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm throwing it down.

721
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,560
That fucking Heathcliff dude, he doesn't terrorize

722
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,320
the neighborhood at all.

723
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:46,560
No.

724
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,360
And then when he does, it is just gaslighting

725
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,200
and psychological and not fun.

726
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,000
It's not pranks.

727
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,120
Here is how to free yourself.

728
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,280
And I have actually used this specific technique

729
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,400
that I'm going to share with you.

730
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,200
What you do is, if there's a fancy old writer

731
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
that you think you should be reading,

732
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,040
you feel guilty about it, find another also good writer

733
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
that takes shit on them.

734
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
And then it frees you from, I'll give you an example.

735
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,120
There is actually a pretty famous piece called

736
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,720
Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses by Mark Twain.

737
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,040
And Mark Twain writes a whole essay where he's like,

738
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,400
fuck James Fenimore Cooper, he sucks ass.

739
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,920
And that to me is like, cool, I don't have to read that.

740
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,080
Mark Twain says he sucks.

741
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,680
Here's a quote from that.

742
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,920
In one place in Deerslayer and in the restricted space

743
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,600
of two thirds of a page, Cooper has scored 114 offenses

744
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,960
against literary art out of a possible 115.

745
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,400
It breaks the record.

746
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,240
He fucking dunks on the whole time.

747
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,480
That's so fresh, right?

748
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,720
So now I don't have to read James Fenimore Cooper.

749
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
But the rabbit hole goes deeper

750
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,520
because some people criticize that piece.

751
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,840
There's a quote here, this is from John McWilliams.

752
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,760
Hilarious though Twain's essay is,

753
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
is valid only within its own narrow

754
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,760
and sometimes misapplied criteria.

755
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,560
Fucking great.

756
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,160
Now I don't have to read Mark Twain.

757
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,320
I'm out on him too.

758
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,160
If you keep going down that chain,

759
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,840
eventually all you're left with

760
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
is the worlds of power novelizations of old NES games.

761
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,320
Which is fine.

762
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,920
Only the work of FX9 will survive.

763
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,360
If you go deep enough, you will find like Mark,

764
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,120
like Mark, Luke and John being like,

765
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,560
those novelizations of Mario fucking rule, dudes.

766
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,080
In the old gospels, it's man,

767
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,720
the blaster master novelization of worlds of power

768
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,160
is some real bullshit.

769
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,760
They left out a lot of really cool levels and power ups.

770
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,280
That seems like a pretty good place

771
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,560
to head on over to the money zone.

772
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,960
But first Trav, why don't you tell us a little bit

773
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,080
about this week's organization

774
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
that we're donating our ad revenue to.

775
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
Yeah, we're gonna be donating

776
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

777
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,960
Sylvia Rivera was partners in work with Marsha P. Johnson.

778
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,800
Did a lot of work for the trans community

779
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,840
and the Sylvia Rivera Law Project.

780
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,720
Basically, they're working hard to provide legal services

781
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,560
and protect the rights of trans people.

782
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,840
They focus specifically on people of color and poor people

783
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,120
and fighting discrimination against gender non-conforming folks.

784
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,640
So it's a great organization.

785
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,000
You can check them out at srlp.org.

786
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:40,240
Let's get the money to give to them now.

787
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
I can tell you about an experience

788
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,400
I had this very weekend.

789
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,920
God, I hope it's related to Stitch Fix

790
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,280
because that's who we're supposed to be telling.

791
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
It is, it is, don't worry.

792
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,720
I got me a Stitch Fix.

793
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,760
I opened up their box and I lifted out a shirt

794
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,440
that made me gasp in delight

795
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
and run across the house to find my wife and say,

796
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,920
look at this absolute winner I have just received.

797
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,280
I will post a picture of it.

798
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,640
It is a beautiful shirt.

799
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,760
And here's the best thing.

800
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,120
Covered in anime babes.

801
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
No, there are no anime babes, Griffin.

802
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,320
It kind of looks like fireworks on it,

803
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,800
but in a really cool way.

804
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,840
And the thing is, I didn't pick that shirt out.

805
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,080
It was because my stylist has worked with me

806
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
and I've answered questions

807
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,240
that they were able to say like,

808
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
Travis is gonna love this.

809
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,520
And they were right.

810
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,040
Because that's what Stitch Fix does.

811
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,040
They ask you questions,

812
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,680
they work with you to figure out what your style is.

813
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,840
And then they send things that are your size,

814
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,480
your style, and you try them on,

815
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,840
you keep what you love,

816
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,680
and you only pay for what you keep.

817
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,520
And one of my favorite things about it,

818
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,480
you can say like,

819
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,160
this is how much money I'm comfortable

820
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,360
paying for a t-shirt.

821
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,880
This is how much money I'm comfortable

822
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,400
paying for shorts, right?

823
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,640
And so they won't send you super expensive clothes

824
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,920
that you don't wanna keep.

825
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,720
It's amazing.

826
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,760

Sheet pan, pesto, salmon.

844
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,640
Whoa.

845
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,800
Hot honey butter glazed chicken.

846
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,240
Whoa.

847
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Fettuccini.

848
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,280
Okay.

849
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,240
Meatballs.

850
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,280
And you're hearing me say this,

851
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,760
you're thinking like,

852
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
what is he talking about, a restaurant?

853
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,560
You shouldn't be going out to one of those,

854
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
a place that is dangerous

855
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,960
and you could possibly get COVID from

856
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,920
if they're doing it bad.

857
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,160
Well, no, you goofball.

858
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,640
I'm talking about doing it at home with Blue Apron,

859
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,160
where it's safe in your house

860
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,000
and you can make fettuccini pasta and mushrooms

861
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,520
like you're doing food art.

862
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,800
And right now cooking at home matters more than ever.

863
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,160
I think I've outlined that pretty well,

864
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,680
so I don't have to go into more detail

865
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,840
about why home cooking matters right now.

866
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,840
But Blue Apron is a really good way to do that

867
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,600
because you get a box of fresh quality ingredients

868
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,880
delivered straight to your door

869
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
and then you follow these recipes

870
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,720
and you make tasty, tasty meals

871
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,560
and you learn how to cook.

872
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,160
I did Blue Apron for a long time

873
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,400
and got good at learning how to cook

874
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
and I can make whatever.

875
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,720
Stew, pasta, bread, pudding.

876
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,400
And it's great.

877
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
You create a plan that works for you

878
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,640
with Blue Apron's ever-changing mix of menu options

879
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,800
and prices start as low as $7.49 per serving.

880
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,160
Don't sacrifice flavor.

881
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,360
Don't settle for boring meals.

882
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,840
With Blue Apron, you can enjoy top rated recipes

883

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,440

00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,200
That's BlueApron.com slash my brother, Blue Apron.

888
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,000
Feed your soul.

889
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,500
Whoa.

890
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,160
I started listening to Oh No Ross and Carrie

891
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,680
shortly after I broke my arm

892
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,240
and the doctor had told me I'd never walk again.

893
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
I couldn't get my book started.

894
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,600
I was lost, honestly.

895
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,760
I knew it was time to make a change.

896
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
There's something about Oh No Ross and Carrie

897
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,800
that you just can't get anywhere else.

898
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,320
They're thought leaders, discoverers, founders.

899
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,680
I'd call them heroes.

900
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,080
Ross and Carrie don't just report on French science,

901
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,160
spirituality, and claims of the paranormal.

902
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,520
They take part themselves.

903
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,000
They show up so you don't have to.

904
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,080
But you might find that you want to.

905
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,720
My arm is better.

906
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,000
I can walk again.

907
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,480
I wrote an entire book this weekend.

908
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,800
It's terrible, but I did it.

909
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,720
Just go to MaximumFun.org.

910
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,600
Thank you, Ross and Carrie.

911
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh No Ross and Carrie is just a podcast.

912
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:49,920
It doesn't do anything.

913
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,280
It's just sound you listen to in your ears.

914
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,160
All these people are made up.

915
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,800
Goodbye.

916
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,760
Hey, who's that on the-

917
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,960
Who is it?

918
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,680
It's Lynn.

919
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,240
Hi, Lynn.

920
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,920
I wasn't recording before, but now I am.

921
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,400
Hi, Lynn.

922
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,040
Hi, Lynn.

923
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,520
Hi.

924
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,720
Welcome to the podcast.

925
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,000
We were in the middle of doing the podcast

926
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,880
and now we're just like-

927
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,440
Thank you.

928
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,160
In it.

929
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,800
You're on it.

930
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
This is the podcast.

931
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,520
Longtime fan, third time caller.

932
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,160
Thrilled to be here.

933
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:08,640
Is that right?

934
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,280
There's no way.

935
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,480
I feel like you were just on the one time

936
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
when you were at the public.

937
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,120
And then that time you guys did the Margaritaville Blue Carp.

938
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
And then the other times were live times

939
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,600
when you indulged me saying,

940
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,760
hey guys, I wrote another song about you.

941
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,200
Can I play it at your show?

942
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,520
We've given you a lot of opportunities, huh?

943
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,160
Yeah.

944
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,600
You're so welcome.

945
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,040
I think this is my third time on the podcast.

946
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,600
That's great.

947
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:33,840
Wow.

948
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,560
What an honor.

949
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,760
Make them say Hammer proper.

950
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,960
How are you doing though?

951
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,080
I'm all right.

952
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,400
Whoa.

953
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,680
Oh, fuck.

954
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,280
There's a story behind there.

955
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,160
There's a sadness.

956
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,400
Sadness behind those eyes.

957
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,120
Actually, I'm quite hashtag blessed all things considered.

958
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,000
You're catching me after spending an hour and a half

959
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,440
putting together a play set involving tools.

960
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,800
And as soon as I finished putting together the play set,

961
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,680
my son yelled, yay, and then stubbed his toe,

962
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,520
started bleeding, and started screaming.

963
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,760
Oh my god, did he stub it on the play set?

964
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:10,800
No, no.

965
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,000
He stubbed it on being five and running funny.

966
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,040
So I don't really want to talk about Hamilton.

967
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,880
It is, if anybody cares, it's coming out Disney plus July 3rd.

968
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,760
You can watch it on Disney.

969
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,680
I'm sure you're fucking sick of talking about it.

970
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,720
Sick of talking about it.

971
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,680
I'm sick of talking about it.

972
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm happy to talk to you about anything else.

973
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,560
Any other musical.

974
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,560
Any other musical.

975
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,160
What's going on with Tootsie?

976
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,200
I have this feeling sometimes like Tootsie is still going.

977
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Yeah, like they're still doing it to no crowd.

978
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,960
Yeah, I feel like they're still doing Tootsie probably.

979
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,640
It's come and gone.

980
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Oh man, it was so funny though.

981
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
Poor little Henny out for Tootsie.

982
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,000
Are any musicals going right now?

983
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,840
There is a Phantom of the Opera playing in Seoul, South Korea.

984
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,320
That is the one musical playing in the world right now

985
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,840
because they were serious about their shit and locked it down.

986
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,520
And now they can do Phantom,

987
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,440
which is all about a guy in a mask, weirdly enough.

988
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,800
Yeah, it is weird.

989
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,280
That's the price you get for taking it seriously.

990
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,880
You get to see Phantom.

991
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,800
I was going to ask about the musicals

992
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
that form the DNA of who you are.

993
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
I'm so grateful every time we get a little night music,

994
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,320
courtesy of Justin McElroy,

995
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,080
when he sings in that ineffable-

996
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,040
It's really just that one track though, right, Juice?

997
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,760
You're not like a big night music like hit.

998
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,120
Didn't know it was from that.

999
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,200
So that's where I'm at as far as that.

1000
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
I got had on a Lou Rawls CD when I was younger

1001
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,360
and so it got in my heart that way.

1002
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,920
Musicals that really fought-

1003
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,560
Man, you know, obviously Rent was huge for me

1004
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,760
as Tim Robbins told me at your show, Hamilton.

1005
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,160
Rent taught my generation tolerance, which is huge.

1006
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,200
Huge for Rent.

1007
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,000
Thank you to Rent.

1008
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,280
Big ups to Rent.

1009
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Did you ever dream cast yourself in Rent?

1010
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,960
Did you ever give a thought who you might play?

1011
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm pretty sure that I would be the window washing guy.

1012
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,120
Honest living, honest living.

1013
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,240
That would be a good part.

1014
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,320
Honestly, I would be, and I would be lucky to have it.

1015
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,480
You know, Man of La Mancha was a big one for me.

1016
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,320
That's a cornerstone for me.

1017
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,480
That was my audition song was Man of La Mancha

1018
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,000
for a very long time was my-

1019
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,840
The title track, Man of La Mancha?

1020
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,120
Oh yeah, not Impossible Dream.

1021
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,240
I can't carry that off.

1022
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,000
But I could do like a sort of spoken word intro

1023
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
into the song and then,

1024
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,080
because that gets you like 30 seconds in,

1025
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,840
then there's only 30 seconds of singing after that,

1026
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,720
which is perfect, right?

1027
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,320
I, Lynn and I share this playing Birdie,

1028
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Conrad Birdie in Bye Bye Birdie.

1029
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,760
It is, how old were you when you did it?

1030
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,040
I was, I want to say like 17, 18.

1031
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,840
That's huge.

1032
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,640
When you are at your gangliest and teeniest

1033
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,520
and you play a role in which everyone has to pretend

1034
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,320
to be in love with you,

1035
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,080
I mean, it kind of explains everything about-

1036
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,000
Well, it goes one step further than that, Lynn.

1037
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,600
Our father was the director, Nepotism,

1038
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,760
and one of the creative decisions he made

1039
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,080
was to have Conrad Birdie, myself,

1040
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:24,000
enter from behind a 12 foot tall photograph of myself,

1041
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
a backlit with like fog while everyone cheered for me.

1042
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,000
Your reckless confidence is entirely justified.

1043
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,240
Yeah.

1044
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
Yeah, it's not his fault.

1045
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,240
Can't blame him.

1046
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,600
It's all dad's fault.

1047
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,640
Griffin, you like musicals?

1048
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,960
Yo, King Kong.

1049
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,200
The King Kong musical.

1050
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Seen it, I saw it.

1051
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
Yeah, love that big guy.

1052
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,560
As of last year, I'm officially a Tony voter

1053
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,560
and so I did my due diligence

1054
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
and I saw every show of last season.

1055
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
I thought you were gonna say voted for King Kong.

1056
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
I did see the King Kong.

1057
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
Voted, biggest gorilla, yes.

1058
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,240
It won a special award.

1059
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,040
There are-

1060
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,920
A King Kong award.

1061
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,200
Yeah, biggest King Kong.

1062
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,160
It won a special honorary Tony for being the biggest King Kong

1063
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,120
for taking 14 people to manipulate.

1064
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,880
It has a special Kong, Tony.

1065
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,000
It knocked the shit right out of Noises Off's King Kong.

1066
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,440
That King Kong sucked.

1067
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,640
That King Kong sucked.

1068
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,920
The one in Tootsie was cool though

1069
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,480
because he had sunglasses and he came out on a skateboard.

1070
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,360
He was like, oh man.

1071
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,720
But only 13 people.

1072
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,240
Yeah.

1073
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,800
Hey, Lynn, are there musicals that you are...

1074
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,880
I get this with pop culture sometimes

1075
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,440
where I become fixated or obsessed

1076
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,320
with the idea of something without actually

1077
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,480
having any actual affection for it

1078
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,240
or actually maybe even seeing it.

1079
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,040
I'll give you an example to give you a little time to think.

1080
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,440
There is this musical called Chocolate the Musical

1081
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,080
and it's a one-woman show that this woman tours around with

1082
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,320
and does Chocolate the Musical for like,

1083
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,800
I guess if you have like a meeting of the Red Hat Ladies

1084
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
or something like that,

1085
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,800
she'll come and do musical, Chocolate the Musical.

1086
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,360
The Red Hat Ladies is such a deep pull, Dustin.

1087
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
Not if you know Arnani, man.

1088
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,480
It's pretty much top of mind 24-7.

1089
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,520
Is she a Red Hatter?

1090
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,160
Hell yeah, dude.

1091
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,440
Absolutely.

1092
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,240
The Red Hat Ladies, in case you don't got this,

1093
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,640
is like a society of ladies who wear

1094
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,640
like red Sunday brunch hats and go see shows.

1095
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,840
It's very benign.

1096
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,440
It's not the current connotation of Red Hat.

1097
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
No, it's a very different vibe.

1098
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,120
The other one is the High Fidelity Musical

1099
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,440
which came out for like a few weeks

1100
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,040
and then wasn't anymore.

1101
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
Eight performances on Broadway

1102
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,480
written by my good friend, Tom Kitt.

1103
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,720
That was the musical that put the fear of God in me

1104
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,320
because the same producers produced High Fidelity

1105
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,120
that produced In the Heights, my first show.

1106
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,360
And like for years, they were like,

1107
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,120
what are we going to get High Fidelity on?

1108
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,960
Because that's a no brainer hit.

1109
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,880
Everyone loves the book.

1110
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Everyone loves the like tunes.

1111
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,640
And then it like lasted eight performances.

1112
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,320
And they were basically like,

1113
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,280
once High Fidelity is a hit,

1114
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,760
we'll take a chance on your little show with Latins in it.

1115
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,800
And then it didn't, nothing happened.

1116
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,600
How did your show do?

1117
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,000
It turns out our show did okay.

1118
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,360
But it was scary.

1119
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,520
It was sort of like that was such a surefire hit.

1120
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,240
It had a well-known director, a great composer.

1121
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,200
And it just, you know, no one wants to see Rob sing.

1122
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,960
I guess, yeah.

1123
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
Like the whole thing is that he listens to music.

1124
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
You're making something about the best music ever

1125
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,400
when there's frequent arguments about-

1126
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,160
And you're not allowed to use that music.

1127
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,960
Totally.

1128
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,240
It was an impossible task.

1129
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,080
You want to hear my favorite song?

1130
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,240
I own a record store.

1131
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
That's my favorite song.

1132
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,480
It's always been my favorite song.

1133
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,800
We don't have questions,

1134
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,000
a question from the audience for you.

1135
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,480
Like we sometimes do for guestpert stuff.

1136
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,400
And I've been asking the last few guestperts,

1137
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,680
like, you know, COVID related stuff.

1138
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,000
Like how are you, how, what are you doing at home?

1139
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,440
But I think it would be better to do just a Yahoo.

1140
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,240
Yeah.

1141
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,040
And just like get you on that Yahoo with us.

1142
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,800
Do you feel like qualified to do one of those?

1143
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,480
Completely unqualified, but happy to be along for the ride.

1144
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,200
Wait, okay.

1145
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,880
Just one more quick thing.

1146
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,160
Just Starlight Express.

1147
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,320
Have you seen it, Lynn?

1148
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:26,560
Can I tell you?

1149
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,320
Because that's a musical about trains.

1150
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,880
Yeah, I know.

1151
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,480
And I fucking would love to see that shit.

1152
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,760
By the way, it's based on Thomas the Tank Engine.

1153
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,320
Get out.

1154
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,960
His company is the really useful company

1155
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,760
because he wanted the rights to Thomas

1156
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,880
and it didn't quite happen.

1157
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,680
So he did his own train musical.

1158
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,800
I've never seen it.

1159
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,280
I actually have the ability on that one.

1160
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,000
I remember seeing the commercials and being like,

1161
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,400
well, trains, musicals, where do I sign?

1162
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,360
But my parents didn't have the money, so I never saw it.

1163
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,640
Unfair, unfair.

1164
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,520
Okay, Griffin, I'm sorry.

1165
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,080
I won't talk about any other bizarre musicals.

1166
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,480
Lynn, I'm so excited for you to put your,

1167
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,440
we've never allowed anyone into this particular sanctum.

1168
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,360
And I think you're going to crush it.

1169
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,160
Michelle sent this one.

1170
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,840
It's a Yahoo Answers user who I'm going to call

1171
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,480
Jamuel Miranda asks,

1172
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,720
Super Mario versus yourself in a few scenarios.

1173
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,640
For some random reason,

1174
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,480
Super Mario is teleported into the real world

1175
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,040
with the sole goal to hunt you down and kill you.

1176
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,440
Mario is still bound to his game physics

1177
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,560
and can still jump just as high.

1178
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,840
I'll give you three scenarios that could occur

1179
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,440
and I want you to tell me how they would play out.

1180
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,400
Oh boy. So we can just run down these.

1181
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,040
That went such a different direction than I-

1182
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,800
Yeah, before we get too deep,

1183
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,480
I need to make sure I understand the premise.

1184
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,200
Yeah.

1185
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Mario has been teleported

1186
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,680
into our world Sonic movie style.

1187
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,600
Earth 616 or wherever.

1188
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
Go down a pipe, come up a earth toilet,

1189
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,440
and he wants to kill you so bad.

1190
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:55,840
And that's-

1191
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,680
Okay, so he wants to kill you

1192
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
or he's been tasked with killing you.

1193
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,200
He needs to kill you.

1194
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,640
Okay, that is important

1195
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,160
because I could maybe talk him out of it

1196
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,600
if it's just a job.

1197
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,680
No, you got the pipe inside you that gets him home.

1198
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,320
So anyway-

1199
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,560
Now even that though is a different scenario

1200
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,400
than him just wanting to kill me.

1201
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,680
Okay, he could jump really high.

1202
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,520
Scenario one, you are casually walking outside

1203
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,320
like any normal day.

1204
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,080
You feel safe and are unarmed.

1205
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,040
Suddenly Mario, who is also unarmed,

1206
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,120
comes running at you with the purpose to end your life.

1207
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,440
You know this and prepare to fend off the ambush.

1208
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:27,920
What happens?

1209
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,560
Wait, is he mushroomed or not?

1210
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,080
He's unarmed.

1211
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,200
This is actually huge.

1212
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,040
I need to know scale, right?

1213
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,800
That is my biggest question.

1214
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,960
On the TV, he doesn't look very big.

1215
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,640
Is he a human-sized Mario?

1216
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,600
Is he a human-sized?

1217
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,200
Okay, so he's a human-sized Mario.

1218
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Is he human-sized at the same proportions?

1219
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,360
Because density there is a huge factor.

1220
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,080
He's a dense fella.

1221
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,800
He's quite thick in all the right places,

1222
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
but he's running at you.

1223
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,240
It says he's running at you.

1224
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,920
He's not like walking at you slow,

1225
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,280
imposing, Terminator-style.

1226
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,040
This fucking plumber is sprinting at you, Lynn.

1227
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,160
You have to get high.

1228
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,880
You gotta get high.

1229
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,680
You have to get high.

1230
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,640
Higher than-

1231
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,080
If his whole thing is jumping on you,

1232
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
you gotta get high.

1233
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah, you gotta get to the high ground.

1234
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,720
But now we're in a Donkey Kong scenario.

1235
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,280
Yeah.

1236
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:13,760
Yeah.

1237
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,120
He's not gonna stop.

1238
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:15,680
He's coming.

1239
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,720
You gotta throw barrels.

1240
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,000
You gotta throw barrels.

1241
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Gotta throw some barrels at this fucking guy.

1242
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,760
Could you get under something,

1243
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,440
under something that will protect you?

1244
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,840
That will protect your head from bouncing.

1245
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
Because if it's just Mario running at you,

1246
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,440
he does not have a-

1247
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,000
I mean, I guess he could spin, couldn't he?

1248
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,520
That's the danger.

1249
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,240
Here's my thing.

1250
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,040
There are enemies in Mario that walk slowly at you

1251
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,200
and you wait for them to end you,

1252
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,840
or sometimes they run really fast at you,

1253
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,800
or sometimes they jump.

1254
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,720
I don't think there is an enemy in Mario

1255
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,440
that can fucking punch and kick the way I do.

1256
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,880
So Mario may not-

1257
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,720
He may run at me and start to jump

1258
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,000
and I just kind of move out of the way

1259
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,440
and I fucking punch him in the face.

1260
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,120
He's like, oh, what are these?

1261
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,720
And I'm like, yeah, you motherfucker.

1262
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,360
I punch back.

1263
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,320
He won't understand it.

1264
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:00,880
He won't get it.

1265
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,960
No, he can't process that.

1266
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,840
There is also, I'm now thinking that the Mario games

1267
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,880
would be much different

1268
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,360
if like when a Koopa saw Mario coming,

1269
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,280
they ran away from him.

1270
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,840
Like, I don't want, I'm just walking around, dude.

1271
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,320
Yeah.

1272
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,200
All right.

1273
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,640
I'm a hopping turtle.

1274
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,440
Let's do a bit of, let's do some opposition research here.

1275
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,120
Lynn, you're gonna play the role of Lynn.

1276
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,000
You are quarantining wherever you are quarantining.

1277
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,240
Travis, Justin, and I are gonna be Mario.

1278
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,600
And let me pitch you scenario two.

1279
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,040
You're inside your house

1280
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,960
like any normal person during quarantine

1281
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
and you see Mario trying to break into your house.

1282
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,200
You can defend yourself with anything in your home

1283
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,360
and Mario is armed with a hammer throw power up.

1284
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,440
Wait, a hammer throw power up?

1285
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,680
That's like Donkey Kong.

1286
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,680
He's got the hammer and he's swinging indiscriminately?

1287
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,240
No, he throw.

1288
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,120
Like the Hammer Bros?

1289
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
Yeah, he can throw.

1290
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,600
So I guess take a moment, look around your house

1291
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,440
and in 15 seconds, Justin, Travis, and I

1292
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,040
are gonna come at you with a hammer throw power up.

1293
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,120
And don't say a Tony or anything

1294
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,960
because like that's cheating.

1295
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,000
Because it's very heavy.

1296
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,880
The Tony is a heavy weapon.

1297
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,160
Very heavy and impressive.

1298
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,360
What if Lynn is like, I pick up the big gun.

1299
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,920
By the way, guys, I'm huge into guns

1300
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,920
and this is how I'm announcing it to the world.

1301
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:11,360
Yeah.

1302
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,640
All right, Lynn, your time's up.

1303
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,840
I smash in through the window

1304
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,800
with my big powerful carpenter's boots or plumber's boots

1305
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,760
and now Mario's in your house.

1306
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,240
I activate the Playmobil water table

1307
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,640
I have spent the last fucking hour assembling.

1308
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,560
You're so much slower in water.

1309
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,040
Get at me.

1310
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,080
Okay, okay.

1311
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,120
So you've, okay.

1312
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,320
You're so much slower in water.

1313
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,960
Now I'm just a squid who moves slowly and I'm a threat.

1314
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,200
Okay.

1315
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,360
Oh, that's pretty good.

1316
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,240
I don't know how a water table would flood an entire house.

1317
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:38,800
You shouldn't.

1318
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,080
I'm putting on all the water.

1319
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,800
Just all the water.

1320
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm just, I'm flooding everything.

1321
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,600
Okay, Lynn floods the house.

1322
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,280
Justin, Travis, take the Mario wheel.

1323
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,560
We're just still trying to kill Lynn.

1324
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,120
Is that the idea?

1325
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,960
Yeah, the three of us are trying to kill our friend, Lynn.

1326
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,160
Are we three different Marios?

1327
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,120
No, we're the same Mario.

1328
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,080
I'm gonna take over.

1329
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:52,880
Travis, Travis, you can be Mario now.

1330
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,400
I'm turning this to a water level.

1331
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,440
Get on my level.

1332
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,480
Okay, so you've begun flooding your own home.

1333
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,080
Yeah, the hammer throwing is no longer,

1334
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,040
you can't do that in water.

1335
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:01,520
That's silly.

1336
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,320
Yeah, so I'm gonna break a wall sconce.

1337
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,200
I assume you have sconces off the wall

1338
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,240
and attempt to electric.

1339
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:09,840
Don't fucking dox Lynn.

1340
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,320
I live in an apartment building in Manhattan.

1341
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,080
So you have sconces?

1342
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,000
I have no sconces.

1343
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,320
Ah, fuck, that was the only thing I had.

1344
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,040
Well, now you just see Mario looking for sconces

1345
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,400
and he's just pawing at the wall.

1346
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,520
Travis, waste his turn.

1347
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,440
Lynn, how are you gonna kill Shigeru Miyamoto's best friend

1348
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,360
and video game son, Mario?

1349
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,040
I am going to, because I know that just touching me

1350
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,840
will kill him, because that's how it works in this world.

1351
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,320
I'm going to edge and swim until Mario's close to the window

1352
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,920
and then I'm gonna try to open the window.

1353
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,360
Okay, Justin.

1354
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,480
Because I live several stories up.

1355
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,480
He's right in your fucking trap, Justin, get him.

1356
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,800
I'm gonna push beloved Tony winner

1357
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,520
and multi-talented artist, Lin Manuel Miranda,

1358
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,320
out the window.

1359
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:56,820
Okay.

1360
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:00,720
I'm gonna Wario scowl as I fall out the window.

1361
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,600
All right, we won.

1362
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,040
We killed Lin.

1363
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,480
What is scenario three?

1364
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,200
Let me just read it.

1365
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,960
Hey, who lives, who dies, who tells your story?

1366
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,200
It turns out Mario is who tells your story.

1367
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,040
That's so weird, you didn't see that coming.

1368
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,920
Sorry, but our princess is in another fucking castle.

1369
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,280
Lin, I know you're busy and we've kept you

1370
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,480
for a long time, but I would be remiss

1371
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,240
if I didn't read scenario three.

1372
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,640
You've successfully evaded Mario this whole time

1373
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,320
and managed to locate where he lives

1374
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,240
while he isn't trying to kill you.

1375
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,400
You now have the element of surprise.

1376
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,920
You now have the element of surprise

1377
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,080
and can bring with you whatever you could reasonably

1378
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,440
afford, get a hold of, or make.

1379
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,920
There is no way of knowing what Mario has though.

1380
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
So now the tables have flipped a little bit.

1381
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,320
Mario Lin is in his Manhattan apartment.

1382
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,000
Well, this is getting a little aggro for my tastes.

1383
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,080
Yeah, this is like John Wick shit where it's like,

1384
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,920
okay, now you have to go after them.

1385
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
This is that Van Damme hard target.

1386
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
How does it feel to be hunted?

1387
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,800
I assume he's like little.

1388
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,720
He's not eating a mushroom when he's chilling at home.

1389
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,120
Oh no.

1390
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,280
He's on the run now, if he's hiding out.

1391
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,040
We don't talk about this, but when he eats the mushroom

1392
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,720
and gets big, it hurts his bones so fucking bad.

1393
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,200
His bones and muscles and skins all grow so fast, so much.

1394
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,240
And when he gets small again, his bones don't shrink.

1395
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,680
They just kind of bend.

1396
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,480
It hurts so fucking bad.

1397
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,000
He doesn't eat the mushroom at home unless the princess

1398
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,760
makes him, if you know what I mean.

1399
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,640
I don't understand.

1400
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,880
For his hog.

1401
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,360
For Mario's hog.

1402
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,200
Oh, he eats it too.

1403
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,080
For his hog.

1404
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,400
Okay.

1405
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,880
For his hog.

1406
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,720
The mushroom makes his hog bigger.

1407
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:43,760
Right.

1408
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,240
Lynn, we're going to explain to you in excruciating detail

1409
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,080
the premise of Justin's joke.

1410
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,040
What Justin's saying is that when Mario eats a mushroom,

1411
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,680
his penis not only becomes engorged, but it begins.

1412
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,000
Right.

1413
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
All of them becomes bigger, Lynn, right?

1414
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,880
And so that would include his genitals, which,

1415
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,600
and I guess in this scenario, the princess would want

1416
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,120
like a bigger zone down there.

1417
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,320
Yeah.

1418
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:12,720
Does that make sense?

1419
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,000
So it would make him eat the mushroom so that his penis

1420
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,280
would become larger.

1421
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,360
Explain it back to us, Lynn, just to make sure that

1422
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:20,720
we know that you understand it.

1423
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,880
So Mario is at home, but he's in his half-man form,

1424
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,040
his lowercase form.

1425
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,600
Right.

1426
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
Unless the princess asks him to eat the mushroom,

1427
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,320
in which case-

1428
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,240
Why would she want that?

1429
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,160
And explain it, because I need to know that you got it

1430
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,040
before we can move on.

1431
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,680
It would grow him to double the scale,

1432
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,360
including his genitals.

1433
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:41,840
Right, perhaps.

1434
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,800
And why would that be desired by her?

1435
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,920
Why would she want that?

1436
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,400
Yeah.

1437
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,280
I'm gonna hang up.

1438
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,000
I'm gonna hang up.

1439
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,640
Everybody gets it.

1440
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:50,880
Okay.

1441
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,200
This is great.

1442
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,760
No, I need to know that he understands the benefit.

1443
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,800
It's all good stuff.

1444
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,640
It's all good, fun stuff.

1445
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,000
July 3rd.

1446
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,440
Welcome to Warp Zone.

1447
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,560
July 3rd.

1448
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:01,440
Check it out.

1449
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,720
Disney Plus.

1450
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:03,200
Probably.

1451
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Dude, that will feature Hamilton and the-

1452
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,840
No one tell Disney Plus about this episode.

1453
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,680
It feels funny.

1454
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,240
I don't like the plug after this.

1455
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,120
I don't like the plug.

1456
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,640
Disney Plus.

1457
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:14,400
You can be a double feature.

1458
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,280
Hamilton and the Journey of Nettigan.

1459
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,320
Fire it up.

1460
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,120
Call up Bob Iger.

1461
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,960
Say, I got a podcast for you, bud.

1462
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,400
Gonna love this one.

1463
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,320
Kill our chances of getting on there, actually.

1464
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,080
I'm starting to freak out about it.

1465
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,320
So would you stab him, or-

1466
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,080
I think Lin doesn't have time to kill him.

1467
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,200
What would I do with-

1468
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:36,400
I mean, getting close to him would kill him in that moment

1469
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,600
when he's most vulnerable.

1470
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,000
He's a weak man.

1471
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,520
But would you enjoy that as much?

1472
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,400
I mean, that's a thing.

1473
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,600
Are you saying that you're going to-

1474
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,280
I just wanna be clear, Lin.

1475
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,920
Are you telling me that you're going to kill Mario

1476
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,520
while he's in flagrante in the middle of sexual Congress?

1477
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,840
Is that when you're gonna wait for your moment?

1478
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,760
You fucking nasty dog.

1479
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,520
Come on the podcast, Justin said.

1480
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,680
We'll talk about musicals, Justin said.

1481
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,800
July 3rd.

1482
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,880
We talked, but we did the prerequisite musical conversation

1483
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,080
before we got the meat, the pearl of this oyster.

1484
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,400
In my defense, I did wanna talk about more weird musicals,

1485
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,840
but Griffin made me change.

1486
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,200
You heard that happen.

1487
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:17,840
You heard him.

1488
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,520
Just real quick, though.

1489
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,360
Did you see Spider-Man?

1490
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,920
I didn't.

1491
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,560
I never did.

1492
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,680
I had a friend who was at the first preview

1493
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
and he was a big Spider-Man fan and he was like,

1494
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,440
this isn't even about Spider-Man, dude.

1495
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,800
Fucking kicks ass.

1496
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,000
The guy got hung up and everything stopped and he left.

1497
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,880
That's all I know about Spider-Man.

1498
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,160
That's how it ended every night.

1499
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,560
You never knew what would happen.

1500
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,400
Eventually, Spider-Man would get stuck

1501
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,880
and everybody would bow underneath him.

1502
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,000
That was the end of the musical.

1503
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,920
Okay, Lin, thanks so much for coming on the show.

1504
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,800
It's always such a joy.

1505
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,880
Lin, I'm sorry.

1506
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,440
No, now I feel bad that we made you talk about dirty video game stuff.

1507
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,280
I was, I'm kinda into it.

1508
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:03,920
I'm good.

1509
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,400
Oh, good.

1510
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,400
All right, I got some websites for you to visit

1511
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,480
and I'm sure the rest of the show will help you out with that as well.

1512
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,360
Thanks so much, Lin.

1513
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,800
Thanks, guys.

1514
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:13,520
Appreciate you.

1515
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:19,940
Whoa.

1516
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,320
I wanna munch.

1517
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,040
Squad?

1518
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,540
Squad!

1519
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,700
I want to munch.

1520
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,200
Squad!

1521
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,100
Welcome to Munch Squad.

1522
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,380
It's a podcast with a podcast that features the latest and greatest in brand eating.

1523
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,180
I have wanted to give a bit more introspective time

1524
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:44,820
because I wanted to start off with a bit more introspective of a Munch Squad today.

1525
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,340
Or at least an introspective lead-in to a Munch Squad.

1526
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,020
You know, things are hard right now.

1527
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,500
I didn't know if everybody heard about it.

1528
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,900
Oh, do tell.

1529
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:59,220
Yeah, it's just Earth and I have one shining light

1530
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,020
and I have two kids so you know it's not them.

1531
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,340
I have one shining light that keeps me kind of going when things are hard

1532
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:09,060
and that I do include my children in that.

1533
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:09,560
Right.

1534
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,140
And it's the fact that somewhere on this big blue marble we call Earth,

1535
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:20,260
every once in a while, the boardroom doors at Papa John's fly open

1536
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:27,060
and you hear and there is a large dent made in the top of the door jam

1537
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:32,020
which then cracks as Shaq blows into the room and announces,

1538
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,700
hey idiots, here's the new shit I'm going to lay it out for you

1539
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,180
and you're going to do what I say because everybody hates you except for me, Shaq.

1540
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,420
The only thing keeping everybody from hating you.

1541
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,420
That announcement recently that Shaq made to the boardroom of Papa John's.

1542
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,980
Papa John's introduces the extra large shakaroni pizza.

1543
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,480
Yep.

1544
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,020
Oh, huh, huh, huh.

1545
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:06,740
Is the pizza large or are the individual, I'm sorry, shakaronis?

1546
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,300
There's no pepperoni on it.

1547
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,180
It is pepperoni.

1548
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:14,980
It is a pepperoni free pizza covered in pepperonis which are now shakaronis.

1549
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:24,340
Papa John's announced Monday the launch of the new shakaroni pizza in collaboration

1550
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:26,980
with board member and restaurant owner Shaquille O'Neal.

1551
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,460
No shit.

1552
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,420
Don't say.

1553
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:36,420
I wish that it had said in strict defiance of the wishes of Shaquille

1554
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:40,900
who begged us not to make a shakaroni pizza.

1555
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:48,660
Are they smoky, cured, spiced chunks of Shaq?

1556
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,780
I don't want that.

1557
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,220
No, it's Shaq free.

1558
00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:00,340
Papa John's will donate $1 from every shakaroni sold through August 23rd, 2020 to the Papa

1559
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:05,940
John's Foundation for Building Community, which is a very general and non-threatening

1560
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,420
name of a group which supports communities as they work together for equality, fairness,

1561
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,420
respect, and opportunity for all.

1562
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,620
Here's the quote.

1563
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:19,060
It was important to me for the shakaroni to be bigger than just pizza.

1564
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:25,540
By giving my new pie a try, $1 will be donated to the Papa John's Foundation for Building

1565
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:30,820
Community to support COVID-19 relief, the fight against racial injustice, Boys and Girls

1566
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:36,340
Club of America, the United Negro College Fund, and general community involvement, says

1567
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,100
O'Neal, Papa John's board member and franchise owner.

1568
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:47,860
Conceived by O'Neal himself, the shakaroni is an extra large pizza made with Papa John's

1569
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:54,820
fresh, never frozen, six ingredient dough topped with extra cheese and extra pepperoni

1570
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:00,500
shakaroni, I think they meant to say, and then cut into Papa John's largest slice size

1571
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,300
to date.

1572
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:07,700
Well, now, so I don't mean to be obtuse here, but it sounds like what you're describing

1573
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,100
is a big pepperoni pizza.

1574
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,220
I guess I'm just confused as to where the shakaroni part comes in.

1575
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,380
And let me just say, why not make it like a macaroni and cheese pizza?

1576
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,580
Because then shakaroni totally applies.

1577
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,900
Well, don't even fucking worry about that, Travis.

1578
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,460
Oh?

1579
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:31,060
Because the larger than life pizza is also accompanied by an exclusive Snapchat AR experience

1580
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:38,260
for fans who order the shakaroni using the Snapchat app, customers simply point their

1581
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,620
camera at the pizza box to reveal a 3D surprise.

1582
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:48,740
I don't know what the 3D surprise is, but I assume it's Shaq dressed as Kazam announcing

1583
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,740
that your pizza wishes have been granted.

1584
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,020
What else could it possibly be?

1585
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,020
I don't know what else it could possibly be other than that.

1586
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:01,380
Can I just real quick just dial in on the implications of using the phrase larger than

1587
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:07,460
life when describing a pizza, which would imply that this pizza is larger than existence,

1588
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:13,300
I guess, larger than anything you could conceive based around your time here on Earth.

1589
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:19,140
Here's what's very interesting, is that nowhere in the press release does it define

1590
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,140
the bounds of the pizza.

1591
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:27,140
It is only in relation to other pizza products from Papa John's.

1592
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,820
Maybe it's bigger than Shaq.

1593
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,460
It's big.

1594
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,420
It's very big.

1595
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,060
We can't tell you how big because the law, legally, we can't tell you how big it is,

1596
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,260
but it's extremely big.

1597
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,980
Perhaps the diameter is one Shaq's worth.

1598
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,420
It's a Shaq of, it's a single Shaq of pizza.

1599
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:49,540
Actually, they say it's a, okay, so the CEO of Papa John's, the new good one, I guess,

1600
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,180
not the old one.

1601
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:50,580
Right.

1602
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:56,420
We're excited to combine all the best ingredients for coming together in support of our neighbors,

1603
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,740
a Shaq-sized pizza.

1604
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,900
Now that, to me, I think that's false advertising.

1605
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,940
That could be criminal.

1606
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,740
Or?

1607
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:12,020
Because if it's a Shaq-shaped pizza, then I think, if it's Shaq-sized, like you have

1608
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:14,420
to have, how tall is Shaq?

1609
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,900
Well, now that could mean, that could mean he's 7'1".

1610
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,420
So this motherfucker, even Reggie Fils-Aime's great shame, the Bigfoot pizza, was nowhere

1611
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:25,540
near 7'1".

1612
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:31,700
What I'm saying is perhaps it could be the pizza to satiate Shaq.

1613
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,700
This is a Shaq-sized pizza.

1614
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,460
This is, you have your human-sized pizza, and then you have your Shaq-sized pizza,

1615
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:42,660
just far larger, much like a baby bear, mama bear, papa bear situation.

1616
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,540
This pizza for Shaq is just right.

1617
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:52,500
So, okay, theory, the reason that the dimensions are not listed is because it is on a sliding

1618
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,140
scale during which, in the morning, Shaq consumes an amount of pizza.

1619
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:00,980
He has continually brought pizza until he announces, Shaq has sated.

1620
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,180
I will have no more pizza.

1621
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:08,420
And then you know, for that day, that's the day, for that day, that is the size of the

1622
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,140
Shaqaroti pizza.

1623
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:14,500
Much like you used to measure the length of the king's forearm, and that was the unit

1624
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,100
of measure, and then it would fluctuate based on who the royalty was in question.

1625
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,460
It depends on Shaq.

1626
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,220
Maybe Shaq is feeling a little stopped up, hasn't had a good BM in a while, isn't all

1627
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,180
that hungry.

1628
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,340
That's a tiny pizza that day.

1629
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:33,380
He skips pizza that day, because he has a terrible stomach bug.

1630
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,460
Because he's only been eating pizza.

1631
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:38,020
That day you order the Shaqaroti pizza, you get nothing.

1632
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:41,140
You get absolutely nothing.

1633
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,940
Good day, sir.

1634
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:43,780
Good day, sir.

1635
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,580
You lose.

1636
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,500
That's a Shaqaroti pizza.

1637
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,780
I think that that's wonderful.

1638
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:57,300
I'm so happy that Shaq is finally getting his hands on the dough over there.

1639
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:00,340
I'm just glad he's finally found something he's comfortable putting his name on.

1640
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:07,140
I have been sitting here trying to think of another way of blending an NBA All-Star player's

1641
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,620
name with a type of salami.

1642
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:13,220
And I think it's so bad, man.

1643
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,020
So poorly.

1644
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:16,740
Mug salami.

1645
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,580
That feels like Punxsutawney Phil's breath.

1646
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,140
That's nothing.

1647
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:24,180
Mug salami Phil.

1648
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:30,500
I thought in my head Dikembe Chorizo, but that felt like absolutely nothing.

1649
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:33,540
Yeah, I mean, I like the flavor.

1650
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:36,740
Chorizo Barclay?

1651
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,540
Like Charles Bar- No, because you can't say that.

1652
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:39,940
You can't.

1653
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,140
That's like naming.

1654
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:44,180
I have named this pizza Chorizo Barclay.

1655
01:01:44,180 --> 01:01:45,460
It's its name.

1656
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:46,020
That's no good.

1657
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:46,980
That's no good.

1658
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:51,220
Well, it sounds like a good-

1659
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,500
Scotty Pippinroni.

1660
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,980
But we already did pepperoni.

1661
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,980
We just said Shaq in there.

1662
01:01:58,820 --> 01:01:59,540
That's true.

1663
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:00,040
Fuck.

1664
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,820
Folks, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1665
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,020
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1666
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:08,180
We hope you're staying safe, staying cool.

1667
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:11,860
Staying cool.

1668
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,220
Keeping the heat off.

1669
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,660
Just as important as staying safe, Justin says.

1670
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:17,540
Staying cool.

1671
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,300
And you got to be safe with those fans.

1672
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,620
Sometimes those fans, those blades move really fast.

1673
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,980
They go so fast.

1674
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:23,620
No, thanks.

1675
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:25,700
Sorry, guys.

1676
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,820
I'm just looking at a list of NBA all-star names.

1677
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,580
I'm really down a fucking well right now.

1678
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,940
But thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song

1679
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:35,780
into Departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1680
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:42,500
It's a powerful song, powerful anthem of Summertime rejuvenation.

1681
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:47,700

There's only a couple more weeks to preorder the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

I believe it comes out, what, the 14th?

1688

Something like that.

1689
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,740

1696
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:24,580
It's way better than Dickens or any of them old jerks.

1697
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,740
Here's a final Yahoo.

1698
