1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,680
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm your sweet baby brother, 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,720
Ladies and gentlemen, I am so pleased to be the ones to reveal to everyone who didn't watch the

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,440
Super Bowl last night that Spuds McKenzie is back. He's back. Yeah, Spuds is back. Big dog.

10
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:18,160
The big dog is back, and he's starring in like the only commercial that like did something.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,280
It was like the only commercial that I remember because it had a dog that drank beer, which is

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,880
very, very good. Very good. It's very, very good stuff, and every other commercial was like,

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,160
oh no, my dumb ugly brother turned into a babe because of this product.

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:43,920
Ha ha ha. Tight. My brother's so smoking hot now. So congratulations, Spuds McKenzie,

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
and whatever beer product I don't quite remember you represent because you've won it.

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,480
You won the big game. But it's easy to remember because the name's right in there sort of.

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,680
No, that's not it. I'm pretty sure it's Yuengling. I think it's McKenzie. I think it's big dog beer.

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,400
I think it's called big dog beer. That's right, Travis, because it tastes

19
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,600
so bad, and dogs will drink it, too. That's the flavor profile.

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,640
It's actually made for dogs. That's what most people don't know.

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,200
But humans can drink it, too. That's Spuds' tagline.

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,840
So Spuds McKenzie was created in 1987. Everybody got very upset.

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,040
So was I.

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,760
Yeah, exactly. Everybody got very upset about Spuds McKenzie because they thought that it was

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:34,720
marketing beer to kids because it was a shale-fun dog, right? And they retired Spuds in 1989

26
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,800
because there was a lot of controversy that this was targeted at kids.

27
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,640
So that seems silly, but then Spuds McKenzie shows back up in 2017, and I was nine when he

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,320
went off the air, and I was pretty fucking stoked to see Spuds McKenzie. So there is a chance that

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,160
maybe he did, in fact, have a large market impact on America's youth.

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,720
To be fair, credit where credit is due, though, I did appreciate how this time they made sure

31
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,680
that this Spuds McKenzie commercial was not for kids, that this was for adults only,

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
and it was just a lot of dog boners.

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,600
A lot of dog hogs. That is a good point, Travis. And I was made uncomfortable by

34
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,360
the many dog penises, and I looked away and I made my family look away.

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,200
Tone Loke's song, Funky Cold Medina, lists Spuds McKenzie as one of the dogs trying to get into

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,880
his house. So now that's another one for Tone.

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,640
I don't remember Funky Cold Medina having that much plot in it.

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,200
Yeah, there's a long plot of Funky Cold Medina.

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,800
Is there a verse that's just like, and then I shut the door, and then it's not a problem anymore

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,040
because dogs can't get through doors unless they have a special door installed in the door.

41
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,440
And I don't have it.

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,240
My god, the window. I forgot to close it.

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,880
It's actually kind of an epic poem, really. It's the Gilgamesh of our time.

44
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,160
The harpies crashed my boat.

45
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Oh, what? Why are you on a boat now?

46
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,680
The fleece was mine. Wild thing.

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,840
We weren't fooled, Tone. We weren't fooled.

48
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,360
We weren't fooled by your theft, by your beat theft.

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,240
How about that football game, too?

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,960
Because a lot of people were confused during the point where they lost the ball

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,200
and they couldn't play for a little bit because the ball was gone.

52
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,760
You remember?

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,840
I guess one of the boys threw the football super hard and then like,

54
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,360
and I was watching on the camera, they had all those wonderful cameras filming it.

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,840
And I swear to God, I just couldn't see where the ball went.

56
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,040
And then they couldn't play for a while until somebody ran into Toys R Us and bought a new

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,840
football.

58
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,040
You know, Griffin, the craziest part of the game to me,

59
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,920
what I thought, what I thought was the craziest part,

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,800
where the game ended in a tie and the Birdmen and the American soldier men,

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,240
they were like, we did great.

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,320
Everybody played good in it.

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,400
And they shook hands and they were back in their locker rooms getting changed.

64
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Some of them were already in their khakis.

65
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,600
And then like somebody ran in, they're like, wait, wait, wait.

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
We just checked the rule book.

67
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,000
We have to keep going.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
And it can't end in a tie.

69
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,200
And they were like, what?

70
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,280
Yeah, you have to keep playing.

71
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,000
And so half of them were still out in their khakis and polos,

72
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,240
exchanging Christmas gifts.

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,800
Yeah.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
And then they were like, OK, well, let's play some more.

75
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,760
Sorry, Justin makes a good point that the season goes through Christmas.

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,360
So they don't get to celebrate Christmas until after the Super Bowl.

77
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
And it's really, where's that movie?

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,480
It's Super Bowl Christmas.

79
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,520
Where's that film?

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,480
That's what I want to see.

81
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,920
So yeah, I remember now Travis hearing about it in the news.

82
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,800
They ran in the locker room.

83
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,000
They're like, it can't end in a tie.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,520
And they're like, well, this is unprecedented.

85
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,000
What should we do?

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,960
And they're like, I don't know.

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,040
We could flip a coin to decide the fate of the final football game.

88
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,560
Are you sure that's a good idea?

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, let's just flip a coin.

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
It's like the last football game and the whole planet is watching

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,440
and other planets are also tuned in.

92
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
And yeah, we got a tie on our hands.

93
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Let's just flip an old coin.

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
We're going to let one of you boys try to do a touchdown.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
And the other guy's like, can we try to do it too?

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
No, sorry, they guessed which side the coin would be on

97
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,360
because it's football.

98
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,800
It's football, you know?

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
I did like how they did it.

100
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
It was just a one-on-one touch.

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,120
So one guy with the ball, one guy trying to stop him.

102
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,520
It was like some like NFL, you know, like 2K sports kind of stuff

103
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,160
where just one guy were running and the other guy chasing him.

104
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,640
And he did get in the touchdown zone.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,520
He did get in there.

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,760
Yeah.

107
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
Spencer Kinsey's real name was Honey Tree Evil Eye.

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
And she was from Pennsylvania.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
Holy fucking shit.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
It was a lady.

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,440
Did you know that?

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,080
A lady dog.

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,680
Spud McKenzie was a lady dog named Honey Tree Evil Eye.

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,040
Do you think that they cast a lady dog so that they wouldn't have to deal with dog boners?

115
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
With the dicks, yeah.

116
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
That seems like a 100% probability scraps.

117
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
I would put that on 100.

118
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,680
Yes.

119
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,720
I love he's the original party animal and I loved it.

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,600
He just loved the party and he was out there having good times

121
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,960
and he cared about friends.

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,360
It was weird to me the overtly sexual attention

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,600
that Spud McKenzie received from ladies in print ads.

124
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,880
That seemed troubling.

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
Yeah, she loved him.

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,640
They loved him.

127
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
Yeah, but it's still a dog.

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,120
It's not like Joe Camel where it's an anthropomorphicized camel.

129
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,600
Oh, yeah.

130
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
I'll fuck Joe Camel for sure.

131
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,080
Right.

132
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,920
I thought that Lady Gaga's performance in the middle of the game was a big surprise.

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,760
Very few people saw that coming that she was going to show up

134
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,000
and put on a little concert for everybody.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,720
I love the duet between her and Spud McKenzie.

136
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:40,960
Yes.

137
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Which it was scary at first because at first they thought it was just a wild dog storming the field

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,680
so they tried to shoot the dog.

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,560
But this is no dog's purpose.

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,920
He avoided all of the shots and he got up on stage

141
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,800
and Lady Gaga was like, please stop shooting at me and this dog

142
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,400
and then they sang all their songs.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,560
Wasn't expecting Lady Gaga's performance which was fucking phenomenal

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,720
to be quite such a stunt spectacular

145
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,280
because boy, she just kept jumping off of things.

146
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Do you think that there was someone when she jumped off the top of the arena who went,

147
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,920
well, that's the end of the show, I guess.

148
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,640
Is this art?

149
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
Is this part of the performance art?

150
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,600
Jesus.

151
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,800
She also had a flotilla of robots at her command

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,720
and if I had given you an infinite amount of time,

153
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
if you put a bunch of monkeys in a room with typewriters

154
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,240
and given them an infinite amount of time to guess what Lady Gaga would do

155
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,560
with a flotilla of robots at her command,

156
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
I bet pretty low on the list would be form an American flag

157
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,160
and then later the Pepsi logo.

158
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,960
It seems like that would not be how Gaga would use her flotilla of robots.

159
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,880
No, I mean, she would basically be like a fucking Call of Duty villain.

160
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,840
She would fucking use those drones to take over the Pentagon or something like that.

161
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,880
This is Gaga's country.

162
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,880
This is one nation under Gaga now.

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,280
When she jumped, there was this moment where I was like,

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
are they gonna form a fucking glider underneath her?

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Like Green Goblin style?

166
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Oh my.

167
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,400
I was so excited.

168
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,680
Megamind shit.

169
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,640
Yeah, exactly.

170
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,840
I was so excited.

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,920
But no, no big gray six action.

172
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,560
Oh man.

173
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,520
Travis just made a dope Megamind, Paul.

174
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
I love Megamind.

175
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,240
This is a good movie, man.

176
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
You didn't get the press it deserved.

177
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,560
You've got to Megamind, dude.

178
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,160
That flick though.

179
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,000
Can we do a retroactive Megamind watch?

180
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
Hell yeah, anytime.

181
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,840
Go watch Megamind.

182
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,800
It's great.

183
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, hell yeah, dude.

184
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,560
Megamind at one point puts on a hologram that for some reason,

185
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,800
inexplicably looks like Greg Kinnear.

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
Like almost exactly like Greg Kinnear.

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,280
Aw, sick.

188
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,480
Never addressed.

189
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
There's Neil Young's song.

190
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
It's the anti-sellout anthem called This Note's For You.

191
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Obviously parodying the Budweiser thing.

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
And Neil Young says he ain't singing for Spuds in the title track of the album.

193
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,280
Man, Neil Young, you really fucking stuck at the Spuds McKenzie.

194
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Damn Neil, you really made me think about some stuff by slamming that beer dog.

195
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,680
I really need to reevaluate some stuff because Neil put forward another thinker.

196
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
You really put that fucking dog on blast.

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,360
You taught that dog.

198
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,640
Can we do the stuff that we do?

199
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,360
Griffin Spuds McKenzie is back.

200
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
I know and I'm fucking feeling it.

201
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
I had a hard time sleeping last night.

202
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,840
You don't remember it.

203
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,000
Of course I remember it.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
It's a dog that likes to party on beer with friends.

205
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,360
There is a pretty good, though, like in an alternate reality where Spuds McKenzie did

206
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,400
not exist in 1987 to 1989 and he just appeared last night.

207
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,120
That ad would have set the world on fire.

208
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,280
Are you kidding me?

209
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,880
Why is the dog a ghost?

210
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,840
Why is he talking?

211
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,280
Why does he drink beer?

212
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,040
Why does he want you to party with your buds?

213
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,080
I do not understand.

214
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,640
Hi, kids.

215
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,520
This is three old man macros talking to you now.

216
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:08,000
There was a time in America where an animal was your go-to beer selling device.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,320
For example, three frogs, each one saying Budweiser.

218
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,640
Doesn't sound funny to you now, but back in our day, that was the shit.

219
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,240
It was on t-shirts.

220
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
Everybody referenced it everywhere.

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,360
There was the Coors Light Snake and he would just show up and you would reach into your

222
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,880
fridge and you would be like, time for a nice, crisp, natural light.

223
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
Ow, fuck!

224
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
And then you would pull back your hand.

225
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,360
You have been bitten and you die.

226
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,080
And then it is sort of a morality tale.

227
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,840
I believe Coors Light had a wolf.

228
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,520
Yeah, a sweet wolf.

229
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,080
Pretty sure.

230
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,120
It is just, I am looking at Wikipedia now.

231
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
It is just the Coors Snake.

232
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,760
You know, I am just now realizing that the Budweiser frogs were referenced in our television

233
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
program and Spuds McKenzie wasn't.

234
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,040
So there goes another shot of relevance.

235
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,440
Fuck.

236
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
That we could have, oh well.

237
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
Let's please God.

238
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,400
Okay, we are not going to have another one of those shows.

239
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,000
He was just called Beer Wolf?

240
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,640
Sorry, what?

241
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,040
The Coors Light Wolf was just called Beer Wolf.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,040
Beer Wolf?

243
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,960
I think it was supposed to be a play on Werewolf.

244
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,440
He started up his own podcast network.

245
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,640
For somebody who has never heard it said out loud.

246
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
I think so.

247
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Beer Wolf?

248
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,680
That is kind of like, oh well.

249
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,280
All right, Beer Wolf.

250
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,840
And Beer Wolf came out before Spuds McKenzie.

251
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,240
So Spuds McKenzie was the Hydrox or the Oreo or whatever.

252
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,640
Hey guys, I am a huge Space Jam fan.

253
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,040
Fuck yeah.

254
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
And for Christmas, my friend ordered me a Michael Jordan Space Jam jersey.

255
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,400
However, he lives across our big ass state and while the jersey was supposed to arrive

256
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,600
while I was visiting, it didn't.

257
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,600
He said he will mail it to me when it arrives, but now it is February and still no Space Jam jersey.

258
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,360
I really want this jersey.

259
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
So how do I ask him the status of my Christmas gift without sounding like a greedy asshole?

260
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
That's Hannah from Texas.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
You gotta get this jersey.

262
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
You gotta get the jersey.

263
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,920
You gotta get the jersey.

264
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
You gotta get it.

265
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,800
There's no social faux pas too great if it ends with you wearing the Space Jam,

266
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,360
Toon Squad, Jordan jersey.

267
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,840
Holy shit, that's a good look though.

268
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,800
That's a good look.

269
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,240
Can you imagine like rolling up to like your your weekly just like pick up basketball game?

270
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,520
Oh, but what's that?

271
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,400
You have a sweet ass new Space Jam jersey?

272
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,840
Yeah, I don't want to play with you.

273
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,120
You have cartoon stretch powers and that's absolutely cheating.

274
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,280
I won't be party to that.

275
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:38,720
Could you tell your friend that you're trying to line up your Halloween costume a little

276
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,800
early this year and you just want to confirm thumbs up or thumbs down status of the jersey?

277
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,000
Hmm, I mean you could also just tell them that since you told me that this thing exists

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
and it belongs to me, my life has been spent in anguish every moment that I know it's

279
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,840
mine but I do not have it and the only way to bring peace to my troubled mind is for

280
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,600
you to either come to me and give me the jersey personally or mail it right now and I will

281
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,040
Venmo you some cash.

282
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,080
That seems like a pretty good actually like I don't think it's rude to let your friend

283
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,920
know that your frothing demand increases for this jersey.

284
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,280
Like you only, this is all you can think about.

285
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,520
Please, please release me from this prison.

286
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
It's all I can think about.

287
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,120
Please, why have you done this to me?

288
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,520
What if you get the jersey and you had to work so hard you did drive all the way from

289
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,040
you know, from East Texas behind the Pine Curtain all the way over to Amarillo and you're

290
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,680
like I've made my journey, I finished my quest, let me get that jersey and you open

291
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,480
it up and you look at the back and it says Jorbin on it and you're like who would make

292
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:50,960
this?

293
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,200
Who would even make, who would print this jersey out and be like yeah, thank you for

294
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,120
calling Toon Squad Jersey Manufacturing.

295
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
This is Greg, how can I help you?

296
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,320
And you're like let me get one that says Jorbin on it and you're like are you sure

297
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,360
because I've seen the movie many times and we kind of make, we kind of make like novelty.

298
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
You sure Jorbin?

299
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,520
Yeah, that was the man's name Michael Jorbin number 26.

300
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,680
And you get so mad and you throw it in fire and you scream at your friend only to them

301
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,480
find out that that was a limited edition like misprint that's worth a million dollars.

302
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,720
Or not, his name really is Michael Jorbin and we've all been saying it wrong this whole

303
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
time but he's a very polite man.

304
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,600
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

305
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,280
Are you worried about Space Jam 2 in that?

306
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,960
No, just hold on a second.

307
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,720
Now just hold on one second, just one second.

308
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
Justin's about to say something super important and we almost missed it.

309
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,000
No, I'm serious.

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,280
This is very important.

311
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm a little worried that our social media just existences once Space Jam 2 becomes closer

312
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,000
to fruition is just going to become untenable.

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
Oh, I've been thinking about leaving Twitter for quite some time and I think that's going

314
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
to be the ol' escape pod.

315
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,400
It's going to be the one, right?

316
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,120
Because it's just going to be a lot of people tweeting Space Jam 2 information at us pretty

317
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,080
much constantly.

318
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah, maybe we should just start like a separate account that's just for people to tweet Space

319
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,160
Jam 2 information too.

320
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,560
Right, and it insta-deletes the tweets after they're sent.

321
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,400
Okay, Griffin, I'm ready for that Yahoo.

322
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,920
Here it comes and it's from Rachel Rosen, game recognized game.

323
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,480
Thank you, Rachel.

324
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,680
It's Yahoo Answers user.

325
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:44,000
They are anonymous, but their name is Jorban asks, why do most butlers came from England?

326
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,840
Why do most butlers came from England?

327
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,040
No additional details provided or required.

328
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,120
Hey, what's up?

329
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:00,080
My name's Stevie and I'm here to polish your China.

330
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,440
So what do you got?

331
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,240
Some silverware?

332
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,800
Let me see that.

333
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,640
Rub, rub, rub.

334
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,120
Got it.

335
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,640
My name's Stevie, by the way.

336
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,160
I am from Minneapolis.

337
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,720
Okay, straight talk.

338
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,480
Real question here, brothers.

339
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,840
Have you in your lives ever actually encountered a butler?

340
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,560
Ah, geez.

341
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,560
A personal physical encounter with a butler.

342
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,480
Like you've gone to someone's home and the door was opened by like an Alfred Pennyworth

343
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,280
looking dude.

344
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,800
Dude, we're not talking about like a, you know, a person you hire to help clean or whatever.

345
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,680
You're talking about an actual like besuited butler.

346
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,200
Yeah, this is a person who like lives in the home, who like answers the door and brings

347
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,280
people to the parlor to meet the master of the house.

348
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,200
I guess not.

349
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,240
Pretty much no.

350
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,760
No, right?

351
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
I don't know that they exist.

352
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
I don't think I've been told.

353
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
No, they do exist.

354
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,760
I watched this amazing show called You Can't Get the Help.

355
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,520
It was from England, but it was a react.

356
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,320
Yeah, exactly.

357
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,200
There's a long tradition there of this sort of thing.

358
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,480
I think culturally people understand it better there.

359
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
I'm just going to say the butlers are better in Britain is what I'm going to say.

360
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
Wow, I happen to think American butlers are the best.

361
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,320
I mean, we don't know.

362
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,720
We don't know.

363
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,520
They don't exist.

364
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
Yeah, that's the thing.

365
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,920
One of the episodes I watched, this is your fella, this old fella, was trying to find someone

366
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,640
to take care of his weapon collection, who could like really do it up right, like all

367
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,840
his Asian weapons.

368
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:47,280
And it was pretty much, the episode was pretty much this stream of young men coming in wanting

369
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,720
to check out old weapons and him like grilling them about how sweet they were and then echoing

370
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,280
that like they are in fact sweet and here's some sweet and like how you would swing them

371
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,480
and stuff like that.

372
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:58,800
Wow.

373
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,000
And then like quizzing them on their application of how sweet they were to swing to be able

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,840
to use these ancient weapons.

375
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,040
That's a cool life.

376
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
It's a cool life.

377
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,920
That's a cool life you put together there for yourself.

378
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,000
Congratulations to you.

379
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,280
Can I become the world's first American butler?

380
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
I think I'd be pretty good at it.

381
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,080
You've got so much to overcome.

382
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,440
I don't think so.

383
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,280
I like nice things and I like people who like nice things and I think I can I think I can

384
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,560
help their things seem nicer.

385
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,240
That's what that's what a butler does, right?

386
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,800
They like, hello, I'm here to make the things seem nicer.

387
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,240
But say that in an American accent, Griffin.

388
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,960
Oh, hey, what's up?

389
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,360
I'm Griffin.

390
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,440
I'm here to make your things seem nicer.

391
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,080
No, you're not.

392
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,040
You're here to rob me.

393
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,840
Get out.

394
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,320
No, I'm not.

395
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,040
Look at my suit.

396
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,840
Look at my cool suit.

397
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,960
Look at my little mustache.

398
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,000
It's fun and flirty.

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,040
Let me inside and I'll make your things seem nicer.

400
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,920
Yeah, come on.

401
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,400
Come on.

402
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:48,880
What are you doing?

403
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,360
What are you doing?

404
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
Oh, you're having friends over for chili.

405
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,840
Hi, welcome.

406
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,040
I'm Griffin, the butler.

407
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,160
Please come in for chili.

408
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,680
They've sold teens.

409
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,120
Let's get you out of those wet clothes.

410
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:58,800
Hold on.

411
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:08,320
So the reason that we don't I think the reason that we have not encountered an American butler

412
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,800
is in our day to day is like it would be I would think fairly expensive to keep a human

413
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
on retainer, right?

414
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,320
Like to keep a person who lives at your house and does it for you would be expensive, right?

415
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,720
Yeah.

416
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,280
Yes.

417
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,440
Bob euchre's character was a sports writer and his wife went to law school.

418
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,480
What in the living fuck are they doing with a butler?

419
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,000
First of any butler.

420
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,720
But it's like fucking like class distinction.

421
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,520
And also warm hearted, if I may, Mr.

422
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,720
Belvedere, I do not understand how they are affording Mr. Belvedere level talent on a

423
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,840
sports writer salary.

424
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,320
It does.

425
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,560
I cannot and his wife is racking up law school bills and she's like, yeah, I love one.

426
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,680
I love a butler.

427
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,360
I assume an inheritance.

428
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,840
Is that an inherit Mr.

429
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Belvedere?

430
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,080
That seems okay.

431
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,160
I thought inheritance of money.

432
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,320
But now that you mentioned it, maybe, maybe Mr.

433
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,520
Butler served euchre senior inventor of the card game where all of his money came from.

434
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,480
And then he just passed Mr.

435
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
Belvedere down to his son, Bob.

436
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,000
I'd rather not know.

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,640
Come on.

438
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Well, there's streaks on all the China.

439
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,880
I know I was not crazy about this, but when I saw the fucking streaks on the China, I

440
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
was like, I got to get in there and do my shit.

441
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,240
Gonna get nasty on them.

442
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't I just don't get it.

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,840
Like they just put that up there and expected us to all sort of swallow it.

444
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,360
And I don't understand.

445
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,280
It doesn't make sense how they could afford Mr.

446
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,080
Belvedere.

447
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,800
I don't get it.

448
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,480
I might get on some love actually shit here for a second, but you know how when British

449
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,320
people are in America and they talk, people like, that's fancy.

450
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
And so that I think that's why I think that's why we make that association.

451
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,520
I think the reverse would be true where if I went to London and I was like, hey, what's

452
00:21:59,520 --> 00:21:59,680
up?

453
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm a butler.

454
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,280
They would hear my particular manner of speech.

455
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,680
And it would be like, that's a fancy boy.

456
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,120
Gotta have him in my house.

457
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,760
Gotta have him, you know, waxing my cars and teaching my kids some valuable lessons.

458
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,680
That's what that's what was meaningful to me is I would show up and I would make I

459
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,800
would invite people into the parlor and I would like help them throw great parties.

460
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,440
But then the kids would come to me and be like, I don't know about school.

461
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,520
And I'd be like, fucking tell me about it, dude.

462
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
And then they would be enriched.

463
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,160
And you teach them like skateboard and skateboard and be cool and how to like smoke.

464
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,920
Yeah.

465
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,280
I just want to know where to find an American butler.

466
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
I just won't.

467
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,600
I just want to know about one American butler or maybe one of us could become the first.

468
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,640
I would hire Griffin as my butler.

469
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,760
Yeah, thanks.

470
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,360
This would be a pretty good butler.

471
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,000
I know.

472
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,960
That's what I'm saying.

473
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,200
Because I'll do whatever the fuck.

474
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,080
Yeah, I won't complain, you know, whatever the fuck.

475
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,120
How is a butler different from a valet?

476
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,720
They're not.

477
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm not.

478
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,480
I'm both.

479
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,440
You can fire me whenever you want to and I will not make a big deal out of it.

480
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,960
That's like my number one thing.

481
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,480
Like this is, I'm at your leisure and then I'm gone.

482
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,280
Bye.

483
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
Richie Rich had a butler.

484
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,600
He's American, isn't he?

485
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,920
I want to seriously, I want to put you guys in the headspace for a second there.

486
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:20,320
Imagine for Christmas that I said, I am buying you one year of butler.

487
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,040
You each open the envelope and it's just a name.

488
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,360
It's like Figginsworth.

489
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,280
Mr. Figginsworth is coming to your house, okay?

490
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,000
Yeah.

491
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,120
Can you imagine just from like a social anxiety, can you imagine the mental math knowing as

492
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
what you do today?

493
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,920
Mr. Figginsworth shows up today.

494
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,360
Can you imagine the mental math you would have to run every time?

495
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,040
I would never ask him to do anything.

496
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,920
No, another plate of pizza rolls, sir.

497
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,360
Yes, thank you, Figginsworth.

498
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,800
I wouldn't know.

499
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,920
Can I ask him to clean the windows?

500
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,880
I have no fucking clue.

501
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,240
Can I ask him to go get my coat?

502
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,960
It's right upstairs.

503
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,240
I just got to get it myself.

504
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,040
Shall I change the rechargeable batteries in your Xbox controller, sir?

505
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,160
Yes, thank you.

506
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
The only impact he would have on my house is like I would have to open up another account

507
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,640
on Netflix so he could have like his own shit.

508
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
Because other than that, I cannot fathom worldwide ask him to do anything.

509
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,800
I would have the confidence to ask him to do anything.

510
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
No, I'll get that, Figginsworth.

511
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,960
Can I do your dishes, Figginsworth?

512
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
Please, please, please.

513
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,880
It's fine.

514
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,920
You always do it.

515
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,480
Well, sir, you always do it, Figginsworth.

516
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:22,980
Figginsworth.

517
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,560
Take a break.

518
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,240
It's your day, Figginsworth.

519
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,800
Today's your day.

520
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,920
What do you want to do?

521
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,800
I'm your butler.

522
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,400
Look at the chore wheel, Figginsworth.

523
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,200
It's your day off.

524
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,840
Go fly a kite.

525
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,080
Go buy and fly a kite, Figginsworth.

526
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
Here's some money.

527
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,880
I love you, Figginsworth.

528
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,680
Hey, hey.

529
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I love you, Figginsworth.

530
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,460
Love you.

531
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,200
Love you.

532
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,440
Sorry I didn't ask you to do anything this month.

533
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,240
Maybe next month.

534
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,880
Maybe next month.

535
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,920
You'll get there, sir.

536
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
Thank you, Figginsworth.

537
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,480
Would you like me to ask me to do stuff for you, sir?

538
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,040
Yes, please.

539
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,760
That would be great.

540
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah, that'd be great.

541
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,600
The thing about butlers they don't tell you is that they have to take their time off while

542
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,640
you're sleeping.

543
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,880
So if you go to sleep, that's when the butler really can play.

544
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,720
And if you hear him roaming around your house sometimes, that's just because that's the only

545
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,520
free time he gets.

546
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,200
So he's got to make the most of it.

547
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,700
Yeah.

548
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,080
Did you beat Dishonored 2 while I was asleep?

549
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:16,720
Yes, sir.

550
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,920
I was playing that.

551
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,560
I was playing that.

552
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,760
You jumped onto my save.

553
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,560
I took care of it for you, sir.

554
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,200
Well, it's like I didn't need you to.

555
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,840
I mean, I was struggling in that segment.

556
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,520
Oh, you brought it down to low chaos?

557
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,400
Nice.

558
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,880
Nice.

559
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,200
Yes.

560
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,640
Lord Gregory dies at the end.

561
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,680
No, Figginsworth.

562
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,640
Figginsworth.

563
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,680
You're fired.

564
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,240
No, sir.

565
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,600
No, please.

566
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,320
Not like this.

567
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,720
Here's another question.

568
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,360
I was just informed a woman I know is throwing a, quote, play party, aka a swinger sex party,

569
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,400
and I wasn't invited.

570
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,640
There does not exist a reality in which I'd actually want to go to this party.

571
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,480
However, she invited several of my friends and I didn't make the cut.

572
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,240
And I'm left wondering if this is because she views me as an introverted, awkward,

573
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,600
prude, and not the potentially sexy, fun-loving lady that I am.

574
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,440
How can I better exude a invite me to your orgy, I don't want to go vibe without being

575
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,880
a creepy weirdo?

576
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,720
And that's from Brooding on the Bacchanalia Blacklist.

577
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
I don't get this question even a little bit at all.

578
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,760
I love this question.

579
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,800
Let me tell you why.

580
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,000
Okay.

581
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,080
This person is bummed that they did not get invited to a party they don't want to go to.

582
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,880
Yeah, that's the thing.

583
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,160
If you take all the sex out of it, that's what it boils down to.

584
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:41,280
If somebody invited me to go to a swinger sex party, I would say no, thank you.

585
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,520
And I would feel kind of uncomfortable having to turn down that invite for anything.

586
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,200
It's not because of the subject matter of the party.

587
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,760
It's just like, when you have to turn down an invite to anything, it is a discomfort.

588
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,440
When somebody scopes out my situation and says, I absolutely should not invite Griffin

589
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,680
to this because he would have to say no to that.

590
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,800
They have done me a wonderful service.

591
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,840
And I can't imagine- this is such a high stakes invite, are you fucking kidding me?

592
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,120
To have to turn this down would be- would be really rough stuff.

593
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
This is such a great service this person has done for you.

594
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,600
Yeah, they've done you a kindness.

595
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
You also- you don't want to be the person at an orgy that's the pity invite.

596
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,640
You know what I mean?

597
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,000
That's a real bummer.

598
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,960
It's just like- it's just- I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'm going to invite

599
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
you to this very personal pan party.

600
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
And it's very personal, and I'm going out on a limb.

601
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,440
Do you want to come to the sex party?

602
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,400
Uh, no.

603
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Ah, shit.

604
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,000
I wish I hadn't invited you to the personal pan sex party.

605
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:45,840
Like-

606
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,400
They do need a designated watcher and everyone though.

607
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,480
Maybe that's something you could volunteer for.

608
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,680
Just the person who watches all the sex- sex stuff happening.

609
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,960
Yeah, and puts, you know, number stickers on everybody to tell them how good they're

610
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,280
doing.

611
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
Or you could just be like in the coat check.

612
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,680
Yeah, you could do coat check.

613
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,720
I don't understand-

614
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,640
Or maybe just send an edible arrangement.

615
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,200
You know what I mean?

616
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,480
I couldn't make it.

617
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,200
Apologies.

618
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,600
You- you are the sort of person that- you are the sort of person that wouldn't want

619
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,880
to go to an orgy.

620
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,440
You weren't invited to the orgy.

621
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,960
It's a fucking- your friend nailed it.

622
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,760
Slam dunk.

623
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,560
They crushed it.

624
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,120
Slam dunk.

625
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,240
We're going to get another- we're going to get an email from their friend that's just

626
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,680
like, hey, I fucking crushed it.

627
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,720
No advice needed.

628
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,440
I fucking crushed it with the e-vites on this fucking- I sent out some fun jib jab

629
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,280
e-vites to my orgy, and I fucking crushed it with who I invited.

630
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,240
I got a 100% yes, 0% no rating.

631
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,520
I thought about my friend Stacy, but then I was like, nah, she doesn't seem like she'd

632
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,360
be down, and I saved us both a really uncomfortable no to that.

633
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,560
So yeah, 100% e-vite.

634
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,360
Just wanted to brag.

635
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,840
Crushed it.

636
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,120
JibJab.com go.

637
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,400
Great comedy source.

638
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,480
What we're dealing with here is like a Venn diagram with a very, very, very, very small

639
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,240
overlap, and one says people who don't want to go to orgies, and the other circle says

640
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,440
people who want to be invited to orgies.

641
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,800
And you are the one person in the overlap that exists.

642
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,440
I think there's a delineation between orgy and swing or sex party.

643
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,000
I just want to make sure that we acknowledge that there is that.

644
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
We understand there's a difference.

645
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,080
It's just like we're trying to use efficiency of language here, okay?

646
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,480
Fine.

647
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,040
We get it.

648
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,160
I have a speech impediment.

649
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm not very good with my S's, so I like to stick with non-S words.

650
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,880
Thank you very much.

651
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,400
There are no, there's no like, there's no judgment here at all, 100%.

652
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,440
This is fantastic.

653
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,800
I'm so glad it's happening.

654
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,200
Go America or whatever country this is happening in.

655
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
I do have an issue.

656
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,680
Why do you know about this party?

657
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,600
Someone at some point is doing this so fucking wrong.

658
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,400
To me, you just, it's just implied.

659
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,360
Obviously, you don't tell people that you're going to a fun sex party

660
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,640
with some people they know.

661
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,760
It's not, it is not a judge.

662
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,480
I don't think it's a judgment thing as much as like, it's just more fun that way.

663
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,920
It's just not done.

664
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,440
It's just, it's unprecedented.

665
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,160
Any party, especially if you're, because this is how I imagine the invite goes.

666
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,600
It's like a one-on-one.

667
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,680
It's not like you stand up in the break room and go,

668
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,240
hey, by the way, having a party later, if anybody wants to come.

669
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,280
So clearly in this one-on-one invite,

670
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,040
you know that there's some exclusionary tactics happening here.

671
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,040
So for you to then, on any party, go around being like,

672
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,800
yeah, got invited to a party.

673
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,360
Did you?

674
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,640
Like, no, that's not how you deal with that.

675
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
Check this shit out though.

676
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,000
Sex party's off and popping and it's going so good

677
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
and lots of lovemaking going on.

678
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
It's great.

679
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,520
And then who walks in?

680
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,120
It's fucking Anderson Cooper.

681
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,040
And he's like, there's a mole.

682
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,200
And then all of a sudden we get that fucking

683
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,920
revival of the mole that we've all been waiting for.

684
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,640
But it's like a very, very, very erotic mole.

685
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,600
That would be the best television show that has ever aired.

686
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,000
Are you kidding me with this ratings bonanza?

687
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,960
I need you to stop with this bonanza you're having

688
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
and take this quiz on who the mole is.

689
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,960
Can we wait?

690
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm almost finished with my bonanza.

691
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,480
Yes, you can wait.

692
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,040
It's fine.

693
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,880
I'm the designated watcher for this one.

694
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,000
Anyway, so continue the bonanza.

695
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,560
Please enjoy your bonanza.

696
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Just know that the love you make may be with the mole.

697
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,760
Well, you've ruined it.

698
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,040
I have no problem with that, Anderson.

699
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,160
Oh, okay.

700
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:38,720
Okay.

701
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,760
I don't want to make love to the mole.

702
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,920
I might have underestimated how much people cared

703
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,520
about not having sex with the mole.

704
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,920
I will say this, the mole is fucking smoking hot

705
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
and really good at doing it.

706
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,080
So you got that going for you.

707
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,640
So you got that.

708
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
Maybe you don't want to vote him off the island

709
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,680
or however the mole works.

710
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,760
It's been a long time.

711
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,720
I just can't see a world where Ahmad Rashad

712
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,640
doesn't try to sneak in there though.

713
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
It seems like he would definitely want to be the guy.

714
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,280
I don't think Anderson can handle this one on his own.

715
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,440
I do need to just go ahead and help him on this one,

716
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,160
on this Mitch.

717
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
One of the two hosts is a mole,

718
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,080
but we won't tell you which one.

719
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,720
Man, I miss the mole.

720
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
Fuck.

721
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,280
Yeah, mole is a good show.

722
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,120
It's a good television show.

723
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,440
All right.

724
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,560
Time to go to the money zone.

725
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,040
Follow me.

726
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,760
I'll show you the way.

727
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,960
Gotta tell you about a box I got yesterday.

728
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,800
Not yesterday, it was a few days ago.

729
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,720
I opened it and my nose was full

730
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,480
of the passionate smell of the beautiful blooms.

731
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,040
A bunch of beautiful blooms because it's from ProFlowers.

732
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,960
Because it's that time of year

733
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
where ProFlowers sends us flowers

734
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,000
and all of a sudden I have flowers in my house

735
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,360
and at first I panic because I'm like,

736
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,880
I don't know what to do with these things.

737
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
But then I remember you just sort of look at them

738
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,120
and smell them and they're great.

739
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,400
Because they...

740
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,320
What is it, Travis?

741
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,360
Well, I was just going to say,

742
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,120
like I can give you a 99% guarantee

743
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,040
from my brother, my brother and me to you

744
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,840
that these flowers will not contain a listening device.

745
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,080
Oh no, no listening devices here.

746
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
That's not how ProFlowers does it.

747
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,280
If there's a listening device,

748
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,520
it was planted there by, you know,

749
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,880
I guess the whatever postal service delivered them.

750
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,120
So they have really...

751
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,880
These are great flowers, good prices.

752
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,400
And right now you can get two dozen assorted roses

753
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,840
with a free glass vase for 29.99 plus shipping and handling.

754
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,120
That's what we've got.

755
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,440
Beautiful vase with some beautiful roses.

756
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,520
It really lightens up the kitchen.

757
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,200
And can I tell you a secret, Griffin?

758
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Please.

759
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,080
You can reuse that vase.

760
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
Yeah, no, I realized we put it on the counter

761
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,800
and I placed it in between two identical vases

762
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,880
that we have full of some lovely, like gemstones.

763
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,360
Don't break into my house though, please.

764
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,720
They're not real gemstones.

765
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,760
I don't just have a big urn full of rubies and emeralds.

766
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,840
But right now the only way to get two dozen assorted roses

767
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,640
with a free glass vase starting at 29.99.

768
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:18,000
29, I just, I know I said 20 and then a bunch of nine sounds.

769
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,920
It's 29.99.

770
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,720
Just go to proflowers.com and use the code MYBROTHER.

771
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,080
That's proflowers.com.

772
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,480
Click on the microphone and type in the code MYBROTHER.

773
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,200
Don't wait.

774
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,720
This deal expires soon.

775
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,160
No Valentine's Day is coming up

776
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,800
and a lot of people are just looking for like a fun,

777
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,000
special way to celebrate.

778
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,640
Here it is.

779
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,200
This is it.

780
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,560
You found it.

781
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,200
You found it.

782
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,400
I would like to tell you about Casper.

783
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,840
Yeah.

784
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,760
It's a mattress company that's done changed the mattress game.

785
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,000
I got two in my house.

786
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,840
One that I sleep on in my bedroom

787
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,560
and one that I sleep on in the nursery

788
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,640
when my baby's being real fussy and I don't want to bother my wife.

789
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,080
I put my baby in her crib and I sleep on the Casper mattress

790
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,800
in the nursery and everybody sleeps okay.

791
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,320
I'll say not great, but the quality of the sleep is good.

792
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,360
It's the baby screaming that is the biggest effect of the sleep

793
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,480
and not the mattress.

794
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,160
That's a little insight onto the Travis McRoy sleep scape,

795
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,960
but it has nothing to do with whether or not Casper is great

796
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,600
because it is.

797
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,840
Yeah, it's a fucking great.

798
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,360
It's a great, great old mattress.

799
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,400
We got one in the guest room and every time we have guests over

800
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,880
they always talk about how sick it is.

801
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
Have you talked about the free trial and return policy?

802
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,360
You can sleep on a Casper for 100 days

803
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,680
with free delivery to the US and Canada.

804
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,280
And if you don't like it, that's not possible,

805
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,840
but you get painless returns, so no big deal.

806
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,000
$50 towards any mattress purchase can be yours

807
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,840
by going to Casper.com slash my brother

808
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,360
and using promo code my brother, all one word at checkout

809

terms and conditions blog.

810
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,400
Justin, can you tell me about this next message?

811
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,720
Yes, this message is that the person who wrote the message

812
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,920
wrote also wrote a book, so they're kind of multifaceted.

813
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,280
Yeah, just writing a bunch of things,

814
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,680
a bunch of different like vehicles.

815
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,120
It's called systematic how systems biology

816
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,360
is transforming modern medicine.

817
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,440
And it explains how simple biological pieces

818
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
work together to do complicated things.

819
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,040
How the neurons in your brain work together

820
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,800
to allow you to think how the microbes in your gut

821
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,480
might influence your weight and mood,

822
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,240
how bamboo flowering schedules create swarms of rats in India

823
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,440
every 48 years and how gerbils in Kazakhstan

824
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,720
get bubonic plague.

825
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,480
Can you take another run at saying

826
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,280
the name of that country?

827
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,640
Kazakhstan?

828
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,000
Kazakhstan?

829
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,080
Well, I agree to disagree.

830
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,160
No, don't do that, there's no disagreement

831
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,120
to be found here, sir.

832
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,360
Whichever one of you that is interrupting me so rudely,

833
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,520
can I please just read the call to action?

834
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,880
I mean, I guess so, but just the country has a way of saying it,

835
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
but go for it, sorry.

836
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,320
I think this is like a Mexico, Mexico kind of thing.

837
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,280
Definitely not, but go ahead.

838
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,080
Get a copy of Systematic at Amazon, Barnes & Noble,

839
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,560
or your local bookstore starting February 7th, 2017,

840
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,080
which is tomorrow.

841
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,600
You can go get it.

842
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,760
You should say what they said in their message, though,

843
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
because they kind of, they kind of-

844
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,960
They did throw a little shade, they said,

845
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,360
which was definitely 11 months ago, but it wasn't.

846
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,840
It's tomorrow, you fucking asshole.

847
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,340
Nailed it.

848
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
Thanks for the money.

849
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,360
Thanks for the money.

850
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,920
Good job on the book.

851
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,160
Good job on the book.

852
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,440
Now you can write a third thing.

853
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,960
It's an apology note.

854
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
Looking forward to it.

855
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,240
I have a message here for Melanie,

856
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,600
and it's from your little sister who says,

857
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,640
happy birthday, Melanie.

858
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,840
I love you so much.

859
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,320
And to express just how much you mean to me,

860
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,120
I chose the sweetest baby brother in the whole world

861
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,760
to tell you so on your favorite podcast.

862
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,000
You're my best friend and amazing older sister,

863
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,760
and I love you tremendously.

864
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:58,560
Here's to you.

865
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,320
This one is also-

866
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
I miss you, miss you tremendously.

867
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Oh, what did I say?

868
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,480
Kazakhstan.

869
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,520
I miss you tremendously.

870
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,160
Here's to you.

871
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,760
And this was supposed to go up in February,

872
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,400
so we're-

873
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Guys, I'm feeling good about how we're starting this year off

874
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,880
with regards to Jumbotrons and literally in no other regard.

875
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,560
Literally no other way am I cool with how we're doing so far,

876
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
except for this one way, we're doing it pretty good.

877
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,160
The first ever Very Very Fun Day is coming to Talley Hall in Chicago on February 11th

878

884
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,840
Another question here from a listener, and it goes a little something-

885
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,800
Oh no, we're going to do a yahoo.

886
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Oh no, we're going to do a yahoo, shush.

887
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:18,880
You're the boss.

888
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,120
Media Luminary swinging his 30 under 30 around.

889
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,880
How about this one from Morgan Davey?

890
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,320
Keep it waving, Morgan Davey.

891
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,560
It's from Yahoo Answers user Lisa R who says,

892
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,080
what is a good argument to convince my parents to let me have a two horses?

893
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,000
Hello, hello.

894
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,920
Hi.

895
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,840
I've been dreading the conversation,

896
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,480
convincing my parents to allow me to get another horse.

897
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,240
Right now I have a horse that I was going to use for barrel racing,

898
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,760
which I'll interject here is when you stuff a horse into a barrel

899
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,600
and then you stand on top of the barrel

900
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,520
and you just kind of run with it all wacky.

901
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,920
But turned out to be better at Western Pleasure,

902
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,280
and that's where, I don't know, man.

903
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,120
I'm going to need one of y'all to Google.

904
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,120
I know that means you're not going to pay attention to the rest of the question,

905
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,800
but I must know what Western Pleasure is.

906
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Travis, no, just one of you.

907
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,120
I need one of you to listen to the rest of the question.

908
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,720
It is a Western style competition at horse shows

909
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,200
that evaluates horses on manners and suitability of the horse.

910
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
Couldn't have found a better name.

911
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,600
Yeah, Western Pleasure.

912
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,480
Fucking sick.

913
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,120
We're going to get into horse manners here in a second.

914
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,560
Why couldn't we just fucking,

915
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm going to start a new podcast

916
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and I have zero time for new projects right now.

917
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,400
I swore to myself no new projects,

918
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,520
but now I must have a podcast called Western Pleasure

919
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
and it's a fan cast for Northern Exposure.

920
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,160
Okay, right now I have a horse that I was going to use for barrel racing,

921
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,000
but turned out to be better at Western Pleasure

922
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
and I have gotten very attached to this horse.

923
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,640
Anyway, so now I'd like to add a new-

924
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,040
That's just a bad sentence construction.

925
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,400
So good at Western Pleasure, I have grown very attached to this horse.

926
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,920
Anyway, so now I'd like to add a new speed horse

927
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,200
and do not know how to come about this conversation with my parents.

928
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,360
I feel like their main argument point will be

929
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,880
why do you need two horses?

930
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,600
Please help me.

931
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,800
So we've done, gosh, how many questions about horses?

932
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,680
All of them?

933
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,240
Secretly?

934
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,160
There's an undercurrent of horse in everything

935
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,600
and we've talked about convincing the parents to let me get a horse.

936
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,320
This is a new and exciting avenue for us,

937
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,720
which is what if there's another one?

938
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,000
Just a super quick sidebar.

939
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,680
I did search Western Pleasure in iTunes

940
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,040
and while it returned no podcast, it did return a book.

941
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:37,600
Oh, good.

942
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,000
Handsome Ty Steele, a professional horse trainer is looking to add to his income

943
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,960
by offering horseback riding lessons at his horse farm.

944
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,600
Unfortunately, he accidentally places his ad

945
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,160
in the personal section of the local newspaper.

946
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,000
Gordon Burghardt, recently transferred from New York to the Midwest,

947
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,120
comes across the ad.

948
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:58,080
His overactive libido causes him to misinterpret the ad

949
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,120
as offering something far different than what Ty intended.

950
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:01,680
Fucking yes.

951
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,760
So what happens when Gordon arrives at the farm for his lesson?

952
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,280
And that is the book by Terry O'Reilly called Western Pleasure

953
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,440
and you can get it for $1.99.

954
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,840
Tear my fucking pants off, Western Pleasure.

955
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,400
Hell yeah.

956
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,000
What's a good argument to convince my parents to let me have two horses, though?

957
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,520
I mean, here's the thing.

958
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:21,840
You said-

959
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,440
I came up with the best argument.

960
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,160
Oh, okay.

961
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,120
Did you just interrupt me or is the fucking-

962
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,920
I just interrupted.

963
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,880
No, I just interrupted you.

964
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,080
But I came up with a really good joke and I didn't want to wait.

965
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,280
Well, that's in the Travis McElroy story.

966
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,320
Holy shit.

967
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,640
Shit, you beat me to it.

968
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,680
Fucking go for it then.

969
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,320
Best argument for two horses.

970
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,280
I have four legs.

971
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,640
Yeah, I mean, that's a good-

972
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,280
Damn it, you're right.

973
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:49,920
All right, worth it.

974
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,960
But the legs would have to be-

975
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,440
Sorry, Travis.

976
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,960
The legs would have to be arranged-

977
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,080
I am a centaur.

978
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,960
No, no, no, no, no.

979
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,160
See, dummy.

980
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,600
It can't be like that.

981
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,000
It has to be-

982
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,120
You broke your joke.

983
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,840
It has to be four horizontally aligned, a perpendicular-

984
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,800
I'm a comb.

985
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,360
Of legs.

986
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,120
You have to be a comb, right.

987
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,960
I'm a human centipede just getting started.

988
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,360
Okay, the best argument, and I'm being serious here because I want to seriously fucking help

989
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:23,360
this person because that used to mean something around here, is you said parents, plural S.

990
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,640
You got two parents, two horses, romantic rides, romantic horse dates for the folks.

991
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,400
I'll use this motherfucker for Western pleasure.

992
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,480
I'll use this other motherfucker for speed racing.

993
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,440
And then on the weekends, you take them out to the ranch.

994
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,400
You're having a good time out there, romantic time.

995
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,080
Maybe you start feeling things that you haven't felt.

996
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,280
Things got a little bit stale.

997
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,320
Going out on horseback is going to change all that.

998
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,960
The problem is convincing your parents that two horses is not a case of diminishing returns

999
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:56,640
because you have to feed two separate horses now.

1000
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,760
You have to stable two separate horses now.

1001
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
And you can't ride both of them.

1002
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,880
You, singular, cannot ride both of them at the same time.

1003
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,880
So how do you convince your parents that it is an increase, it is a return on investment?

1004
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,240
And I think the answer is you have to convince them the horse is magical.

1005
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,600
Oh, okay.

1006
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Not that you need another horse, general, but you need this specific horse.

1007
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,240
See, this horse is fire type.

1008
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,000
The one I got now, fire type.

1009
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,160
And so when a water type comes around, I'm fucked.

1010
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,240
So I need to get me a grass type horse.

1011
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
Just kidding, all horses are grass type.

1012
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,280
It's all they eat is silly geese.

1013
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,000
Here's what you got to do.

1014
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I got a solution for you on this one.

1015
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,000
This one I got a solution for.

1016
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,000
What you're going to do is you're going to buy two horses before your parents find out.

1017
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,040
Oh, I see.

1018
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,160
Once they are both there, you marry them.

1019
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,320
And then your parents are like, you've got to sell one of these bad boys.

1020
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,840
And you say, well, mom, dad, they're married.

1021
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:10,080
So no, I don't think that I'm going to sell one because they're a married pair of horses.

1022
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,440
They're a married couple.

1023
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,680
I do like, Justin, in the scenario that you have assumed that the person asking this question

1024
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,560
is someone who has the means to purchase two horses.

1025
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,520
They're just afraid of the condemnation from their parents.

1026
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,520
I thought you were going to say the means to marry a horse,

1027
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,560
at which point I was going to just jump through the internet, Travis,

1028
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,360
and tell you everybody can marry a horse.

1029
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,880
It's all make believe.

1030
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,320
And we're all just having make believe fun when we talk about these things.

1031
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,080
I could go out and marry two horses right now.

1032
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,080
I could marry two dogs if I wanted to.

1033
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,040
I guess that's true.

1034
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,800
Technically speaking, he's got a point.

1035
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
I couldn't come up with any argument.

1036
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:48,080
Yeah, there's no argument against, yeah, absolutely.

1037
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,520
So I think if you marry the horses,

1038
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,160
then legally your parents can't make you sell either one of them.

1039
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,960
Yeah, marry them to each other or you marry them.

1040
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,120
No, you marry them to each other, Travis.

1041
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,000
Okay, I just-

1042
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,440
Justin, just wanted to make sure we all understood what page we were on.

1043
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,480
You were on a bad page.

1044
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,280
No, no, no.

1045
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,600
I just wanted to make sure everyone knew what page we all three were on.

1046
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,640
Choose your own adventure novel and you got ate by a yeti, sir.

1047
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,600
And then I married the yeti.

1048
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,800
You married the yeti.

1049
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,200
You loved the yeti very, very much.

1050
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,320
I'm going to ask another question.

1051
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,800
The other day in my intro to criminal justice class,

1052
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,240
a student took out a whole lemon and started to peel it.

1053
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,000
And then he asked me for the time.

1054
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,400
So I told him and he went, oh, okay, in a sad tone of voice

1055
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,720
and put his partially peeled lemon back into his-

1056
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:45,680
He put his partially peeled lemon back into his back,

1057
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,600
almost ashamed of his actions.

1058
00:46:47,600 --> 00:47:03,200
My question is this, what should I do if the situation comes up again?

1059
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,680
What is the code word that I can use so I can get this man to enjoy his lemon in class?

1060
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,920
I think he's some kind of citrus sleeper agent and I need advice.

1061
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,120
That's confused and citrusy in the concord.

1062
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:23,760
We have been getting, listen, before we talk about this,

1063
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,080
I just want to say we've been getting some fucking all time questions from you all.

1064
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,000
The past few weeks have been all time questions

1065
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,280
and I can't thank you enough for making this show palatable.

1066
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,520
There's so many.

1067
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,400
There's so many.

1068
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,760
I love our listeners and I believe, listen, I believe you.

1069
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,280
If you come to us with a question,

1070
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,440
that is a sacred bond of trust you put forward.

1071
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,520
I believe you, except I don't believe this person

1072
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:54,480
because there's so many angles to this dangle that is just unimaginable.

1073
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,800
The fact that this person was apparently going to eat a lemon

1074
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,800
is like not even chief among them,

1075
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,720
but that they unpeeled, they unspooled this lemon a little bit,

1076
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:05,360
found out that the time was bad or wrong,

1077
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,160
and then put the partially unpeeled lemon,

1078
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,240
just going to let some of the raw flesh of the fruit touch the inside of my JanSport.

1079
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,520
What?

1080
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,080
This kind of thing always makes me feel I'm an old man now.

1081
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,800
I'm 33.

1082
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,560
I'm not as hip as I used to be.

1083
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,960
This always makes me fear that this is a reference or a meme

1084
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,640
or some kind of internet joke that was like a setup

1085
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,360
that you were supposed to respond a certain way.

1086
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,560
Like, what's the fox say?

1087
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,840
And you're like, this is math class.

1088
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,480
What are you talking about?

1089
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,600
What are you talking about?

1090
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,160
Okay.

1091
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,520
This was a gag from last night's American dad.

1092
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,240
Well, he didn't fucking see that, of course.

1093
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:42,800
Oh, I've got it.

1094
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,880
So you're saying that after they asked for what time,

1095
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,520
you should have looked them in the eyes and said, what's up?

1096
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,560
Yeah, exactly.

1097
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,120
Exactly.

1098
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,080
That's exactly it.

1099
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,720
Here's what I think the proper response is in this situation.

1100
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,240
They start peeling the lemon.

1101
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,400
They say, excuse me, do you have the time?

1102
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,560
You do a dramatic take, make eye contact with him and whisper,

1103
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,160
it's the sour hour.

1104
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,680
And then just everything goes crazy.

1105
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,200
I mean, I think you could even be more on the nose than that

1106
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,960
and just say, it's time for me to watch you

1107
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,800
apparently eat a lemon like one might eat a delicious tangelo.

1108
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,480
And I'm very much looking forward to it.

1109
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,280
So please don't cock block me again.

1110
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,040
I got to watch this pop off, please.

1111
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,800
I've been thinking about it all week

1112
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,240
since you bailed on me last week.

1113
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,440
You left me devastated.

1114
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,520
I do enjoy the image of a person who attends their class

1115
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
with a lemon and not a phone.

1116
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:41,360
So they have the one thing, they do have a lemon with them.

1117
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,080
They left the house today with a lemon and not a phone.

1118
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:44,560
Yeah.

1119
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,840
Doesn't this reminds me of like those logic puzzles

1120
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:51,360
where it's like two men meet at a restaurant

1121
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,480
and order albatross and say for old time's sake,

1122
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,680
and when they take a bite, they fling themselves off a brick.

1123
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,640
Like this is like, there's some explanation here

1124
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,480
that I just don't understand.

1125
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,800
And it's like, well, you have to know

1126
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,920
that lemon is also another word for,

1127
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,680
and it's like, ah, it all makes sense now.

1128
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:14,560
Is there possibly maybe like a university-wide protest,

1129
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:17,200
a very subtle protest where like-

1130
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,920
All right, at noon, we're all gonna eat our lemons.

1131
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,640
Right, we'll all eat a lemon at the same time.

1132
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,240
I mean, maybe you're onto it.

1133
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,440
Maybe it's just this person feels

1134
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,280
like being very disruptive today.

1135
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,600
So they take a big juicy bite of their lemon

1136
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,800
while the professor's talking about criminal justice.

1137
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,960
And he's like, well, it's really important to understand

1138
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,920
about jurisprudence.

1139
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:37,840
And then this person's just like, chomp.

1140
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,720
Oh, can you please, do you mind not doing that

1141
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,680
in the middle of my class?

1142
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,600
Hey, we're allowed to eat.

1143
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,960
I looked it up in the bylaws.

1144
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,200
Homp.

1145
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
Cankersores.

1146
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,080
Oh, the cankersores are barking.

1147
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,680
Is it maybe a flash mob?

1148
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,080
Is there maybe a flash mob happening

1149
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,080
and this person's one role in the flash mob

1150
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,000
is to eat a lemon at his exact moment.

1151
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,080
There's like some improv everywhere shit.

1152
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,560
I don't know exactly what-

1153
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:05,760
Oh, but they missed it.

1154
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,360
They missed it, that's it.

1155
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:09,600
Yeah, that's what they, yeah.

1156
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,800
It's not that they're too early.

1157
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,840
It's that they're too late.

1158
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,480
And the whole fucking mousetrap style,

1159
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,320
like what's the word for like the Rube Goldberg machine-

1160
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,160
Oh, they were supposed to start it.

1161
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah, exactly.

1162
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,880
Them eating a lemon was just to start it.

1163
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,760
So there's just a flash mob like waiting at 12.01,

1164
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,640
like, oh, come on, Jerry, come on.

1165
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,800
And then Jerry shows up to class at 1.01

1166
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,520
because they forgot about daylight savings time.

1167
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,560
And it's like, what time is it?

1168
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,520
And you're like, it's 1.01.

1169
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,200
You're like, oh, oh no, the mob's gonna be so mad at me.

1170
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,120
They plan on doing a flash mob to Led Zeppelin's

1171
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,000
The Lemon Song.

1172
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,720
And then they're like, ah, fuck, I even brought the prop.

1173
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,680
Guess I gotta eat it now.

1174
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,440
This is amazing.

1175
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:52,560
I can't imagine.

1176
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,520
So good.

1177
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,680
Is there another good question that you want to do?

1178
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,360
My office puts a 1,000-piece puzzle in the break room

1179
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,640
for everyone to work on.

1180
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,720
When finished, a picture of the puzzle

1181
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,000
is taken, displayed, and a new puzzle is put out.

1182
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,600
Although people work on the puzzles,

1183
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,360
I'm always the one who completes them.

1184
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,080
Am I good?

1185
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,400
Or should I let someone else know the sweet satisfaction

1186
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,560
of putting in that final piece?

1187
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,320
And that's from Puzzlet in Cleveland, Ohio.

1188
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,920
This is a good question.

1189
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,560
But also, I want to address the fact that you work at an office.

1190
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,560
We're hanging on the walls.

1191
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,800
A guest might come into your office to do business

1192
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,680
and see a fucking framed picture of just, like,

1193
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,960
a bunch of balloons.

1194
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,320
That's pretty cool.

1195
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,040
You guys are really into balloons and, what is that, ice cream?

1196
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,080
And that's the album cover of Sgt.

1197
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,440
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.

1198
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,320
Boy, you guys are into a lot of diverse topics, I see.

1199
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,040
I love this super cool Pixar slash Google workspace

1200
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,760
where the bosses are like, no, we don't care if you spend hours

1201
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,920
on end in the break room working on a puzzle.

1202
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,960
Whatever.

1203
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,000
We're cool here.

1204
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,640
It's a puzzle QA facility.

1205
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,520
So it is part of their, here's what I would do.

1206
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,480
Fucking mix it up.

1207
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,360
Are you ready for this?

1208
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,960
When you're about to put in the final piece of the puzzle,

1209
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,200
put something underneath the puzzle,

1210
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,520
flip it over upside down,

1211
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,480
wait for someone to enter the room,

1212
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,360
and then put the last piece in.

1213
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:19,760
Oh, fucking shit.

1214
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,600
And they'll look at you and you'll just be like,

1215
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,280
that's how I do it.

1216
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,440
Fucking Bobby Budnick from Slate Your Short Style.

1217
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,520
I put the puzzle in,

1218
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,840
I could put it together backwards.

1219
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,040
I feel like the picture is cheating.

1220
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:31,520
That is so sick.

1221
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,880
And you'll become a fucking office legend.

1222
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,200
I have another way of doing it good.

1223
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,240
And that is just when you're about to crush it,

1224
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,040
you call everybody in.

1225
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:41,600
Guys, come in here.

1226
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,560
I'm about to crush this puzzle.

1227
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,120
Folks, come in to watch you smash the puzzle.

1228
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,080
And you get that last piece and you're like, here it goes.

1229
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,520
And you hold it way up in the air,

1230
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,480
like you're going to slam dunk it.

1231
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,320
Like, oh, and you're bringing your arm down

1232
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,680
and everybody's like cheering and clapping

1233
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,520
because they're about to be set free from the puzzle.

1234
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,800
And then you spring your arm down,

1235
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,400
but then your arm hooks and crooks

1236
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,080
and you put it in your mouth and you eat it.

1237
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,000
And then everybody's like, whoa, yo, James, what the fuck?

1238
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:04,640
And then you say,

1239
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,240
there's a final piece of the puzzle is you.

1240
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,480
Teamwork is the final piece of the puzzle.

1241
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,520
And everybody claps.

1242
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,160
Now you're the boss.

1243
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,840
You've inspired everybody.

1244
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,320
And they take a picture of this puzzle without a piece.

1245
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,840
And all of a sudden it's like an office episode

1246
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,560
because it didn't go right, but they learned something.

1247
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,360
Why wouldn't they just frame the puzzle?

1248
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,720
Why do they take a picture?

1249
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,640
Is that for like, so we could do it again later?

1250
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,560
Do they have that few puzzles?

1251
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,400
Yeah, we got to keep this.

1252
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,280
This is a fucking Prima strategy guide on balloon puzzle.

1253
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,840
What if we get a-

1254
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,680
Picture as a reference for the next time,

1255
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,440
like it looks like this when it's done.

1256
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,280
That'd be sick.

1257
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,640
If I fucking worked at an office

1258
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,040
and they had me put together a thousand piece balloon puzzle

1259
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,400
and it took me a month

1260
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,840
and then all of a sudden they brought in

1261
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,560
and they're like, guess what?

1262
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,440
Same balloon puzzle.

1263
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,240
I'd be like, fuck yeah.

1264
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,440
All right, guys, let's get it together.

1265
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,320
We know the green one's there at the bottom left

1266
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,440
and let's just work from there.

1267
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,440
I can't imagine.

1268
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,120
I can't imagine.

1269
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,520
I think being the person to finish the puzzle, I get it.

1270
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:03,760
Yeah.

1271
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,000
Can you imagine being the person to start the puzzle?

1272
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,600
What would be worse than that?

1273
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,480
Like if I see a pile of puzzle pieces,

1274
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,680
I'm just going to keep on walking.

1275
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,200
There's no words on heaven or earth.

1276
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,960
That's going to make me start the sorting process.

1277
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,560
Unless you find those tasty corners.

1278
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,360
You find those corners

1279
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,920
and then all of a sudden you're like, my work here is done.

1280
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,320
Everything you do will be built on the back

1281
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,080
of my major accomplishment here.

1282
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,280
I am now, now I'm the puzzle master.

1283
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:29,600
You know, that's what you,

1284
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,960
when you get to that last piece,

1285
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,000
you take that last piece,

1286
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,120
you go out in the office

1287
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,160
and you find the person who's been having a rough time.

1288
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,160
Maybe like they just lost the big account

1289
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,120
and you walk up to them

1290
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,560
and you like kind of flip it to them.

1291
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,000
Like you're flipping them a quarter

1292
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,920
and you're like, you need this more than I do.

1293
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,120
And like they get to switch the puzzle.

1294
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,480
They can switch the puzzle.

1295
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,000
One thing that you could do

1296
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,880
is take early on in the process,

1297
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,080
steal one piece of the puzzle

1298
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,680
and then put it in a giant sack of foam waffles

1299
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,720
and make them like slip around and look for it.

1300
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,120
That's how Mark Summers invented Double Dare at his office

1301
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,160
and he got fired for that,

1302
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,520
but then he got a job at Double Dare.

1303
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,400
So it all worked out.

1304
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,520
It all worked out in the end.

1305
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:15,200
And another thing you could do is buy,

1306
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,160
go to Spencer's Gifts and bring like a hundred dollars

1307
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,360
because you're going to want to purchase

1308
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,720
a lot of fun stuff in there.

1309
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,720
But you buy a sexy erotic Puz,

1310
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,240
just like a good doing it Puz

1311
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,680
and then everybody's putting together

1312
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,360
this balloon Puz at work

1313
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,040
and then you go in to finish it.

1314
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,080
You shut and lock the doors.

1315
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:35,440
You throw that balloon Puz away

1316
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,520
and you put down this finished sex Puz.

1317
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,560
And then when people come in,

1318
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,360
you'd be like, yeah,

1319
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,440
I guess we just couldn't see it until it was finished.

1320
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,600
But damn, Jerry,

1321
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,920
you picked up a pretty fucking erotic Puz, bud.

1322
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,040
A lot of hunks in this Puz.

1323
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,080
A lot of hunks.

1324
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
There's a hunky Puz.

1325
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:55,280
A lot of fucking trouser dogs in this one, huh, bud?

1326
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,600
Hey, hey, Jerry, this Puz was called Western Pleasure.

1327
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,960
That's what you got wild, man.

1328
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,160
I'm trying to fucking figure that out.

1329
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,120
I mean, it's fucking good.

1330
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,400
It's tasteful and like very like sexy, but like.

1331
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,240
I also thought it was going to be balloons.

1332
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,760
I'm as surprised as anyone here.

1333
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,600
Right, I thought balloons until the moment

1334
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,560
I put the dick one in.

1335
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,960
And this one piece did have the dick in it.

1336
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,400
Then you fucking reach down,

1337
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,600
you pop a piece out,

1338
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
and you shift the rest of the Puz a little bit.

1339
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,720
It's fucking one of those lintricular ventricular dealies.

1340
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,240
And all of a sudden it turns into balloons

1341
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,080
as soon as you pop that one piece out.

1342
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,840
What is this sorcery?

1343
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,600
That's another thing you could also do.

1344
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,280
Folks, that's going to do it for us this week.

1345
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,240
I'm my brother, my brother and me.

1346
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,680
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1347
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,920
We last week put out the trailer for our TV show.

1348
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,800
If you want to watch that,

1349
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,040
you can check out CISO's Facebook page

1350
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,160
or CISO's YouTube channel or just find,

1351
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,440
I mean, it's not hard to find media.

1352
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,520
It's 2017, just like find it.

1353
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,120
Find it on YouTube and wherever.

1354
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:47,840
Go watch it.

1355
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,200
A lot of people liked it.

1356
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,240
That was very gratifying.

1357
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,240
Yeah, I'm very excited for,

1358
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,760
we're going to like more and more stuff.

1359
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:56,720
So it's going to keep coming out

1360
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,960
until the show comes out on the 23rd.

1361
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,840
I am, holy shit guys, that's very soon, huh?

1362
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,040
Two weeks.

1363
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:03,600
Two weeks.

1364
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,120
Holy shit.

1365
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,760
All right, well, I think everybody's going to dig it.

1366
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,000
So if you don't, please don't tell us

1367
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,920
because the podcast can be bad.

1368
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,720
Like we've made like 4,000 of these, whatever,

1369
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,400
but we only made six of the TV show.

1370
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,160
And so if you think it's bad,

1371
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,920
it would hurt my feelings very much.

1372
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,920
Yeah, it would hurt feelings.

1373
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,240
And we've heard from a lot of people,

1374
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:27,840
I just want to clarify this on the show.

1375
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,880
We've heard from a lot of people

1376
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,160
who do not live in America

1377
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,320
and as such have difficulty accessing CISO.

1378
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,440
I'm sorry for that.

1379
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,240
Very, very sorry for that, that situation exists.

1380
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,200
We also have like no,

1381
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,360
there's no reality in which we have any control

1382
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,240
over that whatsoever.

1383
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,960
And the CISO people are smart people.

1384
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,400
I mean, if they could just flip a switch,

1385
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,600
I'm sure the switch would be flipped.

1386
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,920
It is not because they hate Canada

1387
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,560
and there's like bonkers licensing stuff involved.

1388
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,120
I mean, I'm talking about-

1389
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,080
Which we also have no, yeah, we have no idea.

1390
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,880
But ask them, that's the best thing you can do.

1391
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,760
Just tell them on Twitter,

1392
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,640
like, hey, I live in this area

1393
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,320
and I'd really like to watch this show.

1394
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,520
I understand people are frustrated.

1395
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,800
Please don't be like mean about it

1396
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,720
and be like, fuck you guys.

1397
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,080
They were really nice

1398
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,240
and they let us make a TV show with a lot of money.

1399
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:18,640
Yeah.

1400
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,720
So like, I don't know, be nice.

1401
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,560
I want to thank John Roderick in the Long Winters

1402
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,080
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1403
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,360
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1404
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:25,920
Can I do that?

1405
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,360
Can I do that?

1406
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,160
Please do.

1407
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,720
Hey, thanks.

1408
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:31,600
That was it.

1409
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:32,640
Also to the international thing,

1410
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
I did want to say, if history is any indication,

1411
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,880
there will be one episode of the show

1412
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,280
that is freely available on YouTube.

1413
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,960
So everybody will at least be able to watch

1414
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,400
one episode of it, I believe.

1415
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,560
We're also working on an event

1416
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,880
on the 15th of this month

1417
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,480
that we're going to be streaming.

1418
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,800
And we are going to be doing kind of a press event,

1419
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:56,800
showing an episode and doing a Q&A afterwards,

1420
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,160
which you should be able to watch.

1421
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,600
Watch our Twitter stream and our Facebook page

1422
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:02,960
for the details on that.

1423
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,520
Yeah, we should know more by next week's episode.

1424
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,600
So hopefully we'll have the details then.

1425
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,200
But we want to make sure we get as many people

1426
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,560
included as possible.

1427
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:13,040
Thanks to MaxFun for having us.

1428
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,160
Go to MaxFunFun.org.

1429
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,520
Check out all the great podcasts there.

1430
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,920
Congrats to Jessie and Teresa having another baby.

1431
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,640
Very, very exciting.

1432
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,920
The Portland show sold out very, very quickly.

1433
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,320
Oh yeah.

1434
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,000
There's a thread started on the Facebook group

1435
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,400
for people who weren't able to get tickets

1436
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,360
and are looking for tickets.

1437
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,120
Cause there's always like, you got tickets

1438
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,720
and then you found out you had to work that night

1439
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,920
or something and you're not able to go.

1440
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,760
If you do end up with tickets that you're unable to use,

1441
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,320
posting in the Facebook group is a super cool thing to do.

1442
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,280
And we know it sold out really quick.

1443
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,320
And we apologize that they went so fast,

1444
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,960
but hopefully there'll be some ticket exchanges made

1445
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,280
and some people who weren't able to attend are able to go.

1446
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,520
If you're going to be at that show and you have questions,

1447
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,800
you can start sending them in now.

1448
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:02,480
Just put Portland live show in the subject line

1449
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,560
so we can start grouping those questions together

1450
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,320
and we'll see you there.

1451
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,760
Y'all want that final?

1452
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:10,720
Yeah.

1453
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:11,600
Yes.

1454
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,280
I'm going to give it to you then here it comes.

1455
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,120
It's from, it was sent in by Dana Scarborough.

1456
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,600
Thank you, Dana.

1457
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,160
It's by Yahoo Answers user C who asks,

1458
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,160
are flautists capable of expelling poison darts from a flute?

1459
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,200
My name is Justin McElroy.

1460
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,080
I'm Travis McElroy.

1461
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1462
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,320
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Me.

1463
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,040
Kiss your dad.

1464
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:43,920
Square on the lips.

Listener supported.

1469
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,240
Going into a bullseye interview,

1470
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,120
I know it's somebody who does amazing work,

1471
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,720
but it's an actual conversation.

1472
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,000
I don't know where it's headed.

1473
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,720
Absolutely.

1474
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,760
You're absolutely right.

1475
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,360
You said it actually better than I did.

1476
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,200
So I have to think about what that means.

1477
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,280
Hey, this is the straight talk that you're going to get on this show.

1478
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:19,760
Bullseye.
