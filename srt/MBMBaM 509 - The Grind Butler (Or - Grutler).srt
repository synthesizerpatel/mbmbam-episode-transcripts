1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,840
Hello everybody and welcome to another My Brother, Mean Advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis of McElroy.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,120
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin, and we're doing it.

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,960
Yeah, baby. This is the recording,

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,480
we're doing it. I have something, an update of sorts.

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,160
She's already the fastest woman alive, fastest person alive, frankly.

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,720
Fastest being alive? I don't know, I think it's she that's probably-

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,040
But Britney Spears, as we have established, is the fastest human being alive.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,520
Just kind of leaning into it a little bit for my taste, but okay.

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,320
Well, she's, I mean, since she established it, she has been using it to save people from,

15
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,200
you know, from dangerous situations. And she just yesterday was doing a live stream from her home,

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
from her home gym, and just casually, casually mentioned,

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,400
I haven't been in my home gym for about six months because it burned down.

18
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,800
There were two candles in there, and yeah, one thing led to another.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah, you're really deep in the Britneyverse, Trav.

20
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,920
Listen, you know-

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
I was not expecting to return here on this show,

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,760
because typically whenever something funny or goofy or zany happens in the world,

23
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,760
we'll wring the juice out of it and then we'll move on.

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,760
But I didn't expect you to kind of get off at Britney Station

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,040
and spend some time holidaying there.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,680
You know, Griffin, a lot of people during this time,

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
the last few months, have found a lot of new hobbies.

28
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,400
You know, for some people, they've taken up the ukulele or perhaps knitting.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
And for me, it's a fascination with Ms. Spears.

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,520
So Britney's doing okay. Sounds like she's hanging in there.

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,280
Well, she rebuilt her home gym, I assume with her own two hands.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,280
She actually built it better than Bob Vila and faster than Bob Vila.

33
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Well, it's kind of like in The Batman Begins.

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,600
It's like in Batman Begins, he said, beginning a sentence that I cannot wait to hear.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,960
You know, at first, Bruce Wayne's like, I want to tear down Wayne Manor.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,600
I hate it here.

37
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,680
And then Ra's al Ghul burns it down much like two candles

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,320
burned down Britney Spears' home gym.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,000
And then she was like, you know what?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm going to rebuild it brick by brick.

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,600
And then she also put a Batcave in the basement, I assume.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,800
It's just, what have we turned?

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
This is one of those moments where it sinks in like, damn, shit's different.

44
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,560
You know what I mean?

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Yeah.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,560
This is what it took.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:22,960
Hold on.

48
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,880
This is what it took for that to sink in, Griffin?

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,760
Me covering Britney Spears for a second time out of 509 episodes?

50
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,240
It's not.

51
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,880
I think it's just doing sort of news.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
You know what I mean?

53
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,960
The breaking headlines.

54
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,440
It's touching the vein of just like, here's a thing that's happening right now.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,040
Usually when we do the intro, it's most of the time something like,

56
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,920
hey, everyone, this movie's coming out and that's funny

57
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,440
because we're too cool to care about it.

58
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,600
And people laugh because they're like, they're talking about Avengers,

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,680
but they're too cool to care about that nerd shit.

60
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Or sometimes it'll be like one of us has turned into another character or another creature.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,480
And hearing you talk about this Britney stuff that you saw online,

62
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,960
it feels, I don't know, it just feels different, man.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,720
It feels like you've changed, man.

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,920
Maybe this is going to be like my model trains, you know?

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Like that thing of like, oh, I never thought Travis would, you know,

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,800
get into painting toy soldiers or whatever.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,760
You know what I mean?

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,280
This is my thing.

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,080
I'm going to have a room in the attic that the kids aren't allowed to touch.

70
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,680
And it's where I keep my Britney Spears conspiracy wall.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,920
I was hoping to spin.

72
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,280
I had it penciled in this week's intro to talk about the theatrical release of Scoob.

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,120
And I, of course, have been denied that.

74
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,280
Good news.

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
Damn, I would have loved to hear that one, Juice.

76
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,760
I know.

77
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,400
Fuck.

78
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,440
I had it penciled in.

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,200
Remember to talk about Scoob!

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Can we start over Scoob watch?

81
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
Can you include it?

82
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,160
Here's the headline with new rule exemption.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
Scoob assured Oscar eligibility.

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,360
That is a relief for me.

85
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,320
So Scoob's coming May 15th.

86
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,280
That should fix it.

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,760
Got a good cast for that, though.

88
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,120
I don't know what it is.

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
Scoob!

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,580
Okay.

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
I mean, I'm guessing it has to do with the Scooby Doo.

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah, it's Scooby Doo before, in the before times.

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,360
There's a thing I love in trailers where they're like,

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,440
every hero has a story and every story has a beginning.

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,000
And this is our beginning and it's Scoob.

96
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
And it's when they first fell in love with Shaggy and Scooby.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,840
Shaggy, what?

98
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,360
When Shaggy and Scooby fell in love?

99
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
No, it's when Shaggy and Scooby.

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,680
Yes, when Shaggy and Scooby fell in love.

101
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,120
Now, don't confuse this with Scooby Doo The Mystery Begins.

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,920
Okay.

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,440
Which is a 2009 flick starring Robbie ML as Fred,

104
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Nick Pilatus as Shaggy.

105
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,560
And of course, because he's legally bound to,

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,000
Frank Welker is the voice of Scooby Doo.

107
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,200
That is a different, that is an origin story,

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,400
but it's a live action one.

109
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,640
Oh, and this is animated?

110
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
It's been 10 years, it's time for a reboot.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
So, I was thinking for my failed introduction

112
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,680
that I would do something like talking about,

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
you know, all the drama in the royal family

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
without actually knowing what that is all about.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,120
Oh boy.

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,480
Do you want me to try?

117
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,160
I can try, but do you guys think

118
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,720
two bad introductions is enough for one episode?

119
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Or should we try and get the hat trick

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,360
for me talking about the royals?

121
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,320
There's three of us.

122
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,280
Yeah, it seems insane to stop now.

123
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,160
Okay, yeah, I guess there's something going on over there.

124
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,240
They all, I guess one of them, Harry,

125
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
I want to say Harry and his spouse, they have left.

126
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,000
They have dipped out of the family.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,920
They said, no, thanks, we're tired of it.

128
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
And the queen who is quite old.

129
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,520
How old, how old is she?

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,320
She's Trav 60, easy.

131
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,480
She can't believe it is what I've been hearing.

132
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,200
Can you do an impression of her not believing it?

133
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,040
That feels like it may be pushing it

134
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,480
because I don't even actually know

135
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,880
how many people over there feel like protective.

136
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
Like, that's my queen, don't do an old voice for her.

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,200
You could do like a cool hip voice then.

138
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,880
I mean, it didn't have to be inaccurate.

139
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
Okay, you're doing what, Harry?

140
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,880
You're doing what, Harry?

141
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
Nailed it.

142
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,040
This is an embarrassing true story.

143
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,360
We were watching The Greatest Showman recently

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,720
for the first time because-

145
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,280
Is this gonna be a fourth bad introduction?

146
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,560
No, it's tied to the queen thing.

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,440
Okay, okay, okay.

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,080
It's tied to the queen thing.

149
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
We were watching The Greatest Showman

150
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,400
and there's this scene where they go to visit the queen

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,920
and perform in front of the queen.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,160
I was watching this flick and I was looking at her

153
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
and I said, she's young, right?

154
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,840
And I said, you know, it's crazy to think

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,880
that she's still a queen.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Oh, Justin, buddy.

157
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
That film is set in the 1850s.

158
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,760
So that would be quite a thing.

159
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,040
And so it is, I mean, it would be weird

160
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,680
to think that she's still the queen, huh?

161
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,920
And then Sidney was like, are you fucking,

162
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,480
are you fucking idiot?

163
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,040
And I had to do a classic move of like,

164
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,720
wow, you didn't get my great joke.

165
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,920
My cool joke I did.

166
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,480
Cool joke.

167
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
Call Blimey didn't get that one, huh?

168
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh, bollocks.

169
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,960
Apples and pears.

170
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,440
Oh boy, yeah, I was embarrassed about that.

171
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,360
This would be quite the reveal

172
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,400
if she finds out that it was not in fact a cool joke

173
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,640
she didn't get, but in fact, the fact that I'm an idiot.

174
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,200
It is crazy to think that she's still,

175
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,920
that Queen Victoria is 160 years old and still the queen.

176
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,280
Still kicking it.

177
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Still kicking it, still rocking the castle.

178
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,360
Oh boy.

179
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,920
So this is an advice show, as you've certainly guessed

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,040
at this point, we have to do an introduction.

181
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
At some point we signed a contract with Jesse Thorne

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
that said we would do an introduction at the beginning

183
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,000
of every episode.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,720
Next episode, can we just try just fucking chart,

185
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,480
like bull rushing that shit and getting right into it,

186
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
like no introduction, just to see how that feels.

187
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,920
Just to see how that does.

188
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,520
That's scary just to think about it.

189
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,640
Okay.

190
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
There's no table setting though,

191
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,440
how people get into the vibe.

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
That feels like a plane doing like a vertical liftoff.

193
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,280
One of my roommates recently broke up with their partner

194
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,880
a month into quarantine.

195
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
They're understandably lonely and sad

196
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
and need a lot of support.

197
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
This afternoon they asked if they could take a nap

198
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,400
in my bed just to have some company.

199
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,680
So I said, sure.

200
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,960
It's now 8.30 and I'm starting to look towards bedtime,

201
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,200
but my roommate is still snoozing.

202
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,560
Do I wake them up?

203
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
How do I wake them up?

204
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,000
Do I just go to sleep next to them?

205
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,360
Do I sleep on the couch?

206
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
Please, brothers, I work at 7 a.m. tomorrow

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
and I'm running out of time.

208
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,400
That's from Befuddled by Bedtime in Boston.

209
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,760
Oh boy.

210
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,520
Oh, classic Friends episode.

211
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
So I'm assuming-

212
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
The one where Joey sleeps and sleeps and sleeps and sleeps.

213
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,800
Yeah.

214
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm assuming through context please

215
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
that you were not in the bed.

216
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Like you were maybe like watching TV

217
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,760
or playing video games or like sitting at your computer

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
and they napped to be in the room with you?

219
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,920
Yeah.

220
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,320
Yeah.

221
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, why?

222
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
Yeah, I guess they are in the room.

223
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,080
I don't think you are asleep next to them.

224
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,200
I do like the question, how do I wake them up?

225
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,520
That one seems pretty easy to answer.

226
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Maybe a poke or a shake.

227
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
One of those two.

228
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,360
No, you gotta be the Benthier rough thing though.

229
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,880
You have to be gentle.

230
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,840
That has to be, maybe open a window

231
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,520
and let the music of the city.

232
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,320
You know what I mean?

233
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,880
Kind of the soothing jazz coming up from the club

234
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,160
across the empty club,

235
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
the unpopulated club across the street.

236
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,200
A kiss of breeze.

237
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,880
The rat-a-tat of the subway drums.

238
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,680
The smell of fresh croissants at the patisserie.

239
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
The birds going about their jobs.

240
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,800
They're doing their thing.

241
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,840
One's in the room.

242
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh gosh, everyone's awake.

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
This bird's in here.

244
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,200
Someone get this starling out of here.

245
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
Wait, it's cooking?

246
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
The bird is cooking?

247
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,560
This is incredible.

248
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,640
He's got an alto saxophone.

249
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,520
Fuck yeah.

250
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,560
Really is cooking.

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,280
Yeah.

252
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,840
Oh, it's all about the notes the bird doesn't play.

253
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,800
Come on.

254
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,480
That actually is the last one.

255
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
Last time anybody can ever do that.

256
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,280
Oh really?

257
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,000
Everyone write a new joke about jazz, please.

258
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,240
Yeah, so I'm guessing you're in the room with them.

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,880
They're napping.

260
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,160
You're uncomfortable with napping next to them.

261
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
That's probably a good call unless you wanna,

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,400
and I'm not gonna like cast aspersions,

263
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,640
but let's just say escalate it.

264
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,040
Yeah.

265
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,800
This is a bad time for roommates to bump it up

266
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,080
or escalate it.

267
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,760
I mean, even if it's just like unintentional spooning, right?

268
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,720
Don't, yeah.

269
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,960
You're gonna activate, you're gonna escalate,

270
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,040
and this is not the time to be doing that.

271
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,920
It is actually do not activate, do not escalate

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,640
is a very good sort of rule of thumb

273
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,600
for I think everyone in our current situation.

274
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,360
De-escalation is going to present some serious injuries.

275
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:35,680
But also-

276
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,080
You know what?

277
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe go sleep in their bed.

278
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
Yes, no.

279
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,600
And then just switch rooms.

280
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm saying specifically with a roommate scenario,

281
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,520
you are tied to them.

282
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,400
You are doing a three-legged to five or seven

283
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,320
or some odd number of leg race with these people right now

284
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,800
and you cannot escalate that

285
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,080
or else you are just like really weighing yourself down.

286
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,800
One thing you should do is wake them up and be like,

287
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,080
hey, I didn't wanna,

288
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,880
this is your circadian rhythms are gonna be fucked.

289
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,200
Yeah.

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,640
You have gotta get it together.

291
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
You can't be sleeping right now.

292
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,320
Go out and take a jog.

293
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
Don't take a jog.

294
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
You can socially distance the jog.

295
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
I don't care about the jog though.

296
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,960
They just need to be up and out

297
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,400
and I'm worried about their rhythms.

298
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,040
The circadian rhythms.

299
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,160
They're gonna mess themselves up.

300
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,640
You shouldn't be napping till 8.30.

301
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
When did the naps start?

302
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,640
I don't know.

303
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,000
We don't have the information.

304
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,320
Fuck.

305
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,280
But here's the thing,

306
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,360
unless the answer to that is 8.15,

307
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,480
it's gone on too long.

308
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
8.30 is like the best fucking time.

309
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,680
8.30 is like my favorite time of day.

310
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,160
My time of day is 8.30.

311
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
That's must see TV right there.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,240
Must see TV is on, kiddos in bed,

313
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,800
had your dinner, belly full,

314
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,720
maybe having a little cocktail,

315
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,200
something to wind down the day.

316
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,160
And it's just started.

317
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,880
You're not like bumping up against bedtime just yet.

318
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,320
It seems like you could do anything.

319
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,120
We have time to,

320
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,680
we could start a movie at 8.30.

321
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,920
Oh my god, that's exactly what I was about to say.

322
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,920
Why would you want to be asleep during the 8.30 times,

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,600
which is the best fucking times?

324
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
It is, it was literally,

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
I did not see the Star War,

326
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,440
the new Star War in the theaters.

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,560
It came out, literally it was out for,

328
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,640
I believe three weeks before we finally timed it out.

329
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,360
Where it's like,

330
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,840
we have time to watch this entire Star War.

331
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,320
We finally got the kids to bed early enough

332
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,760
to watch the Star War.

333
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Still started to fall asleep hour in,

334
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
did have to break it up into two showings.

335
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Sleep at 11 p.m.

336
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
Nap at 1.30 p.m.

337
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,720
Nothing at 1.30.

338
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
Yeah, there's nothing fucking going,

339
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
nothing good going on.

340
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,720
No, nobody's doing shit.

341
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,040
8.30 is bumping, baby.

342
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
That's when the music of the city

343
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
is really hitting its zenith.

344
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,680
Oh yeah.

345
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
That's where you get like the wheels cross,

346
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
they cross like the grates and you get that

347
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
bum bum to bum bum bum.

348
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
As the cars drive by, you know.

349
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
The rhythm of the city.

350
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,360
Yeah.

351
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,320
You get it.

352
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,080
We all know what the rhythm of the city is, Charles.

353
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,720
Yeah.

354
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
Bum bum sss, bum bum bum bum sss.

355
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
Yeah, bum bum sss.

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,400
I got a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

357
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:22,960
I got hot dogs here.

358
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
I got hot dogs here.

359
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,000
Umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella, umbrella,

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,200
umbrella, umbrella.

361
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Extra extra, read all about it.

362
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
Extra extra, read all about it.

363
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,840
He's bleeding.

364
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,880
He's bleeding.

365
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,760
It's everywhere.

366
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,760
Get off my bus.

367
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,840
Hey, get off my bus.

368
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,760
Hey, I dropped all my eggs.

369
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,000
I dropped all my eggs.

370
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,520
There goes the baker with his tray like always.

371
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,680
Marie, the baguettes.

372
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,680
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by several people.

373
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,400
Thank you, everyone.

374
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
It was an anonymous Yahoo answers user

375
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,880
who I'm going to call, this one's just named John.

376
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,680
Oh, is it spelled funny?

377
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,920
No, J-O-H-N.

378
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,120
That's what it says in my mind.

379
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,240
John asks, where do you-

380
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,440
Sorry, one sec.

381
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
Can we just talk about the Martian Bay Hunter for a second?

382
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,240
Of course.

383
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay, Martian Bay Hunter.

384
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,120
What?

385
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,080
Okay.

386
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,600
His name is John Jones.

387
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,960
Okay, I want to talk about this.

388
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,160
I want to talk about this.

389
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,440
Finally.

390
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,360
Finally, someone create, hey, Tim,

391
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,440
I need you to create a new superhero by the end of the day.

392
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,560
Okay, so did you finish your assignment?

393
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
It's actually Joseph.

394
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,520
Joseph Sandwichen.

395
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,320
Did you finish your assignment, Joseph?

396
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
I did, yes.

397
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,680
This is the Martian Manhunter.

398
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
He's an alien who manhunts.

399
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,400
That's very good.

400
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,680
Does he have a secret identity?

401
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,960
Because those are huge right now.

402
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,680
Yes.

403
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,400
Yes, he does.

404
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,760
Okay, so what's his secret identity?

405
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,120
Um, John.

406
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,280
Oh, is that like a human name he took to blend in?

407
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,360
J, no, it's different.

408
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,520
It's J apostrophe O-N-N.

409
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,800
So John is his name.

410
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,360
John?

411
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,520
Yes, John is his secret identity.

412
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,000
Does he have a last name?

413
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,360
It's Jones.

414
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
Is that just like regular?

415
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:38,560
Um, it's actually J apostrophe O-N-C-Z.

416
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,800
So hold on, let me just check real quick, Joseph.

417
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,560
It's John Jones.

418
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
It's real weird and alien.

419
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,400
It's really different.

420
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
So weird and alien?

421
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
And I came up with it a long time ago and not now.

422
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
So Joseph, you're telling me that it's weird and alien,

423
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,640
but they still use letters like J and O and N?

424
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,200
It's John Jones.

425
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
The letters are the same even in space, Travis.

426
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,440
It's the constant universal language is letters.

427
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,400
So-

428
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,200
I'm sorry.

429
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,920
Okay, so sorry.

430
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,120
Go ahead with the Yahoo.

431
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah, that was a fun little detour.

432
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
John asks, where do guys place their valuables when grinding?

433
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,600
Thank you.

434
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,080
If I'm grinding with a girl, I'm wearing jeans

435
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,720
and think that it's would be more comfortable for both of us

436
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,040
if my front pockets are empty, makes the dance feel better.

437
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,000
But then I will need my wallet and phone with me.

438
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,760
So where do you think I should place them?

439
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,960
I know about the back pockets, but what about other places?

440
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm a guy, lol.

441
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,640
Okay, first of all, it's 2020.

442
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,160
You can grind with anybody.

443
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Like anybody can grind with anybody, all right?

444
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
So I don't think that this has to-

445
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,040
Actually, let me, if I could just-

446
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,520
Just, nobody can grind with a girl.

447
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
Oh, right now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

448
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,240
Just nobody can grind with anybody.

449
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
Right, grind yourself, baby.

450
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
I feel like the problem with this is like,

451
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,280
there have been so many numerous innovations

452
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,760
that have been designed to fix this very problem.

453
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,640
And the problem is society has turned their back on them.

454
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
I'm thinking mostly of the fanny pack.

455
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,880
The fanny pack was there, so you could sing-

456
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
You're saying the fanny pack is not gonna-

457
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,760
I guess the fanny pack, when deployed above the fanny,

458
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,320
in non-sort of British terminology,

459
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,080
the American fanny.

460
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,160
The American fanny.

461
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,520
When deployed above the American fanny for the,

462
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,360
let's say the top in the grinding scenario,

463
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,480
then it would be out of the way.

464
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,760
I guess the bottom in the grind could be wearing the fanny pack

465
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,040
in the British sense.

466
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,960
Yes, and you know, as long as we're talking about it now,

467
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
what about grind butlers?

468
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,880
Oh, that's cool.

469
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,440
Yeah, butlers deployed throughout the dance floor

470
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,480
with trays who will take and hold your valuables,

471
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,800
and most importantly, protect them,

472
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,160
while you get your grind on, as the kids say.

473
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,240
Hi, I'm pitching, I'm looking for a $10 million investment

474
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
for my idea, grind butlers.

475
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,040
So I'd be like, Grimsby, I'm finished!

476
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,360
And you would come over with a silver tray

477
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,680
that had my phone and my inhaler on it,

478
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,040
after I finished grinding?

479
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,480
Correct, correct.

480
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:26,800
Okay.

481
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,680
And here's the thing, if someone tried to take your inhaler,

482
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,840
Grimsby's throwing elbows.

483
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,160
So he has to be strong.

484
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,800
Oh yeah, he's a burly butler.

485
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,720
I have a lot of questions, actually, about this, Travis.

486
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm glad you brought it up.

487
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,760
So Grimsby, the grinding butler, he doesn't participate-

488
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
We can just say Gretler, by the way,

489
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
if you wanna shorten it.

490
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,680
I do.

491
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
Grimsby the Gretler.

492
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,720
Grimsby the Gretler is gonna watch,

493
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,680
does he watch me do?

494
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,040
Oh yeah, he needs to be there, because you need him.

495
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,120
He's not just, okay, he performs other butler duties as well,

496
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,960
but his prime directive is to collect valuables

497
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
whilst grinding, so he's there for you.

498
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,160
But I think I want him in earshot, but not eyeshot,

499
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,520
so if I could, I place a little mask on his eyes.

500
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,200
I'll hand him my inhaler, I'll hand him my phone,

501
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,360
I'll hand him some of the toys that I have in my pocket,

502
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,480
and he'll put them on a tray,

503
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,360
and then I can slip a little mask,

504
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,200
like a sleep mask, over his eyes

505
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
so he doesn't see me do what I'm about to do.

506
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
Do you put the pieces of trash that you mean to throw away?

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
Is that weird to give Grimsby the Gretler?

508
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,800
No, in fact, he gets kind of offended if you don't give it to him,

509
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,400
because he's like, that's my job, sir.

510
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
Now, I have a question, here's a different question.

511
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

512
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,800
Will he be monitoring my text messages

513
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,880
for information that I might want?

514
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,120
Yeah.

515
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Like, am I gonna be grinding, and Grimsby's like,

516
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
excuse me, sir, but there's a text here from Stinky D.

517
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,680
He says, Stumbler's 2 is bumpin', get down here.

518
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,440
I can't miss that.

519
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,240
Yes, indeed.

520
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,000
He will also remind you to hydrate,

521
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
because, I mean, that's very important.

522
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
Now, he will not get you the drink,

523
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,160
let's be clear, he will not get you the drink.

524
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,760
He's not a butler, for fuck's sake.

525
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
That is not his job.

526
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,480
Don't insult him, yes.

527
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,160
Now, I guess just another question, Trav,

528
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,920
for this product, which is a man.

529
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,520
Wait, before I move on, sorry, Griffin,

530
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,920
I do wanna hear that question, I do wanna ask something.

531
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,720
If I go to get a drink, will Grimsby take my grinding spot

532
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,520
and hold it?

533
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,160
I don't want that.

534
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Now, here's the thing, not with your partner, or partners,

535
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,920
right, but he will kind of spread his arms

536
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,480
to create a perimeter so that he can maintain

537
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,720
the hold you have created to do your thing.

538
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,480
And I want him to maintain the rhythm.

539
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,000
Like, I wanna just hop right back in to the rhythm.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,720
No, he will definitely, he will act as an avatar

541
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
for your grinding.

542
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,160
Perfect, cool.

543
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,760
So, my question that Justin so rudely interrupted is,

544
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,080
I've given Grimsby my valuables to hold,

545
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,800
and then I'm grinding, and I do pass away

546
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,880
while I'm grinding.

547
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes, they are his.

548
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, they're his now.

549
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm not sure I want that to happen, Travis,

550
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,760
but I want him to be able to, like, those would still be

551
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,320
sort of, like, under my will.

552
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,480
When you hire Grimsby, you have to name him the executor.

553
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,160
Correct, correct.

554
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,280
So if you grind so hard you die, he will settle your affairs.

555
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,760
And he will also, I should, this is an, okay,

556
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,080
I'm glad you asked, because this is in the front print,

557
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,160
he will not only take your valuables,

558
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,040
he will take on your whole personality

559
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,240
and continue grinding.

560
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,360
Because our slogan here at Grind Butler's

561
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,640
is the grind goes on.

562
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,240
One other thing to bear is that circumstances of your death

563
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
are in any way mysterious.

564
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,240
Grimsby will not rest until the crime is solved.

565
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,320
That's true, even if he committed it.

566
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,680
That's the intro, like, he will hunt himself down.

567
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,000
Right.

568
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,040
He checks that first, though, because the Butler did it,

569
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,240
the Gretler didn't, so you don't have to worry about that.

570
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,480
And now there is one thing,

571
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,480
we've done a lot of product testing.

572
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
Sounds good so far, though, so far.

573
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,240
We've done a lot of product testing,

574
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,080
and there is kind of one big pitfall

575
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,040
that you need to be aware of.

576
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,760
You need to be careful that you don't fall in love

577
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,480
with Grimsby.

578
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,200
That happened because he's so reliable and, like, dependable,

579
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
and, you know, you're out there on the dance floor

580
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,960
trying to make a connection, and it keeps falling apart,

581
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,240
and who's always there for you?

582
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,120
It's Grimsby, and after a while, like, it becomes sexual,

583
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
and you have to be really careful there.

584
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm just going to come out and say,

585
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,520
just like bathroom stuff, is this going to be a problem

586
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,320
for Grimsby?

587
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,560
Does he have the sort of biological needs,

588
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,520
as I understand them?

589
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,040
Well, he's trained.

590
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,920
He's highly trained in tantric peeing,

591
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,240
so he can go all night and then just pee once.

592
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,400
He's always peeing a little bit, you mean?

593
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,360
Yeah, yeah.

594
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,200
Do you mean he holds his pee, or do you, no, clarify, please?

595
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, you have the option.

596
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,280
It's up to you.

597
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm thinking about how much it's going to cost me

598
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,520
to keep the track suit.

599
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,760
He has special pants that tuck into his boots,

600
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,720
and so he can pee a little bit the whole time,

601
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,840
or if you would prefer not to have to replace the boots

602
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,680
every night, because that is on you.

603
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,720
That expense is on you.

604
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
It's like a classy place.

605
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, then he does need a 45-minute break

606
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,680
just once a night.

607
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,120
Once a day, frankly, if you're partying straight,

608
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,080
like if we're in a Coachella situation or something

609
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,840
and you never want to leave, then he can do once every,

610
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,120
he can go 72 hours, but then he does need four hours off.

611
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,240
He's like a camel, yeah.

612
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
And Trav, I'm glad you answered that,

613
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
because I was wondering if maybe you could address

614
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
the rumors that have been circulating that Grimsby

615
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
does emit just a constant kind of foul odor

616
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
that no one seems to know exactly where it's coming from.

617
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,520
That's not with every Grimsby.

618
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,840
Sometimes it's just a weird humming noise.

619
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah.

620
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,160
That is, yeah, and the odor, okay,

621
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,080
so it's actually the odor and the humming noise,

622
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,920
but usually the odor, and as weird as this is to say,

623
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,960
drowns out the humming noise, if that makes any sense.

624
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
Yeah, sure.

625
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,840
No, it's a chemical smell, which is worrying.

626
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,800
Yeah, no, it's very upsetting,

627
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,480
but so far, I mean, listen,

628
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,560
we're still in early stages of testing at this point.

629
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,960
The Grimsby model's only been on the market

630
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,680
for a couple months.

631
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,440
We have no idea what the long-term issues are,

632
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,600
but for right now, still looking

633
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,840
for that $10 million investment, so.

634
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,000
It's yours, it's yours for 0% of the company.

635
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,760
That sounds great, that's a great deal.

636
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,260
Yeah.

637
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,960
If Griffin wants to make good on this incredible offer,

638
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,720
he's gonna need to start building wealth,

639
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,040
and the only way that we know how to do that

640
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:08,320
is to take you with us to the money's end.

641
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I like everyone else of good moral fiber.

642
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,040
I'm trying to limit my visits into the outside world

643
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,400
as much as possible lately,

644
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,240
and one of the most convenient ways I've found of doing that

645
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
is utilizing stamps.com.

646
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
If you need to mail stuff, you need to buy postage,

647
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,960
you know, mailing stuff.

648
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,480
Yeah, mail stuff.

649
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,000
You know, post office stuff.

650
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,040
You can do it with stamps.com,

651
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,720
and it's not just US Postal Service rates.

652
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,840
Stamps.com also offers UPS services

653
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,840
with discount rates up to 62%,

654
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,320
and with stamps.com,

655
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,920
you don't have to pay UPS residential surcharges,

656
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,720
so it kind of like turns your home,

657
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,840
your board with your house,

658
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,160
why not turn it into a post office space?

659
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,600
Not for public usage.

660
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,960
I'm pretty sure that's illegal.

661
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Don't do that.

662
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,960
Don't do that, but it can serve all the same purposes.

663
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
Now, you could do it, I think,

664
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,800
for the members of your household.

665
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,280
You could set it up and make them come to you.

666
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,000
That's iffy.

667
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,160
I guess if you charge them, it's probably,

668
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,400
yeah, that's probably bad.

669
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,280
In addition to saving time and gas and safety,

670
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,200
you know, not going to the post office,

671
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,400
they also have some discounts.

672
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Stamps.com is gonna give you five cents off

673
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
every first-class stamp,

674
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,160
up to 40% off USPS shipping rates,

675
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
and right now, our listeners can get a special offer

676
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,800
that includes a four-week trial,

677
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,080
plus free postage and a digital scale

678
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,320
without any long-term commitment.

679
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,600
Just go to stamps.com,

680
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,840
click the microphone at the top of the homepage,

681
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,200
and type in my brother, all one word.

682
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
That's stamps.com, enter my brother.

683
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,400
Stay safe, friends.

684
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,440
It's actually my friends, Justin.

685
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
Yeah, stay safe, my friends.

686
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,360
It is important that we hit that

687
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,400
every time that we do talk about stamps,

688
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,480
because, and I think this is fucked up,

689
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
and I won't say this, I wouldn't say this to stamps,

690
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,160
so I hope they're not listening.

691
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:10,480
They're not.

692
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,600
But I think it's fucked up

693
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,000
that stamps only wants their friends to be safe.

694
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,920
And to be fair, they're not wishing ill

695
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,880
to their non-friends.

696
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,720
No, no, no, no, no, but they are just saying,

697
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
hey, my friends, stay safe.

698
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,120
Everyone else, do what you're gonna do.

699
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
Yeah, it's fine.

700
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,560
Listen, I can't control my not-friends,

701
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,200
you know what I mean?

702
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,400
I don't know them.

703
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
Hey, do you know what has been really helping me

704
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,640
through these tough times?

705
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
It is my underwear that I wear.

706
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,840
Oh, you didn't even give me time to guess.

707
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Well, yeah, there was no point,

708
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,200
because you knew what the answer is,

709
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,720
because we're looking at ad copy together.

710
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,960
Yeah, but I was gonna say something like,

711
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,680
you know, the love of family and friends.

712
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:53,920
No.

713
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,560
Or like your brain meds, or like,

714
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,440
I don't know, your child's laughter.

715
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,600
No, man, it's my Goodyear wear, bruh.

716
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,760
It's talking about me undies,

717
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,360
because they are comfortable as hell,

718
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
whether we're talking about undies,

719
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,840
whether you're talking about loungewear,

720
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,120
or them onesies, which are so soft.

721
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,560
They got all kinds of really comfy shit.

722
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,000
You know what I like?

723
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,600
I like their t-shirts.

724
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,360
Oh, the t-shirts are fantastic.

725
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,880
Mm, love them.

726
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,520
You can also get a membership from me undies,

727
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,840
and it is very, very handy.

728
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,960
Imagine this, every month,

729
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,800
the softest, coziest undies magically appear at your door.

730
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
And on your body.

731
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,080
And then on your body.

732
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,840
That part's not magical.

733
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,120
You do that with your hands.

734
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,480
It feels magical.

735
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
You get more of these underwear with this membership,

736
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,880
and you're just gonna be living the dream.

737
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,040
Also, a membership comes with site-wide savings,

738
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,720
early access, and free shipping,

739
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,360
and zero reasons to ever leave your house.

740
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,920
You just grab those new undies right off the porch,

741
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,840
and it does say here,

742
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,000
get back to that summertime dreamin',

743
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,680
which I, rarely do we read this verbatim,

744
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,520
but damn, that's strong.

745
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,720
Anyway, you can get 15% off your first order,

746
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,960
free shipping, and a 100% satisfaction guarantee

748
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,880
That's meundies.com slash my brother.

749
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
Hi, I'm Jackie Cashin.

750
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,160
Hi, I'm Lori Kilmartin.

751
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,040
And we have a podcast called the Jackie and Lori Show.

752
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,560
Who are you, Lori Kilmartin?

753
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,080
Oh my God, so much pressure.

754
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,760
See, I'm a stand-up of the new stand-up since 1987.

755
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,040
I'm a writer for Conan.

756
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,080
I've written a couple of books,

757
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,640
have a couple of CDs out, have a special out.

758
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
Who are you, Jackie?

759
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,680
Well, I too am a stand-up comic since 1984.

760
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,560
And I do the road like a maniac

761
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
and don't have a cool writing job,

762
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,120
but I have four albums out working on a new album.

763
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,480
We talk about stand-up.

764
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,680
We talk about all the different parts of stand-up comedy.

765
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,440
So that's the Jackie and Lori Show,

766
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,080
and you should subscribe on Maximum Fun

767
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,960
if you want to hear that.

768
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,400
Yeah, and I would encourage you not to.

769
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,320
Yes, yes.

770
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,920
Oh man, you were right on it.

771
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,800
I want to munch.

772
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,300
Squad.

773
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,760
I want to munch.

774
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,260
Squad.

775
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,200
Welcome to Munch Squad.

776
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,120
It's a podcast within a podcast.

777
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,280
I was trying to take you back to 2007

778
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,800
with that introduction because it is the Munch Squad,

779
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,680
what would we call it?

780
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,880
Munch Squad Retro?

781
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,760
I think you've called it a different fucking thing

782
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,400
every single time.

783
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,760
Yeah, let's keep doing that.

784
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,920
This is throwback Munch Squad.

785
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,560
We're going back into the archives for some classics.

786
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,720
This one comes to us from Jacob.

787
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,600
Thank you, Jacob.

788
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,960
And it's Cold Stone Creamery.

789
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,800
And this is really like peak,

790
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,840
I don't know if this is peak wildness,

791
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,120
but this has to be one of the earliest examples

792
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,800
of absolutely wild press releases I have seen.

793
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
It's from 2007.

794
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,720
Cold Stone Creamery unveils new frozen treat innovations

795
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,520
for the love of it.

796
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,600
The love of the game?

797
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,240
The ice cream?

798
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,520
Y'all can't get hung up on this, okay?

799
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,480
This is a wild one.

800
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:18,980
Okay.

801
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,640
If there were an encyclopedia definition

802
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,120
for passionate ice cream lover,

803
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
it would read something like this.

804
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Oh boy.

805
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,920
A passionate ice cream lover

806
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,760
is one that is unapologetic

807
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,080
about their obsession with ice cream.

808
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,320
Why did you kill that man?

809
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,160
I don't need to answer to you.

810
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,240
This person craves the highest quality ice cream

811
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,480
made just the way they like it.

812
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
I mean, ice cream, right?

813
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,520
Just make it in the ice cream way

814
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,200
that results in ice.

815
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,280
There seems like a pretty narrow band of things

816
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,320
that will result in ice cream.

817
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
I like it in a ball shape on a cone or a cup.

818
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,880
This person craves the highest quality ice cream

819
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,240
made just the way they like it,

820
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
and at one time or another,

821
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,800
has crossed the line to get it.

822
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,440
What the fuck are you talking about right now?

823
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,800
What are you implying?

824
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,840
What line?

825
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,200
The thin blue line?

826
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,720
Oh boy.

827
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,360
What line?

828
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,740
The ice cream.

829
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,280
The red line?

830
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,440
Listen guys, I worked at TCBY for a summer and a half.

831
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,200
There's a fucking line, and you do not cross it.

832
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,640
Would you not cross it?

833
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,320
Maybe it's the picket line?

834
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,400
Was there a big strike going on in 2007?

835
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,960
I don't remember.

836
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,600
This ice cream flavor is scab.

837
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,160
Cold Stone Creamery's taste master, Ray Karam,

838
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,760
understands this desperate love

839
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,320
for customized super premium ice cream,

840
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,520
and even has a story or two about crossing that line.

841
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,000
Jesus.

842
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,400
Oh my God.

843
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,640
Luckily, Karam harnessed that passion,

844
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,480
enthusiasm for ice cream

845
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,880
to develop an array of innovative frozen treats

846
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,800
available at stores throughout the country,

847
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,560
starting June 1st.

848
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,400
Thank God he harnessed his passion

849
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,360
before it could destroy him and those he loved.

850
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,600
Can you imagine that kind of ice cream line

851
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,480
crossing passion out just in the streets?

852
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,400
Well, to be fair, he harnessed it while in ice cream jail.

853
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,840
Like it was a state mandatory crossing.

854
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,640
In his quest to incorporate ice cream

855
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,920
into every part of the day,

856
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,400
Karam has developed French toast ice cream.

857
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,360
Jesus.

858
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,120
And no flavor would be complete without

859
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,200
a custom creation combination.

860
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,840
In this case, it's French toast with the most.

861
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,280
Made with French toast ice cream

862
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,720
mixed together with apple pie,

863
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
filling pecans and cinnamon.

864
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,320
Now, if only ice cream would become

865
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,160
an acceptable breakfast food,

866
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,760
ice cream lovers around the world would rejoice.

867
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
So this has been a pretty long press release so far.

868
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
And so far, I have learned that there is a dude out there

869
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,360
who really does like and enjoy ice cream a lot.

870
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:51,520
And they do have French toast with some mix-ins.

871
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,400
And it has taken like seven paragraphs to get there.

872
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,520
This next line was good enough

873
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
that I stopped reading the press release

874
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,080
because I decided that even if it was just

875
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,920
what I've read so far in this line,

876
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,440
it would be fine.

877
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,640
It would be acceptable.

878
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,080
I have no idea what comes next.

879
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,680
We're all going to find out together.

880
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
After developing French toast ice cream,

881
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,560
you can imagine the taste master became parched

882
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,080
and in need of a pick-me-up.

883
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh, I'm spent.

884
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,960
I can't imagine that.

885
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,480
No more.

886
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,080
That's precisely what I imagined.

887
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,000
It is finished.

888
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
When I heard that, I thought,

889
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,520
man, that dude must've gotten mad thirsty

890
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,120
after thinking of that ice cream flavor.

891
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,800
You can imagine that.

892
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,960
As a result, the already exciting line of smoothies,

893
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,520
which is a, I mean, I don't know what they,

894
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,760
they seem to know what they're talking about.

895
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,000
The smoothies now has a new edition

896
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,200
that packs a punch.

897
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,560
The new Mountain Dew smoothie called Dew Iced

898
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,400
delivers amazing tastes combined

899
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,000
with an exhilarating boost.

900
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,640
Fuck yes.

901
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,520
With Dew Iced appealing to the heart,

902
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,480
sorry, with Dew Iced appealing to the young at heart,

903
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Karim thought it was best to honor,

904
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,080
next honor those ice cream sentimentalists

905
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,000
that love a good old fashioned Sunday.

906
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,960
And that is with a capital S and the A at the end.

907
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
So you know it's fucking fancy.

908
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,800
The starting June 1st, Cold Stone Creamy

909
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
wore off of three new Sundays

910
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
that feature indulgent, rich ingredient layers

911
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,040
together as such.

912
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,320
This is the fucking,

913
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,400
I'm not messing up the words anymore.

914
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,160
This is just the wildest.

915
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,480
Okay.

916
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,440
They didn't think anyone would keep reading past this point.

917
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:31,940
Yeah.

918
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,400
I'm not going to list these.

919
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
There's no way they're available anymore.

920
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,920
Quote, this time of year always makes me smile.

921
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,400
The weather is warm.

922
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,560
Families are spending time outdoors.

923
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,520
I bet it does make you smile, you greedy fuck.

924
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,120
You ice cream pervert.

925
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,960
You ice cream pervert.

926
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,360
I bet you do get horny when the weather's warm.

927
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,360
And families are spending time outdoors,

928
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,000
making it the ideal time to enjoy ice cream together.

929
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,080
No fucking shit, Karim.

930
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,960
Damn.

931
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,600
Inspired by my own summertime memories,

932
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,880
I set out to develop several new innovative frozen treats

933
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
that add to the merriment of the season.

934
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
We've been doing this a long time.

935
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,320
I'm not sure I've ever seen someone in the press release.

936
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,320
It's like fucking, I did it again.

937
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,400
Get on me.

938
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,920
I really, I did it again.

939
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,520
And I'm so proud of myself for doing it,

940
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,560
crushing it once again.

941
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,000
For those ice cream lovers that want their ice cream

942
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,360
and to come for their own home,

943
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,000
Cold Stone Creamery now offers a line of grab and go creations

944
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,080
available in the store display freezer.

945
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,160
Ice cream aficionados across the country

946
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
are raving about the new grab and go flavor,

947
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,200
Choc-a-cone made with crunchy sugarcane pieces.

948
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
Gosh, I'm luxurious.

949
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,120
Uh oh, sounds like Justin needs a frozen Mountain Dew

950
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,920
pick me up.

951
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,720
Oh, he's parched.

952
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah, I'm parched.

953
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm parched.

954
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,480
Hey, I'd fuck up a Mountain Dew smoothie.

955
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,240
But not a slushie, to be clear, a smoothie.

956
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,600
Yeah, that means they got yogurt or kale in there.

957
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,080
Yeah, I don't care for that idea at all.

958
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,600
At the Tees, we used to offer an item where we would mix

959
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,640
like a sherbert with Sprite,

960
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,520
blend that up in the mixing machine and serve that up.

961
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,200
And one day I came in and I did have like a one liter bottle

962
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,960
of the Dew and I was like, hey, what about this?

963
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,760
I mixed that shit up and I drank it.

964
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,240
And then I was just at a LAN party.

965
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,520
Like I just was at a LAN party after that.

966
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,740
Amazing.

967
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,860
Um, you got, um, just real quick.

968
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,300
I had something, I hate to butt up against Justin's thing,

969
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,180
but um-

970
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,380
Then don't, then wait, wait, wait.

971
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:46,100
Oh, hello.

972
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,140
Then wait, you haven't done it yet.

973
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,580
You haven't, fuck.

974
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,380
I was just about to give my brothers a bit of a quiz,

975
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,980
but if you'd like, you're welcome to play along at home.

976
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,660
I don't want, hey, check this out.

977
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,100
Hey, I've never done this before.

978
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,300
I don't want to.

979
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,140
I think you'll really enjoy this one, Griffin.

980
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,540
I've, I've tailored questions for both of you.

981
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,660
Sure, sure, sure.

982
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,780
I think you'll really enjoy this.

983
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,980
No, but check this out.

984
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,780
Check this out.

985
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,380
I'm not going, I'm not gonna.

986
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,420
Okay.

987
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,940
Well, Justin, I'll start with you then.

988
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,140
Great.

989
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,180
Looking forward to it, Trav.

990
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,500
Give him my questions too.

991
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,220
Oh, okay.

992
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,180
You got it.

993
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,300
In the Carly Rae Jepsen song, I Really Like You,

994
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:26,340
she sings about really, really, really, really, really, really liking someone.

995
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,380
What actor is featured in the music video for this song?

996
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,300
This baby bullshit.

997
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,260
Um, let me remember.

998
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,140
Don't look it up.

999
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,860
Do not look it up.

1000
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,380
I'm not looking, I'm not looking it up.

1001
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:37,860
Let me think.

1002
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,180
Judd Hirsch.

1003
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,220
Incorrect.

1004
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,220
The answer is Tom Hanks.

1005
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,740
Nope, it's Judd Hirsch.

1006
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,540
Justin's right.

1007
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,180
Now, Griffin, I'll go ahead and give you Justin's questions.

1008
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:48,820
Where did you get?

1009
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,580
I don't know where you got your information, Travis,

1010
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,420
but Judd Hirsch was the subject of Carly's affection in that video.

1011
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,660
So, Griffin.

1012
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,220
Excuse me.

1013
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,740
I'm winning, Justin.

1014
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,380
Do you hear that?

1015
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,340
He's dying.

1016
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,060
Do you hear it?

1017
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,620
Oh, we're destroying his will.

1018
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:05,620
In the 1996 FMV classic, The Seventh Guest,

1019
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,660
you play a disembodied consciousness that moves through the house,

1020
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,740
solving puzzles and observing the events of that mysterious night

1021
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,940
at Stolf's house as they unfolded long ago.

1022
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,380
What is your character's name?

1023
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:20,740
Dave Thomas.

1024
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,060
Is that-

1025
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,180
Dave Thomas.

1026
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,940
It was a Wendy's only.

1027
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,260
It came in The Happy Meals, I believe.

1028
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,300
No, the comedian Dave.

1029
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,420
The comedian Dave Thomas.

1030
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
Oh, that comedian Dave Thomas.

1031
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,620
No, the Wendy's one.

1032
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,140
It was the Wendy's one.

1033
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,140
Now, what do you think is the real answer, Griffin?

1034
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:38,980
Shimmothy.

1035
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,020
I don't know, Travis.

1036
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,340
Fuck.

1037
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,220
Justin, do you know the answer?

1038
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:44,660
Ego.

1039
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,020
Ego is correct.

1040
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:52,340
Justin, in the song Boy Problems, co-written by, among others, Sia,

1041
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Jepsen reveals that she has very recently broken up with her boyfriend.

1042
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:01,060
In the music video for the song, what iconic hairstyle does Jepsen sport?

1043
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,300
Bob.

1044
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,260
Griffin, do you know the answer?

1045
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,020
No, I was asking my friend Bob.

1046
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,340
Hold on, he doesn't know.

1047
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,260
Griffin, do you know?

1048
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:15,380
I mean, she had the short dark hair in that one, like the Liza.

1049
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:15,860
The Liza Minnelli hair.

1050
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,820
It's a mullet.

1051
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,500
A mullet?

1052
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,460
A mullet.

1053
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:19,780
Yes.

1054
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,060
Okay.

1055
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,180
This feels wrong, too.

1056
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,700
That's correct.

1057
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,300
No, man, mine was right, and Justin, so far, Justin, I'm giving you Travis's points,

1058
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,740
which I don't even know how that works, but I'm still hung up on Judd Hirsch.

1059
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,300
All right, Justin, one last one here.

1060
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:46,020
The 2018 Jepsen bop, Party for One, became an instant self-care slash masturbation anthem.

1061
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,460
The music video begins with-

1062
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,300
Those two are synonymous, but go on.

1063
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,940
The music video begins with a hotel desk clerk performing what strange act?

1064
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,140
Masturbating.

1065
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,020
Correct.

1066
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:58,820
Griffin, do you know?

1067
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,020
All I know-

1068
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,340
There's nothing strange about masturbation, Justin.

1069
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,660
Well, it would be strange.

1070
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,500
I mean, anything could be strange, given enough context, Travis, and I think that a hotel clerk

1071
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,740
in his little cap and uniform masturbating would be quite strange.

1072
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,660
Well, you say that, but Darling Nikki was in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine.

1073
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,140
So there.

1074
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,420
Griffin, do you know the answer?

1075
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,940
It's masturbating, and it was Judd Hirsch, the first answer.

1076
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,060
It is incorrect.

1077
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,300
They face plant into a loaf of bread.

1078
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,580
So I think the winner is Griffin.

1079
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:41,300
All right.

1080
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,020
What?

1081
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,860
Well, maybe it's Ty, because you knew Ego.

1082
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm giving Justin one of my points for that Judd Hirsch answer, man.

1083
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,500
I still think he got fucking ripped on that.

1084
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,100
All right.

1085
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,700
The winner is Justin.

1086
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,100
Yeah.

1087
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:56,900
I won.

1088
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,780
Hooray.

1089
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,420
Here's another question.

1090
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:58,980
No, here's another question.

1091
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,940
Do you want to do Yahoo?

1092
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,060
This one was sent in by Michelle.

1093
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,620
Thanks, Michelle.

1094
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:05,700
It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user, because everybody on Yahoo is a chicken shit these days,

1095
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,100
I guess.

1096
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,380
Back in my day, people would put their fucking name on shit.

1097
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:18,660
But Denise asks, is it possible that someone has looked at a mummy or skeleton in a museum

1098
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,540
that was their great, great, great, and so on, grandparent?

1099
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:27,220
I went to a museum some time ago, and there was a couple of mummies that were buried together

1100
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,420
in the Stone Age or so.

1101
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,060
I know it sounds weird, but I felt a really strong connection to them.

1102
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,340
They felt like family.

1103
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,620
I got so sad.

1104
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:40,020
Is it even possible that they were related to me?

1105
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,520
Huh.

1106
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,500
Is it possible?

1107
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,500
Is it possible?

1108
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,260
Yeah, it's possible, right?

1109
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,660
I mean, Stone Age mummies are not possible.

1110
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,020
That's probably not right.

1111
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,380
That's not right.

1112
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,500
But back in mummy times, there were only like 100 people on Earth.

1113
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,620
Yeah, there weren't that many.

1114
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:58,820
Yeah, right?

1115
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,460
Because you got Adam and Eve, right?

1116
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,540
Yeah, and then you got Cain and Abel, and then it's a little fuzzy for me for a while.

1117
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,660
Yeah.

1118
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,620
How that worked out.

1119
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,140
I really enjoy the idea that this question asker is in a museum, and they're looking

1120
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,340
at some mummies, and they're like, oh my god, I feel an incredible, incredible connection

1121
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,140
to these mummies.

1122
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,300
I think that I might be related to these mummies.

1123
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,460
I wonder when these mummies are from.

1124
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,540
The plaque is three feet away from them.

1125
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,220
Fuck, I don't know.

1126
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,980
Probably the Stone Age or some shit.

1127
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,140
Anyway, I got to go get on Yahoo about this one.

1128
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,860
And if you look, see how they kind of have like a head and body?

1129
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,300
I have a head and body too.

1130
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,620
That's just like me.

1131
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,980
We're the same animal.

1132
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,780
So like, I know that they are probably my great, great.

1133
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,500
Let's figure out how many greats it is.

1134
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,660
Because I want to say like four or five.

1135
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,580
It's not as many as you think it's going to be.

1136
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,740
And I think it's fucked up actually that there are mummies in museums.

1137
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,940
Because that's a dead body.

1138
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:03,140
Sure.

1139
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:04,260
No one ever talks about that.

1140
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,500
But like, do you think that docents at museums are like, when kids come in, they walk up

1141
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,420
to the kids are like, hey, kids, you want to see a dead body?

1142
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,300
Because it is a dead person in there.

1143
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,100
I'm assuming.

1144
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,700
I mean, more museums should advertise like when they have those mummy tours.

1145
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,540
They should just have a huge banner that's like, hey, kids, dead folks.

1146
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,220
You guys want to see a dead body?

1147
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,740
Back in my day, I didn't want to go to a museum that had a mummy in it for fear that it would

1148
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:39,220
come to life and suck all of my vital organs out of my body like the movie showed me that

1149
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,180
they could do.

1150
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,500
When really, I shouldn't have gone to see them because it is dead bodies.

1151
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,540
I hope nobody digs up my dead ass and puts me on.

1152
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,420
I disagree.

1153
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:49,620
Okay.

1154
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,140
Here's the thing.

1155
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:55,540
They're going to leave me in the ground for no one to even think about?

1156
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:56,740
And enjoy?

1157
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:58,740
Enjoy?

1158
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:06,020
Listen, I don't want to be one of the ones that gets eaten to cure rickets or whatever.

1159
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:12,340
I want to be one of the ones that's put in a well lit, gotta be well lit, like wing of

1160
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:17,540
a museum for people to be like, dang, I bet he was important or else he wouldn't be here.

1161
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,540
That's a good point, Travis.

1162
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,580
You're enjoying it.

1163
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,700
People want to enjoy you.

1164
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:21,940
Thank you.

1165
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,300
You want people to be enjoyed.

1166
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,740
You know what?

1167
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:25,380
No case.

1168
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,900
Let him touch me.

1169
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,700
Yeah.

1170
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,580
Let him find out.

1171
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:30,980
No case, good lighting.

1172
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,540
That's the thing, I see the mummy now and I'm like, I want to touch it.

1173
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,500
A limited engagement.

1174
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,660
Come experience Travis McElroy the way he was meant to be enjoyed.

1175
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,100
Touch Travis while he lasts.

1176
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,580
Good lighting, no case.

1177
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,620
Listen, the oils on your human hands are going to wear away at his old, old body.

1178
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,620
So like, come and get a touch.

1179
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,980
First come, first serve.

1180
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,860
All the flash photography you want, baby.

1181
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:02,580
Don't worry about it.

1182
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,420
Be there while it lasts.

1183
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,060
Travis was a limited engagement, but he's back now.

1184
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:08,900
For a little bit.

1185
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,700
For a little bit.

1186
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,820
No food and drinks in the Travis ch-

1187
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,820
All right, you can bring your food and drinks in.

1188
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,460
Spill some Mountain Dew on him, see if he wakes up.

1189
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:21,540
Dump a Dew Iced on his head, see if it's enough to invigorate him.

1190
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:22,040
He's back.

1191
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:22,540
He's back.

1192
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,280
He's back.

1193
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,600
Do museums have skeletons in them?

1194
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,880
I don't think they do, right?

1195
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,400
They do, sure they do.

1196
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,960
They got dinosaur skeletons, but they don't have human skeletons, do they?

1197
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,040
Dinosaurs were the humans of their day, Griffin.

1198
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,040
And they're not skeletons.

1199
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,920
It's like rocks saying what they thought the bones look like if they remembered correctly.

1200
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,320
Whoa, Justin, that was fucked up, what you said.

1201
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,120
It's the truth.

1202
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,400
I have recently, as I've been playing Animal Crossing and Dig Up Fossils

1203
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,400
and PB's been like, what are fossils?

1204
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,920
And I've been explaining to her.

1205
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,000
And then she asked like how the dinosaurs died.

1206
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,880
And as I was explaining, you know, meteor hit the earth and all that stuff.

1207
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:05,480
She started to get very upset and not because of the idea of that.

1208
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,760
But like when I said like, you know, the sky's darkened and then they didn't have food to eat.

1209
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,920
She was like, oh my God, I bet they were so hungry.

1210
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,960
And she was like really upset on the dinosaurs behalf.

1211
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,760
And you know what?

1212
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,200
I've never thought about it that way, but it's pretty fucked up, right?

1213
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,800
They were just like, yeah, they're dead.

1214
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,400
Could never happen to us.

1215
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:23,480
Yeah, I'm glad they're fucking gone.

1216
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,200
Think about how sharp their teeth are and how powerful the talons.

1217
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,800
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1218
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,920
Do I need that?

1219
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,160
My life's hard enough with the quarantine and all.

1220
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,800
I don't want to get stomped on by an Apatosaurus or something.

1221
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,400
Do you think, wouldn't it be cool if the dinosaurs were like,

1222
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,400
hey, I hear this is all over blood.

1223
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,080
You guys should come back out.

1224
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,120
It's totally cool.

1225
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,200
It's a fucking hoax, dude.

1226
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,160
Come on out, it's fine, we're loving it out here.

1227
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,160
You're dinosaurs are immune, I know that no, no, no, I had it already.

1228
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:51,640
It's fine.

1229
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,040
Come on.

1230
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:53,160
Even that bad, really?

1231
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,920
It's not even really that bad.

1232
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,840
It's like as bad as the dinosaur flu.

1233
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,320
You all died from the dinosaur flu.

1234
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,760
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1235
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,240
That's pretty, listen, man, it's ancient history.

1236
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,440
It's before history.

1237
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,040
In fact, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

1238
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,480
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

1239
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,280
We hope you're hanging in there, staying safe.

1240
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:21,720
The whole bit, we got some new stuff on our merch store, I think.

1241
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,680
It's McElroyMerch.com.

1242
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:30,200
In addition to our ill-advised 10th anniversary commemorative plate, new t-shirts.

1243
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,280
We've got some stickers to get that summertime vibe going.

1244
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,080
And a t-shirt for Griffin and my video game podcast, The Besties.

1245
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,440
So that's worth checking out if you're so inclined.

1246
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:51,160
Real quick, I wanted to make, I wanted to mention the podcast I do with my wife called Shmanners.

1247
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:59,320
Last week's episode is a special all about video conferencing and teleconferencing etiquette.

1248
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,800
And we got a bunch of questions about it and did our best to answer those.

1249
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,440
So if that's something you've been worried about, you can check that out.

1250
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:14,280
And the week before that, I talked about a historical figure named Joshua Norton,

1251
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,760
who is a dude who proclaimed himself the first emperor of the United States in the mid 1800s in San Francisco.

1252
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,600
And it's one of my favorite topics ever, and I was very excited to talk about it.

1253
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,320
And so if that sounds interesting to you at all, either one of those, make sure you go check them out.

1254
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,520
I think they're great.

1255
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,200
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for these for a theme song.

1256
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:40,600
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, groove on those funky tunes.

1257
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,400
Nice.

1258
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,520
And thanks, speaking of funky tunes, thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1259
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:57,000
All kinds of great shows on the Max Fun Network shows like Stop Podcasting Yourself and Story Break and Switchblade Sisters and a whole bunch more all at Maximumfun.org.

1260
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And like Travis said and Justin said, we have other stuff at mcroy.family and at the McRoy Family YouTube channel.

1261
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:15,320
And if you are a fan of our podcast, The Adventure Zone, The Adventure Zone graphic novel, book three, Pedals to the Metal is available for pre-order now at theadventurezonecomic.com that's coming out mid-July.

1262
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:19,480
So don't wait, order it now, give yourself something exciting to look forward to.

1263
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,000
Is that going to?

1264
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,040
That is it, I am going to read the final yahoo now.

1265
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,840
Thank you to everyone who sent in yahoo's.

1266
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,920
Jack sent this one in though.

1267
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:29,720
Thanks, Jack.

1268
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,200
It's from yahoo answers user Negotiate.

1269
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:45,000
Who asks, is it safe to say that the 1880s were just like the 1980s but with less technology?

1270
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,520
My name is Justin McElroy.

1271
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,800
Travis McElroy.

1272
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,240
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1273
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,160
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1274
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,600
Kiss your dad square on the lips.
