1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,160
Does anybody remember Laughter? That's one of my favorite lines from the hit movie,

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,680
Almost Famous. I remember laughing. It was just one Monday ago when I listened to My Brother,

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,840
My Brother, Me, but the sun has gone around the earth seven times. Is that it? That's how it goes,

8
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:10,880
and we're back for another episode of Jucks, Jokes, and Chorkels, and Jucks, and Chorks,

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,200
and Mighty Ducks, and Mighty Ducks. Quack. This is My Brother, My Brother, Me. It's an

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,400
advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,400
So our show is that you ask us things, and then we take those things, and we make you

12
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,440
sound smarter by giving you the answers to all your problems. So let's get right into the answers

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:44,160
to the problems. I get ultra nervous around famous people. How can I work through my fear and build

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,400
up enough courage to talk to Felicia Day or Bruce Campbell at the Chicago Comic Con this year? That's

15
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:59,280
from Chaz Monroe. The easy answer is you don't. Don't. Don't do that. What do they need with you?

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,520
What do you have to say to people like them? Their lives are so much cooler than yours.

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,880
Well, the thing is, it's win-win, though. What are you going to say to them where Bruce

18
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Campbell's going to make the decision not to hang out with you anymore? What have you got to lose?

19
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,840
Travis is really the one to be answering this question, because we usually,

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,560
if we see a celebrity or something, what we do is we tell Travis to go talk to them.

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
Oh, God. Yeah, he's our envoy to the stars.

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,400
Well, the nice thing is you can walk up to Bruce Campbell and be like,

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
hey, Bruce, shove it, and then walk away. He has no idea who you are.

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,360
Yeah, because they don't have feelings.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,600
Well, but if you walk up and you say the nicest compliment you could possibly construct,

26
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,240
or the meanest insult, your stock doesn't go down in Bruce Campbell's eyes.

27
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,280
That's true. This conundrum is all in your head. If you say to yourself,

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
ah, screw it, I'm just going to be normal and polite, that's the number one thing.

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,120
What you don't want is for them to walk away thinking, man, what a weirdo.

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,680
Yeah.

31
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,000
What a weird guy. Now, speaking of this,

32
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Travis, did you or did you not once give Bruce Campbell a cookie? Is that accurate?

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,480
I did. I did give him a cookie because he was talking about how everybody was giving him

34
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,920
hand-drawn pictures of Ash and action figures that they had made in their basement,

35
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,520
working on it for several weeks.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,240
Ash Ketchum?

37
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Yeah, Ash Ketchum. And I was like, well, do you want a cookie? I didn't make it,

38
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
but you can have it. And he was like, that's the greatest thing anyone's ever given me.

39
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,480
So anyone who sees Bruce Campbell at Comic-Con, give him a cookie.

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,080
He's down, man.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
I guarantee he did not eat that cookie.

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,080
He did not. Hey, Darlene, throw this in the poison box for me.

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
It's chocolate chip and pills.

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,560
I cried into it just a little.

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,480
Just remember, when it comes to talking to famous people,

46
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,360
really your only goal should be that for years to come,

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,840
you can tell your friends how you talk to Bruce Campbell.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
Yeah, it's not going to matter much to Bruce Campbell, ultimately.

49
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Like, if you expect them to look at you and go, man,

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,280
that was a really witty thing you just said.

51
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,600
You seem like somebody I could be best friends with.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,640
Yeah, that's not happening.

53
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,800
That's the thing. You've got to be realistic about what the interaction is going to be,

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,040
because they're not going to walk away thinking like, man,

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,600
I wish I had more time to chill with that dude.

56
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,200
It's just not how people's brains are wired.

57
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
Just try to make the best impression possible and be confident.

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,840
That's the number one thing.

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,560
Although I bet the only thing Bruce Campbell hates more than when people come up to him

60
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:45,520
and are super skin-peelingly awkward are the people who think they can hang on the same level

61
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,880
as Bruce Campbell or even worse or cooler than Bruce Campbell.

62
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,160
Yeah, you're not that.

63
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,080
You want to be reasonably complimentary.

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,160
You want to be like, I love your work.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
Keep up the good stuff.

66
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
See you later.

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,680
That's it. That's all you need to do.

68
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,480
Mm-hmm. I do want to make a note about Felicia Day.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,720
That is a different situation.

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,680
Just don't do that.

71
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah, don't talk to her.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,840
Just don't talk to her.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,760
She gets that all the time.

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,440
Let it go.

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,400
But talk to Bruce Campbell.

76
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
He seems all right.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,040
Felicia Day from everything I've heard is very nice.

78
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,240
I haven't spoken to her.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,880
I'm sure she's very nice, but the odds are you're going to walk up

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,080
and no matter what wonderful compliment you have formulated in your head,

81
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,880
it's going to come out like this.

82
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah, you're just going to start expectorating.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,920
Wow.

84
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,640
Your hair is red.

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,600
It's nice.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,920
Your pants like your toe.

87
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,760
I recently moved to a new city to be with my girlfriend.

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,800
Mistake?

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,040
Yeah.

90
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,360
There's like in parentheses, it doesn't.

91
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Mistake?

92
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,400
Yes.

93
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,240
At first it was difficult, but well, well.

94
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,240
Wonder who could have told you that?

95
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Could it have been our first episode?

96
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,480
Yep.

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,120
At first it was difficult, but now things are going well

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
and I've recently been hired on to do my dream job.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
However, the most important thing in my life,

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,360
by which I mean my motivation, is this girl.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
She recently informed me that she's moving to a city an hour and a half away

102
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:20,000
and said so nonchalantly as if it had not been a consideration

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,240
in the decision making process.

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,960
Is she packing her bags and moving away?

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,920
Love this guy.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,960
Dude, she's giving you the Carmen Sandiego slip.

107
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,480
She goes from Nashville to Norway.

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Hey, Ricky, where's Tracy?

109
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,120
I don't know.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,480
I have to go buy an atlas.

111
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
Hello, shoes.

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,440
Where's your girlfriend?

113
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
How familiar are you with country flags?

114
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,720
Because I need someone who can identify them to find my girlfriend.

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
Hey, first off, that's some cold shit.

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,680
I just want to tell you that she's doing to you.

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
So you moved to Nowheresville, Indiana,

118
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,560
and she says, I'm moving an hour and a half away.

119
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,040
Is that the way this shakes out?

120
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,540
Really?

121
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,880
I've got to tell you, dude, honestly, I love you

122
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,560
because you listen to our show and I know that you love this girl.

123
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,440
That doesn't sound like the actions of somebody who cares enough about you.

124
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,120
No, especially to drop it.

125
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
It's one thing to be like, listen, I've had this opportunity come up.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,640
I can't turn it down.

127
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
But you're just be like, oh, PS, I'm moving.

128
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,640
Peace, like.

129
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
BT dubs.

130
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,560
Yeah, that's right.

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,640
The nonchalantly is what really bothers me.

132
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,320
I mean, maybe she's, you know, I do that.

133
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,960
I think everybody does that where you feel really bad about something.

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,480
So it's not a big deal.

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,520
It's not an effective defense mechanism in the slightest.

136
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,240
But I've done it before.

137
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
I mean, 90 minutes isn't isn't too bad.

138
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,760
It's not like as far as long distance relationships goes, it's not too bad.

139
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,960
But presumably the only one he knows there.

140
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,560
Yeah.

141
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,280
And also, he moved to a city to be with her.

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
And then, yeah, like if they were in the same city to begin with,

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,520
and then she moved an hour and a half away, no problem.

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,600
But to him to relocate himself and then she moves away.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,160
Here's a little tough love.

146
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,000
You might want to take a step back from the situation

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
and kind of take stock of the relationship

148
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
because you might be a little too close to it

149
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
and it might not be going as well as you think.

150
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,480
We got another email here.

151
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,720
I keep moving away from my boyfriend.

152
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,880
When is he going to and then he moves to where I am.

153
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
When is he going to get it to hit?

154
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,320
Love lost in Las Vegas.

155
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,160
I say, you know,

156
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,960
I say you just got hired to your dream job.

157
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,040
It's time to make a new home an hour and a half away

158
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,120
from your ex-girlfriend.

159
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,680
Yeah, you need some time for you.

160
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,400
You really do.

161
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,080
You need to take some time and see where it goes.

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Don't follow her again.

163
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,560
If you want to like cool things off

164
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,800
and see if it's still working out in a few months, cool.

165
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,160
But you just got a good job.

166
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,760
And you really, the fact that she would do that

167
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,520
without really thinking about you that much,

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
it doesn't, it's worrisome.

169
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,520
Let's put it that way.

170
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,240
It's worrisome.

171
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,400
So take, I agree with Travis, take stock.

172
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,560
Just bury yourself in your work

173
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
because really work is the best girlfriend

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,760
that a guy could ask for.

175
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,440
I have 13 goddamn Yahoo answer questions.

176
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Let's just do them back to back to back to back to back.

177
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,240
Yeah, let's kill ourselves.

178
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
I think it'd be good to start out with this one.

179
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
It was sent in by Randy May.

180
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,040
Thank you, Randy May.

181
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,200
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Sarah, who asks,

182
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,240
why do I sleepwalk to the toilet, sit there and cry?

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
Ever since I was a child,

184
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,920
I would sleepwalk to the bathroom

185
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
and just sit on the toilet,

186
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,120
not going to the bathroom and cry.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,320
The thing is, I'm usually conscious of it.

188
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,760
So am I sleepwalking?

189
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,160
Why am I doing this?

190
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,440
Hey, no, you're like really depressed.

191
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,080
You're like, you've been super depressed your whole life.

192
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,800
Your whole life.

193
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,480
And this thing you're doing

194
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,400
is the most depressing thing I've ever heard of.

195
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,160
So it's like a cyclical.

196
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,440
You're making yourself more depressed.

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
You're not sleepwalking.

198
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,360
You can't sleep.

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
You're conscious.

200
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,280
You're conscious.

201
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,680
Sometimes I sleepwalk,

202
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
but I didn't lay down to go to sleep,

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
but I did this really super depressing thing.

204
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
Um, everybody.

205
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,600
Yeah.

206
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,920
Everybody in the answers section agrees that,

207
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,040
agrees that this is just stone cold depression.

208
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,160
Can I just say right now,

209
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,880
if you post a question on Yahoo Answers

210
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,800
and everyone in the answers is like,

211
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,200
uh, if everyone on Yahoo Answers

212
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,640
isn't where you have a problem.

213
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Oh, bad news.

214
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
If there's not one person in the answers who's like,

215
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
no, there's completely normal.

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,720
Then you've broken Yahoo Answers

217
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
and it's time to stop.

218
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
Cause there's some fucked up things

219
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,440
that people will endorse on Yahoo Answers.

220
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,560
It'll get raw in there.

221
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,640
Yahoo Answers user Jeremy responded.

222
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,960
It's probably hard gas and depression.

223
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,760
Wait, hard gas?

224
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
The least of combination.

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,600
Oh no.

226
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,160
Sounds bad.

227
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,440
Thanks for coming into my office today, Fred.

228
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,400
I've been listening to your stomach.

229
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,680
Sounds like you got hard gas.

230
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
That's where it crystallizes.

231
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
We're going to get some little miners in there

232
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
and really get that out for you.

233
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
Hard gas is the hardest thing to deal with

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,760
that you can have.

235
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,720
It's harder than diamonds.

236
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
Hard gas.

237
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,560
What's wrong with you Yahoo Answers?

238
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,800
So she, so she's, she goes to sleep

239
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240
and she says, I need a walk.

240
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,840
I'm going to go to the toilet and sit on it and cry.

241
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,120
But she's not asleep is the thing.

242
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
Is the thing is she's not asleep.

243
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,400
That's not sleepwalking.

244
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,920
She's just unconsciously,

245
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,560
she's just like, you know, you do that from time to time.

246
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,280
You time travel.

247
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,120
You're like, oh, how did I, why am I doing this?

248
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,320
Like how am I, why am I sitting on my porch?

249
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,280
I'm not even wearing pants.

250
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,000
What's going on?

251
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,120
Maybe I went to like the worst hypnotist show ever.

252
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
Every time you see Jay Leno's face,

253
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,120
you will stand up from your bed.

254
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,280
You will walk to your toilet and you will cry.

255
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,120
To be fair, I do that every time I see Jay Leno's face.

256
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
I see Jay Leno's face too.

257
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,520
Hey, whenever I call a pizza place,

258
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,840
the first thing they say is, how can I help you?

259
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,800
I've gotten in the habit of saying, I'd like a pizza,

260
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,720
but I'm beginning to think that sounds a little patronizing.

261
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,400
Of course I'm ordering a pizza.

262
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,640
When I call a restaurant with pizza in its name,

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,480
what's the proper etiquette here?

264
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,960
How do I get through the pizza ordering process quickly

265
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
and without seem rude?

266
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,280
Thanks, Caro.

267
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,280
I like this one a lot.

268
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,120
Travis, is it Caro or did you just paste it improperly?

269
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,240
No, it's Caro.

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,960
Okay, Caro.

271
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,240
Not Carol.

272
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,680
Um, no.

273
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,320
I like that this is, uh, um, that's better than my usual,

274
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,400
which is I say, any pies today?

275
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,680
I just yell, zombie brah.

276
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,520
Zombie brah.

277
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,680
What's the za situation over there?

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
I like this a lot.

279
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,600
I think that when you, when you call, um, any,

280
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,280
any sort of food business,

281
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,160
you should explain as explicitly as, as possible,

282
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,560
the, the steps, the processes that brought you to,

283
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,560
to this phone call, like, hi, uh, Papa John's.

284
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,840
This is Griffin.

285
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,840
Um, I, I understand that you have pizza.

286
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,800
I'm in need of pizza.

287
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
Uh, I am calling your particular location

288
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,520
because that's close to my apartment.

289
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,760
And, uh, also I've heard great,

290
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
great things about your garlic dipping sauce.

291
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
So, uh, can we just begin the exchange right now?

292
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
Or do you have, do you have any questions for me?

293
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,640
I shouldn't, I shouldn't be so presumptuous.

294
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,240
What are the possibilities that you could bring me a pizza?

295
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,520
Do I need to come get the pizza?

296
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,880
What is the pizza situation at your location?

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
I don't want a pizza.

298
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,680
What I'd like is a round crust with sauce,

299
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,840
cheese, and toppings melted on top of it.

300
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,120
Can you do that for me?

301
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,240
Is that a possibility?

302
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,040
Hey, uh, I gotta, I gotta tell you,

303
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
this guy's working at the pizza place.

304
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,480
There is not, like, you being expedient

305
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,120
and efficient in your order

306
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
is the least rude thing you could do.

307
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,040
Yeah.

308
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,200
Like, the last thing he wants to do

309
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,280
is listen to you prattle on about,

310
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,200
and hem and haw about, you know, how,

311
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,640
what do you want to, what are you saying?

312
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,760
Your pizza's great.

313
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,480
I don't make it.

314
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
I work in a chain.

315
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
What I like to do is when they ask, how can I help you?

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,080
I pretend like I've called OnStar

317
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
and I've been in an accident.

318
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,120
That's good.

319
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,200
That's an efficient way of getting pizza.

320
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,000
That's not gonna be awkward.

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,520
How is this bad at getting pizza?

322
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
So bad, but really great at getting out of cars.

323
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,560
This is a, this is a total non sequitur,

324
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,800
but I found, I came across this incredible thing

325
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,280
on the internet that people have started doing

326
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,000
where they write, whenever you order pizzas online,

327
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,840
there's like a special field

328
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,760
where you can write in, like, special requests

329
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
and people have started asking, like,

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,840
draw a wizard on the box

331
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,240
and, like, sometimes you'll get somebody awesome

332
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
who will, in fact, draw a wizard on the pizza box.

333
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,720
So I wholly encourage people to start doing that.

334
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
Do you think if you said,

335
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,640
can you make me a happy face out of pepperonis?

336
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,920
Yes, I think they could do that.

337
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,240
Yeah.

338
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, you know what else?

339
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,960
Emailer, Caro, I have completely stopped using the phone

340
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,920
for my pizza order.

341
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,200
I mean, maybe if you're calling, like,

342
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
you know, the local pizza joint,

343
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,840
then this would be a different situation.

344
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,560
But, like, Papa John's and Dominio's,

345
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,040
they will, you just do that online.

346
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,560
Do that on your computer.

347
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Dominio's has a tracking system that tells you

348
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
who made your pizza and who is putting it in the oven.

349
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,120
Yeah, like, what stage of its life cycle it's currently at.

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,720
I wish it went further, actually.

351
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,120
I wish it was, like, in your small intestines.

352
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,680
Or into the past, like,

353
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Justin is thinking about ordering a pizza.

354
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,640
Justin has a deep, deep pizza hunger.

355
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,920
That's your intro.

356
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Hi, my name is Phillip.

357
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,960
My pizza hunger is deep.

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,800
I have a deep, rich pizza hunger.

359
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
I got a vein of pizza need in me that goes way down.

360
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,760
Do you guys sell pizza?

361
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,920
Because you're called Pizza Hut.

362
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,520
There's still a little confusion there.

363
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,880
It's nebulous.

364
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,320
It's nebulous on your pizza.

365
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,280
So I guess what we've settled on is zombie, bro.

366
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,880
I think that's still the best.

367
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,760
Griffin, hit me.

368
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,480
We need another one.

369
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,560
Good, because I got them.

370
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,920
I know, you know you got them.

371
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,440
How about this?

372
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
It was sent in by Emily Terrible.

373
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,320
Thank you, Emily Terrible.

374
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Drake H, who asks,

375
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,120
need some good drug awareness slogans.

376
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:03,760
10 points.

377
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,560
Oh, I should explain.

378
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,800
Yahoo Answers has this form of currency

379
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,920
that I don't think I've ever discussed,

380
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,040
but it's highly upsetting.

381
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
I think like you can give people points

382
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
for answering your questions.

383
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,400
I don't know what you do.

384
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,480
You spend those points on like kush balls?

385
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,040
I don't know.

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,760
I'll never know.

387
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,920
Anyway, just need some good drug awareness slogans.

388
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,360
It'll be better if they rhyme.

389
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,480
10 points to the best one.

390
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,080
That probably means the one with the most

391
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,640
or the one with a really, really good one.

392
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,280
Thanks, guys.

393
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,560
The best answer is by Yahoo Answers user, A7X Rules,

394
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,200
who says, for inhalants, you could get a picture

395
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
of the big bad wolf huffing something

396
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,800
and write he huffed and puffed

397
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
and then a picture of a grave

398
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
and underneath that, right?

399
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,120
And he blew himself in.

400
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
Or there's a whole website dedicated to it.

401
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,000
Just say, no, I'm too good for drugs.

402
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,040
Drug-free is the way to be.

403
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,920
Don't choose the booze.

404
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,360
If you choose the booze, you lose.

405
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,400
What's your anti-drug?

406
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,200
Stay alive.

407
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,080
Don't drink and drive.

408
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,320
Shoot up for the stars, not your arms.

409
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,400
Smoking the dope won't help you breathe.

410
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,240
You cope up with hope, down with dope.

411
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
If you don't know jack, you won't smoke crack.

412
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,120
This is your brain.

413
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,080
This is your brain on drugs.

414
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:14,720
Any questions?

415
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,120
Drugs are retarded, so don't get started.

416
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,080
Say not to pot.

417
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,960
PCP bad for me.

418
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

419
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,280
Say not to pot?

420
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,560
Hey, man, do you want some pot?

421
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:25,700
Not.

422
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
No, no, it's like a Wayne's World throwback.

423
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,440
Hey, I'd love some pot.

424
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,740
Not.

425
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,920
PCP bad for me.

426
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,360
I love that one.

427
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Because sometimes, like, I have a big PCP rock, a big vial of PCP juice.

428
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,640
A big sack of PCP.

429
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,240
A big strip of PCP.

430
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,480
I have a container full of PCP.

431
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,040
I have a container with PCP in its appropriate form in the appropriate amount to get me fucked

432
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,540
up.

433
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,520
And I think, is it?

434
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,160
Can I?

435
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,960
Should it?

436
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,460
Do it?

437
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,720
But then PCP bad for me just runs through my mind, and I fly away.

438
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
Kiss meth mouth goodbye.

439
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
Hugs not drugs.

440
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm above the influence.

441
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,920
Pot makes your brain rot, so let's not.

442
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,200
Get high on life, not on drugs.

443
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,960
You don't need heroin to be a hero.

444
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Be aware.

445
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,160
Don't share.

446
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,780
What?

447
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,360
Griffin, you are-

448
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,800
Those are your drugs.

449
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,640
Griffin, you're probably the best slam poet of our time.

450
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
Do you think?

451
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,600
I feel like, listening to you, I feel like I'm on Russell Simmons Deaf Poetry Jam.

452
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,560
It's like a tri- it's transportive.

453
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,240
Say not to pot?

454
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,880
You can't just make things up, and then pretend that not is something you say to people.

455
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,380
Yeah.

456
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,120
You can't be like, say jeed to weed.

457
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
Say what?

458
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,720
The rest of that should be, say not to pot, and then get beat up because you're an idiot.

459
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,080
If you say any of these things, you will get the shit beaten out of you.

460
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
Like, hey, hey, hey buddy.

461
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,000
You wanna, you wanna eat, do you wanna eat or snort or somehow imbibe this PCP?

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,120
Uh, sorry guys.

463
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
PCP?

464
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:09,680
Bad for me.

465
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,120
Do you wanna help me drink this empty squeeze it bottle of PCP?

466
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,080
That's what they keep them in.

467
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,560
They melt the top of the lighter.

468
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,720
They drink to squeeze it, then they melt the top of the lighter.

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,160
That's why it's so popular, it's a drug.

470
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,640
It's because-

471
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,840
They fill it with PCP.

472
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,680
There's so much impetus to squeeze it.

473
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,480
Who are these people that are constantly having to turn down drugs?

474
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,200
And why can't they just say no?

475
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
Is the dealer gonna be like, that wasn't creative enough, take this.

476
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,040
Try again.

477
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,280
I need to feel it.

478
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,600
I need to feel that you really don't want my drugs that I bought.

479
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,120
Could you, if only you had rhymed, I wouldn't be shoving this PCP in your mouth and eyes.

480
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,240
Or possibly ears or nose.

481
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,760
Or ears or nose.

482
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,800
Perhaps butthole.

483
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
I don't know how it's distributed.

484
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,280
I don't know about PCP very well.

485
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,360
Angel dust, Griffin, angel dust.

486
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,920
Is that what it is?

487
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,840
Yeah, you know, angel dust.

488
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,920
Probably snort.

489
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,960
That actually sounds kind of nice.

490
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,240
But it's bad for you, don't forget.

491
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,280
Ah, shit.

492
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,040
Yeah, sometimes I get confused.

493
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,120
I label my empty squeeze it bottles.

494
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,360
Just say bad for me, honestly.

495
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,080
Can we come up with anything for this person?

496
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,640
Like, better than say not to pot?

497
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,320
How about say yes to the dress?

498
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Because if you spend your money on dresses, you won't have any money for drugs.

499
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
Yeah, all I can come up with is something like angel dust.

500
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,680
It sounds really pleasant, but I'm going to have to pass.

501
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,200
No, see, that's nice because I didn't know that before.

502
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
I was literally 15 minutes away from going out to the street and finding some dust.

503
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,240
I appreciate your offer of marijuana, my friend, but unfortunately,

504
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm going to have to pass because I have things to do today.

505
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,640
What about I'm broke?

506
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,480
By that point, you're just punched in the face.

507
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm broke?

508
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm broke.

509
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,280
How about you holding, keep holding, and then you walk away.

510
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
That's a pretty good one.

511
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,560
I think that that would really shut him down.

512
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,760
Hey, I'm a secret cop.

513
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,800
A secret cop.

514
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,680
Yeah, I'm a cop.

515
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,440
That'll get you out of any of these.

516
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,800
Let me tell you about Jesus.

517
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,440
My dad, not angels.

518
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,400
You're confused.

519
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,200
My dad's a cop.

520
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,000
That's how you turn any drug dealer down.

521
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,640
My dad's a cop.

522
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
Yeah, he's going to bust us.

523
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
I think that this is an imagined situation.

524
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I don't think that there are these people who want to say no to drugs,

525
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,160
but don't know how to do it.

526
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,320
Who don't know how to come up with a good cover story for why they don't want to do drugs.

527
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,440
Yeah, do you want to know how I say no to drugs when people offer them to me?

528
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,440
Oh, no, thanks.

529
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,760
That's it.

530
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,120
That's all you have to do.

531
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,640
Yeah, or maybe I'm cool.

532
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm cool, but you're the fool.

533
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,280
Don't do drugs.

534
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,880
I'll just keep drinking this whiskey.

535
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,680
Thank you so much.

536
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
That's what I usually say.

537
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,840
I'm getting high on life, by which I mean whiskey.

538
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
My friend wants to ask someone to Sadie's.

539
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,600
What is that?

540
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,960
Like Sadie Hawkins?

541
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,520
Okay.

542
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
Sorry, I didn't have that in my school.

543
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,760
I grew up in the 50s and that had been antiquated for 30 years.

544
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,120
She doesn't know what she should say.

545
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:27,680
Her plan is to make a banner with a pickup line and the question to ask the guy to Sadie's

546
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,600
and hang it from the top of the stairs at lunch.

547
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,520
What should she put on there?

548
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,520
Sorry about this.

549
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
Any suggestions are welcome.

550
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,640
If you come up with something inappropriate, she's willing to tape it up there and run

551
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,080
off campus if necessary.

552
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:40,960
Thanks.

553
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,560
Shigatai.

554
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,280
How about, hey, you're probably going to say no because of this banner.

555
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,360
Hey, everything you just said sounds absolutely like the worst.

556
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,480
Don't do any of that.

557
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,040
You know what really makes someone want to go out with you?

558
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,480
Public embarrassment.

559
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,360
Humiliation.

560
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,200
Hey, look over there.

561
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,560
It's Banner Bob.

562
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,720
Kid that people only know because they'll go on a banner about him.

563
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,400
Just print out some four by sixes of his tiny dick and paste it on every single locker that

564
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,960
you can find.

565
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,880
This is Bob's dick.

566
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,240
It's minuscule.

567
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,920
Will he get a Sadie Hawkins with me?

568
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,800
Not now.

569
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,360
Probably.

570
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
Oh, God.

571
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:31,200
See, okay, girl, you are illustrating the classic men are from Mars, whoever from V is

572
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,760
Conundrum.

573
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,800
A girl would love that.

574
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,960
That would be so romantic.

575
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,240
She would love that.

576
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
A guy that does not, he's not, no, don't do that.

577
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
He's in a very delicate situation.

578
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,240
He's in high school.

579
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,720
Probably, presumably, right?

580
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,120
I mean, high school, it seems like a Sadie Hawkins, right?

581
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,840
High school.

582
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,560
Well, she said run off campus or he said run off campus.

583
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,800
And like, if I tried to run off my campus at Huntington High School, I would have been

584
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,240
shot as I tried to leave the gate.

585
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,560
Got a runner.

586
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,040
My question is this.

587
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,280
What possibly put your friend under the impression that she needed to do a big display?

588
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,640
Why don't you just walk up to the dude and be like, hey, Sadie Hawkins, you down?

589
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,440
Um, like, that's going to cover it.

590
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,560
Yeah, that'll be plenty.

591
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
That'll be plenty of interaction for this.

592
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,120
Now doesn't even have to do that much.

593
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,360
OK, but we are we are we're we are violating the premise of this question.

594
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,280
She's hanging a banner up the banner.

595
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,320
She bought the banner.

596
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,920
OK, she's already prepaid on the banner.

597
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,440
OK, she lost her receipt.

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
She's already done three exchanges at Walmart this year.

599
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
So it's not going back.

600
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,640
Got to do it.

601
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,320
What is the banner say?

602
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
Um, you're the best I'm going to do.

603
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
Let's go to Sadie Hawkins together.

604
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,160
I still think sorry about all this would be really effective.

605
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,720
Please don't read this banner.

606
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,000
Let's go to Sadie Hawkins.

607
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
What if you blame it on somebody he doesn't like?

608
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,040
Carolyn put this banner up.

609
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,880
So don't go to Sadie Hawkins with her.

610
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,800
Go to Sadie Hawkins with me, your friend.

611
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,000
What if you made one of those pictographs?

612
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,800
Is that what it's called?

613
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,360
One of the things that's like pictures with like, it's like a puzzle.

614
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,040
A rebus.

615
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,680
A rebus.

616
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,040
So you have a rebus, right?

617
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,120
But it's you just take a big picture of Stephen Hawking and you put it up there.

618
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,400
So you put it up there and like you write minus T minus Tevin.

619
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,640
I was much more interested in going to a Stephen Hawking's dance.

620
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,640
Yeah, the good thing is lots of seating.

621
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,640
Not a lot of talking.

622
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,160
Not a lot of talking.

623
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,000
And all of like the hip-hop, the shitty hip-hop music they play is run through a vocoder.

624
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,560
Shorty got low.

625
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
We're allowed to make fun of him because he's so goddamn smart.

626
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
Yup, he's never gonna listen.

627
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,560
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buttons hun.

628
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,400
Here it is.

629
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
Want to roll up to the Stephen Hawking's dance with me?

630
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,840
Why don't you ask him to the Stephen Hawking's dance?

631
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,920
Why don't you get Stephen Hawking to ask him to the Sadie Hawkins dance for you?

632
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,800
Wait, where are you going?

633
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,680
Come back.

634
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,080
Just give me 21 minutes to type this out with my eye.

635
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,920
Stop it.

636
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,080
Is that what he does?

637
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,160
Why don't you turn the banner?

638
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Why?

639
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,120
I can make fun of him.

640
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
He's like, he's succeeded.

641
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,960
Sure, he ripped a hole in space with his thoughts, but listen.

642
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,280
What if he does that to me?

643
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,160
He uses his brain to kill me from far away.

644
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,360
He almost certainly will.

645
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
You've got this banner, right?

646
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,520
That's what we're saying, that she has this banner.

647
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,440
Why don't you not write something clever on it and hang it at the top of the stairs at lunch?

648
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,920
Why don't you use it as some sort of makeshift net?

649
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Catch that boy.

650
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,680
Catch that boy and bind him.

651
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,520
Catch him, bind him, take him to the dance.

652
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,160
I'm going to wrap you up like a mummy and you're going to be mine forever.

653
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,800
Come on, mummy.

654
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,680
Because what every guy is waiting for is to be wrapped up like a mummy.

655
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,000
And then tag him and release him back into the water.

656
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:18,880
Where's Rob?

657
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,880
He looks like he's in science class right now.

658
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:28,560
In six months, we'll pull him in and trim his nails and clean his teeth and see how he's doing.

659
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, I'm going to get him investigated.

660
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,360
He'll eat me out of your hand.

661
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,120
Hold a super donut out of your hand.

662
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,920
He'll peck at it.

663
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,240
Now he's sleepy.

664
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,040
Who's sleepy?

665
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,480
Now he's sleepy.

666
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,520
How about a Yahoo?

667
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
Yeah, perfect.

668
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,640
Okay.

669
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,560
This one was sent in by Jacob Blocker.

670
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,760
Thank you, Jacob Blocker.

671
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,880
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Holmes, who asks,

672
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
Answering the phone while having sex.

673
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,160
Super hot or really rude?

674
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,680
That sounds like the headline of like a some sort of Dateline report.

675
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,080
I'm sure at one point or another while you were all doing the deed, the phone rang.

676
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,920
And that's where this question starts.

677
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
Where does it end?

678
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,920
No one knows.

679
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,240
Is it super hot to answer the phone and pretend like nothing is going on while continuing to have

680
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,680
sex, or is it unbelievably rude to even glance at the phone to see who it is?

681
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
What more, answer it.

682
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,560
I think we are all in agreement that texting during a dinner date is terrible manners,

683
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,800
but why is it more acceptable during sex, considering sex is much more intimate than

684
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,840
sharing a meal or a conversation?

685
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640
It's not!

686
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,120
Your thoughts?

687
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,120
You're a fucking psychopath, Hans.

688
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,480
You're a fucking psycho.

689
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Who said- Why is it that everybody says it's cool to text during sex?

690
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,400
Like, what are you talking about?

691
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,360
That's not a thing.

692
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,280
What reports are you reading?

693
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,520
Yeah, according to the Hans Daily.

694
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,720
If I ever-

695
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,320
Texting was sexting, like that's what you thought sexting was.

696
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
Everybody's talking about sexting right now.

697
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,920
I guess it's all right to do, but it seems rude to me.

698
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,280
Also, I just want to point out, I don't care how good a fucking actor you are.

699
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,680
I'll know.

700
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
Ain't no way you're pulling that off.

701
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
You're not- Yeah, everybody knows.

702
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
What's upsetting is that I probably wouldn't know, and like that's the most upsetting thought

703
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,720
in my mind right now.

704
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,640
So now whenever I have a conversation with anybody over the phone and I hear like a small

705
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,880
lull, like the tiniest lull, I'm just going to assume that they're boning down.

706
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,080
So this is- Okay, first off, I'll tell you what is sexy, Hans.

707
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,080
Calling it doing the deed.

708
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,400
That's really- That's so hot.

709
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,040
What I love is a euphemism for sex that I'm pretty sure my gym teacher used when he was

710
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,880
trying to explain it to boys and girls.

711
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
When you say doing the deed, it makes it sound like you're committing a felony.

712
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
Is it okay to answer the phone when making whoopee?

713
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,080
That's either like a small, small boy or a dog or a corpse that you're doing the thing

714
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,320
to.

715
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,880
Later he did the deed.

716
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,000
Don't know how else to put it than that.

717
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And he chopped him up and he buried him in a hole.

718
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,120
So find him guilty, please.

719
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,640
We got tons of evidence because he was talking on his goddamn cell phone.

720
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
We've been tracing all his texts.

721
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,040
His texts that he sent while having sex with people.

722
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
What a weird-

723
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,560
Chopping him up right now, lol.

724
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,160
Loz.

725
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,660
Loz.

726
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,640
You know what's worse is that he probably doesn't have like an iPhone.

727
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,280
He's probably got one of those old, like, Zack Morris giant cell phones.

728
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,000
Time out!

729
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,520
Hey, sweetheart.

730
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,440
Sweetheart, can you unflip this for me?

731
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,720
I need you to flip it open.

732
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,640
I need to- And I need you to hold the pound key down while I press this letter so I can

733
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,360
capitalize it.

734
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,920
I mean, good for Hans to apparently have this as much like- He can just like focus on- He

735
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,320
can do more than one thing at once whenever he's doing the deed.

736
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,280
Like, how does that not demand all of your- How does that not demand all your attention?

737
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,680
If it's not, then you're not a very considerate lover.

738
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,000
Maybe, Hans, the problem is you're not a very considerate lover.

739
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,200
Also, getting to have sex and getting somebody to call me to want to do something are two

740
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,240
such rare events.

741
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,760
I can't imagine them aligning.

742
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,680
I just know that when I go into a movie, I turn off my cell phone so it's not to interrupt

743
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,480
the other patrons.

744
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,040
But when I'm having sex, I turn it all the way up.

745
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,000
Sorry, other patron.

746
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,200
It's just you and me now.

747
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,080
I even tweet.

748
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,920
I tweet my phone number like, give me a ring.

749
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,720
About to get it on.

750
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,920
Nothing hotter than that.

751
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,040
Hit me up.

752
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,520
When you call the My Brother, My Brother, Me voicemail, I guess it can't- That doesn't

753
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,200
work because it happens on the internet.

754
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,360
Yeah, it's gross also to think about.

755
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
But just, you know, chances are.

756
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,520
Chances are.

757
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,680
I fuck all the time.

758
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,400
Just 26, 7.

759
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,320
Oh, because he's in Chicago.

760
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,240
He's got that extra hour in that different time zone.

761
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,160
How much does age matter in a relationship?

762
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,640
I'm 22 and I work with a 35 year old that I am crushing on hardcore.

763
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,960
I think the only reason that we aren't sleeping together right now is because he thinks I

764
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,520
am too young.

765
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,480
Thoughts?

766
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,720
Well, you are too young.

767
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,520
You are too young.

768
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,240
That's gross.

769
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,840
22 and 35?

770
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,920
I think it's once it's half your age.

771
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,960
If half your age is the difference between, I think that's-

772
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,160
But that's so he's cool?

773
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,160
No, I'm saying he's not cool.

774
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm saying that's more than half your age.

775
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,360
If half of his age is 11, right?

776
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
Half of his age is 35.

777
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,800
So adding 11 to 22 is 33.

778
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,720
Right?

779
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,000
You're too young.

780
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,960
You're too young.

781
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,240
He's gonna hurt you.

782
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
He knows so much more shit than you do.

783
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,600
I mean, if you're mature enough to enjoy the taste of a vine-ripened 30 plus man,

784
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,840
I'd say that you are pretty mature.

785
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Don't listen to Travis.

786
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,000
Us 30 plus guys have to stick together.

787
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,040
His jaundiced, sun-stained, wrinkly old skin.

788
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,960
There's no one- I think once you hit 30 plus, you assume that no one wants to have sex with

789
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,040
you.

790
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,480
Maybe you need to be more explicit.

791
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,480
And just go up to him and say, hey, oldie, let's do this.

792
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,720
Hey.

793
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,520
Hang a banner.

794
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,280
Ready to be a statistical improbability?

795
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Have some sex.

796
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,600
This is a sexy episode.

797
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,200
It is not a lot of sex in this episode.

798
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,080
It's just right.

799
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,480
A lot of people want to have sex, but not able to work it out.

800
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,440
Or a pizza.

801
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,840
They just can't seem to make the initial connection.

802
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,520
Sagging with sex juice.

803
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,440
Hey, yeah, I'd like extra cheese, pepperoni, and sagging with sex juice.

804
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,080
Is this weird?

805
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,600
Is this a weird conversation we're having?

806
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,160
I was looking for a less awkward way to order pizza, and the podcast I listened to said,

807
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,760
I should order it with sex juice so that we'd have a good laugh about it.

808
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,360
Sex juice and angel dust.

809
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,520
That is my favorite Cary Grant movie, though.

810
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,240
I still have like a dozen yahoos.

811
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,280
Okay, do another one.

812
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,240
Okay, do another one.

813
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,320
Wait, are we, I mean, did we help 22 and 35 out enough?

814
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,040
Just go for it.

815
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,520
He wants to, he wants to, he wants you on and around him.

816
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,080
Just go for it.

817
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,120
The short answer is age doesn't matter in a relationship unless it does matter in a relationship.

818
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,320
Like, if it doesn't matter to either one of you, it's not a problem.

819
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,840
If it matters to him, then it's a problem.

820
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,080
He doesn't think you're too young, trust me.

821
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,600
I think, I mean, he's just scared.

822
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,960
Long as he's not married.

823
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,920
Long as he's not married.

824
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,200
You don't want to be a homewrecker.

825
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,840
Unless he is.

826
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,560
I feel like maybe I should just read like five or six of the headlines,

827
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,920
and then you guys can tell me.

828
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,760
Choose your adventure style.

829
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,080
Which one we should, which one we should dip into.

830
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,560
Okay.

831
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:32,880
Do it.

832
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,840
Does that sound acceptable?

833
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,120
Okay, how about this?

834
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,240
I'll just read them, and then I'll go into further detail when you decide.

835
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,920
Question, who does Ash really kiss from Pokemon?

836
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
Is it okay to cry after sex?

837
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,960
How do you ask someone to model for you?

838
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,160
Could an adult male survive on just breast milk?

839
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,920
Can I lick my cat?

840
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,120
I enjoy it, does he?

841
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,880
Getting a tattoo soon, I know what I want, but could you guys help me with something?

842
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,000
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

843
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,200
Okay, okay, all right.

844
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,920
Could I legally hunt and kill a Sasquatch?

845
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,120
Okay, I vote on the chinchilla business.

846
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,240
Okay, chinchilla business.

847
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,800
This is easy.

848
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,000
We can knock this one out quick though.

849
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,720
Okay, all right.

850
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,560
Chinchis and a cinchi.

851
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,040
What?

852
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,960
This one was sent in by Matt Warren.

853
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,600
Thank you, Matt Warren.

854
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,280
It's by Yahoo Answers user Megan, who asked,

855
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,480
I need help naming my chinchilla breeding business.

856
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,960
Hello?

857
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,640
I am looking into breeding chinchillas, but I need a name for my company.

858
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,680
I want it to be something elegant and pretty, and the last word needs to be chinchillas or exotics.

859
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,200
I don't want anything that says Megan's or Ontario's, etc.

860
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,160
I also don't want silly names like chinny chin chins.

861
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,600
That's the best.

862
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,440
That's the best one, though.

863
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
It needs to sound sophisticated.

864
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240
For example, some names I like are Blue Moon Chinchillas, Blue Moon Exotics,

865
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,200
Autumn Breeze Chinchillas, Autumn Breeze Chinchillas,

866
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,840
Autumn Breeze Chinchillas, Autumn Breeze Exotics,

867
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,720
White Rose Chinchillas, White Rose Exotics.

868
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,880
If you need any other information, just ask.

869
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,360
Also, if you want to add in some possible chinchilla names, I wouldn't mind.

870
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,720
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

871
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,360
Bramble Pelt.

872
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,280
Thanks for everything, Megan.

873
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,000
Storm Scream.

874
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,880
Night Shadow.

875
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,880
Can I suggest Fluffy Rats Exotics?

876
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,320
Because that says what they are without it coming right out and saying chinchillas.

877
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,000
Chinchillas is a bit on the nose.

878
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,240
Can I suggest Chin Deep?

879
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,840
Chin Deep.

880
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,720
Now, it does have to end with chinchillas or exotics.

881
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,840
Those are the rules.

882
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,120
Chin Deep Exotics?

883
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,320
Oh, that's not good.

884
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,520
That's not a good...

885
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,720
That doesn't work for me at a few levels.

886
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,680
That sounds like a website that opens up when you're on another website

887
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,400
you shouldn't be on accidentally.

888
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,600
Ready to go chin deep?

889
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,640
How did you get chin deep?

890
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,960
No one started dumping exotics.

891
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,880
When it got waist deep, you weren't like, ow.

892
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,000
It didn't happen all at once.

893
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,640
I am chin deep in exotics right now.

894
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,120
That pit of exotics doesn't look so deep.

895
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,040
I'm going to jump in and just see how it goes.

896
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,960
I'm chin deep.

897
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
What about Speed Rats?

898
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,160
Speed Rats.

899
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,600
Because that's what chinchillas are.

900
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,880
They're like rats, but they dart back and forth very quickly.

901
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,560
Erotic exotics.

902
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,760
Okay, now we're on to something.

903
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,560
Yeah, that's good.

904
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,240
It's got like a little flow to it.

905
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,320
What about Mussolini's Chinchillas?

906
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,800
I mean, you want something classy.

907
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,680
Something classy.

908
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
How about Sacco Chinchillas?

909
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
Sacco Chinchillas.

910
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
And then your best thing is like, you already have a gimmick.

911
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,400
So like, people come in, you're like, how about a Sacco Chinchillas?

912
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:01,120
And like, they can pay extra for the grab bag, and who knows what's in the grab bag.

913
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,640
Spoiler alert, dead chinchillas.

914
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,120
There's a good one.

915
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,320
Dead chinchillas.

916
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,160
People come in like, hey, what the fuck, man?

917
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,880
And you're like, no, no, no, they're very much alive.

918
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,520
Would you like one?

919
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,440
It's pronounced the odd.

920
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,400
How about Tiny Shitty Cats?

921
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,560
Chinchillas.

922
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,200
Exotics.

923
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,700
Exotics.

924
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
Exotics.

925
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,120
Anytime you have like any pets smaller than a cat, just fuck you.

926
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,080
Like, that's not a thing.

927
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,280
Yeah, let's get out of here with that.

928
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,280
Unless it's a ferret, which is like a long cat.

929
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,640
I still don't like those.

930
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,280
A friend of mine once told me that I shouldn't be afraid of his chinchilla

931
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,120
because it has little raspberry eyes and it wouldn't hurt a flea.

932
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,840
What does that mean?

933
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,000
That's a weird name for a business.

934
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,280
It has like segmented eyes?

935
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:49,840
Yeah, no, it looks like a ra- I think it may be just the color of raspberry.

936
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,200
I hope they don't have segmented eyes.

937
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,480
That would be pretty much the worst.

938
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,800
They could see you from all angles.

939
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,520
There's gotta be something.

940
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:00,880
I think we've got-

941
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,440
Out of curiosity, are there any answers on that question?

942
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,880
Yeah, there's gotta be some, right?

943
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
I mean, they're all, but they're all very...

944
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,120
How about Clueless Money Grubbers R Us?

945
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,040
That's a little mean.

946
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,680
Excuse me?

947
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,720
Breeding any animals not a business or a company.

948
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,920
They're not there for your profit.

949
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,640
I'm ruining things.

950
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,920
Oh, God.

951
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,200
Oh, God.

952
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,640
Ragged Telecaster says,

953
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,680
I don't know about names, but I'll breed with your chinchillas if you like.

954
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, no.

955
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,780
Dude.

956
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,200
What?

957
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,680
What did you say to me?

958
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,680
You'll breed-

959
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,800
Here, hey, do it on site and call it the worst thing you've ever seen chinchillas.

960
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,520
The island of Dr. Moreau chinchillas.

961
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,200
Yeah.

962
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
A nightmare circus sideshow.

963
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Everything you've ever feared in your life, chinchillas.

964
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,200
How about just chinchilla-

965
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,120
I want to buy a chinchilla, maybe want to die.

966
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,800
How about loose and easy chinchillas?

967
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,960
The sluttiest madam chinchillas.

968
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,480
Madam chinchillas.

969
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,560
Your first time around, you're gonna want Rosie.

970
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,360
She breaks in the newbies.

971
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,080
Yahoo Answers user EmeraldA responded,

972
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,240
I like autumn breeze exotics, but I am thinking chinny chinny chill lala.

973
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,680
Chinchilla cool cats or chinchilla CCs for short.

974
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,760
Chinchilla CCs?

975
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,400
What?

976
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,840
It is good to start out the name with C because one of the first listed in directories.

977
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,240
And how about chinny chilled out cats?

978
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,040
Lol.

979
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,440
What the fuck are you saying?

980
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,200
Chinny chilled out cats?

981
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,080
How about fun dip baseball disco dance?

982
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,800
Like how about we just make a bunch of words

983
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,880
that have nothing to do with the thing that she asked about.

984
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,480
So he says you should pick something with a C

985
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,320
because it's one of the first letters.

986
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,320
Like you know the first one, right, dog?

987
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:00,160
Yeah, maybe a few pages in the directory that precede chinny chilled out cats.

988
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,520
You dumb fuck.

989
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,880
To be fair, everyone knows everyone just skips right over A and B

990
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,320
because those are for pussies.

991
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,000
You got to go right into the C.

992
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,520
That's where the meat of the matter is.

993
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,800
Absolutely amazing.

994
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,120
Chinny chin chinchilla cats.

995
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,160
Aardvarks chin chinchillas for fuck's sake.

996
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,680
This is what you call your business.

997
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,160
Aardvarks and chinchillas and not aardvarks.

998
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,120
Aardvarks, chinchillas, and just kidding about the aardvark exotics.

999
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,320
Just do a rebus with a picture of an aardvark plus chinchilla minus aardvark.

1000
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,160
Because everybody knows that in the film book rebuses come first.

1001
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,320
Go on in and watch a grown man fucking chinchilla.

1002
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,040
I'm so glad we're back to back.

1003
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
The rebus for that is going to be a nightmare.

1004
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,080
Here at aardvarks, chinchillas, and not aardvarks.

1005
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,720
I came here to fuck aardvarks and chinchillas and we're fresh out of aardvarks.

1006
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,840
So this is misleading advertising.

1007
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,520
I'm also a lawyer.

1008
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,800
Good to see you.

1009
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,800
But first I am going to- I've heard good things about Rosie.

1010
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,760
Can you direct me to her?

1011
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,320
Goddamn slut rats.

1012
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,480
You're fooling nobody.

1013
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,520
I can't get past it.

1014
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,480
Nothing's funnier than a man having sex with a chinchilla.

1015
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,840
How am I going to top that with like-

1016
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,720
More like logistically perplexing.

1017
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,400
Yeah, all I can picture is that if that was as the business,

1018
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,880
watch a dude fucking chinchilla, it's just him waving and smiling at a crowd.

1019
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,480
And it's really messing with me.

1020
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,200
Dear Bob, do you and your chinchilla-sized wiener want to go to Sadie Hawkins with me?

1021
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:42,960
Get back of me.

1022
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,800
Here's a photo of reference for people who are not familiar with Bob.

1023
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,760
You said chinchilla-sized and I heard chinchilla-shaped.

1024
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:53,600
We have to move on.

1025
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,120
We can't legally.

1026
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,640
I'm stuck here.

1027
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,040
I'm stuck here, too many terrible images.

1028
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:05,520
Is it weird or gross when you answer your cell phone while on the toilet?

1029
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,880
My brother does that all the time.

1030
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,720
And when I tell him it's gross, he begs to differ.

1031
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:10,960
Yes, the end of the show.

1032
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,600
That was easy.

1033
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah, it is.

1034
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,720
Don't ever do that again.

1035
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,120
I mean, what's the fucking-

1036
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,040
What could possibly be ambiguous about this?

1037
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,320
There's nothing to debate on this question.

1038
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,280
It's gross.

1039
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,080
It's gross always.

1040
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:26,480
Unless.

1041
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:27,840
Unless.

1042
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,080
No.

1043
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,560
Unless you push it and answer your phone in a huge airport bathroom while everyone else is going.

1044
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,200
That's really good.

1045
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,800
Hey, Christy, it's Reggie.

1046
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,440
What's up?

1047
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,080
What are you doing?

1048
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm just crying.

1049
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,400
How did I get here?

1050
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,520
Thank you for calling me and helping me snap out of it.

1051
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,960
Damn you, Mr. Mysterio.

1052
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,080
You got me again.

1053
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,680
I want to hear Griffin's last question.

1054
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,640
But first, housekeeping.

1055
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,680
If you want to listen to other shows, if you want to talk to like-minded individuals,

1056
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,880
anything you can dream of, mbmbam.com is our web address.

1057
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,240
Make sure you head over to the maximumfun.org forums.

1058
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,040
That's where everybody is talking.

1059
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,880
We've seen there have been a lot of mbmbam listeners who have made the pilgrimage over

1060
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,320
there and I just want to tell each and every one of you how just I'm legitimately super

1061
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,600
proud of every one of you.

1062
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,080
Yeah, scary.

1063
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,120
But just don't be afraid because you could do it.

1064
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,360
I noticed a little bit of hesitation in the first couple first couple weeks, but I think

1065
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,560
that I think that our communities are they're jelling.

1066
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,360
Yeah, they are jelling.

1067
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:52,720
And also there's a there's a post on the forum every week where people discuss the

1068
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,680
new show.

1069
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,720
Go there and like talk about it so we can beat those jerks that stop podcasting yourself.

1070
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,960
I want our forum to have more responses than theirs.

1071
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,520
Why are you so angry at them?

1072
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,080
I'm going to start.

1073
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,840
I need to start an imaginary.

1074
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,960
You know how like they say you go to prison and kill somebody the first day?

1075
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,560
It's the same principle.

1076
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,560
No, I love those guys.

1077
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,720
They just had their 150th show for them.

1078
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,760
Oh, congrats.

1079
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,000
I know.

1080
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,560
Congrats, guys.

1081
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,680
Mazel tov.

1082
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,040
That's a funny ass show.

1083
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,480
I feel like we should do a better job.

1084
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,720
Like, go listen to all the different Maximum Fun podcasts.

1085
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,560
They're all so, so incredible.

1086
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,200
Yeah, they're all great.

1087
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,880
We get questions all the time where people are like, well, I'm finally caught up on your

1088
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,440
show.

1089
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,000
What do I do now to wait till next Monday?

1090
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,640
Go to Maximumfun.org and listen to all of those shows.

1091
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,040
There's like hundreds of Jordan Jesse Goes.

1092
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,520
Yeah, there's.

1093
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,400
Jump on those.

1094
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,440
Stop podcasting yourself.

1095
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,480
Judge Jon Huntsman.

1096
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,600
Go listen to Jordan Jesse Go a bit where they're coming up with new

1097
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,400
new sci-fi channel movies that combine people with animals.

1098
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,400
One of them was Jose.

1099
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,320
Jose can snake.

1100
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,920
So go listen to those shows.

1101
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,800
You'll really enjoy them.

1102
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,520
If you would like to sponsor our show, we will.

1103
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,400
We will.

1104
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,880
We would love to have you on as a sponsor.

1105
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,800
We'll say whatever the hell you want us to.

1106
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,840
We're dirty like that.

1107
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,520
And you can like where the chinchillas of podcasting.

1108
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,800
We are the chinchillas of pocket.

1109
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:15,840
That was our original title.

1110
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
The email Teresa.

1111
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,840
That's with an H, correct?

1112
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,800
That is correct.

1113
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,880
At Maximumfun.org and tell her, hey, I want to get on board with those guys.

1114
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,880
It's affordable.

1115
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:27,760
It is.

1116
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,080
It's like a hundo.

1117
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,040
So get on board.

1118
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,840
Hundo for a personal message, 150 for a commercial message.

1119
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,080
I'd like to say a couple of special things.

1120
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:46,160
Um, one out to KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9, your antidote to commercial radio with hot Donna.

1121
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,200
That's good.

1122
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,000
What are you doing?

1123
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,160
Yeah.

1124
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,800
You like that?

1125
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,600
No, I like this.

1126
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,640
It's a Kansas state, uh, college radio station.

1127
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,960
Um, and hot Donna gave us a great shout out and recommended us to all the listeners.

1128
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,760
So can I wait?

1129
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,600
I want to give her a liner.

1130
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:00,400
I want to give her a letter.

1131
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,120
Hey, you're listening to KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9.

1132
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,480
Your antidote to commercial radio with hot Donna.

1133
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,640
Worth its weight in gold.

1134
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,760
You're welcome hot Donna.

1135
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,880
Hey, this is my brother, my brother, me and Oasis.

1136
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,240
And you're listening to KSDB Wildcat.

1137
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,960
They're being quiet.

1138
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,400
We're here with Mark McGrath.

1139
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,880
Listen to the KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9.

1140
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,400
Can we go a week without a Mark McGrath reference?

1141
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,640
It's dated and like completely like why the fuck do we keep talking about this dude?

1142
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,360
I love him.

1143
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,080
I can't get enough.

1144
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,120
Hey, lock into KSDB, the Wildcat 91.9 and enjoy fucking that chinchilla.

1145
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,760
Break off the knob.

1146
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:51,680
Uh, so also a special thanks to Michael, Eric and Stephen for helping me out with a,

1147
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,520
with a project, uh, for work.

1148
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,800
They're very nice guys.

1149
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:01,440
Um, on Twitter, thank you to at Matt Murray for recommending us to your friend and at

1150
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,160
mad offer.

1151
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,160
Sorry about fart touch.

1152
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,000
I just kind of want to apologize to everyone.

1153
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,720
It's like a blanket apology for touching.

1154
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,360
I feel like fucking Pandora and I opened a box and let fart touch out and I've ruined

1155
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,840
lives.

1156
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,880
Yeah, you can't put that back.

1157
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm so very sorry.

1158
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,040
Master Stealth on YouTube.

1159
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,080
He created a video to help introduce, um, new listeners.

1160
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,520
So, you know, check it out.

1161
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,000
It's all about the people's nasty gum bit.

1162
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,800
Um, so thank you much.

1163
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,360
If you search MBM on YouTube, you find a lot of clips.

1164
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,080
That's a good way to introduce people to show say, Hey, let's do the show.

1165
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,960
Here's a bit.

1166
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,440
Here's a bit.

1167
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:37,840
They do.

1168
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,800
There's a classic bit.

1169
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,920
One of the recurring bits.

1170
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,440
We don't actually have those, but it would be nice if we did, you know, we need to bring

1171
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,320
back, you know, it's coming back in fashion for the, for the new spring season listening

1172
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,280
parties.

1173
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,720
Ooh, listening parties.

1174
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,000
We, this for our, for our new listeners, we used to do this thing and we still do it.

1175
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,840
We just, not a lot of people have requested them where, uh, if you get together with a

1176
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,440
group of friends, what was our ruling?

1177
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,320
Was it four?

1178
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,960
We said it's two for God.

1179
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,080
So four for us.

1180
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,280
Cause it's okay.

1181
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,560
So, you know, four more gathered in our name.

1182
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,680
Preferably some people who've never, maybe, maybe a couple of people who'd never heard

1183
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,560
the show before.

1184
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,160
Um, but you, uh, yeah, you guys, you get together with them, uh, and you, you schedule a listening

1185
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,800
party and you send us an email with explicitly stating this is for the listening party.

1186
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,640
Uh, and we will record you a brief private message, which we will send to you.

1187
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,640
Tell us as much about the party as you can so we can try to make it, you know, it's

1188
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,200
personal.

1189
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,960
Yeah, it's important that afterward we need pics or it didn't happen.

1190
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,880
Photographic evidence.

1191
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:44,560
Uh, if you need a template, uh, just check out the mod locks because, uh, dude's still

1192
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,040
repping the set after what?

1193
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,680
Like five months, nothing, but nonstop parties like party 17 or something.

1194
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:55,280
Yeah, it's completely, it's sickening, but like in a good way, sickening in a good way.

1195
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,000
No, I'm thank you.

1196
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:56,880
I'm I'm sick.

1197
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,120
And I think that's it, right?

1198
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,200
That's all of our garbage we have to do.

1199
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,800
All of our housekeeping.

1200
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
Uh, did you give out our email address?

1201
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,560
N B N B M at gmail.com.

1202
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,440
Did you give out our phone number?

1203
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,240
There it is.

1204
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,640
Three, two, one, three, three, three N B N B A M seven eight three nine.

1205
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,280
Wow.

1206
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,760
I don't know.

1207
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,720
I don't think you got a single one of those.

1208
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,200
I don't.

1209
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,400
I don't actually know the number.

1210
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,400
It's two zero three N B N B A M one.

1211
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,360
Okay.

1212
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,080
Oh, it's easy enough.

1213
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,440
That's easier than I made it out to be.

1214
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,080
I think.

1215
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,320
Yeah.

1216
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,800
Just call and leave us a message cause we like hearing your voices.

1217
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
Yeah, we just, we love you very much.

1218
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,280
Uh, so Griffin hit me with the last question.

1219
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,920
One to grow on.

1220
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,800
One to think about.

1221
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,280
Yeah.

1222
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:35,520
Yeah.

1223
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,280
This one was sent in by Donald Hawkins.

1224
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,400
Thank you, Donald.

1225
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tommy Smith, who asks,

1226
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,600
can you help me stop thinking about Sonic the Hedgehog?

1227
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,000
He's Travis McElroy.

1228
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,200
He's Griffin McElroy.

1229
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,120
He's been my brother, my brother and me.

1230
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:55,760
Kiss your dad.

1231
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,200
This is going to wear on the lips.

1232
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,960
Keep your heart three stacks.

1233
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,000
Keep your heart.

1234
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,160
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1235
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,120
Keep your heart.

1236
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,120
Man, these girls are smart three stacks.

1237
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,240
These girls are smart.

1238
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:27,200
Play your part, play your part.
