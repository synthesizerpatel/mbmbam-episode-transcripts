1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:46,880
Hello everybody and welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me,

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,480
an advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:07,840
And I'm sweet, sensual Valentine's Day brother. Not brother, but sensual gentleman,

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,480
Griffin McElroy, the youngest brother, your brother.

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600
Wait, are you their sensual brother?

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,120
I've got two Ferrero Rochers and I've put them in a suggestive sensual position.

12
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,640
My nipples.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,720
I figured, listen guys, pause the show. I think that maybe there might be people out there who

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,480
don't, and we all know that we love Valentine's Day. It's the most important holiday.

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,840
It's the most sacred holiday.

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
The most natural holiday.

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
Most natural holiday Jesus invented a long time ago. And so there might be people who

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,680
don't have a sensual lover and so they might want some help, like podcast help with that.

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
And we help with every other thing, I don't see why. And it can be completely platonic,

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
you know what I mean? Like a platonic sensual.

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,960
I do like this though, Griffin, because in the past we've helped people find love.

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,360
And what if we just cut out the middleman, which is us, and we just were like, hey,

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,480
we're here for love.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,720
Well, I love my wife very, very much. There will be no dalliances today, thank you.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,120
Yes.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,600
But we can, but it's like a make pretend.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,120
And listen, here's what I'll do, and gosh darn it, we done missed it. This is, I don't

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
know, January or February or whatever day it is when you listen to this, it's not Valentine's

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,880
Day. But if you want to tell people that I was your Valentine, you can.

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,640
No, no, no, that's too far. That's too far. That's too far.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,360
That's too far?

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,160
Yes, this episode is, you could say the episode is.

33
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,760
Oh, the episode is your, okay, yeah, you're right. Hey, don't lie, this episode is your

34
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,400
Valentine.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,960
Okay, Justin, you want to get a hand on this ball or you're going to sit this one out,

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,280
you think?

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,040
I don't know where the ball is, guys. It's confusing enough that Travis is committing

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
adultery and Griffin is-

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
No, no, no, no, I'm letting people lie about me committing adultery.

40
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,120
No, no, we don't even do that. The podcast episode is your sensual friend for today,

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,240
the most sacred of all the high holy days.

42
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,640
Griffin, here's my question, because the word could mean many different things, but is the

43
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
okay, when you say the episode is your Valentine, do you mean like we're walking around the

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,000
classroom and we're putting this on the envelope you've taped to the front of your desk, or

45
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,920
this is the podcast is putting a note in the envelope taped to the front of your desk?

46
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
You love the podcast.

47
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,480
Yes.

48
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,320
That's the end of the sentence. That's the end of the thought.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,480
You love the podcast, now the podcast loves you.

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
You now love the podcast.

51
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Finally, it's reciprocated. It's the podcast loves you.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Okay, are you right? I'm paused. I have these two Ferrero Rochers where my nipples are.

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,080
The podcast nipples.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Yeah, and then I'm sitting on a bed of poetry. The episode sitting on a bed of poetry I wrote

55
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,000
for you.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,320
Yeah, and it's getting the chocolate everywhere, streaks it, streaks it.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,080
No, wait, you said pretty plainly that the chocolate was on your Griffin McElroy's nipples.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
I did a tumble. I did a tumble. I did a tumble into the paper.

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
That does sound like something I would see on Tumblr. That's fair.

61
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
Son of a, come on!

62
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,480
No, but Griffin, you're saying, are you personifying your own body for chocolate delivery?

63
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,440
I was wearing a suit with little Velcro Ferrero Rochers all over it.

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
Like a mocap?

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,200
And you have to, yeah, like mocap balls. And then for Valentine's Day as a special treat,

66
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,480
you get to run around, try and grab them off me. But I did a tumble into the poetry that

67
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,280
the podcast made for you.

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,800
No, but you're still saying you, Griffin. I thought the podcast was the Valentine.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah.

70
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,920
But you're saying you are covered in chocolate.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,480
The podcast is the one seducing you on the bed of poetry. I'm also there wearing a suit

72
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,040
of Ferrero Rochers in case you get peckish.

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,200
So you're just the caterer?

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Completely platonic body food.

75
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
I'm wearing clothes under the Ferrero Rochers.

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,320
Okay.

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay.

78
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,680
For me, it's a fun game where I see if I can, because after five minutes,

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
I get to keep all the Ferrero Rochers that you didn't grab off him.

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
Oh, it's kind of like a big game that captures the flag.

81
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,560
It's like, capture the flag, but it's all me hazelnut chocolates.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,920
Hey, welcome to Wild and Crazy Kids. This week, you got a special game. You're going

83
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,920
to grab those chocolate off those people, and if they don't, they eat them.

84
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,800
I just, I don't see what the fucking confusion is. We do this every fucking year.

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,880
Start the metaphor.

86
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,080
Are you eating a Ferrero Rocher?

87
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,560
Was that a Ferrero?

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Start the metaphor over, and don't involve your corporeal form in it.

89
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,880
Okay.

90
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,840
See if you can do this.

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Start again. Hello.

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Hi, everybody. Welcome, my brother, my brother, me, et cetera. And then Griffin says...

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,320
This is podcast. I love you. Grab this candy.

94
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,480
Where's the candy? Wait, wait. Where's the candy?

95
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,360
The podcast that is this one has candy all over its suit, wearing it like a mocap.

96
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
Are you eating? Who is eating what right now? Who's eating Gilbert grapes right now?

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,200
I'm eating up this delicious description you're giving up.

98
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,720
Yeah, of a sentient podcast that's down for love.

99
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,360
Well, nobody's going to love this thing now because you guys have... You guys have fucking...

100
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Oh, Griffin, you put chocolate on your own nipples.

101
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
Griffin, could you describe the podcast for me?

102
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
You didn't let me finish that part. I have it on my nipples, but then it's everywhere else too.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800
No, no. You finished it. That part was completed.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,280
Here comes the poetry pile. I jump in. I get all my chocolate streaks everywhere.

105
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,480
No, you can't be there. I'm sorry, Griffin. You are not allowed

106
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,000
to see whatever Valentine happens between the episode and the listener.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,640
You recorded the episode. You left the episode.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,600
Okay, okay, okay. Hold on. And here's the next part.

109
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,920
And then I see you approaching the podcast episode.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,600
I take off a few Ferrero's and throw them in your direction just because I've had a big round.

111
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, let's stop. Shut up. And then I walk meekly backwards out of the room.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,520
And then whatever you do with podcasts at that point is up to you,

113
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,040
God, and podcast and the Ferrero Rochers. That's better.

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,720
That was much better. Here's the two issues that I still have.

115
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
I wouldn't say much, Justin. That was very generous.

116
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,480
Somewhat better. Here's the two issues that I still have with this.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,240
One, you're technically stripping because you are removing layers.

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
I got clothes on underneath the Ferrero Rochers.

119
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,680
I know, but it's a long con kind of strip, but it is stripping.

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
No, I disagree with you on that point, Justin, because when I see someone take their jacket off,

121
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,400
I'm not like, whoa, whoa, whoa, NSFW. Depends on how they take it off, though.

122
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
The way I take off a jacket.

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,160
When podcast takes his jacket off, it does it the cool, like backwards Jeb Bartlett.

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,280
Yeah, there you go.

125
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
The other thing I had was that you fed people chocolate off your body.

126
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,520
No.

127
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,920
And that's another one that's got a little bit charged.

128
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,040
Gave it to them.

129
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,680
Gave it to them.

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,520
And if I remember correctly, you more flung it at them.

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,720
One of two things happened.

132
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,040
Either you threw your body chocolate on the dirty floor,

133
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
or you fed it lovingly to them.

134
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,320
Which of those two options?

135
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,480
You're saying, oh, OK, and you hear that audience?

136
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
Justin says you all can't catch good.

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Interesting.

138
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,360
Did you throw it like a Benihana chef and they caught it in their mouth?

139
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,640
Or with their fucking hands.

140
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,040
Gross.

141
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,720
Then they're going to get chocolate all over their hands before reading the poetry.

142
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
The body impact when I dive into the poetry pile makes the foil come off and streaks the chocolate.

143
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't see why are you guys wrestling?

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,440
It's been nine fucking minutes.

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,760
You're the one wrestling with the poetry.

146
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,240
OK, I just want to suggest, start over.

147
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,960
All right.

148
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,080
God, heaven.

149
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,520
Hey, it's my brother, my brother, and me podcast killing it year in, year out.

150
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,280
This time, Griffin's going to say something.

151
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,160
So Valentine's Day is upon us, and we would like you to make love to the podcast.

152
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,640
And by make love, I mean it in the literal sense and not in the coital sense.

153
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,080
You and the podcast, there was no love before, but now there will be love with you

154
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,040
and this inanimate podcast to help set the scene.

155
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,440
I will appear in the room.

156
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,280
Shush.

157
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
The podcast will also be there.

158
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,760
You will be there.

159
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,720
I have a suit of Ferrero Rochers if you get peckish.

160
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
And also, I have wine balloons.

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,160
Do you want one?

162
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,880
Wait, where are they?

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,120
I have 12 wine balloons hidden all around.

164
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,760
Did you say hidden?

165
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,920
Why are they hidden?

166
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
Why are they hidden?

167
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,840
Why would you hide them?

168
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,280
You fucking Easter bunny.

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
It's not a fun surprise.

170
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,920
You know where they are.

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,520
I have a suit of Ferrero Rochers over my clothes.

172
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
You will not come at me with your mouth open.

173
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,480
I will hand them to you.

174
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,960
You will take them with your hands, unwrap them, and eat them.

175
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,520
Sometimes I will jump in the poetry pile.

176
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,640
Sometimes there's a wine balloon in there too, and I make a terrible, terrible mess.

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
But then when it's time for you and the podcast to consummate it,

178
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm going to back out of the room meekly.

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,200
I will no longer be present.

180
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,560
Here's what I have.

181
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Okay, I want to go back to the things that I hate.

182
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
So one of the main ones is that you've locked someone in a room with a podcast

183
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,360
that they may not even be in.

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,560
He didn't say lock the door.

185
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
He just said he was going to leave them to whatever they get up to.

186
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,960
But the implication is clearly that they're going to do it, this person and the podcast.

187
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,000
And can we make clear that it's an episode of a podcast?

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
It's not the whole podcast.

189
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,000
It's not the whole podcast.

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
That's semantics, because we've done some things on this podcast,

191
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,720
broadly speaking, that no one would love.

192
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,080
We got unfuckable eps.

193
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,000
I just want to go back also to the wine.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,960
I feel like a wine balloon popping over a pile of poetry.

195
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,040
Is the sexiest thing you've ever heard?

196
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,440
It's one, it's someone's fetish.

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,480
Don't forget about the chocolate streaks from my suit.

198
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah, now is it red wine or white?

199
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,680
Of course it's red wine, it's Valentine's Day.

200
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,640
And it's popping on the rose thorns.

201
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,960
I've sprinkled thorns all over the bed.

202
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,760
You're not there.

203
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,000
Jesse Thorne, Teresa Thorne, they're all on the bed, sprinkled lovingly.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
I will say, I realized in Griffin's 18th take at this,

205
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
that while Justin and I have been upset at it,

206
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,000
this idea of a holiday concierge is basically what Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are.

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
They come in, they provide you all the stuff,

208
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,560
and then they leave and let you get down to it.

209
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,880
Yeah, there needs to be one of those for Valentine's Day, Cupid.

210
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,080
What's our first question?

211
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,800
One more try.

212
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,080
There's no way we can do this.

213
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,880
This is my brother.

214
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,640
Griffin is a winged cherub.

215
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
This is my brother of a show.

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,120
I feel like we need-

217
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,640
This is a brother of an episode.

218
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,960
Yeah, we need indices, indices A before I even start going.

219
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm wearing clothes fully, and there's no question about that.

220
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,640
Over the clothes, I have stuck many Ferrero Rochers.

221
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
Like, can you edit this to be sequentially first?

222
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,840
Yes.

223
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,280
I want this to be the first thing people hear, okay.

224
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,200
There are 12 wine balloons hidden throughout the room.

225
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,880
If you are hungry, there's the Rochers.

226
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,800
If you are thirsty, there is wine.

227
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,600
The only other object in the room is the podcast episode that this is.

228
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,720
What about the poetry pile?

229
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,520
The poetry pile is also there as the third, fourth-

230
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,800
Could we also include a button on the wall, like in an escape room?

231
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,640
Like, hey, if at any time you want me to unlock the door, just hit this button.

232
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,280
If it gets too wet and wild in there, here's the button that you press.

233
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,720
It's over the poetry pile, and you're going to have to sort of scramble around in there.

234
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,440
It's rough terrain.

235
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
To find the flag in the poetry pile.

236
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm going to count to 30 and leave.

237
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,880
If you can find all the wine balloons before then, you get $10,000 furnished by San Pellegrino.

238
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,480
And a trip to space camp.

239
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
I'm so glad we got a sponsor.

240
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Yeah.

241
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm so glad we got a sponsor for this.

242
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
I want to welcome San Pellegrino to sponsor the show.

243
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,040
You also get a booth at the Food and Wine Festival, and you don't even have to know what to do with that.

244
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm worried that including a sponsor is going to make this holiday too commercial.

245
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,680
Yeah, probably.

246
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,400
I worry.

247
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,720
Let's switch it for BK Nights.

248
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,600
What are they doing?

249
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,800
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

250
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Maybe a Casio keyboard in there?

251
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,360
Sure.

252
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,160
So.

253
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,160
So, okay.

254
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,640
I think that that's got it.

255
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,040
I think what I love about this, Griffin, here's a quick list, bullet pointed.

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
One is I think that you have not included yourself physically in it.

257
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,640
You've much more resigned yourself to a Jeff Probst role or Chris Harrison role who is clearly on the periphery.

258
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,160
And I feel like it's kind of like those cats also where it's like clearly on the periphery, but the implication is always that if they decided to compete, they would win.

259
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,440
They would beat ass, yeah.

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Yeah, so that's good.

261
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:38,240
And I think it's also like a very romantic, loving environment that you've created for the podcast episode and the listener.

262
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,800
Yeah, and fun, too, fun, because you got to find the balloons and poetry can be fun for some people.

263
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
Yeah, maybe the poet, but nobody else.

264
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
Here comes our first question.

265
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,800
My parents sent me a Valentine's Day card today.

266
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,240
Now, I don't keep in touch with them as much as I used to, and I have to-

267
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
Shame.

268
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,240
Shame.

269
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,240
They sent it to me as an attempt to cheer me up about my lack of a romantic partner.

270
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,840
Well, we handled that.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,240
You're in a committed relationship with a podcast episode.

272
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,200
As reality has it, I do have a partner, one who I've been dating for almost a year now.

273
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,400
I just forgot to tell my parents about my relationship due to how infrequently we catch up.

274
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,360
Hachi machi.

275
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,440
The card that my parents sent me is not only very fancy, but the endorsement on it isn't written on the card directly,

276
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,400
but is instead on a piece of paper that slides out of the card.

277
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,760
Can I replace it with a new dedication and give this card to my significant other?

278
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,720
That's from Valentine's vexed in San Francisco.

279
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
No!

280
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,080
I need a fucking map for that question.

281
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,640
What a buckwild, like, light cycle-esque turn that took.

282
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,880
Just like a hard fucking bank, and I'm exploding into your light wall.

283
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
What?

284
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,160
I just want everyone to know, I put together the question list, and I don't always know if a question is going to be a winner,

285
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,400
but when I hear Griffin do that, like, lean away from the microphone, like, oh my god.

286
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,800
Like, I know, I got it.

287
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,360
Yowza, I mean, I really thought, how do I tell my parents I've been in a relationship for years?

288
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,560
Certainly would take precedence over, how do I save $1.26?

289
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,600
How do I grift both my parents and my lover?

290
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, um, Yowza, I mean, yeah, ugh.

291
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:21,280
This is some real, I think nothing's funnier than pulling off the gag, and not everybody can do it, and a lot of people try,

292
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,560
of like, re-gifting the card.

293
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,800
I've never seen anybody do it, um, earnestly, with an earnest mind, an earnest heart, to say,

294
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
this, oh, this is not the same card.

295
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,480
Most of the time, it's like, uh-oh, yeah, this was totally from my four-year-old nephew, Todrick.

296
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
Uh, see, and I marked his name out, and I put mine in, as a funny joke.

297
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,000
This is a new strat altogether that I've never heard of, and I don't think is quite good.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,400
I will say, though, I think now you can never tell your parents about your significant other,

299
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,000
or they're just gonna feel absolutely ripped off, because they sent you a card,

300
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,880
and you had a significant other the whole time.

301
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,440
Yeah.

302
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,320
Oh, oh no, what a pickle.

303
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,080
What a picky.

304
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
You shouldn't do this thing.

305
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
You shouldn't do this thing.

306
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,840
I understand that not everybody's money situation is the same.

307
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,760
God knows that's true.

308
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:20,480
But this is, the amount that you are saving to enter yourself into,

309
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,800
you're in the fucking hornet's nest right now,

310
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,320
and you could easily not be in the hornet's nest by going to Walgreens,

311
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,080
or taking a sheet of loose-leaf paper and doing your fucking best with some Crayola on it.

312
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
That's even better.

313
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:38,560
Now, Griffin, there is the line that the card is very fancy.

314
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,920
Mmm.

315
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,120
Very, maybe this is like a $12 card.

316
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,240
Like, you open it up, and a video plays or something.

317
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,280
Oh, that's good.

318
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,760
Or you open it up, and it has a song like,

319
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,600
come on and have some birthday fun.

320
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:53,920
Or maybe-

321
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,920
Are you ready for some birthday?

322
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,080
What if there's a prerecorded thing in there, but you only hear it if you open it all the way?

323
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,120
So your significant other gets it, and they open it all the way, and it's like,

324
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,480
dear Philippe, we so treasure you, and we're sorry you're so terribly lonely.

325
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
As alone as alone can be.

326
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,840
Anyway, love you, your parents, who bought this card for you.

327
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,120
Ugh.

328
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:17,840
Can I ask you a question?

329
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,280
Are you just maybe bored?

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,840
And the idea of, for this $1.65 you could save yourself,

331
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,000
you could potentially turn your life completely 180 around.

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,680
Everyone who is close to you now feels jilted by you, and you dunk it right into the toilet.

333
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,720
It's like you're looking at the power to destroy your entire life.

334
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Yeah, and it's seductive, that power, sometimes.

335
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,520
God, it is.

336
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,120
Yeah, like you have that button, it's like a self-destruct button,

337
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,760
but it's like everyone else destruct button.

338
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah.

339
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,000
Maybe here's a great gift for your significant other.

340
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,880
Okay.

341
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,160
Tell your parents about them.

342
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah, I'm sure they would appreciate that.

343
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,680
I also feel like you could make your own shitty card on looseleaf,

344
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,960
and write your own love message on it, and then you pull out the nice fancy card,

345
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,440
and you start to hand it to them, and then you tear it up, and you say,

346
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,040
no store-bought card is good enough to transmit my love thoughts to you.

347
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,240
So you're gonna tear up the Valentine's Day card your parents got you?

348
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,840
Yeah, no evidence.

349
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,040
No, but the question-asker is also a great slide of ham addition,

350
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,360
so they didn't really tear it up, Justin, don't worry.

351
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
Oh, okay, I gotcha.

352
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,440
They tore up the phone.

353
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,560
And then a dove.

354
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,760
Yeah, a dove comes out.

355
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,360
A dove comes out.

356
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,040
Here's a Yahoo that was sent in by Merit Palmer.

357
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,720
Thank you, Merit, it's Yahoo Answers user.

358
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
Hello, question mark, who asks?

359
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,920
McFly.

360
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,720
Can I start a gym called Goku, or would that be infringement?

361
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,880
There would be no reference, or mascot, or anything similar DBZ.

362
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,760
That stands for Dragon's Ball ZZ, zero.

363
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,680
Then why, then I guess, do you just think, what a great name for a gym?

364
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,680
Well, no Trav, I think you're gonna get brand recognition.

365
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,440
But as long as you don't put the spiked man himself on there,

366
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,640
doing his big, powerful yell, then I think you're probably gonna be okay, right?

367
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,400
Goku's just a name, and what's in a name?

368
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,880
A rose by any other name is still Goku.

369
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,200
There's no good names for gyms.

370
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,360
Think of a good name for them.

371
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,440
The ones near my house include Planet Fit,

372
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:35,440
that's bad, that's like, hey aliens, come here and get healthy, that's terrible.

373
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,680
There's a 24 hour fitness center that closes at nine, that sucks.

374
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,320
What about Beef City?

375
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,200
Beef City sounds like a butcher shop, no way.

376
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,200
Okay, how about Rippington's?

377
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,640
That's good, hey can I suggest maybe-

378
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,000
That sounds like an amazing vape shop, start over.

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,360
Griffin, give me one good gym name, and I'll tear it down.

380
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
I got a good one, you ready?

381
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:58,980
Yes.

382
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,800
Goku, what is, listen to the question, it's perfect.

383
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,080
It's not even called Goku, no listen, it's not even called Goku's gym.

384
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
It's called Goku.

385
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,880
This gym is Goku.

386
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,520
So hey, sorry honey, I'm gonna be late.

387
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,040
I'm gonna stop at Goku after work.

388
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,760
I think actually without any context,

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,600
it kind of sounds like a super high-end frozen yogurt shop.

391
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,720
It does kind of sound like that, so what we're gonna need to

392
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
express or communicate is that this is a place

393
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,240
where the art of crafting muscles takes place.

394
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,840
Sweaty Goku.

395
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,720
I'm gonna call it, we're gonna call it the art of Goku.

396
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
I think that is gonna get the message across

397
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
that this is a place to be reckoned with

398
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
if you want to put some beef on your bones.

399
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,620
Yeah.

400
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,240
What about just Goku Makers?

401
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, I like that.

402
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,920
That's a direct reference.

403
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,480
Okay, Goku Maker one, he gets his power from the yellow sun.

404
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
So that's not good.

405
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,920
A real Goku Maker is the yellow sun.

406
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,800
Secondly, that's a direct reference to this popular character,

407
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,720
Goku from Dragon Ball Z.

408
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,080
Well, so what about this?

409
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,200
Because it would teach you like the art of getting buff, right?

410
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
As you said, right?

411
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,360
So what about Goku's Art Academy?

412
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,080
Okay, I like this so far.

413
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,240
That's it, that's the end of the thought, it's good, okay.

414
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
Well, I figure, because here's the thing,

415
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
at first you would show up with like paintbrush in hand

416
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,160
and then you would say like, okay,

417
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,800
now snap that paintbrush in half.

418
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,920
That's lesson one.

419
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,800
What if you have, what if it's called Goku, right?

420
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,080
But then you also have a big neon sign up

421
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,680
that says Vegeta next to it.

422
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,840
Now listen, now listen, listen, listen, listen.

423
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,960
When the people who own that property swing by

424
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,800
to close you down or the copyright police or whatever,

425
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,040
more neon letters click on,

426
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,680
it's displaying the word vegetables.

427
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,800
And then it's like you never even,

428
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,520
it's like no, you're all good.

429
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,240
You're talking about like a speakeasy gym.

430
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,440
When you say it out loud,

431
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Vegeta sounds like a grandmother

432
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
trying to order Mexican food.

433
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,760
Kind of, I would like vegetables, excellent.

434
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,680
Hey, give me one of them vegetas.

435
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,920
I would also say it sounds like a six pack.

436
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,200
I would say it sounds like a sixth grader

437
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,960
trying to talk about a vagina.

438
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,680
What are you doing at a gym?

439
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,640
What are you doing?

440
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,320
It's not about making muscles.

441
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,440
Anyone can do that.

442
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:27,840
No.

443
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,080
What I think you're doing really at a gym

444
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,520
is investing in yourself.

445
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,040
It's about investment.

446
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
So here's what I think you should do

447
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,160
is call it Goku's bank.

448
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,280
And that could be a little more palatable, I think.

449
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,760
Because yeah, that's the thing is like,

450
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,760
I think I don't know much about copyright infringement.

451
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,080
Not much.

452
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,880
But I'm pretty sure that if it doesn't compete

453
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,920
with what the existing Goku is offering,

454
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,840
you're probably fine, right?

455
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Yeah, right?

456
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,320
Like I could start a store called Pepsi's Vegetables

457
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,520
and I'd probably be cool.

458
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
What if your gym had two doors?

459
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,680
Okay.

460
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,240
Can we just stop for a second

461
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,080
and think about Pepsi's Vegetables?

462
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,880
Yeah, let's give that one its fair.

463
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,320
Let's give that one its due.

464
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,840
It's just a powerful idea.

465
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
I was running away from the warm pool of Pepsi's Vegetables.

466
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,040
I'm gonna turn around,

467
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm gonna splash around there with you guys for a while.

468
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,720
I mean, they can try to shut me down,

469
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
but it's not like people are confusing

470
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,560
my vegetables for their soda.

471
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,040
That's right.

472
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,560
These are Pepsi's Vegetables.

473
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,680
These are my vegetables and I'm Pepsi.

474
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,120
All right.

475
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,280
Oh, legally change your name to Goku.

476
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,120
And then call it Goku's gym.

477
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
They can't fucking touch you.

478
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,880
Yes, that's true.

479
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,000
And legally make yourself look exactly like Goku.

480
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,480
And then put a picture of yourself next to it.

481
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,000
And learn to play the piccolo.

482
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
I haven't seen the show.

483
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,920
Haven't seen it.

484
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,360
But maybe the gym has two doors

485
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
and over one is a sign that says,

486
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,720
this one's for not Goku's.

487
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,920
And then the exit door, you can just leave that blank.

488
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,560
You can put like,

489
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,120
this one's for question mark, question mark, question marks.

490
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,440
And then all you have on there is not Goku.

491
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,160
That's true.

492
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,120
And then you're saying,

493
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,560
listen, I'm explicitly saying that I am not your property.

494
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,640
I am not stealing your copyright.

495
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,560
This is what I've opened here is like a not Kroger.

496
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,680
This is, you know what I mean?

497
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,160
Like, yes.

498
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,520
God, I love it.

499
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,160
I love it when Goku yells and energy comes out.

500
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,120
Yeah.

501
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
And he uses it to power the US

502
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,120
so that we have less of a dependency on fossil fuels.

503
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Haven't seen the show.

504
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,680
Hey, everybody can just real quick,

505
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,560
just say it out loud.

506
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,280
Thank you, Goku.

507
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,160
Thank you, Goku.

508
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,920
Gokyu.

509
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Is that a trademark?

510
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
Can we put thank you, Goku on a t-shirt?

511
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,280
Yeah.

512
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,160
What if we put thank you and then in quotation marks,

513
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,960
Gokyu.

514
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
Oh, shit.

515
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,400
God, Goku is so powerful.

516
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,040
He's so good.

517
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,640
He would be so good on a powerful t-shirt.

518
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
He would make you look stronger just from wearing it.

519
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,680
My wife, it's impossible.

520
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,680
My wife is very thrifty and scolds me anytime I'm-

521
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,400
My wife!

522
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,120
Anytime I spend money unnecessarily.

523
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,640
She recently suggested we pick up coffee at a local coffee shop

524
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,720
as a treat to ourselves for penny pinching.

525
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,080
The issue is I've been secretly shopping at this coffee shop

526
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,200
at least once a week for over two years.

527
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Oh, my God.

528
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,440
They know me by name and begin making my regular order

529
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,200
before I get to the register.

530
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,560
Had I warned the baristas to pretend like they don't know me

531
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,720
so I won't be caught when I do go with my wife.

532
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
When I do go with my wife.

533
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,880
Yeah, sure.

534
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,520
My wife.

535
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,000
My wife.

536
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,320
That's from regular in Redondo Beach.

537
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
The Dondo.

538
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,320
The Dondo.

539
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,560
I wish you did more like shout outs to locations

540
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,760
like the Dondo, call him in or something like that.

541
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
I mean, the good thing about having IBS

542
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,120
is that people just assume that you do have it all the time.

543
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,680
So if you need to fake a tummy ache so that they,

544
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
so your wife will go get the coffees

545
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
and you could just chill at home and avoid the situation

546
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
altogether, that's fine.

547
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,920
Maybe just burst in and say like, I'm new here.

548
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
Okay, they get your wife's credit card.

549
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
They look at the name.

550
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh, you must be related to blah, blah, blah.

551
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,400
He's in here every week.

552
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,000
Oh, shit.

553
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,800
Double life.

554
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,640
You've apparently led a double life

555
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
and your wife has found out about it

556
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,720
when you're not even there to explain yourself.

557
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,760
Yep, you're the one who knocks.

558
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,640
What if you go in and then they're like,

559
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
oh, it's our regular.

560
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,400
I'll make you your vanilla latte.

561
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,120
And you say, what the fuck are you talking about?

562
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,880
Well, have you considered not lying?

563
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,760
I was gonna say, it's almost like there's a very good reason

564
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,200
why we shouldn't lie to people

565
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
that share their lives with us.

566
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,400
I feel like we've caught the bad end of that particular.

567
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,120
Hold on, this is an opportunity for us

568
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,160
to make a very salient, very helpful relationship tip.

569
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
I feel like there's lots of people out there

570
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,960
who have what they think is little secrets

571
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,920
from their SO or their partner, whatever.

572
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,560
But you do it so much, but you're like,

573
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
it's okay, it's just little secrets.

574
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,920
But then when your partner finds out about it,

575
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,840
you are immediately confronted with the reality

576
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,160
that, oh no, it's big secrets.

577
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,160
It's kind of weird that I didn't clue them in.

578
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,360
This is like if you embezzled a $1 every day

579
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,120
from where you worked and you're like,

580
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,640
oh, I'm just stealing $1.

581
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,480
And then you work there for 30 years

582
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,360
and you've stolen thousands and thousands of dollars?

583
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,640
I should clear up.

584
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,520
I'm not saying that there needs to be 100%.

585
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,040
I'm not saying that you have to check in

586
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,120
every time you wanna do something, right?

587
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
I also do not think that that is the basis

588
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,080
of a healthy relationship.

589
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
It's just the nature of,

590
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,680
it doesn't matter the size of the secret.

591
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,400
When your SO finds out that you have a secret,

592
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
there's a weird energy now.

593
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I celebrate the secret.

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
I think it's fine to have a secret.

595
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,120
I think it's good to have a little secret.

596
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,960
But I think it should be the kind of little secret

597
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
that if your SO finds out about it,

598
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,080
then they don't give a shit.

599
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,840
Or at most they kind of like roll their eyes.

600
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,920
No, you're missing the point, Travis.

601
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,400
If you try to make it something like you would want to hide,

602
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,960
okay, I was like three weeks into my Coursera class

603
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
about appreciating classical music

604
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,000
before I told my wife that I was taking this class

605
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
because she saw me and she didn't give a shit.

606
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,960
Because who would?

607
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,520
But it was my little private thing for a little while.

608
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,040
That's my special class between me and this cat from Duke

609
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,640
who has a lot of knowledge about classical music.

610
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,240
It was our special thing, right?

611
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,760
And I didn't tell my wife about it

612
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,040
because it was my little secret

613
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,360
that she wouldn't give an ever-loving shit about.

614
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
Yeah.

615
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,640
See, what I do is I routinely,

616
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,560
I will overspend on something

617
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,560
and when Teresa and I first started dating,

618
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,600
I knew that she would be upset

619
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
that I went to, say, the grocery store

620
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,280
and bought a bunch of impulse buy items and spent too much.

621
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,200
So I would routinely just cut money off of how much I spent

622
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
and say, yeah, I only spent whatever.

623
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
And then one day what I did is I told her

624
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,800
that I was doing that.

625
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,120
And so now I still do it, but she knows I'm doing it.

626
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,320
So it's like a lie, but it's not.

627
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,800
But also we both agree that it's better this way.

628
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,760
It's called Big Secrets.

629
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,600
How completely psychopathic, Trav Gray.

630
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,560
Thanks for sharing.

631
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,480
No, because then she knows that I round town.

632
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,760
How absolutely baffling is it?

633
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,960
Is it Justin or is it normal?

634
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,120
That's a jagged little pill right there, bud.

635
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
I've never done what you guys have talked about.

636
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,960
Your secret, your classical music,

637
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,360
your Mozart perversions.

638
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,560
I'm actually not to Mozart yet.

639
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,440
I kind of got hung up around Bach because I don't like his stuff.

640
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,160
You know he wrote 30 minutes of new-

641
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,760
Hold on, MoneyZune Kuwait.

642
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,640
MoneyZune?

643
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
Is Zune one of our sponsors?

644
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
The MoneyZune Kuwait.

645
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,320
Bach wrote a new 30 minute piece of music every week.

646
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,040
But that was easy when there wasn't other music.

647
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,120
He could just be like, bing, bing, bing, bing.

648
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:21,920
That's a new one.

649
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,960
That's a new one.

650
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,880
They've always done that one before.

651
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,920
That's a new one.

652
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,400
It's for at least two.

653
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,840
Huff my nuts, Beethoven.

654
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,880
It's for at least two.

655
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,840
That's a new one.

656
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,200
Do that for 30 minutes.

657
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,960
He didn't, Justin, to be fair,

658
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,840
he didn't say he wrote 30 minutes of good music every week.

659
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,640
He also wrote 30 minutes of lyrics to that music,

660
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,840
but they made him cut it every time

661
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,200
because of how dog shit it was.

662
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,200
And the dragons come over the crest of the ridge

663
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,040
and the sunlight sword hangs above them.

664
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,160
Bach, please.

665
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,640
We have talked to you so many times,

666
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
we love the music so much,

667
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,800
but your lyrics are,

668
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,360
and the white wolves gather at the edge of the sunlight.

669
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,080
All right, Bach.

670
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
I just feel like you're using a lot of weird imagery.

671
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,640
It's not.

672
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,000
Run, run your fingers through my curly white hair.

673
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,280
Bach, Bach, we're not ready for this.

674
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,800
Our great, great, great, great green kids

675
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,240
are gonna eat that shit up.

676
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,200
Yeah, they're gonna love it.

677
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,240
But all this stuff about like reaching the peak of the mountain

678
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,680
and soaring with the eagles,

679
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,040
we're not into that right now.

680
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,640
Could you please just, I don't know, talk about flowers?

681
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,680
I think we like that.

682
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,480
Can we all agree?

683
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
Flowers, maybe spring?

684
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,880
We're into spring.

685
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,120
And the flowers spring from the mouth of all the virgins

686
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,280
as they ride upon their dragons.

687
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:47,780
Whoa.

688
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:49,920
Damn it.

689
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,800
From their eyes.

690
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,480
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

691
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,280
And when I look into your eyes,

692
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,320
you put me in my grave.

693
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,120
No, Bach.

694
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,960
The dragons in my love grave.

695
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,000
What, no, what?

696
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
With their incredible laser rifles.

697
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,720
Wait, wait.

698
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,200
What?

699
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,160
Holy shit.

700
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,880
What?

701
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,400
The robot overlords I see in my dreams.

702
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,920
Bach, what the fuck?

703
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,800
What the shit are you on?

704
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,480
Anyway, are you cool?

705
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,360
30 minutes of music.

706
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,680
We put an hour of podcast.

707
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,200
Yeah, and some weeks we skip.

708
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,080
Because we can't, because we're tired.

709
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:40,240
Anyway, let's go to the mighty dance.

710
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,520
Hey, can I tell you all about schtomps?

711
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:42,820
Yeah.

712
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,060
Yeah, I love these things.

713
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,660
Do you guys like art and pictures and drawings?

714
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,220
Yes.

715
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,300
What if you could get them really little and sticky

716
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,420
and allow them to make your mail go from where you have it now

717
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,860
to where you want it to go?

718
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,980
Oh, okay.

719
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,820
And then it's like you're giving somebody art,

720
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,580
but you're also giving them the mail

721
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,620
that you need to get in their hands.

722
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,340
Do you know that stamps are picked by CSAC,

723
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,940
the Citizen Stamp Advisory Committee?

724
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,100
And it's a secret organization

725
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,380
that the public isn't allowed any insight into.

726
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,260
And these 12 non-postal worker employees

727
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,700
pick them all in secret?

728
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,660
I did not know that.

729
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,740
But what I do know is that if you don't want to go

730
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,180
to the post office to get your stamps,

731
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,940
then stamps.com has you covered

732
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,300
because they have all the services

733
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,420
of the US Postal Service right at your fingertips.

734
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,660
I'm talking about printing your own postage

735
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,900
for any letter, any package, any class of mail

736
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
using your own computer and printer.

737
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,940
And they save you money too

738
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,220
because they got postage discounts

739
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,500
you can't get at the post office,

740
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,900
including five cents off every first class stamp.

741
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,300
And that shit adds up though.

742
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,380
They also are not allowed to have alcohol

743
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,060
or cigarettes or firearms on stamps.

744
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,060
So if you look at like Betty Davis's stamp,

745
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,540
they photoshopped out her cigarette.

746
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,300
If you check out her stamp,

747
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,940
it looks like she's holding a cigarette.

748
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,300
They replaced it with a carrot.

749
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,500
There's no cigarette there.

750
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,380
I heard a lot of stamp stuff on every little thing

751
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,460
and I just wanted to share it all with you guys.

752
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,140
Okay, well.

753
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,940
Cool.

754
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,500
I just found out that I can't get the gun stamps I wanted

755
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,780
so you've really peed me oh.

756
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,260
Sorry about being your oh, clean out.

757
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
But anyway, stamps.com is great.

758
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,220
It's a very, very convenient way to get your postage

759
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,060
if you, like me, don't like going to the post office

760
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,420
because it's far away and also anxiety.

761
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,380

771
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700

772
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,340
and I would like to give you my seven word pitch

773
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,140
for Squarespace.

774
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,540
Hell yeah.

775
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,020
You ready?

776
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,180
Want make website?

777
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,220
Make website with Squarespace.

778
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,140
Seven words.

779
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,020
Yeah, that's not good.

780
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,700
That's a tagline, baby.

781
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,300
I feel like I can get it under two words.

782
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,820
Website?

783
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,780
Question mark.

784
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,820
Squarespace.

785
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,020
I can do it in one.

786
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,520
Okay.

787
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,740
Webspace.

788
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,260
Ooh, I think I could do it in one letter.

789
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,020
W?

790
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,260
Okay, so that's Squarespace ad

791
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,820
and that'll be $50, please.

792
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,420
That's not actually the Squarespace ad.

793
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,180
Travis has a real one that he'd like to tell you about.

794
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,060
Yeah, so here's the thing.

795
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:30,900
Squarespace, listen, we live in the digital age.

796
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,420
Everything's digital these days.

797
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,340
If you want to have a successful business,

798
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,940
you have to have an online presence.

799
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,940
If you want to be a cool hip artist,

800
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,380
you have to have an online presence.

801
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,540
If you want to be just about anything,

802
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,060
you need to have an online presence

803
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,260
and you don't need to know anything

804
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,580
about making websites to do with Squarespace

805
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,900
because Squarespace, it's easy to set up.

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,620
Fuck yeah, dude.

816
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,700
You just got me so psyched with all that stuff.

817
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,060
I know, but I have like a flow

818
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,020
and now I have to start over.

819
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
It's a digital age.

820
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,900
Fuck, I forgot.

821
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,740
Nice, dude.

822
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:26,500

826
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,060
There's nothing quite like sailing

827
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,020
in the calm international waters on my ship,

828
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,300
the SS Biopic.

829
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,220
Avast!

830
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,660
It's actually pronounced biopic.

831
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,260
No, you dingus!

832
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,380
It's biopic!

833
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,900
Who the hell says that?

834
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,500
It's biopic.

835
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,540
It comes with the words biography and picture.

836
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,780
All right, that is enough.

837
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,380
Ahoy, I'm Dave Holmes.

838
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm the host of the newly rebooted podcast,

839
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,340
formerly known as International Waters,

840
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,020
designed to resolve petty but persistent arguments like this.

841
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,740
How?

842
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,220
By pitting two teams of opinionated comedians

843
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,580
against each other with trivia and improv games, of course,

844
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,060
winner takes home the right to be right.

845
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,740
What podcast be this?

846
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,180
It's called Troubled Waters,

847
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,180
where we disagree to disagree.

848
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,980
So I got Yahoo.

849
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,980
Yeah.

850
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,500
So this one was sent in by Merritt Palmer.

851
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,700
I don't know if it's good jokes,

852
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,300
but I feel like we need to talk about it

853
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,540
because it's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

854
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,340
who I'm gonna call Nancy, who asks,

855
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,540
is dessert its own meal or is it a part of dinner?

856
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,580
Is it a thing of its own or is it just dinner's sweet hat?

857
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,380
My first inclination is to say it is a thing of its own.

858
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,020
Mm. But then I also think it would be really weird

859
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,300
to just skip dinner and have dessert at like 7 p.m.

860
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,420
I, it's 3 p.m. I have finished lunch long ago.

861
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,300
I reach into my cookie drawer and I retrieve Oreos

862
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,020
and eat them.

863
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,300
That is a snack.

864
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,140
I have just finished my dinner of ham at 8 p.m.

865
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,340
and I reach into the cookie drawer,

866
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,140
pull out Oreos, I eat it.

867
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,020
That's a dessert.

868
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:26,660
Yeah, if you have something sweet without dinner,

869
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,260
it's not dessert.

870
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,220
No.

871
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,940
It's excess.

872
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,700
It's a snack.

873
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,420
It's a snack.

874
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,940
It's Snackcess.

875
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,740
No, we don't need to do that.

876
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,340
Snackcess Hollywood.

877
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,380
You don't need to do that.

878
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,540
I'm just saying if you have dessert without dinner,

879
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,820
it's not dessert.

880
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,180
It's a snack.

881
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,580
It's a sweet snack, okay?

882
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,700
If you, I, here's the problem though.

883
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,780
I like my dessert later in the evening.

884
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,260
I don't like to have my dessert directly after dinner.

885
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,940
I like to let it settle a little bit.

886
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:58,740
Yeah.

887
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,240
Okay?

888
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,660
Is that dessert?

889
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,580
If you've choked a little herb,

890
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,100
a little post dinner kush.

891
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,180
I think maybe that's fourth meal, Justin.

892
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:06,660
Is that?

893
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,940
Or 3.5 meal?

894
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,140
Is that dessert if I wait until 10 o'clock?

895
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,820
It's not dessert, right?

896
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,460
Yeah.

897
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,420
No, that's dessert.

898
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,700
That's dessert still, yeah.

899
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,980
Here, let me counterpoint.

900
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,300
And that whole time you were chilling and getting blazed,

901
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,900
that was all dinner.

902
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,700
You were still in dinner that whole time.

903
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,780
You had some additional vegetables.

904
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,420
Yeah.

905
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:28,020
It was your weed stuff.

906
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,300
Now look, here's it,

907
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,020
but to anybody who says dessert is part of dinner,

908
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,060
let me throw this out.

909
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,540
I bring you a plate that I've made you for dinner,

910
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,460
and there on the plate is a really well cooked chicken breast,

911
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,460
maybe some steamed broccoli, and an Oreo.

912
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,300
And an Oreo on the same plate as dinner.

913
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,180
Weird, huh?

914
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,220
This is a bad dinner you've made for me, Travis.

915
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,660
I get that, but I'm saying that Oreo doesn't belong there

916
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,500
because that should come at a separate time.

917
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,140
But at the same time, when I go out to a fancy restaurant

918
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,460
and I'm having lunch with all of my famous friends,

919
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,580
James Vanderbeek and the rest,

920
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,540
when we are eating all of the great dinner food

921
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,900
and then they say, would you like dessert?

922
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,980
I've already filled my tummy up with all the great dinner food

923
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,420
because I forgot about dessert.

924
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,300
If they brought the dinner and the sweet tiramisu

925
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,260
on the same plate to my table when it's dinner time,

926
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,420
oh y'all, it's like a kid cuisine.

927
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,900
Griffin, we're not talking about what it should be.

928
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,500
We're talking about what it is.

929
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,900
Can I pitch my adult kid cuisines

930
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,980
at restaurants that you can get, please?

931
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,580
But that's just called cuisine.

932
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:44,580
What do you think a waiter or anybody at a restaurant

933
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:49,460
would do if you said, yes, I'm going to have the ribeye

934
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,260
and the baked potato and later I'm gonna want

935
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,340
the brownie lava explosion, so just put it on the same plate.

936
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
I feel like that's what Applebee's whole thing is

937
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,140
because they don't give a fuck.

938
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:01,860
That is true.

939
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,660
They don't give a fuck.

940
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,660
Everything's sizzling in the same skillet

941
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,980
to save on doing dishes later.

942
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,460
Applebee's will bring you some pudding shooters

943
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,060
and then they'll bring you a garlic man,

944
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,580
which is a man they make out of a whole garlic bulb,

945
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,660
two lobster tails and a steak and three breadsticks.

946
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,780
And he is sentient.

947
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,860
And he is sentient and you have to chase him and eat him.

948
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,500
And then finally they bring you your drink last

949
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,660
because they are absolute what?

950
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:38,500
What's the third breadstick?

951
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,860
Why are you so nasty today?

952
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,940
I can't believe you're making fun of me for that.

953
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,420
Justin, I want you to try and imagine trying to stand up

954
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,860
this meat man that I've talked about

955
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,780
using just the two breadstick legs.

956
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,780
A tripod is a way more secure foundation

957
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,580
and I knew that when I was saying that shit on the phone.

958
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,780
Where is the tripod?

959
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,460
Where's the kickstand leg of the tripod?

960
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,900
Towards the back like a tail.

961
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,940
What's up now?

962
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,380
And then two on the corners.

963
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Okay, good.

964
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,260
Not like a penis.

965
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,740
Not like a penis.

966
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:04,980
Yeah.

967
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,860
Unless it's a fun prank Herb, you know.

968
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,500
You can request it that way, but you better tip well.

969
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,180
Yeah, they'll do it sometimes for you know,

970
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,460
like stag parties and stuff.

971
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,500
Yeah, or birthday.

972
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,260
Man, I want to have my bachelor party at Babblebee's.

973
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,700
We've talked a lot of bullshit.

974
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,860
I feel like dessert's part of dinner though.

975
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,500
What if it's actually the beginning of breakfast?

976
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,140
Whoa.

977
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,860
Here's a sneak preview of what breakfast is gonna be like.

978
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,180
Yeah, hey, because you know when sweet goes?

979
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,980
Breakfast.

980
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,180
Sweet flies at breakfast.

981
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:32,900
Yeah, sweet's good at breakfast.

982
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,780
Sweet doesn't fly at dinner.

983
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,860
It's like a trailer for breakfast.

984
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,060
Yeah, hey, and when you wake up, there's more where that came from.

985
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,220
Hey, speaking of this, I want a munch.

986
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:44,660
Okay.

987
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,140
Scarred.

988
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,300
You guys have to say squad.

989
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,420
Did you say squarred?

990
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,380
Scarred.

991
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:49,620
Hit it.

992
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,700
Hit that funky music.

993
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,340
I want a munch.

994
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,540
Squarred.

995
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:53,700
Okay.

996
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,260
I have two.

997
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,220
I'm just gonna read the first line of this one, even though it's really good.

998
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,500
This is McDonald's adds donut sticks to breakfast lineup.

999
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,820
And the first line of this is, roses are red, violets are blue.

1000
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,340
The rumors of donut sticks coming to McDonald's are true.

1001
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,540
Okay.

1002
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,940
You've heard the buzz.

1003
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:18,420
That's good.

1004
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,140
Hey, I didn't know Robert Frost was still alive.

1005
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,980
He is, and he works for McDonald's.

1006
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,180
Robert Frosty.

1007
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,780
I'm the new Hamburglar.

1008
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,500
Okay, Robert.

1009
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:26,980
Okay.

1010
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,700
Calm down.

1011
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,900
Yes, that's happening.

1012
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,740
Nothing delicious can stay.

1013
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,140
I'll take the number two less eaten by.

1014
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,180
But I want to talk about, this is actually extremely important and challenging.

1015
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:47,860
Domino's new platform rewards points for competitors pizza.

1016
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:49,700
Listen.

1017
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,140
Okay.

1018
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,660
They announced this during the Super Bowl.

1019
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,980
Starting a February 2nd, Domino's began awarding points for all pizza customers.

1020
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:04,820
All pizza customers eat through its new points for pies program.

1021
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,780
The big catch.

1022
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,860
This includes competitors pizza, not just Domino's.

1023
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:15,540
Listen, instead of advertising during Sunday's game, we decided to invest in a breakthrough

1024
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:20,420
program that rewards everyone who loves pizza as much as we do, says someone.

1025
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,620
We know everyone is asking themselves, did Domino's just say they will award points for

1026
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,900
eating any pizza, even from a competitor?

1027
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,180
That's accurate.

1028
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:39,940
This new app will scan anything and say that it is pizza, or not pizza, obviously.

1029
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,740
Its internal teams developed pizza identifier capable of scanning each pizza or slice.

1030
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:51,860
It then uses artificial intelligence-driven software to identify the image.

1031
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,340
Quote, this is the first time Domino's is using AI technology like this.

1032
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,980
I hope so.

1033
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,940
Let's fucking hope so.

1034
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,780
And also, I hope that that's, okay.

1035
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,060
I hope it's the last time, but it won't be.

1036
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:13,300
It will be running the pizza identification process and is already smart enough to identify

1037
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,260
all pizza.

1038
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:19,940
Even if it's a homemade English muffin pizza, a pizza with a hot dog stuffed crust, or a

1039
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,780
high-end artisan pizza.

1040
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,780
It can even identify if it's a dog squeaky pizza toy.

1041
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,460
Hey, um, Dennis, that's not pizza dog.

1042
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,740
Are you okay?

1043
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,100
Because it sounds like you just proven that your robot can be easily fooled.

1044
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:40,900
Justin, Justin, I don't want to skip ahead, but is there a part in this press release

1045
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,780
where they say, and we don't know why we've done this, we hope that will reveal itself

1046
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,580
to us later.

1047
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,660
What's the points for though?

1048
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:57,380
You can scan other pizzas and get pizza points, or piz points, as I've decided to call them.

1049
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,660
Pizzies, pizzers.

1050
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,940
You can get pizzies or piz points, and then you can exchange those piz points for more

1051
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,540
piz at Domino's.

1052
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
So, okay.

1053
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,660
I can't do that.

1054
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,900
So, okay, I can't tell if that's good or bad.

1055
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,580
It seems not great.

1056
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,620
Well, Domino's has really turned their shit around, is what they want you to believe,

1057
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:22,340
but it's still, Domino's is okay, but you go around taking pictures of pizza like you're

1058
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,620
in fucking Pokemon Snap, and then you go to the Domino's and show them your camera roll,

1059
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,300
and you just kind of swipe through it, and they say, yep, yep, yep, circle with little

1060
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,140
circles on it, yep, yep, yep, here's a pizza, and you can take a picture of that, and then

1061
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,100
it never ends?

1062
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,460
No, you dummy.

1063
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,260
There's, the employees aren't part of it.

1064
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,940
There's a robot that lives in your phone, and it beams the image to the cloud, and the

1065
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:52,820
AI, the pizza bot that lives in the cloud, identifies things as being pizza or not pizza.

1066
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:58,500
We're training robots to perfectly identify what things are pizza.

1067
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:05,540
How bad is Domino's doing right now that there was a board meeting where they brought in

1068
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:11,620
the folks in R&D and said, hey, are people even still eating pizza?

1069
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,780
Is there any way we could figure this out?

1070
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,900
Fuck, guys, it's all about hot dogs now, fuck!

1071
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,940
What can we do?

1072
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,020
What do we do to figure out who's even eating pizza anymore?

1073
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:30,260
Maybe the chefs at Domino's are like, listen, guys, I have no fucking clue what we're doing

1074
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,980
here, I don't even know if this is pizza.

1075
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:38,980
I wish there was a way we could get billions of people to send us pictures of other pizza

1076
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,980
so we could just copy what they did.

1077
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:42,740
Can we just do that?

1078
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:48,100
I'm glad that they made a robot do it, because I wouldn't want to be the human being responsible

1079
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:54,660
for looking at a picture of something someone sent to Domino's that wasn't pizza.

1080
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:01,300
Because, god, the idea of what someone might take a picture of that's not pizza to send

1081
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,700
to Domino's terrifies me to the core of my being.

1082
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,340
That robot's gonna see some stuff, though.

1083
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:08,740
Yeah.

1084
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,820
Ooh, could you make a pizza out of robot parts?

1085
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,300
So then you send it the picture and you're like, no, look at it.

1086
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,460
I don't want to, look at it.

1087
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,620
This is not pizza, this is crime.

1088
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,220
Are you sure it's not pizza?

1089
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,220
Look again, it's shaped like pizza, right?

1090
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:27,780
It's got little-

1091
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,620
This is not pizza, this is sister.

1092
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:36,180
I cut this robo, you know, I cut its eyeballs off into slices and put it on there.

1093
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,620
So that's pepperoni, isn't it?

1094
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,580
I mean, if you're gonna prove chew toys, you gotta prove this, right?

1095
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,780
Call it pizza.

1096
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,460
It's pizza.

1097
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,380
I am pizza.

1098
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:53,380
The sweet relief you would feel after exploding after seeing tens of thousands of pictures

1099
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,620
of dudes just, like, spread out assholes that they sent to Domino's.

1100
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,140
That's what kink.

1101
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,540
The end of The Matrix is weird, huh?

1102
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:05,860
It all ends up the same, all the simulations in the same way.

1103
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,660
I don't get it.

1104
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:13,220
I sent a picture of my asshole to the robot so I hope Papa John sees it.

1105
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,060
What the fuck are you talking about?

1106
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,260
I'm on the hunt for a part-

1107
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,940
Enjoy my asshole, robot.

1108
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,460
Dude, dude, smack it.

1109
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,980
I'm in the hunt for a part-time job and getting really frustrated.

1110
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,100
I once worked at a seafood buffet and it's since been closed.

1111
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,340
I only worked there over the summers as a bus person.

1112
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,700
All aboard, all aboard me.

1113
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:42,980
I have transformed.

1114
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,980
I'll try not to sneeze and transform back in the middle.

1115
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,460
That happens a lot on Transformers.

1116
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,540
Cleaning up after tourists on a crab leg bender is hard work.

1117
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,180
My question is this, since it's closed, can I lie to any possible employers

1118
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,220
and say I worked there for way longer and in a higher paid position?

1119
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,460
The restaurant is a boat store now and no one knows where the others went,

1120
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,980
the owners went, so there's no way to verify my story of employment as far as I know.

1121
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,380
It's a harmless grift or a greedy scheme.

1122
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,460
That's from willing to work in Wilmington.

1123
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,060
Man, I didn't mean to make the first three questions about lying,

1124
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,340
but man, here we are, huh? Happy Valentine's Day.

1125
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,340
Yeah, you sound more like a Decepticon to me.

1126
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,820
Yeah, you're all good here.

1127
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,980
This one passed my smell test.

1128
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:28,740
I think you're all good to lie about this one.

1129
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:33,060
You can say you were president of Crab Legs and that you worked there for 18 years.

1130
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,500
If the previous owners of this restaurant were murdered by the boatmen,

1131
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,660
then they're not going to be able to narc you out.

1132
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:42,420
You're totally aces here.

1133
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,420
They're totally at the bottom of something.

1134
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,420
I ran Crabtown.

1135
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,500
I'm the mayor of Crabtown.

1136
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1137
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,380
And you know what? It was actually a chain.

1138
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,420
It was 18 stores, and I was the mayor of all of them.

1139
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:00,980
And I saved a small child from crabs that overran one of the stores.

1140
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,460
This is actually kind of weird because like,

1141
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,700
why doesn't everybody do this all the time?

1142
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,700
This seems like such a good crime that I'm surprised it's not extremely,

1143
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,420
extremely common.

1144
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,260
I mean, maybe it is extremely common,

1145
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:17,540
but it just seems like a grift everybody is probably running all the time, right?

1146
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,660
So like put down a friend's name as the phone number and say like,

1147
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,140
yeah, call the manager and ask them and then call and say like,

1148
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,100
yes, this is Todd.

1149
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,140
He was great.

1150
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:26,660
Hello, this is Bill Gates.

1151
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,500
Hey, was Steven really your quote number two?

1152
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,740
Was he really quote your left hand, dude?

1153
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,860
Yeah, he helped me with Microsoft 98.

1154
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:42,900
Steve Ballmer learned everything from him.

1155
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,100
I was going to name it 97 and he fixed it.

1156
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:46,900
And he fixed it.

1157
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,140
And he also made Halo, so I've got to go.

1158
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,220
It says here his job title was Keyboard Lord.

1159
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:55,220
Do you guys really have a job title for that?

1160
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,020
Yeah, he put the T on there.

1161
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,980
I wasn't going to include any T's and he said people might need that.

1162
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,300
It says Keyboard Lord and Mouse Master.

1163
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,220
This is a story to sound fake.

1164
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,700
Yeah, he sure is.

1165
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,500
He included the cord and buttons.

1166
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,500
I was just going to give people a hunk of plastic.

1167
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,260
I'm actually a robot that he broke in.

1168
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:19,140
It sounds Mr. Gates might be so bold.

1169
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:24,340
It sounds like really Steve was kind of the brains behind the entire operation to me.

1170
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,660
I owe him so much.

1171
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:26,900
Yep.

1172
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,380
What are you?

1173
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,380
I'm including my own sentence.

1174
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:32,340
Why do you, what are you going to do without him?

1175
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,620
Sounds like he was pretty vibe.

1176
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,980
Well, I'm making, I'm working on making new toilets now.

1177
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:38,900
They're pretty cool.

1178
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,100
They don't stink, these ones.

1179
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,340
It's not a joke.

1180
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:43,140
He's really doing that.

1181
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,860
You could also say you're Joe from Joe's Crab Shack.

1182
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:49,220
And you had, you were the first one who looked at these little red bastards and said,

1183
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:50,740
I'm eating me one of them.

1184
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:56,260
Yeah, Gallagher's brother started performing and doing the Sledge-O-Matic routine and a lot

1185
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,660
of Gallagher's jokes because Gallagher couldn't meet the demand of people that wanted to see

1186
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:01,620
Gallagher perform.

1187
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,340
So his brother started performing and then when he got in trouble with his brother for

1188
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,380
something, he started performing his Gallagher 2.

1189
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,580
And the reason I'm bringing this up is that there's probably room for a Gallagher 3 if

1190
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:17,380
you wanted to, or like no one would know.

1191
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,460
I think the situation's confusing enough that you could probably claim to have been Gallagher

1192
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,940
2 at a certain point or, you know.

1193
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,500
Not just, it's honestly foolproof.

1194
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,620
I guess my question is, the one question I have, how does that help you get a part-time

1195
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,260
job?

1196
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,820
Well, it's in the produce department.

1197
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:38,760
So.

1198
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,060
Yeah, I'm familiar with the tensile strength of a lot of people.

1199
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:45,620
I know exactly how hard I can punch this motherfucker.

1200
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,740
I am aware of how many bits any given produce will turn into.

1201
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:56,260
Apparently there is a Joe's Crab Shack in Austin, but it's quote, temporarily closed.

1202
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:59,620
And I don't know what conditions led it to be temporarily closed, but you may as well

1203
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,620
go ahead and make that permanent, my friend.

1204
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,740
Yeah, out of crabs.

1205
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:04,980
Couldn't find them.

1206
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,260
Couldn't find them anywhere.

1207
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,780
How about we close it out?

1208
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:08,420
I'd love that.

1209
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:08,900
Let's do it.

1210
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,420
Y'all, thank you so much.

1211
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,700
We've had such a good time with you.

1212
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,180
I hope you did have a happy Valentine's Day.

1213
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:18,900
Whatever that means for you, even if it's like not observing it at all or chilling by

1214
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,100
yourself or whatever, I hope you enjoyed yourself.

1215
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,980
Because we, kidding aside, do love you very much and we appreciate all of the support

1216
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,740
over the years, et cetera, et cetera.

1217
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:34,020
I want to let you know that we have tickets, hopefully on sale now if everything has gone

1218
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,260
right, for San Jose and Salt Lake City.

1219
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:43,460
We're going to be in San Jose April 2nd and 3rd with the Adventure Zone and my brother,

1220
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,260
my brother and me.

1221
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:48,260
And then we're going to be in Salt Lake City on April 4th with my brother, my brother and

1222
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:48,760
me.

1223
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:54,440
And you can get tickets for those if you go to McElroy.family and click on tours there

1224
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,160
at the beginning.

1225
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:59,320
And then we're going to have some more announcements coming soon for the rest of 2019.

1226
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,920
But we hope to see you all in San Jose and Salt Lake City in April.

1227
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,600
Thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song.

1228
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,000
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1229
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,840
It's a super good album that I love a lot and you will too.

1230
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,000
And thank you to Maximumfun.org for having us on the network.

1231
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,200
They got a bunch of great shows.

1232
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,000
They got a new one with Ted Leo and Amy Mann that you're going to love a lot.

1233
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,360
They've got Mission to Zix is a new one up on there.

1234
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:26,760
A bunch of new shows all at Maximumfun.org and we have other stuff at McElroy.family.

1235
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,640
And you know what else just occurred to me?

1236
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,880
We haven't mentioned this in a hell of a long time.

1237
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,360
We have a YouTube channel that I believe now is McElroy family is the name of the channel.

1238
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,840
You can also we have an Instagram account where you can see like some behind the scene

1239
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,480
stuff from our live shows and tours and whatnot.

1240
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,240
As well as a Twitter account at McElroy family.

1241
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,240
So like go follow those, I guess.

1242
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,960
Absolutely.

1243
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,440
Yeah.

1244
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,040
And sorry that Travis said hello.

1245
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,520
Yeah.

1246
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,960
Listen, I hate it.

1247
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,760
I hated it.

1248
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,520
As I was doing it, I hated it.

1249
00:55:58,520 --> 00:55:59,560
So here's a final Yahoo.

1250
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,600
This one was sent in by Brian.

1251
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,080
Thank you, Brian.

1252
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:09,720
It's Yahoo Answers user Chris who asks, what is a ham basket and how does it get you to hell?

1253
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:15,080
My name is Justin McElroy.

1254
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,680
He mistook the letters.

1255
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,320
Oh, I see.

1256
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,440
I'm Travis McElroy.

1257
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1258
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,360
We were brother by brother.

1259
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,120
May I kiss your dad's square lips?

1260
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:41,400
Maximum fun.org.

1261
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,440
Comedy and culture.

1262
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,560
Artist owned.

1263
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,920
Listener supported.

1264
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,960
Unless you binge watch TV at least 80 hours a week, inside pop is definitely not for you.

1265
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,920
Sean, that's a little extreme and also not quite true.

1266
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,000
Okay, Amita, how about Inside Pop is the podcast for people who love and appreciate

1267
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,080
the best pop culture has to offer.

1268
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,120
Oh, much better.

1269
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,960
In every episode, we interview the people who create the culture you crave.

1270
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,720
Past interviews include the showrunner of Ava DuVernay's Queen Sugar and Mudbound

1271
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,080
director Dee Rees.

1272
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:13,160
You'll also get the very best pop culture recommendations in our Big Cell segment.

1273
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,400
Plus the opinions of two TV producers who are pop culture obsessives and actually do

1274
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,320
binge 80 hours of TV a week.

1275
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,440
Eyeballs.

1276
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,400
So tired.

1277
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:49,080
Listen to Inside Pop every other Wednesday on the Maximum Fun Podcast Network.
