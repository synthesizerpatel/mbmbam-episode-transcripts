00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello and welcome to 99% Invisible, I'm Roman March.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,800
Those are the guns he has on every episode that he shoots.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,920
Facts, facts.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,000
Time to hit this story with the fact cannon.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,920
Well, then he has like a salient point introduce the fucking show.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm dying.

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Hello and welcome to my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era.

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:53,320
I'm your oldest brother, Justin Tyler Mackle, and I'm Travis Patrick McElroy, your middle

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:03,320
list brother, and I'm your sweet baby brother and 30 under 30 media luminary Griffin Mackle.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,280
There are people there are people who work at these theaters who hear me say that every

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
night and must think I'm the biggest dong in the world.

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,360
I have been listening to you all for according to our clock here three minutes and I have

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
some breaking news.

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
They horny for this.

15
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Yeah, sure.

16
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,440
Apparently y'all horny for this one or what?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,760
I am horny for this one.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,960
This is the first.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,960
It sounds weird.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,800
Okay, listen, stop.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,220
Anytime I talk about being horny, if there was a lot of horniness last night, if people

22
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,480
don't cheer after that, it gets weird so fast.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,680
It gets very strange very quickly.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah, I don't know why it feels more normal to describe other people's level of horniness

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,120
rather than your own.

26
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Like it's okay if I say y'all horny.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Yeah, that's good.

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,840
But if I announce I'm horny, it's, see, but you felt it though, right?

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,200
You wanted to laugh but you definitely were like, okay, I did pay for these tickets so

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,160
y'all get in the seats, we're a little tripped out when we saw some of the seats facing each

31
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
other.

32
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Please feel welcome.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
It's become dinner theater.

34
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,760
So welcome to direct them at us.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
So this is My Brother, My Brother and Me, it's an advice show for the imaginary and

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,760
we take your questions and turn them alchemy-like into wisdom, that's right.

37
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Before we get started.

38
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Okay.

39
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
Did we not get started?

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
No.

41
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Okay.

42
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,160
So the first two shows we brought, Justin and I had our wives and various and thunder

43
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,960
children with us.

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,920
And tonight it's just Griffin, Justin and I, and so we decided to really party like

45
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,040
three bachelors loose on the town.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,640
By which I mean as soon as we got here, Griffin set up his PlayStation 4 and we played Destiny

47
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
2.

48
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Yeah.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,000
And no way, it gets fucking nastier because we ordered some Thai food from Seamless that

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,840
took longer than we thought it would and we had to bring it to the theater and eat it

51
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,240
in our dressing rooms.

52
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,120
Yeah, Rachel and Henry are back at home, but you all brought your families with me and

53
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,760
I brought a very special family member who is my best friend Crash Bandicoot, who y'all

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,920
gave me so much guff because I've lugged my PlayStation 4 with me across like three

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,380
state lines at this point.

56
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,920
And they made me take it out of my bag at the airport and I wasn't ready for that.

57
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,480
And when I opened up my bag to fetch the PS4 out of it, there was what I could qualify

58
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,280
as an underwear explosion.

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
But then I said-

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,640
Which is also what happens every time Griffin eats buffalo wings.

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Yes.

62
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,840
But then I set it up in the hotel and Justin was like, hey, can I play some Destiny 2?

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
I was like, who's laughing now?

64
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,680
And Crash Bandicoot appeared on the screen, he said, no, fuck you, Justin.

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
Griffin was being really weird, Travis and I just had small bags, but we checked them

66
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
because Travis is already checking one, so I figured this is fucking boring anyway.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,160
Griffin wouldn't check his and we couldn't figure out why.

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,160
Because Crash was in it.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Yeah, exactly.

70
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,640
That's what we figured out eventually, like his precious PS4.

71
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,760
He'd rather just slam it into an overhead compartment in a rush.

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
Should we get busy?

73
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,640
Let's get to the meat of the thing.

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Yeah.

75
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,160
Now, before I read this first question, some context is important.

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:40,600
This is a question that was sent specifically for this show on September 10th.

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:52,080
Are you supposed to tip Christmas carolers now?

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,640
Are you here?

79
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Was there a name on that one?

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
No.

81
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
No.

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Are you here?

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,920
No, apparently they don't care that much.

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,240
So there's two options.

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,360
Option one is your life is very fucking chill.

86
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,520
Yeah, you have the coolest life out there, this is the thing that you're worried.

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:21,680
This is like number 74,210 on my list, ranking in well below climate change.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,560
The other option is you care about this a lot.

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,760
You really, really care what carolers think of you.

90
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,960
Well, because there's a possibility, I think it's easy to assume that this is like, was

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,920
I supposed to tip them?

92
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,680
But it's also possible that nine months ago, the concern might have been I did tip them

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,040
and they were really weird about it.

94
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
Yeah.

95
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,520
Or that the carolers are still there.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,520
Or should I say there are like five skeletons holding out long ago melted candles and just

97
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,800
a skeletal palm outstretched like, oh shit, stay right there.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I know who can help me with this one.

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,920
That's a great point, Travis.

100
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,960
If you're worried, if you have so little to worry about that you're thinking in advance

101
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,920
about whether or not you should tip Christmas carolers, I cannot relate to you at all.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,680
If nine months after the fact, you're still obsessing about the fact whether or not you

103
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,600
did the right thing or not, welcome home.

104
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah.

105
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
You found your podcast.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
Where are your carats?

107
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,920
Sometimes I will, years later, wake up in a cold sweat like, oh no, I said this and

108
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
I meant that.

109
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Shit.

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,040
I said you also enjoy your flight to the cab drive.

111
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
That one felt relevant.

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,280
We're dancing around it because I think would none of us really want to address the question

113
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
here, because I don't know.

114
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, I actually do know, I do know the answer to this.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,720
Isn't it a pudding-based economy that they have?

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,840
I took one of my collegiate classes.

117
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,640
Oh God, here we go, here we go.

118
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,000
I went to university.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Always rubbing it in.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mom, Paul, we had minus in one of us.

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,480
That's all we hear about now.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
College.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,000
What happened on the quad?

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,680
In this history class, it was pre-Civil War history.

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,560
We did a course on the war on Christmas.

126
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,600
God, this is as boring as college was.

127
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Thank you for recreating the experience.

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,600
I'm getting there.

129
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,920
You know, the actual war on Christmas back when Christmas was outlawed in America for

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
a while.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,320
Okay, hold on, because now I'm in.

132
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,440
You're back in, because for a while, Christmas was all about just getting drunk and like

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:38,840
fucking raging, and so the church outlawed Christmas, and then they brought it back.

134
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,040
It was like new Christmas that was very family-positive, but it used to be that caroling, they would

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,840
literally go door-to-door and demand money and food and gifts from you, and if you didn't

136
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,600
deliver it, they would storm into your house and take shit.

137
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,760
That's why in the song, there's a line that goes, we won't go until we get some, we won't

138
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,760
go until...

139
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
This sounds apocryphal.

140
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:10,040
This is 100% true, so you had to keep a tray of coins by the door to throw at them and

141
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
then slam the door.

142
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,280
You had to hurry to the panic room, you were too slow to the panic room.

143
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,840
Now I've got your Xbox and I also took your son.

144
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,640
Now bring us your Amazon Echo, now bring us your Amazon Echo.

145
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm updating it, because no one has pudding anymore.

146
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,120
How about a yahoo from the Yahoo answer service?

147
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,040
Y'all are fucking loud and I'm loving it.

148
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
This is the best.

149
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,040
It's so good.

150
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,040
This is our... No, no, no.

151
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Okay.

152
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,480
You just misunderstood.

153
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,400
You were a proper amount before.

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's just keep it.

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,720
This is one of the only times... No, the only time of a venue that wasn't at home that we

156
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,840
have played at more than once, is there?

157
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
It's true.

158
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
Third show.

159
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,040
We're talking, this is not... This is not like that, Baltimore, you're the best city,

160
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
yeah, fucking rock on.

161
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
But we do love you, B-Town.

162
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,480
Yeah, B-Town, what's up?

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,360
But we were talking backstage, you're like, what's your best show ever?

164
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,040
And I think it was... Was anybody at our Adventure Zone show here last year?

165
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,320
Y'all were fucking great, and you're great now too.

166
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,880
So anyway, here's a yahoo from Rose Farlow.

167
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Thank you, Rose.

168
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
It's yahoo answers user.

169
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,160
They're anonymous, but we'll call them...

170
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Oh.

171
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,320
Not in our day to day.

172
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,160
Like they've got a real life.

173
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,720
We're going to call them Dravid.

174
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,440
Asks, how can I get the poltergeists in my house to understand that they don't scare

175
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,120
me and nothing they can do will drive me away?

176
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,720
All right, Dravid.

177
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,440
I moved into my house two months ago, and they've been at it nonstop.

178
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,520
Nothing that some earplugs can't fix, even though they try to take them out sometimes

179
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,180
while I sleep.

180
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,400
And I can handle a few objects being chucked my way from time to time.

181
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,560
Holy shit.

182
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
The fact of the matter is that as a living being with a physical presence, I am stronger

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,640
and more powerful than they are 100 fold.

184
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:27,760
The house belongs to me, and they belong to me.

185
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,820
There's a new sheriff in town, and they might as well just cross over because their reign

186
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,440
of terror in this old house is over.

187
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
So get out of here, old dead sheriff.

188
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,160
Welcome back to this old house.

189
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,520
I'm Bob Vila, and busting makes me feel good.

190
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,500
How can I get them to cross over or at least realize their attempts to drive me out are

191
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,920
futile and they might as well just shut up?

192
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,900
First let me ask, can I get a little bit more monitor so I can hear my dear brother over

193
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,120
these rambunctious people?

194
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,880
Thank you.

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,960
I wish these ghosts would just quit it because they're embarrassing themselves.

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,640
Let's clear one thing up first.

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,320
You don't own the ghosts.

198
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,580
This is America.

199
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,480
We don't own anybody.

200
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,080
You don't own the ghosts.

201
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,780
If you can't own a cloud, if you can't own a beautiful vape cloud that you just made,

202
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,600
if you can't own a ghost, they're basically the same damn thing.

203
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,640
If you love a ghost, set it free.

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Yeah.

205
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Well, hold on.

206
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Hold on.

207
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
No, hold on.

208
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Wait.

209
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,240
When the Ghostbusters busted ghosts and had them in their little containment units.

210
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Still didn't own them.

211
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
Okay.

212
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
A warden doesn't own the prisoners.

213
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,800
Yeah, that's a fair point.

214
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,800
My children.

215
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,820
I will also say, I don't know, I guess I've never thought about it in terms of am I stronger

216
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,160
than a ghost?

217
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,760
This guy has.

218
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:08,040
Because like, yeah, they're ephemeral, they are nothing, but in movies they always seem

219
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
pretty scary.

220
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Right.

221
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,800
Well, not in Ghost, but Ghost sets up a weird dynamic where it's like you can either move

222
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,760
a fucking Pepsi can and then it's like, I can kick your ass, or you can summon demons

223
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,400
that drag me to hell and I can't fight that.

224
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Right.

225
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Right.

226
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
He levels up so fast.

227
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
He levels up real quick.

228
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
He evolves.

229
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,240
He uses a moonstone on him and he gets much bigger.

230
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,760
Any time Patrick Swayze is not on camera, he's doing quests, quests and quests and quests

231
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
and quests.

232
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
Killing Kobolds.

233
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Killing Kobolds.

234
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Kill the Kobolds.

235
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Get the new powers.

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,760
Crush Rome Belt.

237
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,760
Crush Rome Belt.

238
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
Inhabit Whoopi.

239
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,160
Inhabit Whoopi.

240
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,400
I don't know how you, what I do enjoy about this person, what I respect, is it's not about

241
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,680
how do I get rid of the ghosts.

242
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,880
It's how do I show the ghosts that I'm the boss.

243
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
How do I establish dominance?

244
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
Right.

245
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
How do I dominate my ghosts?

246
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,720
How do I Caesar Malone this shit?

247
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Yeah.

248
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Ghost Whisperer.

249
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,040
You gotta tap the ghost on the nose.

250
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Here's how fucked Earth is.

251
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
I just said Ghost Whisperer as a joke.

252
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,000
Nah, it's a fucking thing.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Like it was a whole show.

254
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
Which Jennifer Love Hewitt.

255
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,960
I gotta feel bad for these ghosts too because you know they have their little like post-game

256
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,240
debriefs in the attic and they're just like, Jeremy, I've tried everything.

257
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
He's not scared.

258
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
He's not scared.

259
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
He's just not spooked at all.

260
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
I threw a few things at him.

261
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Nothing.

262
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,240
He just caught him.

263
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
He caught an apple and he just ate it in one bite.

264
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,480
What am I supposed to do with that, Jeremy?

265
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,400
That would be an interesting twist on Sixth Sense.

266
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I see dead people.

267
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Yeah.

268
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Yeah.

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
Fine.

270
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
And I wish they'd quit it.

271
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
I've got stuff to do today.

272
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
I'm a little boy.

273
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,160
How cool would it be if you were just hanging out with a little seven-year-old and every

274
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,160
once in a while is like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, fuck off, whatever.

275
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,160
I get it.

276
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
He just walked around shutting all the cabinets.

277
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,920
He's fucking idiots every time.

278
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Hold on, Bruce.

279
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,600
Misha, I can't with you today.

280
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Misha Barton was in that film.

281
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
A lot of people forget that.

282
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,560
She was the throw-up ghost.

283
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
You know.

284
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
She threw up.

285
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
It was real scary.

286
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,560
Check Iron Newbie.

287
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
That's what she's in there as.

288
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
I work in a library.

289
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,760
A few weeks ago, my library- A what?

290
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,920
It's a question, Griffin.

291
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,720
I don't- Did he say library?

292
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Like 95.

293
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Can we get a poll from the audience if he said library?

294
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,120
Fuck it.

295
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,960
Now let's hear it if he didn't say library.

296
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,520
It kind of actually sounds slick down the middle.

297
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,240
That side of the house is like, that was library.

298
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,920
I think it's a speaker issue then.

299
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,800
We've got a speaker problem.

300
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,720
Can we get the R's up in the monitor?

301
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
The R novice.

302
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,040
I work in a library.

303
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,720
A few weeks- A bibliotech.

304
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,080
A few weeks- That's my fucking favorite U2 song.

305
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,640
A few weeks ago, my library was chicken winged and hot dogged throughout the building.

306
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Sure.

307
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
We'll get there.

308
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,640
We'll need to get there.

309
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:07,120
Meaning some wasteful scoundrels left them- I do like the idea that we would bring up

310
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,240
a topic and a question and not tell you, the audience, what we were talking about.

311
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,800
This is just for us.

312
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,440
Meaning, some wasteful scoundrels left them all over the library.

313
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,760
Now you've got me fucking paranoid.

314
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,040
On tables, on bookshelves, on dancer and prancer- No, just on tables, on bookshelves, even hanging

315
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,360
from a hook above the travel books- How do you hang a fucking hot dog from a hook?

316
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,120
Have you never fished?

317
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,760
You just put it on there.

318
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,800
Someone fishing for Darryl's.

319
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,240
We aren't sure who did it, but the people we think did do it were adults.

320
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
Not shenanigan-pulling teens doing some sort of senior prank.

321
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,240
We do not know the motive.

322
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,880
Was it a crime of opportunity or one of premeditation?

323
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,880
How do we get revenge?

324
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,800
That's from Snack Attacked in Boston.

325
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
You hear Snack Attacked.

326
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:16,120
I heard one noise come from stage right of somebody going, and I thought that was them,

327
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
but then we got an ecstatic cheer.

328
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,840
Apparently a similar situation happened to you, so we've got a crime warrant.

329
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,320
In what universe could this be a crime of opportunity?

330
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Right.

331
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,720
Well, I was just going to sit here and eat these wings and hot dogs, but you know what?

332
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,080
There's a hook over there, and I'm going to see what I can do about it.

333
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,880
I'm going to do a hot dog experiment.

334
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,680
How fucking sneaky was this person that they put this food all over the library and nobody

335
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,440
saw it?

336
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,900
And nobody saw it.

337
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,900
You did it.

338
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,900
You're in my head.

339
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Yeah.

340
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,280
Welcome to Terror Dome.

341
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,960
I could be in my dorm room a mile and a half away from the library, and if somebody in

342
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,480
the library was fastening a hot dog onto a hook in the library, I would make sure I saw

343
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
it.

344
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know how you see somebody like, come on, piercing the ween.

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,400
I don't know how you don't notice that.

346
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
Yeah, I do have to say, and thank you for coming, and I don't mean to come down on you

347
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:31,120
so hard, but if a librarian's job isn't to keep people from hanging hot dogs all around

348
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,740
the books, and chicken wings, and also, if I may be so bold, if a librarian's job isn't

349
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,920
to keep people from bringing huge containers of hot dogs and chicken wings into where the

350
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:48,720
books are kept, I do not know what it is you are being paid to do.

351
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,520
That seems like job one, the first video they put into the machine is like, you may happen

352
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,920
to see some of our guests try to hang hot dogs or chicken wings up around the books

353
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
if you see this, please ask them to desist.

354
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,280
If you see someone come in in a large trench coat with an interesting perfume, you might

355
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,640
be a redneck.

356
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,880
I've got a really, you asked about revenge, I've got a real good revenge, and that is

357
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,920
you go around, you're gonna love this, it's so good, you're gonna go around and collect

358
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:28,600
all the food and then sit down and eat all of the delicious buffalo wings and hot dogs

359
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,560
that they've, buffalo wings are very good, I don't understand what the question is about

360
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
this.

361
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,400
These have been manhandled and hooked.

362
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
They've been in hookin'.

363
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,680
I'm not saying, okay, skip the hook one, but if it's just some buffalo wings, if you're

364
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,280
just like somewhere and you happen upon some, if it's still warm.

365
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Wait, no, finish this.

366
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,680
Yeah, no, no, no, no, we're going all the way home.

367
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:56,920
If you happen upon some still warm football food, I think you go for it.

368
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Anywhere?

369
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,200
Anywhere, Griffin?

370
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,880
Not on a street, but on a shelf somewhere.

371
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,400
So you're walking down a library, you see an interesting book.

372
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
What was that?

373
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Library.

374
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,800
You see an interesting, like a Jimmy Carter biography, you take it.

375
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,360
That's your go-to interesting book?

376
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,360
Yeah, he's a fascinating man.

377
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
Okay.

378
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,720
You move it, behind there, a still warm, lots of nachos with nacho cheese all over them,

379
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,120
and you think, score!

380
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,000
Still warm, football food, good to go.

381
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
All right.

382
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,280
Listen, thank you all so much for coming.

383
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,800
We're stopping the podcast for a second.

384
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,440
Oh, no.

385
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,720
Griffin, can we take a quick pause from jokes?

386
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,440
Let's excuse jokes from the stage.

387
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,760
Jokes, go get some ginger ale.

388
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,200
Go to the green room.

389
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
We got fruit snacks.

390
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
We got chocolate in there.

391
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
No problem.

392
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,800
Still warm football food.

393
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,480
So jokes is gone, Griffin.

394
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,480
How much of what you're saying is cafe man?

395
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,480
How much of it is life?

396
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
If it's warm.

397
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,480
No, no.

398
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
No, no, no.

399
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Jokes are gone.

400
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
No, jokes out.

401
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I told you jokes.

402
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,920
I love you, and I care about you, and I need to know.

403
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,120
You have a broken stomach, and jokes is gone.

404
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Jokes left the room.

405
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,040
If I was at a library and I saw some, a library is the perfect setting because I would think

406
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,560
that the library was having some sort of event.

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,840
Griffin, I need what you say for the next 30 seconds until jokes comes back to be in

408
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,480
short sentences that I can introduce in court.

409
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,120
I need you to just say in concrete language the extent to which you're willing to eat

410
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
chicken wings.

411
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,640
Can I tell you something?

412
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,600
Your body is so broken, you shouldn't be eating fucking buffalo wings if Carly Jepsen brings

413
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,000
them to you on a silver platter.

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,920
You shouldn't be eating them, period.

415
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
End of story.

416
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:03,200
It honestly is one of the few times a human being could say, I shouldn't, and mean it.

417
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,560
Even if Trous is like, let's be bad, you could still be like-

418
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,120
I need to take a pause and try to program what Justin just said into my brain so I can

419
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:21,400
try to lucid dream to that tonight.

420
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:29,280
Okay, so listen, we do have quite a bit more podcasts, and I would like jokes to be here

421
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
for it.

422
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Okay.

423
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,180
So could you just tell me, please-

424
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,560
If it was a trusted setting and the wings were warm, yes.

425
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,560
Stop.

426
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Stop.

427
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,680
I put an asterisk, I put an asterisk next to trusted setting, and I'm going down to

428
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,560
the bottom of the page, and I found the asterisk, what is the text that I find next to it?

429
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
If it's a place I've been before.

430
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
You've been lots of places.

431
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,680
DMV, a gas station.

432
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
This stage.

433
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Not a gas station.

434
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
This stage, yes.

435
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
If there were just buffalo wings out here when we came out-

436
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,400
That's when a giant box falls over on you and someone's caught you.

437
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Yeah.

438
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,000
Maybe that's what this library was doing, is they had a fucking trail of buffalo wings

439
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,680
leading from the jock frat or whatever to try to get them into-

440
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,680
Are they on a plate?

441
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
Griffin, are they on a plate?

442
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Are they on a plate?

443
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Yeah.

444
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I wouldn't eat one just sitting on a couch.

445
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Are they peeled?

446
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,120
We spent 15 fucking minutes talking about whether or not I would eat-

447
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,240
Then answer the question.

448
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,520
Would you not take them to security, lost and found, and then claim them in 40 days

449
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,800
if no one had picked them up?

450
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Wouldn't be warm anymore.

451
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
How about a yahoo?

452
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,800
All right, this one was-

453
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Come on back.

454
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Come on back, jokes.

455
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,800
We missed you.

456
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,480
This one was sent in by Basil Butterbaugh.

457
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Thank you, Basil.

458
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
It's by...

459
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You here?

460
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
All right.

461
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Oh, you went to college.

462
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Cool.

463
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
Were they cool?

464
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,760
I bet if you go to school with somebody named Basil Butterbaugh, you remember them.

465
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,760
You would know them.

466
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,000
It's from Yahoo Answers user, the website's doing a bad job.

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,480
Yeah, it's not loading.

468
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,920
This one's David also.

469
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,840
David asks, I dream of bathrooms?

470
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,920
I dream of a bathrooms like every other dream.

471
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Nothing happens in there.

472
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,080
It's just me checking out different kinds of bathrooms.

473
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,520
Big bathrooms, small bathrooms, hospital bathrooms, old rusty bathrooms, public bathrooms,

474
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,920
bathrooms with fish swimming in the toilets, bathrooms with five toilets to a stall.

475
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Hold on.

476
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,480
Why'd you react that way to fish swimming in the toilet, but not old rusty bathrooms?

477
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Old rusty bathrooms.

478
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Check.

479
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Oh, fish.

480
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Yeah.

481
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,160
Well, think of the attendant who would have to refresh the fish every time.

482
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,160
Every few hours, really?

483
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,640
Bathrooms with five toilets to a stall.

484
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
What's the deal with this?

485
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,000
I have an obsession with dreaming about bathrooms.

486
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
Every bathroom is unique, but nothing ever happens.

487
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I want to meet the person who has dreams every night, every night, where they enter a room,

488
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,920
that's it, for hours?

489
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
Yeah.

490
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:23,720
They just spend hours going, hmm, all right.

491
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,360
All of our great bathroom geniuses, all the great geniuses of bathroom design have had

492
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,480
dreams like this.

493
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,820
You have to imagine.

494
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,900
This is how you get the calling, right?

495
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,400
You see in your dreams, bathrooms you want to see in the world.

496
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
And that's the universe's way of telling you.

497
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,280
Be the bathroom you wish to see in the world.

498
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Exactly, Travis.

499
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,280
Yes.

500
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Yes.

501
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,280
You dream.

502
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,280
If you don't dream.

503
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,240
That's a Craigslist listing title, if I've ever heard one, by the way.

504
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,000
So I don't think it's weird.

505
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I think you're being called, like you're being called to create the great bathrooms, some

506
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,240
of the great bathrooms.

507
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,560
Oh, I like that because like the five toilets in one stall is maybe it's like a conversation.

508
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,560
Sure.

509
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Who knows?

510
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,560
Yeah.

511
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,560
It's a conversation shit pit.

512
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Yeah.

513
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,200
I can't see inside the head of a bathroom genius.

514
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,160
I just take his work as it comes and enjoy it in my own way.

515
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,720
When Tesla brought the world's first toilet to the Chicago World's Fair and electrified

516
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
it.

517
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Electrified it.

518
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,360
He was probably having toilet dreams every night.

519
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,880
You know, you're joking, I think, but it's hard to tell with you sometimes.

520
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,560
It's hard to tell with you sometimes.

521
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,680
But I am now thinking about, it must have been really hard for the first person that

522
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:46,960
invented a toilet to convince people like, no, go ahead, it's fine.

523
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,280
What about my big old nasty cloth bag?

524
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
What do I do with that?

525
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
No, you throw that out.

526
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
You're done with that now.

527
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
You throw that out.

528
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,280
No, it's a hole.

529
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,040
So wait, it's a hole in your house.

530
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
In the house.

531
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,320
That I'll just go shit in?

532
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,440
Hey, I don't mean to seem dense.

535
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
I shit outside.

536
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Right.

537
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,680
So, but no, I want you to come in my house and poop in a room in there.

538
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,080
A room like a bedroom or a parlor.

539
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
Right.

540
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
It's a special one.

541
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,300
Nobody goes in, but I have a chair that makes it disappear.

542
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,000
That doesn't make any sense at all.

543
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
How about I just shit outside?

544
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,080
What about outside?

545
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,640
There's all kinds of outside and you've only got the one house.

546
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440
I don't need to shit in your house.

547
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
I'm fine out there.

548
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,560
Really, it's not a big deal.

549
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,700
We've been doing it for generations.

550
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,800
How many people at fucking Tesla's Toilet Palooza, Chicago World's Fair, 1930, whenever,

551
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,600
rolled up and were like, okay, this seems good, seems good, let me get a feel for it.

552
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,600
All right.

553
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,040
Let me just take this big tank top off and here we go.

554
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
Boom.

555
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,600
And then you hide it, right?

556
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,200
Tesla, it didn't go away.

557
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah, I know.

558
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,760
You did such a bad job.

559
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
That is true.

560
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,400
How many people do you think bought toilets, like took a shit in them and then threw it

561
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,240
away and went and bought a new one?

562
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,600
This is an expensive habit.

563
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,840
We're trying to figure out the number to call for the dirty cloth bag guy.

564
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Yeah, I'm done.

565
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm done.

566
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I finished.

567
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Come get it.

568
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,480
Yeah, no, I'm going to need a new dirty cloth bag to put it in, but it's in the chair for

569
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
sure.

570
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
What's that?

571
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Connect it to water?

572
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I don't.

573
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Hmm.

574
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Hmm.

575
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
How about I get out here, Griffin?

576
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
We just did one.

577
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
How about a regular question?

578
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Griffin?

579
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes.

580
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
I work in a library.

581
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Nope.

582
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
No, you know what?

583
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Let's take a second round of that one.

584
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
I feel like you could have done a better job.

585
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Let's do that.

586
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
One more again.

587
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
One more again.

588
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Okay.

589
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,400
When I was... I've always wondered what it's like for someone to demand I play the hits,

590
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:56,900
and now... When I was younger, my mom rented a horse for my B-day party because I enjoyed

591
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,440
my little pony at the time.

592
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,580
You don't need an excuse.

593
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,160
It's cool.

594
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,160
They're very good animals.

595
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
They're good animals.

596
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
My friends-

597
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
And it's a childhood birthday party.

598
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,160
There's a pony there.

599
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
It's a success.

600
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Yeah.

601
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
No one's going to be like, how gauche?

602
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,640
I love my little pony.

603
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,800
What is this doing here?

604
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:28,320
My friends think it's hysterical because I hate horses and joke about getting... Fine.

605
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,280
They joke about getting one for my B-day later this month.

606
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,200
I'm terrified they might actually go through with it.

607
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,600
Oh, come on.

608
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,880
How do I let them know I'm not joking about...

609
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,960
Not wanting another horse near me without instigating them, and that's Jade from Boston.

610
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Jade.

611
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,000
Please don't boo Jade.

612
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,820
There's a million of you.

613
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,820
But are you here?

614
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,820
Okay.

615
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Okay.

616
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
All right.

617
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,820
You know what?

618
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,820
Turn around.

619
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,820
Everyone leave Jade the fuck alone.

620
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,820
No.

621
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,820
We're not going to do this.

622
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,820
Jade.

623
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
No.

624
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,820
I can't.

625
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,880
I got to disperse this because I don't want Jade to feel like this isn't a welcome place.

626
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,280
Like, too bad.

627
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:14,960
It's the most beautiful animal and it's at your birthday party.

628
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,920
Let me play the world's smallest... Is it violin?

629
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,160
The world's smallest violin for you.

630
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,920
Do it.

631
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,400
That's not what a violin sounds like at all.

632
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,840
I'm just realizing people don't normally make the noise.

633
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,340
That's not usually part of the thing.

634
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,880
People don't usually do that.

635
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,200
Jade, if you weren't afraid of horses, this is a great con to get your friends to supply

636
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,640
a horse for your birthday.

637
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,640
Holy shit.

638
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,880
This is the most reverse that psychology can get.

639
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
Yeah.

640
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,680
I'm just trying to put myself in the headspace of somebody who wouldn't be stoked to see

641
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,240
a horse under any circumstance.

642
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,560
Is it because they're big and they got them chompers?

643
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
I get that.

644
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
I get that.

645
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,240
They are huge bite machines, essentially.

646
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Yeah.

647
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,520
And fast, too.

648
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,720
So they'll bring that bite right to you.

649
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,000
Actually now I'm thinking about it.

650
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Horses are kind of scary.

651
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Yeah.

652
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
You know what?

653
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
And they kick.

654
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And they have metal on their feet.

655
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
They kick.

656
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,240
And often people with swords ride them.

657
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,760
So that's another thing to worry about.

658
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,760
Shit, guys.

659
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,840
Have you ever seen a horse running directly at you and thought, awesome.

660
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,680
I'm going to stand perfectly still and receive that creature.

661
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Maybe- Shit, guys.

662
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Have we been wrong this whole time?

663
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Wait.

664
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Hold on.

665
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Wait.

666
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,760
So the horse says something to you and yeah, you hate all of them.

667
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,520
Like you're at a rodeo and the horse is just like, fuck you, Jade.

668
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,720
And then, but it said it really quiet so like your parents didn't hear and they wouldn't

669
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,280
believe you.

670
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:54,400
Horse, did you tell my daughter Jade to fuck off?

671
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
Straight from the horse's mouth.

672
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,840
And you turn around.

673
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
See Jade?

674
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,840
Anyway, I'm going to go get the car.

675
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,600
I'm going to eat your dog.

676
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
Did you hear it?

677
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,320
It just said it's going to eat our- You heard it, right?

678
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,520
Maybe call your friends below.

679
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,600
If they're like, or I'm going to get your horse and be like, you know what, fine.

680
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Do it.

681
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Yeah.

682
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,200
Jade, I don't know your friends, but if they're like everybody on earth, they're not going

683
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,640
to fucking follow through with this.

684
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,920
You have no worry of this actually coming to fruition.

685
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,240
I could talk, I could run a lot of shit.

686
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,520
I could talk a lot of shit about getting a horse.

687
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,080
I would have no clue.

688
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
What do you do?

689
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,440
Do you call a farm?

690
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,440
Do you know why?

691
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,920
I'll tell you exactly the point at which this joke falls apart.

692
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,560
When money has to change hands.

693
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Yeah, exactly.

694
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
It stops being funny.

695
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Oh, you know what would be funny?

696
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
We'll rent a horse for Jade.

697
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
It's how much?

698
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
How?

699
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,760
And I have to get it from here to there?

700
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
No way.

701
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
Can't do it.

702
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,620
Well, the horse has a way for you to get it from somewhere to somewhere else.

703
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,080
To put miles on it?

704
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,040
Yeah, you're not going to put miles on my horse.

705
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,880
This is a strictly scaring horse.

706
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,080
It's just for scaring people.

707
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
What's that?

708
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,080
You want to scare your friend, Jade?

709
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Yeah, we can do that.

710
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,400
That's 250 as our regular scare your friend rate, but sounds like she's had some experience

711
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,840
with horses before, so we could do it for two.

712
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,840
How about Yahoo?

713
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,840
Hit me.

714
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
This one was sent in by...

715
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:25,680
I appreciate y'all cheer every time for this bad website.

716
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,040
It was sent in by Catherine Parkinson.

717
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Thank you, Catherine.

718
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,500
It's Yahoo Answers.

719
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
Also anonymous.

720
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Fuck.

721
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,560
Dravid has been busy.

722
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:45,120
Dravid asks, what do you call the middle part of the pizza?

723
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,440
Urgent.

724
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:57,520
So, we've got that good, good crust, but what is the part that is not on the edge of the

725
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
pizza?

726
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,000
It's just pizza.

727
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:10,680
No, because if you cut the crust away from something, it's almost like we require a word

728
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
for...

729
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,840
No, if you cut the crust away from the pizza, you have a crust and you have a pizza.

730
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,840
You still have a pizza.

731
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,640
Hold on, Justin, because you can't say you have to cut the crust off of the pizza.

732
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,040
That means crust is part of the pizza.

733
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:31,840
Yeah, but if I walk in and look at a plate and it's pizza with no crust on it, I'm not

734
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,440
going to be like, what the fuck is that?

735
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,040
What did you make?

736
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,960
Okay, wait, hold on.

737
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,040
By the way, Crisp and Tasty's do not have crusts, so if you got a Crisp and Tasty pizza

738
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:52,280
from Gino's, which is a Gino's family of products, if you got a Crisp and Tasty, that is not going

739
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
to have a crust.

740
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
How do you fucking pick it up?

741
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
That's the thing.

742
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,040
You're wrong, because it's all crust.

743
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:01,560
No, this person is talking about specifically the crust around the edge.

744
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,000
It's not about the bottom crust, but that the bottom is crust.

745
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,080
It layers up.

746
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,040
It doesn't layer from the outside in.

747
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,840
It layers from the bottom up.

748
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,560
It's not... Travis is saying there's not a bread hoop containing a cheese mess.

749
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,480
That's what I... Okay, but if I finish a slice of pizza except for the crust, I would

750
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,560
be like, here, I saved you the crust.

751
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,260
I'm not expecting the person to scrape the toppings off and hand me a triangular bread

752
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
slice.

753
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,260
Holy shit.

754
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
I mean, listen, you're right.

755
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,260
Yeah, I know.

756
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,520
But I also feel that I am right.

757
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
I get it though.

758
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
You are.

759
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
Yeah.

760
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,560
The problem is we've got a language issue here.

761
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
It's a language issue.

762
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,800
It has to be solved by introducing another word to the lexicon, to the fucking anatomy

763
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
of Zah.

764
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Okay.

765
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,000
The bread hoop that we think of as crust, or I'm speaking of as crust, pizza bones.

766
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,920
So... Yes, I think we can all agree on that.

767
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,360
We can all agree on pizza bones.

768
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,200
You have cheese-stuffed bones.

769
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,960
So this is the tissue of the- So the cheese is the marrow.

770
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
Right.

771
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,520
The cheese is the marrow of the bones.

772
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,800
Okay, okay, okay.

773
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
This is horrible.

774
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,440
You get rid of the pizza bones.

775
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,000
Yes.

776
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,400
Underneath that is still crust.

777
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
So I grant you that.

778
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Muscle.

779
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,400
No, what are we doing here?

780
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Cheese is skin.

781
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Sauce is blood.

782
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Yeah, sauce is the blood.

783
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Pepperonis are freckles.

784
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Oh my God.

785
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
It's not some skin.

786
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Read the question again.

787
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Start back at the beginning.

788
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Okay.

789
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
It's one sentence.

790
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,400
Yeah, one more time.

791
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,840
One more time, one more time, one more time, one more time.

792
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,840
We've got that good, good crust, but what is the part that is not on the edge of the

793
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
pizza?

794
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,840
And this is- Okay, wait.

795
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Time out.

796
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
Oh, Jesus.

797
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
You all fucking heard it that time, right?

798
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
We just did the flashback.

799
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
The edge of the pizza.

800
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
That is what was being discussed.

801
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,840
The pizza is the hole.

802
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:51,280
But the edge of the pizza, this question specifically is talking about the part that is not the pizza

803
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,280
bones.

804
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,280
Right?

805
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,660
Agreed?

806
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,660
We can all agree on that.

807
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,660
They said around the edge of the pizza.

808
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,660
Justin.

809
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,660
I'm not like some loon here.

810
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Justin.

811
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660
That's what I was thinking about is the bones.

812
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
I'm right.

813
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Justin.

814
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Justin.

815
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,660
Yeah.

816
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Okay.

817
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
Play with me.

818
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,160
Play with me.

819
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,760
In this space, don't just say fuck this question.

820
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,600
No, I'm not saying fuck the question.

821
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,940
I'm saying fuck the condescension and the de-evolution into semantics.

822
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,720
We just need to move on with what the part that isn't the bones.

823
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,520
To be fair, this is a question about what you call something.

824
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,080
So it is literally all semantics.

825
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Okay, granted.

826
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Okay.

827
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:39,240
Would it be too confusing if we referred to the center, we need a fucking word for it.

828
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
The core.

829
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
The core.

830
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,800
The core.

831
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,040
The mantle.

832
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,920
The mantle of the za.

833
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,720
What about just the meat?

834
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
The pearl.

835
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
But the meat has...

836
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Oh, I like the pearl.

837
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,240
The pearl is better because the meat, it does have meat.

838
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,840
So a meat lover's pizza in this context would be pretty wild because if you did not in fact

839
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,960
love the meat as Griffin describes it, that would be a weird person eating pizza.

840
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,000
I don't think it's the best choice for you.

841
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Oh, okay.

842
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Let's throw it all out.

843
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
All right.

844
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,640
The outside hoop is the rind.

845
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,280
Why do we have to throw out crust?

846
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Crust is crust.

847
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Dammit, you're right.

848
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
Crust is crust is crust.

849
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
No, we did this.

850
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
It's the bones.

851
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
No.

852
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
Rind and flesh.

853
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Holy shit.

854
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
Rind and flesh.

855
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,480
Rind and then the flesh of the pizza.

856
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
The flesh of the pizza.

857
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,880
Y'all are cheering, so we'll move on, but this is not up for a vote, okay?

858
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,720
We're gonna settle this together.

859
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,320
I like rind and flesh.

860
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
Rind and flesh.

861
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Griffin, can you get on board with that?

862
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,800
Yes, absolutely, if it means we can do another question.

863
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,400
Okay.

864
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,320
I have yet another question that I am going to grab here for you all.

865
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,880
I love my friend, but a few weeks ago, I was in Target with her, and she removed all her

866
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,760
feet coverings.

867
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:11,000
Is every fucking question in this episode gonna be completely spiritually challenging?

868
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:22,120
Both her shoes and socks to try on a pair of socks that she had taken out of a package

869
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,560
hanging on the wall.

870
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,240
No, no, no.

871
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,920
I guess they didn't fit, because you are acting like you're watching a sword swallower, and

872
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,720
I'm loving it.

873
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:49,380
I guess they didn't fit, because she put them in the garbage, back in the bag, and proceeded

874
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:58,200
to walk barefoot through the sock aisles, looking for another pair to try.

875
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,440
My question is, how do I forget I ever, ever saw this?

876
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Am I overreacting?

877
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,760
No.

878
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,120
Why did she do this to me?

879
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Help.

880
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,080
From Mortified in a Major Way in Massachusetts, I almost don't want to know if you are here.

881
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Are you?

882
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,080
Hey.

883
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
No, no.

884
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,320
No, listen.

885
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Is your friend?

886
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
Did you bring them?

887
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,960
Oh, thank God.

888
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
It almost got real bad.

889
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,960
We're safe, everybody.

890
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
It's fine, everybody.

891
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
Sit back down.

892
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,180
We almost had to end the show and rip cord out of ball stud.

893
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,640
We need an extraction.

894
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Okay, so.

895
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,240
This is theft.

896
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,000
These socks are dunzo.

897
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
That's the thing.

898
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,960
There are so, so very many troubling things in this question.

899
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,840
The thing that troubles me the most, because there could be a situation in which this person

900
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:03,240
just has never had a human interaction before to understand, like, this is not okay, until

901
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:10,520
you get to the point where you open a sealed package to try it.

902
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,040
Because that is exactly what the sealed package is attempting to prevent.

903
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,760
In opening, when I buy, you've broken a promise.

904
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,200
When I buy a sealed package, the promise is, here, nobody touched these, except for the

905
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,760
people that are supposed to.

906
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
You know what we mean.

907
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,720
But they definitely didn't try them on after making them.

908
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,400
No one tried them on.

909
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,340
It's a promise, and in doing this thing, you've broken a vow.

910
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:44,160
You've broken a sacred vow between me and Target.

911
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,900
Is it possible that your friend is deeply spiritual, and just wanted to be barefoot

912
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:58,240
in this Target, just to fucking feel the energy, feel God in this Target tonight, and just

913
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,200
get some of that, just get some Target in between her toes, and just fucking reconnect

914
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,280
with fucking Isaac Mizrahi.

915
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,040
Just like really reconnect with that weird dog who's died, probably, right?

916
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
Because we don't see him so much anymore.

917
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:21,160
She wants to be deeply in tune with this lamp designed by Ryan Seacrest.

918
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,760
Or hey, maybe your friend just had a cross-country flight, just needs to make some fists with

919
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
their toes.

920
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
No?

921
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Okay.

922
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,760
Die hard?

923
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
No one's seen it?

924
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,480
Yeah, no, everybody saw it, but that doesn't mean you have to, just, hey, Harry Potter,

925
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,480
you guys know that one, right?

926
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Okay.

927
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,480
See, they don't have to applaud for it, just because you said a thing, people, now.

928
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,840
Actually, I'm ready to turn a bit of a corner here, because the real monster in this question

929
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
is you.

930
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Uh-oh.

931
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Oh.

932
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
And here is why.

933
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
What?

934
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,920
You saw this happen every step of the way.

935
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,960
My brother is right.

936
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,960
He comes on very strong, but you should have interceded.

937
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:08,480
When Travis says step, he means every grimy fucking bare skin slapping against tile step.

938
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,840
You owe this target an apology.

939
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:17,040
You had so many opportunities to just tackle your friend and remove them from the target,

940
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,080
and apologize to literally every person you saw on the way out.

941
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:29,320
Okay, that was, that was convenient.

942
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:34,360
I don't control when it happens.

943
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,840
Whoa, shit.

944
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
There's a bridge.

945
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:49,320
Can I go to the bathroom, if you just want to...

946
00:42:49,320 --> 00:43:10,720
I want to munch.

947
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:18,040
I want to munch.

948
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,200
I'm talking to Munch Squad, it's a podcast.

949
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,000
It's actually, it's a show within a show that has become more popular than the show that

950
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,480
surrounds it.

951
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,760
Yeah, and normally Griffin helps with it.

952
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,960
This isn't like sad libs, where it's kind of a solo-mish.

953
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,400
Munch Squad is very collaborative, but we're going to go ahead and get started, and hopefully

954
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Griffin will listen.

955
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Just talk real slow.

956
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,600
He is, this is not a joke, gang.

957
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,680
He is peeing now at every live show he's done on this tour.

958
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,120
He really needs to get it under control.

959
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:55,040
Yeah, peeing once a day, can you believe it?

960
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,960
So I'm now subscribed... Look at my peppy boy.

961
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,800
Sorry, I mispronounced that, pee-pee boy.

962
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,560
I'm fucking 30 years old, you can't talk to me like that on a stage.

963
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,640
I'm now subscribed to QSR Magazine, that's Quick Service Restaurant Magazine, and this

964
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,520
is... Wait, hold on, they call it Quick Service

965
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Restaurant?

966
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,620
Like there's not already another- That doesn't sound good, that's not flattering.

967
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,840
There's already another term, it's called fast food.

968
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,160
Why would you call it Quick Service Restaurant?

969
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,920
I mean, fast food is very limiting.

970
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,960
If I go to Chipotle, I'm not eating fast food, I'm eating a quick service.

971
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
You are.

972
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
No.

973
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,960
You are though eating fast food.

974
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:37,960
No.

975
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
Did you hear they got queso now?

976
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,080
Well, but just a heads up.

977
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:45,360
Okay, so here's the... I don't have one of these around me, but the headline was too

978
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,640
good to pass up.

979
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:51,080
Yogurt Land's ice cream has been a hit with fans.

980
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:57,720
Hold on, wait, is this a press release or a news article?

981
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,560
This is a press release on Quick Service Magazine, industry news breaking, Yogurt Land's ice

982
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,440
cream has been a hit with fans.

983
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,340
And this is under the category menu innovations.

984
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,560
Menu innovations.

985
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,400
Beginning August 30th, Yogurt Land is giving everyone sweet tooth a reason to rejoice with

986
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,840
the limited time edition of premium chocolate and vanilla ice cream.

987
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,440
Ooh la la.

988
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I know.

989
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,440
This is very cosmopolitan.

990
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,880
This is under menu innovations.

991
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,200
The new serve yourself ice cream gives Yogurt Land fans an indulgent option to create their

992
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,120
own customized treat.

993
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,440
An indulgent option that before now has never existed.

994
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,600
Where would one even get this iced cream?

995
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:52,960
With the addition of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, Yogurt Land is providing a one

996
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,440
stop shop for all to enjoy.

997
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,720
Okay, if you've ever been with your friends and one of them's like, I want ice cream,

998
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,000
and the other one's like, I'm going to Yogurt Land, and the first one's like, oh, fuck off,

999
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
no way.

1000
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:11,680
I don't think this has happened, but anyway, Yogurt Land guests can swirl up their choice

1001
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,480
of, congratulations on finding the least appetizing wording for that, swirl up their choice of

1002
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,480
chocolate or vanilla ice cream.

1003
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,960
This is the third fucking time they've been like, oh no, just one flavor?

1004
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:27,480
No, fuck off, two flavors.

1005
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,680
One of these days the Yogurt Land people are going to find out about Neapolitan ice cream

1006
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,200
and they will instantly die.

1007
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,920
They can put toppings on it, build their own satisfying delicious masterpiece.

1008
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,280
Why are we talking about this?

1009
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,600
With over 60 toppings to choose from, like fruit, candy, cereal, nuts, cookies, and other

1010
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,600
toppings.

1011
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,240
Here's a quote from John Carlson.

1012
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,480
He's the senior vice president of marketing development and operations at Yogurt Land.

1013
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,160
He's the senior vice president of ice cream, he's just so happy to have something to do.

1014
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,800
The fucking president of ice cream was like, no, I don't want to put my name on this one.

1015
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,360
This is going to be a really stupid press release, I do not want to be involved.

1016
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,360
One of the many joys for Yogurt Land fans is to build their creation to perfectly suit

1017
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,000
their taste buds, says John Carlson.

1018
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,340
Now Froyo fanatics and ice cream lovers alike will have the chance to do so, all under one

1019
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:30,000
roof at Yogurt Land.

1020
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,020
Like how buck wild has Yogurt Land gotten that this return to the first two flavors

1021
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,240
on earth is this, it's like, all right, guys, we got to take out the old tire flavor.

1022
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,360
We've gone a little off the rails here.

1023
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:50,760
Listen, I prefer ice cream to yogurt, of course, but when have you ever been eating yogurt

1024
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:55,520
and just like sighed deeply and stared at it longingly and thought, I wish this was

1025
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,520
vanilla ice cream?

1026
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:05,680
The supposition here is that Yogurt Land has just now discovered that yes, ice cream does

1027
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,560
in fact taste better than yogurt.

1028
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,920
And also from the way they talk, it exists.

1029
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:11,920
Yeah, exactly.

1030
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,440
Like they had a meeting once and one of the people at the thing was like, we should sell

1031
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,240
ice cream, it tastes better, right?

1032
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,920
And people like it better?

1033
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,600
And they're already dumping fucking Cinnamon Toast Crunch and butter on it, so like, maybe

1034
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,600
it doesn't fucking-

1035
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,560
They've upended a gallon of sprees into it.

1036
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,360
It doesn't matter what the fucking canvas upon which they paint is.

1037
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,640
And literally all the machines we have work for both.

1038
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
They work for both.

1039
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,640
Let's-

1040
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:42,080
Shh, it's actually the same flavor, just different colors.

1041
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,480
They're gonna add a billion sprees to it, it don't matter.

1042
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,480
To matter.

1043
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,880
This is where it gets better.

1044
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,440
The majority of our guests are not exclusive to either frozen yogurt or ice cream.

1045
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,320
What are you talking about?

1046
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,200
It's kind of a dessert spectrum.

1047
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,120
So they're not exclusive to frozen yogurt or ice cream.

1048
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,120
Like, please, if you're this person-

1049
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,160
What is this fucking Dr. Seuss butterside upper world that you're trying to-

1050
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,200
Derek, what are you eating, Derek?

1051
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
I'm eating ice cream.

1052
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,200
Have you heard about yogurt?

1053
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
What?

1054
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,200
Yog- Did I say it right?

1055
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Yog-yard?

1056
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,840
And the mom busts into a kid's bedroom, are you eating yogurt in this house?

1057
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:29,600
So giving them a choice ensures that they can come to us regardless of what they desire

1058
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,400
on a particular day.

1059
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,760
Have you- Okay, listen.

1060
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:38,280
Have you ever- You don't have ice cream?

1061
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
Ice cream?

1062
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:44,600
Have you ever had a craving for one of these foods that you could actually distinguish

1063
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:58,840
between- Stop, no, wait, I have to finish.

1064
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,400
Have you ever wanted soft serve ice cream but not frozen yogurt?

1065
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,160
Like, no, I definitely do.

1066
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,880
I have a sweet cold craving.

1067
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,440
I want it to be cold.

1068
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Yeah.

1069
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,640
I do want it out of a machine where I pull a handle and it goes in the cup, but just

1070
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:19,800
not a yogurty kind of vibe.

1071
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,320
It's the cultures that really bother me.

1072
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,120
Do you mean like the deep ice cream culture and the deep yogurt cold?

1073
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,120
People get really into it.

1074
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,080
If I hear more fucking quotes from this dude saying like, there are people on earth who

1075
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,960
like ice cream and some days like yogurt, I'm gonna fucking jump off this stage.

1076
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,520
We wanted to give him as much choice as possible, so we definitely gave him chocolate or vanilla.

1077
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,520
At Yogurtland, we offer the guests an opportunity to find their own personal flavor.

1078
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,520
Our restaurant provides- As long as it's one of the two.

1079
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:57,560
This is what he says, and he really loses the plot here.

1080
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,240
Our restaurants provide a staircase of choices.

1081
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,720
What?

1082
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,080
That staircase just to simulate.

1083
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,960
Just a two-step staircase is what my brother has demonstrated.

1084
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,600
It's a staircase of choices, including non-fat and low-fat frozen yogurt, sorbets, and gelatos.

1085
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:24,240
So wait, time the fuck out.

1086
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,640
You have already introduced frozen yogurt, sorbet, and gelato, and the introduction

1087
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:34,640
of ice cream is a headline?

1088
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,760
Not only that, but has any human being ever looked at something and gone, wow, this is

1089
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,960
like a staircase of choices?

1090
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,320
His programming has broken down at this point.

1091
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,560
JonBot3000 has gone off the rails.

1092
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,320
Ice cream was the missing piece that now delivers a complete selection of frozen delights for

1093
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,800
guests to pair with our extensive topping bar to create their own unique flavor.

1094
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,120
And with this, the prophecy is complete.

1095
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,400
And now, and now, and now I die.

1096
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:17,820
No, wait, dude, Dippin' Dots, oh shit, okay, check it out.

1097
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,680
It's hard as fuck and in little, little pellets.

1098
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,680
It tastes like nothing.

1099
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,680
Guys, we found a new firmness.

1100
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:26,160
It's Dippin' Dots, it's hard as fuck.

1101
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,360
You walk into a yogurt land, it's like, what's your firmness level?

1102
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,800
It's like, nah, I'm feeling like a medium firm.

1103
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,800
All right.

1104
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Two flavors of ice cream.

1105
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,920
I like to imagine the person that wrote this story just sat at Jon Carlson as he finished

1106
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,480
these paragraphs and just kept staring at him so Jon Carlson felt like, well, I should

1107
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,600
say something else.

1108
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,800
And this is what he said next.

1109
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,200
In a traditional ice cream shop, guests must commit to a whole scoop of one flavor at a

1110
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,360
single price.

1111
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,320
I just don't know if I'm ready for that kind of commitment.

1112
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,920
At Yogurt Land, the experience is different.

1113
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,920
We encourage our guests to sample our flavors and then choose how much of each they desire

1114
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,920
and blend with their choice of toppings to create their own personal flavor.

1115
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,440
The ability to create a unique experience with each visit makes us as special as the

1116
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,720
flavors we offer.

1117
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:20,720
What should I do next?

1118
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,720
I'm so excited.

1119
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,760
And then he closes with, at Yogurt Land, you are always in control.

1120
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Shit.

1121
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,080
Now, all credit to Jon Carlson.

1122
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,040
It's 2017.

1123
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,240
I do understand the appeal, Jon.

1124
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:43,480
Thank you for having one thing in my fucking life on earth that is in fact under my control.

1125
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:48,480
I do appreciate that.

1126
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,040
That was the best person I've ever heard write words down.

1127
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,400
Because that's the kind of person that a boss sees that stuff and goes, well, at least

1128
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,400
he's bought in.

1129
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
I mean.

1130
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,280
No, that was the person who somebody walked up to them and was like, I need a 50,000 word

1131
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,960
press release about the fact that we sell two flavors of ice cream now.

1132
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,200
And he was like, shut up and watch me go.

1133
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:22,480
Well, assuming you might ask me for that, I've actually already written something up.

1134
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:29,600
Hey, everybody.

1135
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,720
This is Griffin McElroy from My Brother, My Brother and Me.

1136
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,240
Thanks for listening to the episode.

1137
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,560
Sorry that we did two live shows in a row.

1138
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:39,600
We usually try to space those out a little bit more on this feed, but this weekend kind

1139
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,080
of got away from us and we have a bunch of these in the tank now.

1140
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,760
So we thought we'd put up another one.

1141
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,200
This was our first, our early Boston show, I guess.

1142
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,200
It turned out pretty good, I thought.

1143
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,160
The late Boston show was buck wild and we'll probably be putting that one up and the Brooklyn

1144
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,840
show up eventually, but again, we're going to try and space those out a little bit more.

1145
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,840
I got some ads I want to tell you about, though.

1146
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,040
First one is for Squarespace.

1147
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,800
With Squarespace, you're going to use that platform and you're going to create yourself

1148
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,320
a beautiful website that you can use to turn your cool idea into a website or showcase

1149
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,840
your work or sell products and services of just all kinds.

1150
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:17,280
They do this by giving you the ability to customize the look and feel, settings, products

1151
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,040
and more with just a few clicks.

1152
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:25,280
It's a new way to buy domains and you can choose from over 200 different extensions

1153
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,100
and they have 24-7 award-winning customer support.

1154
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,920
It's really easy to just go make a website by yourself.

1155
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,240
If you go to mcElroyshows.com, you can check out, first of all, all of our shows and videos

1156
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,620
and projects and thank you very much, but you can also see what a website made by Squarespace

1157
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,620
looks like.

1158
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,200
It's really easy to put that one together.

1159
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,320
Check out Squarespace.com for a free trial and when you're ready to launch, use the offer

I also want to tell you about Stamps.com.

These days, you can practically get everything on demand.

1165
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,320
Why are you still going to the post office and dealing with their limited hours?

00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,920
You can get postage on demand with Stamps.com.

own computer and printer.

1170
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,620

You just go to Stamps.com.

1175
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:32,040
Before you do anything else, you want to click on the radio microphone at the top of the

1176
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,600
home page and type in MYBROTHER.

1177
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,600
That's Stamps.com.

00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,280
Never go to the post office again.

1183
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,080
Got a couple jumbotrons here.

1184
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,640
This one is for Caitlin Peterson, and it's from Ben Peterson, who says,

1185
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,400
Well, my love, we've done it.

1186
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,640
We've survived our first two years of marriage.

1187
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,080
And what better way to celebrate than with this definitely on-time message from Juice

1188
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,280
Scraps and Ditto.

1189
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,280
Or just Ditto.

1190
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,320
I can do my impression of the other two, but it will not be flattering.

1191
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,660
Thank you for cooking delicious food, knitting me kick-ass hats, and tolerating my near-daily

1192
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,040
banjo playing.

1193
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,440
You're the best nerd wife a bearded doofus could ask for.

1194
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:14,960
They wanted this on September 19th, which is tomorrow.

1195
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,640
So get off my jock, Ben.

1196
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,640
I'm just kidding.

1197
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,640
You had every reason to be on my jock.

1198
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,320
I can't believe we got this one out on time.

1199
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,920
Congratulations on your tremendous love.

1200
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,980
I got another message here.

1201
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,200
This one is for Will and Allison, and it's from Cooper, who says,

1202
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,500
Congrats on your engagement and your pending-slash-upcoming nuptials.

1203
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,420
Thank you for turning me on to the McElroy family of products, which have subsequently

1204
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,640
saved my life.

1205
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,520
You are both independently my favorite people, and with your powers combined, you will surely

1206
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,680
sit astride the world.

1207
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,760
Or at the very least be my favorite combined person.

1208
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,760
Love you, idiots.

1209
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Why'd you have to get me in there at the end?

1210
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,200
Maybe it's an affectionate nickname, but it hurt me to read it.

1211
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,100
But congrats on your engagement, Will and Allison.

1212
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,520
Thank you to everybody for tweeting about my bim bam.

1213
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,520
Use the hashtag my bim bam.

1214
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,640
This is more of the zone cast thing.

1215
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:05,600
I don't know why I'm saying it here, but we sure do appreciate you spreading the word

1216
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,600
about the show.

1217
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,700
We appreciate everybody who came out to all these live shows last weekend.

1218
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,400
It was a whole lot of fun.

1219
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,360
We're looking forward to getting down south, Nashville and Atlanta.

1220
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,720
I think there's still some tickets available.

1221
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:19,520
If you go to mcroyshows.com slash tours, it may be sold out.

1222
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,520
I don't know.

1223
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,000
I haven't been following it that closely.

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,920

That's it.

Let's get back to the episode and I'll talk to you next week.

1234
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,240

1244
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,800
Should we do more questions or should we do audience?

1245
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Audience questions.

1246
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:25,800
Yeah.

1247
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Okay.

1248
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,920
Don't line up or anything.

1249
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,400
We had a miscommunication in one of our shows and people lined up and it was very intimidating.

1250
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,400
We will call on you.

1251
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Can we get some house lights up?

1252
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,960
Does everybody know the rule for questions?

1253
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:36,960
No.

1254
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,960
Excellent.

1255
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,320
Where are the mics?

1256
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,600
And can we get even more house lights?

1257
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,600
I can't see.

1258
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,600
A little bit less us lights.

1259
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,600
There we go.

1260
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,520
I saw a person in the pink stand up.

1261
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,520
Yes.

1262
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,520
Yes.

1263
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,520
You.

1264
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,520
Yes.

1265
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,520
Come over here.

1266
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,520
Hi.

1267
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,520
What's your name?

1268
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,520
Nico.

1269
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,520
Hi, Nico.

1270
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
Hi.

1271
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,280
So, my friend eats cereal wrong.

1272
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,280
She puts cereal.

1273
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,960
I just heard a radio come on over there and I think it was a police officer who was like,

1274
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,960
be on the guard.

1275
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:07,960
Get ready.

1276
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:08,960
Okay.

1277
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,440
So, she puts cereal in one bowl.

1278
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,400
Nico, by the way, you can angle if you want to angle the mic down.

1279
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,400
There we go.

1280
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,400
Okay.

1281
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Like this?

1282
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Perfect.

1283
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,400
Cozy.

1284
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,320
The fact that you have introduced a second bowl or instrument into the equation has me

1285
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,760
scared out of my fucking mind.

1286
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,760
Okay.

1287
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,760
Yeah.

1288
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,080
She puts cereal in one bowl and then she puts milk in the other.

1289
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,880
No way.

1290
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:33,040
And then she takes the cereal and puts it in the spoon and then she takes, no, she takes

1291
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,040
milk first.

1292
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,040
Okay.

1293
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,120
And then she sprinkles some cereal in the spoon and then she eats it like this.

1294
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,120
You're kidding me.

1295
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,120
No, she doesn't.

1296
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,120
Okay.

1297
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,120
Yeah.

1298
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,080
She's doing it like dipping ramen in the Japanese style.

1299
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:47,560
No, she gets a little spoonful of milk.

1300
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
Okay.

1301
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,560
No, I get it.

1302
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,560
No, yeah.

1303
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:51,560
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1304
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:52,560
I get the process.

1305
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,560
In theory, yes.

1306
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,560
Yeah.

1307
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,560
How do I fix this?

1308
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:01,640
Well, can I tell you the one, I do kind of get it.

1309
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,800
Oh no.

1310
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,880
Because, hear me out, I'm not, well, I am a monster, but not for this.

1311
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Not a cereal monster.

1312
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,880
Yeah.

1313
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:11,880
S-E-R-I-A-L, maybe.

1314
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:12,880
Yeah, no.

1315
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:13,880
Yeah.

1316
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,880
I don't know.

1317
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,880
Because, because, because, because, because, because of the wonderful things he does.

1318
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,880
Wow.

1319
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,520
We've done a lot of those this show.

1320
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,760
Because if you like your cereal crunchy, you would not-

1321
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,760
Hold on, no, no, no.

1322
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,760
Stop the world.

1323
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,440
I just heard from 20 different sources, people say yes.

1324
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,360
Is there somebody else in this, and please don't fucking lie, is there somebody else

1325
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,680
in this audience who does that?

1326
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,680
Raise your hand.

1327
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,680
One, two, three, four.

1328
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,680
What?

1329
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,680
There's like four.

1330
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:48,120
This is a- What?

1331
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:54,560
This is like a 1,090 seat feeder, and four out of 1,090 is way too big of a concentration

1332
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,520
of people.

1333
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:02,220
I wouldn't do it, because I'm cool.

1334
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,640
You people are so cool.

1335
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,560
I'm sorry about my brother.

1336
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,440
People who raised your hand, you're cool too.

1337
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,560
I get, okay, on one hand, I get it, right?

1338
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,400
You want that crunchy bite every time, you want that feeling that just like, you know,

1339
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,000
you've got the amuse-bouche experience, or this is exactly the texture intended by the

1340
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
chef.

1341
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,080
This is kind of a deconstructed cereal.

1342
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,080
That's what it is.

1343
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:28,760
This is exactly the crunch that the captain had in mind when he presented the bite.

1344
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,760
You'll be getting notes.

1345
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,600
This is farm fresh.

1346
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:37,080
When you pour it over the crunch, you lose the umami flavor that's hidden inside of it.

1347
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,480
This time we intended it to be all berries.

1348
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:50,600
I just, these are farm- This is oops, all farm fresh berries in season.

1349
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,920
This is yes, all berries.

1350
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,920
Yes.

1351
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,920
They are berries.

1352
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,640
I understand wanting to maintain the crunch, but all I want to say is it sounds like this

1353
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:07,680
method would take you about five hours to eat a bowl of cereal, and I have adult responsibilities.

1354
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,760
I like about cereal that once you pour the milk on it, the race is on.

1355
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,600
One of the things I like, think in your head about the way you eat cereal at home, and

1356
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,840
the way you've seen people eat cereal.

1357
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:26,280
Have you ever eaten somebody who- No, you don't eat people.

1358
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:27,280
Sorry.

1359
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,520
Have you seen somebody- No, hold on a second.

1360
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,840
I got a friend who eats cereal wrong with other people.

1361
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,840
I have this weird way of eating cereal where I eat other people.

1362
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,560
That's a strange way to- When I was eating Count Chocula and Counting

1363
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:49,280
Crunch, I thought, what if this was a real count or a real count?

1364
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,240
Have you ever watched someone eat cereal who hasn't had the expression on their face of

1365
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,600
pure determination?

1366
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,040
It's just fucking you and me now.

1367
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:02,440
I know when I eat cereal, well, I used to be lying in bed in pitch blackness, trying

1368
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,400
not to wake my wife up as I just shoveled it into my face.

1369
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,200
Then I got on the Bean Life, and those days are behind me now.

1370
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,760
Cereal does demand your attention.

1371
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,760
Yeah, sure.

1372
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,840
Cereal is not something you can come back to.

1373
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,840
Right.

1374
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,880
Well, I did, oh, I just poured a bowl of cereal, but I just remembered.

1375
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,880
Right.

1376
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:27,200
This is why I used to fuck with Crispix, because Crispix was like, don't even worry about it.

1377
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,360
Same with Cracklin' Oat Bran.

1378
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,080
Cracklin' Oat Bran, you could leave for days.

1379
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:34,120
Yeah, Cracklin' Oat Bran tastes like garbage no matter when you eat it.

1380
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,040
Do we have any Cracklin' Oat Bran reps here tonight?

1381
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:39,120
We've just been naming cereals for forever.

1382
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:40,120
Did we help at all?

1383
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,280
The only cereal that actually- There's no fucking marketing.

1384
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,280
It's like you don't even eat the cereal.

1385
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,280
It all gets soggy.

1386
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,280
It all gets soggy.

1387
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
Hey.

1388
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,280
Come on.

1389
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,200
Except for Quaker Oat Squares.

1390
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Those do good.

1391
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,200
Okay.

1392
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,880
If we name one more cereal, I'm going to lose my mind.

1393
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,880
Did we help at all?

1394
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,880
Sorry, did that help?

1395
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,880
So, she's right?

1396
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
I guess, yeah.

1397
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
I would say- That's her.

1398
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:00,880
Oh, so you- No.

1399
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:01,880
I would say- I thought you said they weren't here.

1400
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:02,880
No, I didn't say anything.

1401
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,880
She's here.

1402
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,880
She's right here.

1403
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:05,880
Oh, shit.

1404
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:06,880
Oh, God.

1405
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:15,880
I think you are maybe not right, but justified.

1406
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,880
You're not right, but you're loved.

1407
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,880
How's that?

1408
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,880
Thank you so much.

1409
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:20,880
Wait, wait.

1410
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,880
Okay.

1411
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:22,880
All right.

1412
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:23,880
Now, she wants to spit.

1413
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,880
Okay.

1414
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,880
No, no, no.

1415
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,360
Please address the court.

1416
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,520
Every bite is the first bite.

1417
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,520
TM.

1418
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,520
Thank you.

1419
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:32,520
Thank you.

1420
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,520
Thank you.

1421
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
Thank you.

1422
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Thank you.

1423
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,520
Thank you.

1424
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,520
Thank you.

1425
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:38,520
Thank you.

1426
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,520
Thank you.

1427
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Thank you.

1428
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
Thank you.

1429
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
Thank you.

1430
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,520
Thank you.

1431
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,520
Thank you.

1432
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:45,520
Thank you.

1433
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,520
Thank you.

1434
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,520
Thank you.

1435
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,520
Thank you.

1436
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:49,520
Thank you.

1437
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,600
You 100% cannot trademark a way of eating cereal, but I appreciate.

1438
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
Yes.

1439
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Okay.

1440
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,600
That's a lot of hands up.

1441
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,600
Garfield, the deals wizard.

1442
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,600
Warlock.

1443
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,600
How does he do this?

1444
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah.

1445
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,600
Hello.

1446
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:01,600
But you do have to remove the mask.

1447
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:02,600
Hello, boy.

1448
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:03,600
Oh, shit.

1449
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,600
No, no, no, no.

1450
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:05,600
You can't.

1451
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,600
No, I'm just kidding.

1452
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:07,600
Okay.

1453
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,600
What's your name?

1454
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,600
Oh, God.

1455
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,600
Oh, God.

1456
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,600
Oh, God.

1457
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,640
Oh, God.

1458
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,640
I'm Anna.

1459
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,640
Hi, Anna.

1460
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,640
Hi.

1461
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,640
So, hi.

1462
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,640
My friend's back there.

1463
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,440
So, I look very young.

1464
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,240
I have been told that I'm not allowed to buy a lottery ticket, which seems ridiculous.

1465
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,440
No, that's because we're worried about you.

1466
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,820
Okay.

1467
01:06:32,820 --> 01:06:34,600
Thank you for your concern.

1468
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:39,800
And it's not especially helpful when I'm, say, at Pride and trying to talk to girls.

1469
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,800
Okay.

1470
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:45,560
So, how do I portray myself as an older person?

1471
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,560
Shit.

1472
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,680
Smoke a pipe, maybe a corduroy jacket.

1473
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:51,480
I was about to suggest, like, oh, this is easy.

1474
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,200
You just show them your license.

1475
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,320
But that only fixes the lottery ticket thing.

1476
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,240
This is not something you're probably to do, ladies.

1477
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,880
No, pleasure to meet you all.

1478
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,560
As you can see, I am from Maryland, read it and weep.

1479
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,560
How do you...

1480
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,360
How do you portray yourself as older?

1481
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,360
Try to look younger.

1482
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,360
Okay.

1483
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,360
All right.

1484
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,360
That's so...

1485
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:26,600
Can we take a moment and appreciate that that's the most insightful thing any of us have ever

1486
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,600
said in the history...

1487
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:28,600
Yeah.

1488
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,600
...of the fucking seven years we've been doing this podcast?

1489
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,600
Yeah.

1490
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,480
If you want to look like a 50-year-old uncle, you can borrow my shirt.

1491
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,480
Yeah.

1492
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,480
Options available to you.

1493
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,480
Yeah.

1494
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,480
I mean...

1495
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,600
The easiest thing to do is when someone, like, says, like, oh, you're not older, like, say,

1496
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:45,600
like, I'm flat.

1497
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,600
Thank you.

1498
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,600
Oh, you don't know how young that makes you feel.

1499
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:48,600
Thank you.

1500
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,600
I'm 32.

1501
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
Oh, thank you.

1502
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,600
You don't know how...

1503
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,600
Wait, wait, what?

1504
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,600
No shit, huh?

1505
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,600
No, no, no, no.

1506
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:55,600
I'm 18.

1507
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,600
Okay.

1508
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:57,600
Okay.

1509
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:58,600
Wait, hold on.

1510
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,600
Wait.

1511
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,600
You can't be 18 and say, I look young.

1512
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,600
You are!

1513
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,600
Jacuzzi.

1514
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:11,440
Unless they're looking at you and going, but you're a baby, what are you doing driving

1515
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:12,440
a car?

1516
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,760
No, no, the problem is that pride girls who are, like, 13 come to talk to me.

1517
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,760
That's a no-go.

1518
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,760
Okay, okay.

1519
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,760
Yes.

1520
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,760
Okay, okay.

1521
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:20,760
Yeah, the stakes are very high.

1522
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,760
I get it.

1523
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:22,760
And we're all on the same page.

1524
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:23,760
Yeah, we've all gotten there.

1525
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:24,760
That's the problem.

1526
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:25,760
Yeah, now I'm with you.

1527
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:31,000
Listen, I had this problem where people used to say that I looked way too young for my

1528
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
age.

1529
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,760
So, now the salient advice I could offer you is just wait.

1530
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:38,760
Just hang in there.

1531
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:39,760
It ain't a forever problem.

1532
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,480
Yeah, it's not a forever problem.

1533
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:43,480
This problem will resolve itself.

1534
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,480
Okay.

1535
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:45,480
All right.

1536
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:46,480
Savor this problem.

1537
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:52,600
Oh my God, grab this problem and hold it so, so close because one day you might do a podcast

1538
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,800
where a bunch of people take pictures of you on a street and then you see those pictures

1539
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,760
on Twitter and you go, I look like I'm fucking 55.

1540
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,200
What happened?

1541
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,800
Oh, my mom also is a haunted dog today.

1542
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,800
Oh, nice.

1543
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,800
That's amazing.

1544
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:07,800
Spirit orbs and everything.

1545
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,800
Wow.

1546
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,800
Thank you.

1547
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,800
That's the life form.

1548
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:11,800
That rules.

1549
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:12,800
Did we help?

1550
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,800
Does that help?

1551
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,800
Yeah.

1552
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:15,800
The tides of time will take me through this problem.

1553
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,800
There you go.

1554
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,800
Yeah, maybe make some hard life decisions.

1555
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,800
Yeah.

1556
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,800
Wait for the reaper ever patient to claim you.

1557
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,200
How about, there's people pointing to this person sitting very up front.

1558
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,200
Yes.

1559
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,200
Yes.

1560
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,200
Come on down.

1561
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:34,200
Come on up.

1562
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Yeah.

1563
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,200
Yeah.

1564
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,200
Yeah.

1565
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,200
No glasses.

1566
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,200
No glasses.

1567
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,200
There's a defining detail we gave you.

1568
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,200
You got to work your way back.

1569
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,200
There's a mic back there.

1570
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,200
Uh-oh.

1571
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,200
Wait.

1572
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,200
Fight your way through.

1573
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,200
This is your moment.

1574
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,200
All right.

1575
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Fill the time.

1576
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
Hey, that question about bathrooms was funny.

1577
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Okay.

1578
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,200
No, there's a mic over here.

1579
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,200
We're going to call on somebody more in this region.

1580
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:53,200
No.

1581
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,200
We'll come back to you.

1582
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,200
Okay.

1583
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,200
Find your way to one, but we're going to call somebody else.

1584
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,200
Oh, no.

1585
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,200
Wait.

1586
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,200
They're going to be there in three seconds.

1587
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,200
You're right.

1588
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
Okay.

1589
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,200
We will wait patiently for you.

1590
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,200
Hello.

1591
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,200
Hi, brothers.

1592
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
Hi.

1593
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,200
I also just want to say a brief apology to the people who happen to fall within the sphere

1594
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:11,000
of light of the mic who are just trying to sit there and not be noticed.

1595
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Our featured players.

1596
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I'm noticing you.

1597
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Hi.

1598
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
What's your name?

1599
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I'm Lauren.

1600
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Hi, Lauren.

1601
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Hi, Lauren.

1602
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,920
So a couple months ago for my brother's birthday, I made a terrible mistake and made him a

1603
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:32,280
Danny DeVito paper mache bust.

1604
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:36,800
Those two phrases cannot be adjacent to each other.

1605
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,560
I've made a terrible mistake and made a Danny DeVito shaped bust.

1606
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,440
Those two phrases need to be a day apart from each other.

1607
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,440
Right.

1608
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,800
I spent a lot of time with it making it.

1609
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:55,920
And hence, not a mistake, falling in love with it.

1610
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:01,820
It's just, his unblinking eyes terrify me and it really gives off a negative energy

1611
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,320
and he has it like right when you walk into his place.

1612
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,320
Ah, damn.

1613
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,960
Just fucking hanging from the ceiling like a trap it swings down into you.

1614
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,480
Kind of a Lionel Richie hello situation at this point.

1615
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,480
Right.

1616
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:14,480
Yes.

1617
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,640
How do I get over my fear of this paper man?

1618
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,120
Well, you made it.

1619
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,120
I know.

1620
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,120
Yeah.

1621
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,120
You're its creator.

1622
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,240
You know you have the right to destroy it.

1623
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
Okay.

1624
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,240
Wait.

1625
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,240
I have a very important question.

1626
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,240
Yes.

1627
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,240
Is it your brother?

1628
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:29,240
Right?

1629
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,240
I'm not Danny DeVito.

1630
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,240
Wait.

1631
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,240
What?

1632
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,240
It's my boyfriend.

1633
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:34,240
Boyfriend.

1634
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,240
Boyfriend.

1635
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
Sorry.

1636
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:40,080
Was your, is your boyfriend, was your boyfriend a fan of Danny DeVito or was it just a funny

1637
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,080
thing you did?

1638
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,080
No.

1639
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,080
He's a fan of Danny DeVito.

1640
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,080
He's here.

1641
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,080
Enough so.

1642
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,080
Okay.

1643
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:55,240
Did you know that when this paper mache bust was given to you, was this a, this was made

1644
01:11:55,240 --> 01:12:06,640
and given to me in love, so I'll display it or oh snap, Danny DeVito, I love that guy.

1645
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:07,640
Raw passion.

1646
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:08,640
Raw passion.

1647
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,640
Raw passion.

1648
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,400
The only thing to feel for Danny, um, what, what's like, uh, what's like your favorite

1649
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,400
small thing?

1650
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,840
Like if you had, like if you had, like walked into your room and there was like a little

1651
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,840
handheld thing.

1652
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
Danny DeVito.

1653
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,880
He is known to be a short man.

1654
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,880
I am not telling tales out of school.

1655
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,880
He's doing his best.

1656
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,880
To be tall?

1657
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,880
Yeah.

1658
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,880
Like a little handheld thing.

1659
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,400
If you walked in, like a favorite, like a favorite, like candy or a toy or a little

1660
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,320
gizmo or what it's, what's your, it's the fucking wildest question anybody's ever asked

1661
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:40,320
anybody.

1662
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,320
Okay.

1663
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,320
Ashtrays.

1664
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,120
So say you collect ashtrays.

1665
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,160
This is not what I wanted.

1666
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:48,520
I know where you're going with this and you've asked as a terrible thing.

1667
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,000
You do you like candy?

1668
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Do you like candy?

1669
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Yes.

1670
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Okay.

1671
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Thank you.

1672
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Bit.

1673
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Bit.

1674
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Bit.

1675
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I like bit of honey.

1676
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Okay.

1677
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Cool.

1678
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,000
I love bit of honey.

1679
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Jam a bunch of bit of honey up in that Danny DeVito.

1680
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,320
And then you walk in and he's like, oh, it sounds like it's rattling around.

1681
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,320
Yeah.

1682
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,320
Here's a big stick.

1683
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,920
And now all of a sudden.

1684
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,400
It's a Dan Yato.

1685
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,400
It's a Dan Yato.

1686
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:24,520
It's a, it's a, a poignant, probably difficult, but rewarding way to say goodbye to this nightmare.

1687
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,520
Yeah.

1688
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,920
But God, that's going to be therapeutic though.

1689
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,920
Oof.

1690
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,800
I bet by the end of it, you won't be afraid of Danny DeVito the person.

1691
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,360
And then you'll miss the bust.

1692
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:35,360
Yeah.

1693
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:36,360
I have a picture.

1694
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,360
Would you like to see it?

1695
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,360
No.

1696
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,360
Absolutely.

1697
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,360
Yeah.

1698
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:41,360
Yeah.

1699
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:50,080
Oh shit, it is really good.

1700
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:55,080
That's terrifying.

1701
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
That is really good.

1702
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,880
Can you email that to us so you can put it on Twitter for the episode?

1703
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,880
Can you do that for us?

1704
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:00,880
Thank you.

1705
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:01,880
Um, did we help?

1706
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,880
Did we help?

1707
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:09,160
Hey, that reminded me, um, happy birthday to Josh because I told someone in the line

1708
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,160
that happy birthday to Josh.

1709
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,160
Josh.

1710
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,160
Happy birthday.

1711
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,160
Happy birthday.

1712
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,160
Uh, did we help you with your Danny DeVito problem?

1713
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,160
Great.

1714
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,160
Thank you.

1715
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,160
Wait.

1716
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:22,760
Oh, uh, right here in the corner.

1717
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:23,760
Yes.

1718
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,760
Behind the water bottle.

1719
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:25,760
Yes.

1720
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,760
Please stand up.

1721
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,760
Yes.

1722
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:28,760
Yes.

1723
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:29,760
You.

1724
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,760
Yes.

1725
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,760
Come on down.

1726
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:32,760
You can leave.

1727
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,760
Oh, stunts.

1728
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,760
I hope you all signed your liability waivers.

1729
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,760
I'm good.

1730
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Thank you.

1731
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,760
Hi, what's your name?

1732
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,760
My name is Sarah.

1733
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:41,760
Sarah.

1734
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,760
Can you angle the mic back up to point at your face?

1735
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,760
Yeah.

1736
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,760
Got you.

1737
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:45,760
There we go.

1738
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:46,760
Hi.

1739
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,760
Oh, apparently I have it now.

1740
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:48,760
Oh, shit.

1741
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,760
Now it's time for your type five.

1742
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,760
So, um, I ride a lot of Ubers and to get back and forth to school and the thing is-

1743
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,760
On top like Teen Wolf?

1744
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:55,760
Yes, actually.

1745
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:02,160
And the thing is, is that, um, I tend to get a little, uh, creative when people talk to

1746
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:07,200
me and I kind of like make up a story about whatever I'm doing that day to keep it more

1747
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,200
interesting.

1748
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,200
Sure.

1749
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,200
Lying.

1750
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,200
Yeah.

1751
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,200
Yeah.

1752
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,200
You know, just keeps it fun.

1753
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,200
Um.

1754
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,200
Sure.

1755
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,200
Lying.

1756
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,200
Yeah.

1757
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,200
Just a fun lie.

1758
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:19,200
So here's the thing.

1759
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,200
Are you lying right now?

1760
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
No.

1761
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,200
Yeah, is this a lie?

1762
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:23,200
How do I know?

1763
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:24,200
I guess we're going to get to that.

1764
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,200
Okay.

1765
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,200
Um, so I got into my last Uber last week and the guy told me-

1766
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,200
Finally kicked the habit.

1767
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,200
No.

1768
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,200
Yeah.

1769
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,200
Okay.

1770
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,680
And I found, the guy was telling me how he's actually friends with a lot of the other Uber

1771
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:37,680
drivers in that area.

1772
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,680
Oh, fuck.

1773
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,680
Shit.

1774
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:40,680
Fuck.

1775
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,680
Fuck.

1776
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,680
Fuck.

1777
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:43,680
Fuck.

1778
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:44,680
Fuck.

1779
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:45,680
Fuck.

1780
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,680
Fuck.

1781
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:47,680
Fuck.

1782
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,680
So I don't know what I should do.

1783
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:52,040
Should I continue this fun little storytelling habit or?

1784
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:55,360
Storytelling again is an extremely generous way of describing this habit.

1785
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,360
Wait.

1786
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:57,360
Hold on.

1787
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,360
Wait.

1788
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,360
I was about to-

1789
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:00,360
You're not Stephen King.

1790
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,360
You are lying.

1791
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,360
The Garrison Keillor of Uber.

1792
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,440
Hey, look who I picked up.

1793
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,920
That's the old tail spinner.

1794
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,280
It's been one of their old tails.

1795
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:14,520
I have a super important further details question.

1796
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,520
Let's do it.

1797
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:16,520
These stories.

1798
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,520
Yeah.

1799
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:18,520
How outlandish are they?

1800
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,520
They're not actually that crazy.

1801
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:25,160
I'll just, you know, make up the fact that I'm going to visit some front.

1802
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
I'm going to work.

1803
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:27,160
Or I'll be like-

1804
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Good news.

1805
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,160
You're fine.

1806
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,160
You're cool.

1807
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,160
Yeah, you're fine.

1808
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,160
Those Uber drivers are not getting together.

1809
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,160
I'm like, you'll never believe.

1810
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,160
I picked up this person.

1811
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
They were going to visit a friend.

1812
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,160
Yeah, no.

1813
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:37,640
They were saying like, hey, what's up?

1814
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,640
Thanks for getting me.

1815
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:40,840
I'm going down to like 45th in Congress.

1816
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
And also when I was a kid-

1817
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,400
I mean, they get a little bit more elaborate down the line.

1818
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,200
One time I drank a swimming pool, like, oh shit.

1819
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,840
They get a little bit more elaborate as they go along, but it's like a fun ad-libs games

1820
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,840
the way that I see it.

1821
01:16:54,840 --> 01:17:00,240
One, I think we have established there's no such thing as a fun ad-libs game.

1822
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,240
That's me saying that.

1823
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:05,440
But it's like, I'm getting into a car with someone I'm never going to meet again.

1824
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,440
May as well.

1825
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:07,440
May as well lie to them.

1826
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,920
That's how I go through life.

1827
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,200
At the bank, like, yeah, here's my check that I'm depositing.

1828
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,600
One time I jumped up on top of a school bus and rode it like Teen Wolf.

1829
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,840
God, I got Teen Wolf on the brain tonight.

1830
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,840
Don't sweat it.

1831
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,840
Don't sweat it.

1832
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,840
I think you're good.

1833
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,840
You're totally cool.

1834
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:30,560
They probably appreciate the levity, I would guess, right?

1835
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,880
Maybe next time you get out of an Uber, hop out and just say like, by the way, I lied

1836
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,880
that whole time.

1837
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,880
I'm going to work.

1838
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:36,880
Now that's a story they'll tell people.

1839
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,880
That's a good story.

1840
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:38,880
It's the ultimate power play.

1841
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:39,880
Yeah.

1842
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
Exactly.

1843
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:41,880
By the way.

1844
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:42,880
Psych.

1845
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,880
Does that help?

1846
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:44,880
Yeah.

1847
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:45,880
Thank you.

1848
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,880
Excellent.

1849
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:47,880
Thank you.

1850
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:48,880
Okay.

1851
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:56,200
Someone did a phone flashlight.

1852
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,800
Don't anyone ever do that again.

1853
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,800
But this is the last time.

1854
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
The last time that'll work.

1855
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,800
Yes.

1856
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,880
It's the first time and only time anyone's ever done it.

1857
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:04,880
And it works.

1858
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
Come on down.

1859
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:06,880
The person with the phone flashlight.

1860
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,320
It does make it so I don't have to cover up the house lights.

1861
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:11,860
Oh, shit.

1862
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:14,800
Everybody in the audience apparently knows that it's your birthday.

1863
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,440
We won't sing the song because it takes forever and it's not a very good tune.

1864
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,440
But happy birthday.

1865
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,440
Thank you.

1866
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,400
Everyone sang to me before you guys came out.

1867
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Oh, good.

1868
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:27,040
By the way, also, when we came out, we said hey and high-fived a bunch of folks before

1869
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,360
the show started.

1870
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:32,560
And apparently there was a mass banana crunch that happened out there.

1871
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,480
You can cheer if you want.

1872
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:41,200
But that was, I can't imagine the sonic experience for the people eating at the Panera Bread across

1873
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,200
the street.

1874
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,200
What's your name?

1875
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:44,200
Charlie.

1876
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,200
I tried.

1877
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,640
A lot of Charlie fans in the audience, two nights.

1878
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,240
So I'm a college student.

1879
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,680
I live like up the block.

1880
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,680
It's great, isn't it?

1881
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,680
Oh, college.

1882
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,680
So good.

1883
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:57,680
It's the best.

1884
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,760
Stop rubbing it in, Charlie.

1885
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:05,160
So I live with some suitemates this year and I moved in before them.

1886
01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:06,160
That's one of them.

1887
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,240
Holy shit.

1888
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:13,760
And as a fun little joke, I found this toddler's bike in one of the trash rooms in my dorm

1889
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,000
and I put it under someone's bed.

1890
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,920
Wait, there's, wait, yeah, hold on.

1891
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:23,760
You jumped over the interesting, the like spooky part there, which was.

1892
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,960
Yeah.

1893
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,920
So there's this trash room in school and there was like-

1894
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:28,920
Get that.

1895
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,920
Uh-huh.

1896
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:35,600
Someone, there was like, uh, not toddlers, but it's a high school musical small bike

1897
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,720
and it's pink and it's got Barbie on it also.

1898
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:41,640
But it's not toddlers.

1899
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,640
It's for small children.

1900
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
Okay.

1901
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,640
Okay.

1902
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:45,640
Okay.

1903
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,640
I'm with you.

1904
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
I'm with you.

1905
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,760
So I thought it would be real funny to just like leave it there and then like I just throw

1906
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,560
it out when someone found it.

1907
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,560
Yeah.

1908
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,160
But now it's like a part of where we live.

1909
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:56,960
Have they not discovered it?

1910
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:01,160
They have and they love it.

1911
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,160
What's the problem?

1912
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,160
Yeah.

1913
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,160
Cause now it's part of-

1914
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,200
You gave someone a gift is what that's called.

1915
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,200
Yeah.

1916
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,200
Yeah.

1917
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,200
What's the issue?

1918
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,200
We live in a very small dorm.

1919
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,280
I was about to say, I have an issue with it and that is like, where are you going to put

1920
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,720
this kid's bike?

1921
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:20,600
I live in a house I bought and I still don't have room for a kid's bike somewhere.

1922
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,600
Sorry Henry.

1923
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,440
It's nine months old.

1924
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:29,840
So where do you, what should you, is it worth the memories and the goof to keep this very

1925
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,880
inconvenient bicycle somewhere in your house?

1926
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:34,840
I have asked to get rid of it a few times and they say no.

1927
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:35,840
You got to pay it forward.

1928
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,840
You got to sneak it back out.

1929
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:41,060
The problem is you're going to need an alibi.

1930
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:44,560
The only problem is the only place you can put it is apparently the trash room and they're

1931
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,440
going to know right where the fuck to find it.

1932
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:49,240
Oh, maybe that's what, that's the cycle.

1933
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,000
That's the cycle.

1934
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,480
Tell them that you know they love the bike, but it's someone else's turn to love the bike,

1935
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,320
so you have to return it from whence it came.

1936
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,040
Let me ask you a question because I had a good idea.

1937
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:00,840
Do you, oh, we have additional details?

1938
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:01,840
Okay.

1939
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,840
Hold on one second.

1940
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:05,440
I love, this is the show of, well let me chime in here.

1941
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:06,440
Let me, hold on.

1942
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,440
Let me take a swing at it.

1943
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:08,440
You fucked up.

1944
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,440
I got this.

1945
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,440
What's your name?

1946
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,440
Sarah.

1947
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,440
Hi Sarah.

1948
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,440
And you know Charlie, right?

1949
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,240
Like this isn't just like, all right Charlie, you're done.

1950
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,240
My question.

1951
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:18,240
I also have a bike story.

1952
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,560
We are sweet mates.

1953
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,640
I have seen the bike firsthand.

1954
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,560
It is beautiful.

1955
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,560
Thank you.

1956
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:25,560
Okay, okay.

1957
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,560
Now this check is at everything.

1958
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:27,560
Wait, no, no, wait.

1959
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:32,160
Is there more to the... Yeah, it has two flat tires.

1960
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:37,880
Well, I wasn't... Oh, so you can't ride it.

1961
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,880
Well.

1962
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,880
No, I get why.

1963
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,320
It answers my question, which is why did somebody throw this bike away, and I think it's because

1964
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,680
they got to your school, and they were like, fuck this junk.

1965
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:50,800
Okay, so here was my question.

1966
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:55,120
Does your school have an art department?

1967
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:56,120
It is an art school.

1968
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,120
It's an art school.

1969
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,120
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1970
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:05,600
Are you... There's a Barbie toddler bike in the treasure of course it's an art school.

1971
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,560
Don't kid yourself.

1972
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:12,520
Can you commission a painting of this bike?

1973
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:13,880
Oh shit.

1974
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,760
You changed the number of dimensions in which the bike is available.

1975
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:18,760
Exactly.

1976
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:23,440
It was previously a three-dimensional... Paintings don't got kickstands unless they're on an

1977
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,000
easel, which is kind of like a kickstand for a painting.

1978
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
You solved this.

1979
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Yeah, I did.

1980
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah, I know.

1981
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I was very excited about it.

1982
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Let's go out on a high.

1983
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Yeah.

1984
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Do we help?

1985
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Yes, so much.

1986
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Thank you.

1987
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:43,840
All right, we have to wrap up because we are doing another show in like an hour, and that's

1988
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,560
wild to me.

1989
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:49,840
That show's going to suck compared to this one.

1990
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:55,440
Unless some of you bought tickets to both, in which case it will be just as good.

1991
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:00,720
It is, I should warn you though, all the same jokes, so sorry in advance.

1992
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,880
Please come back and ask your bike question again.

1993
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,000
I want to let everyone know, we have posters out in the lobby.

1994
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,720
If you haven't checked them out, they are beautiful.

1995
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,720
Oh, thanks to Kevin Budnick for designing them.

1996
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,720
Yeah, Kevin Budnick did those, and they're great.

1997
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:20,760
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song, It's Departure.

1998
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,640
Thank you to Paul who has helped us this entire tour.

1999
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,640
It's so, so, so much.

2000
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:26,640
Thank you, Paul.

2001
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,640
Thank you, Paul.

2002
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,640
Thank you to the Wilbur.

2003
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,640
This is Wilbur's beautiful place.

2004
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,640
Thank you to the Wilbur.

2005
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:35,640
Again, we've done two very good shows here now, and that means a lot.

2006
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,640
Thank you, Wilbur.

2007
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,640
You know what?

2008
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:38,640
Thank you, Boston.

2009
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,640
Thanks, Boston.

2010
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,640
All right.

2011
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,440
Now, every week on My Brother, My Brother and Me, Griffin gives us the last question

2012
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:50,760
that we ruminate on and then revisit the next week.

2013
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,520
Griffin, what is that question this time?

2014
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,400
I'm very excited for the discussion next week on this topic.

2015
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,400
Oh, wait.

2016
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,040
I should mention, we are...

2017
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,040
We will not be able to...

2018
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,520
Yeah, we can't hang out after the show.

2019
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,520
Sorry.

2020
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,520
Because we have to do another one.

2021
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,520
There's literally no way that time...

2022
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:06,520
That's how time works.

2023
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,220
But we met a bunch of you before the show, and you were all super cool, so thanks for

2024
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:11,200
shaking our hands and high-fiving with us.

2025
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,200
You're the best.

2026
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,200
Okay.

2027
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:19,120
A lot of you had sticky banana fingers from the bananas you crunched, and I will never

2028
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,120
forgive you.

2029
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:23,040
So, this was sent in by the delivery man, Seth Carlson.

2030
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,040
Thank you, Seth.

2031
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,920
Finally, God, it's from Yahoo Answers user, Curtis.

2032
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,080
We've been waiting for Curtis to hear his thoughts.

2033
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:39,160
Curtis asks, if you die on an operating table but come back to life, is your birthday changed?

2034
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:44,520
My name is Justin McElroy.

2035
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:45,520
I'm Travis McElroy.

2036
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,520
I'm Griffin McElroy.

2037
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,520
This has been My Brother, My Brother, Meek.

2038
01:24:47,520 --> 01:25:17,440
Is your dad square on the lips?

2039
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:41,440
Yes, he is.
