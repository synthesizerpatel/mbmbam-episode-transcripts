1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,720
Isn't it rich?

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,760
Are we a pair?

3
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Me here at last on the ground and you in midair.

4
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,360
Where are the clouds?

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:01:02,280
Isn't it bliss? Don't you approve?

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:11,160
One who keeps staring around and one who can't move.

7
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,560
Where are the clouds?

8
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,720
There ought to be clouds.

9
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,640
Just when I stopped opening doors.

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,440
Finally knowing the one that I wanted was yours.

11
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:44,840
Making my entrance again with my usual flair.

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:54,920
Sure of my lies, no one is there.

13
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:05,880
Don't you love a farce?

14
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
It's my fault I fear.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:20,320
I thought that you wanted me to have a voice, I'm sorry, my dear.

16
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Where are the clouds?

17
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Sending the clouds.

18
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Don't bother.

19
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,320
They are here.

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Isn't it rich?

21
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Is the corpse one of the clowns?

22
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Is that what he's saying?

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Losing my timing this late in my career.

24
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Where are the clouds?

25
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,320
There ought to be clouds.

26
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Well, maybe.

27
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Oh?

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Next year.

29
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Oh.

30
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,320
Well, you got me so excited for clowns.

31
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,320
And it's always next year with the songs.

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Yeah.

33
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
And here they are.

34
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
Enjoy.

35
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
All right.

36
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Now, this is never a note I've given someone after a funeral, Justin.

37
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Kind of milking it.

38
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Kind of milking it.

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Making a real meal out of it.

40
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Good note.

41
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Good note.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
Thank you.

43
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:05,320
And welcome, everyone, to My Brother, My Brother, Me, and Advice Show for the modern era, episode 420, Funeral for a Fiend.

44
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
My name is Justin McElroy, and I'm your oldest brother.

45
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm Travis Big Dog Wolf Wolf McElroy, and just quick note, it's his friend there, Justin, Funeral for a Fiend.

46
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
My mistake.

47
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,320
That's my mistake.

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I'm looking at the, this is Griffin, I'm looking now at the website.

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:34,320
And I'm reading some things that people have written about, let's just say, current events that aren't in the best taste.

50
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,320
And so I'm over here like, let me dunk on them like a brave internet warrior, and I go to click the answer button.

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Let me do it again and again.

52
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:55,320
Yeah, it's grayed out because that function is no longer available to us as of today, April the 20th, the funny weed day.

53
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,320
But there's nothing funny today because I can't answer on Yahoo Answers.

54
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
So what is it now?

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Is it just Yahoo Readums?

56
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Nobody can smoke any of their weed today because it's all soaked with tears.

57
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
It won't light.

58
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:18,320
A lot of people have wanted us to do this episode for a long time, and we've told them there's nothing very funny about weed.

59
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
This website does suck though.

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,320
I just logged on to the one that Griffin's prompting.

61
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,320
I was about to get pretty maudlin, and then I just logged onto the front page.

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,320
It's a bad website that will not be this.

63
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I've never gone to Yahoo Answers in all this time.

64
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Don't start now, baby.

65
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Maybe check it out in like 2011.

66
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,320
But if I don't start now, Justin, when would I start?

67
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Okay, let's see.

68
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Answers.yahoo.com, read-only mode.

69
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
This is not an endorsement.

70
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I wouldn't.

71
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
It's not a great time.

72
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:01,320
It's a lot of people who are like, let me get all up on and be the last one to turn the light out and say the worst shit so that it'll be sort of the epitaph.

73
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
This episode is the epitaph for Yahoo Answers.

74
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Yeah.

75
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
We've done the media.

76
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
We've been doing media about it.

77
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I wrote a piece for Esquire about it.

78
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I went on to ABC News Radio.

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Yes, I went on to ABC News Radio.

80
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
There was a New York Times piece that talked to me about it.

81
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,320
I wrote a feature for Le Monde, but you probably didn't read that because it was French.

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Do you read Le Monde?

83
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:35,320
And this 15-year-old website's dead, and I've been in a genuine stupor since the news hit.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,320
My son was born, and then a day later, my website died.

85
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Oh, so I see what you're saying, Griffin.

86
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
He's the reincarnation of Yahoo Answers.

87
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:52,320
If it had been flipped one day, it would have been so – like, the soul would have left Yahoo Answers and inhabited the son, but that's not possible.

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Well, Chelsea, everyone knows that babies don't get souls until their second day.

89
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Come on, dude.

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Yeah, that's true.

91
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
That's fine.

92
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Oh, boy.

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,320
So we're just – I guess we're just free-forming it.

94
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,320
It's a tragic thing for – I mean, for us, because the content –

95
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
For us.

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,320
The content will be more difficult to produce, categorically.

97
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,320
This was half the show.

98
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,320
On a good day, half the show.

99
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Yeah.

100
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
And some might say the good half.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Good half of it.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,320
No, you know, we'll find a way to patch this quilt together.

103
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,320
I want to say – let's take it all the way back to the beginning of this relationship,

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,320
because when we started My Brother, My Brother and Me, it was April of 2010, so it's been –

105
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Right.

106
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,320
11.

107
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,320
11 years, almost exactly.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,320
And we didn't even note that particular anniversary.

109
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Such a wild time it's been.

110
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:58,320
But it was April 2010, and I had hosted the Joystick Podcast before this, and we had a nice following of great people from that,

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:06,320
but we were worried it wouldn't be enough to have a consistent base of questions for our advice show that we had cooked up.

112
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,320
So I think it was Griffin hit on the idea of including answering questions from Yahoo Answers to give advice to those people.

113
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:22,320
And it has been pretty much a consistent split between Yahoo and our listeners since the beginning, since the jump.

114
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,320
It has been there with us through different hosts.

115
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
It's been there with us through different music.

116
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,320
It's been there with us through different cities that we've lived in, through live shows and at-home recordings.

117
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Yeah.

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Through all three Travis's.

119
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Yeah, all the Travis's.

120
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,320
Yeah, they keep dying.

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Well, what are you going to do, you know?

122
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Well, just stop the lifestyle that you're –

123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I did just want to say I was reading the Wiki page for Yahoo Answers, which date of birth, June 28, 2005.

124
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,320
And it's in so many different languages.

125
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
I didn't even know that.

126
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
And it says dissolved for May 2021 in 13 days' time, it says.

127
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,320
So now Wikipedia has a death clock.

128
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
But the thing that really hit me is down under in popular media.

129
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:25,320
It says the comedy advice podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me features a recurring segment in which co-host Griffin McElroy selects and reads a particularly humorous or outrageous question from Yahoo Answers.

130
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,320
The hosts then discuss and attempt to answer the question to comedic effect.

131
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
First of all, thank you, Wikipedia.

132
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,320
Second of all, there's a link here.

133
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:39,320
And you know how it has like the numeric references at the bottom of the page of the Wikipedia article?

134
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:45,320
The sentence here, we have the 69th reference link here.

135
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:53,320
And it's just – it's not like God's real and he's here in Yahoo Answers.

136
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
And that's Wikipedia page I guess is all I'm trying to say.

137
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Can I just say that I think that even beyond content, I think we owe a certain life debt to Yahoo Answers for unlocking within the three of us our shared love of both ghosts and horses.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Yeah, sure.

139
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I think we never would have come to that if it weren't for Yahoo Answers.

140
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:25,320
So we're trying to find a way to fill in this hole in our heart, which is bad to have in your heart.

141
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Like I've talked to doctors about it because I felt like a literal hole has been punched in my heart by the evil corporate guys at Yahoo or whatever sort of corporate company owns Yahoo at this point.

142
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
I haven't followed it very closely.

143
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
It was pretty mean of them to make this decision just to hurt you, Griffin.

144
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm sorry about that.

145
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It sucks.

146
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I don't know why they –

147
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Yeah, and really robbed me of all the joy of my new baby, but that's something I'm working – that's my cross to bear, right?

148
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,320
They probably didn't know that.

149
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Do you regret naming your baby Yahoo Junior now?

150
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,320
I regret naming him Yahoo Answers forever jokes because it wasn't true.

151
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
We got 15 years.

152
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
I got a Yahoo.

153
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
I got a Yahoo for you.

154
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
What?

155
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Do you?

156
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Yeah, I've always wanted to try it.

157
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
Oh, sure, sure.

158
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I've always wanted to try one.

159
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Yeah.

160
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,320
This is going to be my last chance.

161
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Yahoo Answers is shutting down today as we're recording this, 4-20.

162
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Not shutting down.

163
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Shutting down.

164
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
It's no longer accepting new.

165
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Read only.

166
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Read only.

167
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I do not understand the period where you're like, I just need a little while to soak it in before you pull the plug.

168
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Yeah.

169
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Reading is one of my top two favorite things to do on Yahoo Answers.

170
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
But this was posted two days ago.

171
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Yeah.

172
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Does anyone know what's going on with legendary actor Danny Glover?

173
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I haven't heard anything about him in a while.

174
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm getting kind of worried.

175
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Yeah, I don't know.

176
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I don't know Yahoo.

177
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
And you know what sucks?

178
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
You know what sucks, guys?

179
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
What?

180
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll fucking never know.

181
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Yeah.

182
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
You'll never know.

183
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Where am I supposed to get that from?

184
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Do you know what I mean?

185
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Yeah.

186
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,320
The first answer is there are no legends that I'm aware of that make mention of Danny Glover.

187
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Well, bullshit.

188
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
That's not true.

189
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Second answer, Google his name.

190
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
And while you're at it, Google Mel Gibson, too.

191
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Haven't heard anything about him for a while.

192
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
That's actually fine.

193
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
That's all fine.

194
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320
We're okay with that.

195
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Yeah.

196
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
And then lastly, from question mark, he's still filming movies.

197
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Okay.

198
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
All right.

199
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
But see, that's what I'm saying.

200
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
See what we're going to lose out on.

201
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
No more of this?

202
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Question mark like Indiana Jones reached in under the closing door.

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Yeah.

204
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
He saw the hat of truth there and was like, he's still in movies.

205
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
He grabbed it and then it slammed behind him.

206
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
And there's no more.

207
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Where are we supposed to get answers from?

208
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Do you know what I mean?

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Yeah.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah.

211
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
Like when you get it from Google, it's like a-

212
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,320
It's cold and heartless.

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,320
It's a robot giving it to you.

214
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah.

215
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,320
A robot, not only a robot, a robot looks at some of the different answers and then picks

216
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
the best, most relevant-

217
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Picks the one it likes best.

218
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Thanks, robot.

219
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Yeah.

220
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,320
No, thank you.

221
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
If I wanted actual information, I'd go to the fucking library.

222
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Right.

223
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Exactly.

224
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Exactly.

225
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Pull out the Encyclopedia Britannica.

226
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,840
I want the human connection that Yahoo- I felt closer to the Yahoo Answers user than I

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,320
do to my own children.

228
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Yeah.

229
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
I met my wife on Yahoo Answers.

230
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
A lot of people don't know that.

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Yeah.

232
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
It's true.

233
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
I've been staring.

234
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Griffin asked, who am I going to marry?

235
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
And Yahoo said, Rachel.

236
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah.

237
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I've looked at this website for many years.

238
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Many, many years.

239
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,800
I'm just now kind of looking at it, and we have some Yahoo warriors that have been knee-deep

240
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
in here.

241
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
Yeah.

242
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
Sure.

243
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,940
And seeing the content on this website, I am at this point having a bad feeling that

244
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,880
we should not have let people do that.

245
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
No.

247
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,240
We shouldn't have let people spend that much time down in the mines, as it were.

249
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:16,000
But now, first of all, they did a tremendous service, and my Yahoo warriors are very precious

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
to me.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Precious.

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Precious people.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,600
But also, they are broken now, and they're walking out of so many Chilean miners coming

254
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,680
out of the shaft.

255
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,920
Only they've been down there for 11 years, and they don't know how to live a normal

256
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
life anymore.

257
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,760
They're going to be the people in the Western who are like, people don't sling guns anymore.

258
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,280
I don't know what to do with myself.

259
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,200
I guess I'll buy eight cows and live a quiet life, and they're like, we've got one more

260
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,520
Yahoo answer that needs taking care of.

261
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
No, but they don't.

262
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
They don't miss.

263
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
That's the thing.

264
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,160
The problem is, what is happening to our Yahoo Answers warriors now is that they are so hurt,

265
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,880
let's be honest, by their service, and yet, when the website is gone, they'll still be

266
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,640
chasing that hide.

267
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
That's what I'm worried about.

268
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,760
Where are they going to turn to now?

269
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
Quora?

270
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,200
People keep saying Quora.

271
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,440
Everybody listen to this.

272
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,760
Everybody listen with your listening ears right now.

273
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
Hey, guys, I've got a Quora here.

274
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,200
That's fucking nothing.

275
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
It's nothing.

276
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
No.

277
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
It's nothing.

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,520
And there's probably some good stuff on there.

279
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,280
We just have to find a new name for the segment.

280
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:37,400
It's not a replacement, and it kind of is insulting that you would say that, Travis.

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Yeah.

282
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,320
No, I'm not saying I'm worried that that's where they'll turn to get their cats.

283
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
To get their eye.

284
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Yeah.

285
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Yeah.

286
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,320
There's also some other problems with Quora, which I've never visited but am now.

287
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
There's ads on it.

288
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
What?

289
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,520
You guys are trying to make money?

290
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
Where's the purity?

291
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
You know what I mean?

292
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,800
Yahoo Answers was so smart in that they never made any money off of it at all.

293
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Never monetized.

294
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Exactly.

295
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
Yeah.

296
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,200
So, like, when somebody asks a question like, how are NBA ratings since having gone woke?

297
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,240
Like, I know that business and corporation, it won't put its finger on the scale.

298
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,280
Do you know what I mean?

299
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Yep.

300
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:30,200
I do have a concept for how we can keep the torch, the torches of Gondor lit just a little

301
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,160
bit longer, and it's not a forever solution for this.

302
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,000
That will only happen when we've raised the capital to buy the Yahoo Answers service.

303
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,880
I don't think they're going to give it to us piecemeal, so we will need to also raise

304
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,480
the capital to buy Yahoo, which is not out of the question, but I have a little temporary

305
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,960
solve for this.

306
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
Okay.

307
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,200
And I'm curious what you hear about it.

308
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:06,720
There is a trove of good Yahoos that we have not discussed at all.

309
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,600
In fact, there's over 500 of them.

310
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Wow.

311
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,440
And it's a segment, I don't have a name for the segment yet.

312
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,880
Maybe it's like coming out of the slow cooker, pop them out the crock pot, because now we've

313
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:28,840
had, for some of these bad boys, 11 years to ruminate on them.

314
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,080
What is the source of these, Griffin?

315
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm saying we return to, as we've promised, the final Yahoo Answers.

316
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,880
Oh my god.

317
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Are you-

318
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, so these are the final Yahoo Answers.

319
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,220
Oh shit.

320
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,440
Maybe that's it.

321
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,960
The final- and when these are done, we can do the- we are now at the halfway point of

322
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,000
my brother and my brother and me, because once we've run out of Yahoos in the past,

323
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
then that's it.

324
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,880
But if we do one in app, and we just go back and we check back in-

325
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,560
We're at like 5.56 right now.

326
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,600
That's roughly 5.55 Yahoo Answers.

327
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,280
I think we've missed one or two.

328
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,240
And I guess there's probably 100 or so on there that we wouldn't feel great about revisiting

329
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,900
at this point in our lives and careers, if I can guess.

330
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,160
Can we demo this?

331
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Can we sample this?

332
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,240
Because I've pulled a few here.

333
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,840
And I don't know if we-

334
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
How far back you gone?

335
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Yeah, are you on sequential?

336
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Or are you-

337
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,200
Well, for this demo, right now I got the box in demo mode, because I pulled up like 20

338
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
from the whole span of the thing.

339
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,360
Oh, so we'll only hear like the first 30 seconds?

340
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Right.

341
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,320
And it'll be like a Yahoo, Yahoo, Yahoo, Yahoo.

342
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,320
Exactly.

343
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,720
The audio word mark.

344
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,400
Just to sample it, right?

345
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,240
Here's one, and this is from episode, let's see.

346
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Episode 55.

347
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
That's spaghetti-

348
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,240
Spaghetti-getting.

349
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Spaghetti-getting.

350
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Yeah.

351
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
The final Yahoo on that one.

352
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,320
I'm bored.

353
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,420
What do you do for fun?

354
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,880
It is raining out also, and I am an old man.

355
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
I feel like we can have fun.

356
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Do you know what I mean?

357
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Still good.

358
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,400
We got that laugh.

359
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,960
That laugh we just got of, what a funny thing.

360
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
We got that.

361
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
I don't want to milk that again.

362
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,120
We didn't have the courage at that point to say like, well, hold on, let's answer.

363
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
Well, hold on.

364
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,320
What does an old man do on a rainy day?

365
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
To have fun.

366
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Not just what does he do?

367
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:28,680
Because he can't do something sort of challenging or sort of artistically rewarding that's not

368
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
particularly fun.

369
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,760
He wants to have fun on a rainy day.

370
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,240
He could re-watch The Mandalorian.

371
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
Yeah.

372
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
That's true.

373
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Yeah.

374
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,240
That's good.

375
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,780
I mean, this question was asked in 2011, so well before The Mandalorian came out.

376
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,360
Now we have the wisdom to say, hey, old man, Disney Plus is here, and it's got all the

377
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,480
great content that you crave, like the Falcon and the Winterman.

378
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,880
And it's got Mandalorian, and it's got Yoda's kids.

379
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,520
Well, maybe, oh, oh.

380
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,240
This is an aspect we've never dealt with before is the time travel of Yahoo Answers.

381
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,280
Perhaps he was so bored, he went on to write The Mandalorian.

382
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh, that's great.

383
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
He created The Mandalorian.

384
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah.

385
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
You don't know.

386
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
You know what I just did with my kids?

387
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:17,560
We got some markers and paper, and drew all over some sheets of paper, and then I folded

388
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,920
them into airplanes, and it made some real fun designs.

389
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,360
That's cool.

390
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,200
That's a cool thing that he could do with your kids.

391
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,840
And that's another thing that we can come back to is like now.

392
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,400
So what I'm saying is watch my kids.

393
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
Right.

394
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Yeah, watch my kids, old man.

395
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,160
But we also now, we're dads of six together.

396
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Oh, God.

397
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Yeah, collectively.

398
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,080
Together we have fucking six of them, y'all.

399
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,960
Yeah, so we know a lot now that we didn't know back in episode 129 when we closed things

400
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,400
out with, is it bad to give my six-month-year-old baby a little French onion dip?

401
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,280
I tell you now, no.

402
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,760
If that kid will eat it, it's great.

403
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,760
Six months, yeah.

404
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,760
I think that's probably fine.

405
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,880
Don't give it to him on a Frito scoop.

406
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
No.

407
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
Because baby-

408
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,400
And it's just a little bit.

409
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Don't, okay.

410
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,560
You could probably get away with giving it to him on like a regular Frito, but a Frito

411
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
scoop is far too robust.

412
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
Too crunch.

413
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
No.

414
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,720
Too firm a crunch for those gumless guys.

415
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,560
I think if you soaked the Frito scoop for about three seconds, not much, you don't want

416
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,680
it to be soggy or you're not going to get the dip, you know what I mean?

417
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,360
Right, you want the baby to have a good time.

418
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Right.

419
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
Right?

420
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
He's the Frito scoop that he's just chock-a-block full.

421
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
It's a fucking Super Bowl party.

422
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
Yeah, sure.

423
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
Like, come on.

424
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't want to use up too many of these because it is now a finite resource, but I did want

425
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,160
to mention one.

426
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,360
I got a big kick on this when I was returning to these to like reference some for this media

427
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,120
stuff we've been doing.

428
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,160
I found a few that are in an interesting sub-genre of we were the dummies.

429
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,920
Yeah, that's fun.

430
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,920
That's a fun one.

431
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,680
Here's one that I discovered that I enjoyed.

432
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,720
Can you get a tattoo while breastfeeding?

433
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Oh.

434
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,640
Which, at the time, which is January 28, 2013, we thought, boy, that is a crack up.

435
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,640
Now, us fathers of six think, oh, you mean, is it safe to get a tattoo during the period

436
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
that you're still breastfeeding your child?

437
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Oh, that's right.

438
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Yeah.

439
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Yeah.

440
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
But we would have taken it then as concurrently.

441
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, exactly.

442
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Okay.

443
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
While actively breastfeeding.

444
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,960
Achieving that, by the way, probably, yes, it's safe to do basically everything while

445
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,120
you breastfeed except, you know, high speed stunts.

446
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,400
Well, it depends on where you're getting the tattoo.

447
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Well that's-

448
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,240
Like you wouldn't want to get a nipple tattoo while the baby's right there.

449
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,840
Here's what I would say to you, Travis, is don't get a tattoo anywhere you wouldn't breastfeed.

450
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,320
That is what I would say there.

451
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,760
No, I'm talking about fit like on your body, Jameon, not like where you're going to.

452
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,140
I'm saying keep the needle nowhere near the baby and you could be actively breastfeeding

453
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,280
and getting a tattoo at the same time.

454
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,720
I don't think that a person who's sort of invested in their own happiness is going to

455
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,120
get a nipple tattoo during the period that they are breastfeeding their child.

456
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,720
That doesn't seem like a recipe for happiness.

457
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm not going to tell people what to do with their bodies, maybe that's their thing.

458
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,920
I mean, you're right.

459
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:21,080
The very first final Yahoo I did was can birds get allergies and like-

460
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
Can they?

461
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,080
Maybe.

462
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
I don't know.

463
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,400
That's not as ridiculous.

464
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,920
No, it's still a funny idea to me.

465
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,440
Yeah, it is kind of funny because it's like, what are you going to do about it?

466
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
You know what I mean?

467
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
A lot of illuminati-

468
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
A picture of a bird sneezing.

469
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
A lot of illuminati-based ones.

470
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,440
A lot of illuminati.

471
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I'm going through it.

472
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,160
What's funny is that you could pick any one thing out of this list and do a search on

473
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,400
the page and find three about spaghetti, three about Kenny Rogers, four or five about Dakota

474
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Fanning.

475
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Right.

476
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
There's plenty.

477
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Oh, yeah.

478
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,400
There is a couple about Kenny Rogers, huh?

479
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Yeah.

480
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,400
Chris Gaines.

481
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,400
For sure.

482
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
A lot of Chris Gaines stuff.

483
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
For sure it's going to be in there.

484
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah.

485
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Sorry.

486
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,400
There's also some of them that we can't really circle back to because they don't provide

487
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,880
much of a launchpad for healthy conversation.

488
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,680
Like for instance, episode 336.

489
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,640
You are all asshole.

490
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
That's all that that one is.

491
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,040
And I don't know that we can turn that into a good five minutes of content.

492
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,160
Because the rest of that was I will now destroy the website in a few years.

493
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
Goodbye.

494
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,200
I feel like that's the kind of thing though now we're a little bit more mature and we've

495
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,560
dealt with some stuff.

496
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,560
We could maybe reach out to that person and just see how it's going.

497
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,320
Maybe change the direction of the show, make it about mending some fences.

498
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
Yeah.

499
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
It's a good.

500
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,080
No, I don't ever want to talk to anybody who's unironically used this website before.

501
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
No, that's fair.

502
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
That's fair.

503
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Especially they call me an asshole.

504
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah.

505
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
That's not nice.

506
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
True.

507
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,080
I hurt my feelings.

508
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I mean, is that our answer to this?

509
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Because we're going to have to like-

510
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
It's an answer.

511
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
We're going to have to have more answers.

512
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
It feels like stalling.

513
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Yes.

514
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
Yeah.

515
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
I think I'm going to need to bring back Riddle Me Piss and play along at home and Sad Libs

516
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
and stuff to fill the gaps.

517
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
You know what I mean?

518
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
For sure.

519
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,240
They were on hiatus for about a week and a half and I think it's time to bring them back.

520
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,700
Maybe even more.

521
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,240
Maybe like two Sad Libs an episode or something just to fill the time.

522
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:22,520
Griffin you might have to come up with bits.

523
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:28,200
And I know that that's scary and hard and trust me, I know most of them are going to

524
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,680
be clunkers at first, Griffin, but eventually you might find something like Work of Fart

525
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
that really works.

526
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Yeah.

527
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,560
I mean, people love Work of Fart so bad.

528
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah.

529
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:46,560
So you might need to start generating something like Celebrity Wine Wine Not like Justin has

530
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,040
or something like that.

531
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,880
But right now, Griffin, just spitball what's a bit that you could do, fill in, that would

532
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,400
be as good as Yahoo Answers as far as generating content for the show.

533
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:05,520
Yeah, I could do one about how two guys' songs sound the same.

534
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,040
I could do one about Big Burgers.

535
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Yeah.

536
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,800
I could do one where it's like quizzes for our friends.

537
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,400
And quizzes for our friends is a good jumping off point.

538
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:27,800
I could do one where I do a trick, like a visually a trick that...

539
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,440
Like magic or stunt?

540
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,760
It could be either one as long as it's cool to see.

541
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
Or both.

542
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,640
Well, what I would do is I would post a video alongside of each episode of me doing a trick.

543
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:45,640
Can you imagine if Tony Hawk ramped a sick jump and while he was in the air pulled something

544
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
out of a hat?

545
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,640
That'd be good.

546
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
That'd be fucking cool.

547
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
And that's a great idea for a segment, Travis.

548
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,840
I could just say a cool thing that would have happened.

549
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Like it would be cool.

550
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,480
Yeah, just call it picture this.

551
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
Yeah.

552
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,840
Wouldn't it be cool if Space Jam 2 came out tomorrow?

553
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,520
That could be the segment of just like, wouldn't it be great if...

554
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,840
Well, I can't picture that though, Griffin.

555
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,320
What would that look like?

556
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
You know what I mean?

557
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,040
Yeah, it's just a concept.

558
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,120
I think, and let's just have this discussion.

559
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,640
I know which way it's going to go, but should we cancel My Brother, My Brother, Me?

560
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,640
Should we put it?

561
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Should we put it?

562
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,640
Because here's the thing.

563
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:29,880
There's something very, very, very, very, very scrumptious about Yahoo Answers ending

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,280
and we do episode 420 and it's the end of My Brother, My Brother, Me.

565
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,440
Folks, the way the last couple months have gone, I am afraid to have the conversation

566
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,680
because you know how we love to do things for the lulz that turn into doing it for the

567
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:54,640
serious that turn into big loss of revenue for the McElroy family ad hoc, also writ large.

568
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Anyone who knows me will tell you that it takes very little convincing for me to not

569
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
work.

570
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
Right?

571
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,640
Yeah.

572
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
It's the easiest thing.

573
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,320
Someone's like, I don't know how, and I'm like, oh, we don't have to.

574
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,040
People think that podcasting for a living is the easiest thing in the world and there's

575
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,960
one thing easier than podcasting.

576
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
It's not podcasting.

577
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Yeah.

578
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Yeah.

579
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,840
And listen, I love the image.

580
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,840
I'm listening.

581
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,640
My Brother, I'm on pins and needles over here, I'm dialed in.

582
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,560
The scene is this.

583
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:29,240
They are lowering Yahoo Answers' casket into the ground, starting I guess today and ending

584
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
on May 4th.

585
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
It's a slow lowering.

586
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
Slow process.

587
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
Slow process.

588
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,640
Are beating our breast.

589
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,680
We are grief stricken and we throw ourselves into the open grave on top of the casket and

590
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,820
we yell, bury us too.

591
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,920
Bury us alongside it.

592
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:49,400
We are the favored cats and possessions of the pharaoh that is Yahoo Answers.

593
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,040
Bury me with my funny, which is what I call Yahoo Answers.

594
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,520
I'm not saying it's a good idea, but I just had a baby.

595
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,760
And I, you know, I rely on this show to support my family.

596
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,080
But there's something that makes kind of a lot of sense about this.

597
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
Yeah.

598
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
This is feeling more right.

599
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,080
It's good symmetry.

600
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
The more we.

601
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,800
I mean, let's say this.

602
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,160
At the very least, I think we got to end this episode on a cliffhanger because we have not

603
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,160
had a season finale cliffhanger for so long.

604
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,280
I feel like we're due one where it's like a cliffhanger.

605
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,280
You know what I mean?

606
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Yeah.

607
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,920
Well, we got listen, we got two weeks before the site absolutely goes away.

608
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Yeah.

609
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,920
You know what I mean?

610
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
So I don't know.

611
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm trying to get an Empire Records thing.

612
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Is that that?

613
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
What's that move?

614
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Is that what the movie's called?

615
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,440
The one with the with Renee Zellweger?

616
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,840
Yeah.

617
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,880
And they have to do a rock concert to save Empire Records at the end.

618
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,880
I've tried to get going.

619
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,960
I mean, I'm not really on so sheep, so I've just been kind of just trying to mentally

620
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,360
project it out there like the secret that I want there to be a Let's Save Yahoo Answers

621
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,520
thing out in the Internet.

622
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,880
Whether it's a big music festival, that would be irresponsible to do right now.

623
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
But you know what I'm saying?

624
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,880
And nobody has gotten excited about that.

625
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:24,160
But if we chain ourselves to this heavy, drowning weight of Yahoo Answers and say, we'll die

626
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,480
too, now will you save it?

627
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,040
I think that maybe that would get some ground swell going.

628
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,920
I am prepared to chain myself to Yahoo Answers.

629
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,760
I am worried about putting out the one...

630
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,120
Kind of thought you guys would go along with me a little bit on that one.

631
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
My worry...

632
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm starting to second guess again because...

633
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I'm already chained.

634
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Why did you wait until after I chained myself?

635
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Please.

636
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,320
I am a little worried about putting out into the universe that it's a season finale cliffhanger

637
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:12,000
you know, because we may not get across the board the response we're hoping for.

638
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,720
Yeah, that's a risk, isn't it?

639
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,960
That is the risk.

640
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Maybe some folks that go, well, guess it's time.

641
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,760
No, just check this out.

642
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,320
I chained myself to Yahoo Answers, but not so that I will be dragged down to hell where

643
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,440
Yahoo Answers is definitely going to go.

644
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
No question.

645
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:48,440
Rather, to keep Yahoo Answers moored to my mighty dock, and I won't let it go.

646
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,440
And I don't know what that means.

647
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,280
Oh, so you've chained Yahoo to you.

648
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Right.

649
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,200
It's not going fucking anywhere.

650
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,240
So I guess...

651
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
And I don't know what that means.

652
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,240
Shit.

653
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,880
I had just started to go towards acceptance, but now I am trending right back towards denial.

654
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,240
And that feels right to me because I feel happier.

655
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,160
What's the biggest flash drive you have, Griffin?

656
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
Can you download...

657
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
I got one right here.

658
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,160
This is...

659
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
Yeah, just download Yahoo Answers onto it?

660
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,080
I got an SD card here with 32.

661
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,080
That's probably...

662
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Oh, I think that'll do it.

663
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,440
It's just words, right?

664
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,640
That is the fun thing about this.

665
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,520
I wanted to mention about Yahoo Answers, which will be shut down for good on May 4th.

666
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
What?

667
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Yeah, I know.

668
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,280
Here's what's something wild to think about is this site is just text.

669
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:47,360
I mean, it's just text, and it probably is like one billionth of the storage capacity

670
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,600
required to keep YouTube running, right?

671
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,640
It's just the tiniest little bit of data in the grand scheme of things.

672
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,320
And Yahoo Answers is like, yeah, we just can't afford to...

673
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,240
Is it that Yahoo?

674
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,360
Or maybe would you kind of be happier brand-wise from a holistic brand perspective if people

675
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,360
didn't like...

676
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,040
Every time you mentioned Yahoo, people are like, oh, you mean the garbage?

677
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
No, no, no.

678
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,800
It's not that anymore.

679
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,460
It's good now.

680
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,560
Now it's good because we got rid of that one thing.

681
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:29,640
I don't want to belabor this remembrance because if we remember too hard, we'll remember the

682
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,560
bad times too.

683
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,840
I'm not about that right now.

684
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
That's what the Bible says.

685
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,080
That's what the Bible says to do or not to do.

686
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,440
I just want to say I love you, Yahoo, and thank you for everything you've done for me

687
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,960
and my career and this show.

688
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:58,480
You were a bad website that was propagated by bad people whose terrible work was sifted

689
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,680
through by some of the finest people who's ever lived in the world.

690
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,620
We may replace the time slot for you on this show.

691
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,320
We will have to or else the show will become shorter and our advertisers will have a word

692
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,620
to say with us about that.

693
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:26,640
But you will not be replaced in our hearts and our souls.

694
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm going to miss Yahoo Answers and I'm pretty sorry to see you go.

695
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,960
You were a really great generator material even though a lot of people, man, it was almost

696
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,800
as bad as the haunted doll thing for a while.

697
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,240
People loved Chomp That Flavor.

698
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,600
Now, the flavor had been out there from before us.

699
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,320
We didn't invent or discover Yahoo Answers that would have fit on our cap.

700
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
That would have been.

701
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Exactly.

702
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
But I am going to miss it.

703
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,000
I feel like it's an essential part of the DNA of this program and I feel like it's a

704
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
new day dawning.

705
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,360
But it's a period of renewal.

706
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,480
That's what we can hope for.

707
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,160
Maybe something about crypto we could take a-

708
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
Awesome.

709
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,160
Yeah.

710
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Oh, that's great.

711
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
Some sort of cool crypto update.

712
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
That could be cool.

713
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
When you tell people you want to-

714
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
Oh, boy.

715
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
The pipes, the pipes are calling.

716
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,120
I think this is what Travis wanted to open up the show with and he just wanted to make

717
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,160
sure that we didn't get to the-

718
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,360
Let's just let him go.

719
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
This is appropriate.

720
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Then we'll fade it out.

721
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
Thanks for listening, everybody.

722
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
We'll be back with a regular episode.

723
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,640
If you can even call any of our episodes from now on, Travis, can you turn it down just

724
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,880
a little bit?

725
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,680
If you can even call any of our episodes from now on regular.

726
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Thanks to me and Travis for our theme music and thanks to you for listening and I'm looking

727
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,160
forward to seeing you again soon.

728
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
It'll be different us.

729
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,240
Maybe a little bit more world weary, but we'll be back.

730
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,520
Definitely sadder.

731
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:53,440
Blushed and white with snow, tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow.

732
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,640
Travis, can you fade yourself out?

733
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,840
I would love to hear you do that sort of organically.

734
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:17,480
Oh, boy, I love you so much.
