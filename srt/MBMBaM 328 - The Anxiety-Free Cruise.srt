1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a new phrase, and good girls do you want it?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Just say, hey, I want it.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just say, hey, I want it.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello everybody, and welcome to the island.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Justin Island boy.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
McElroy here.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wait, hold on.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let me just, I have prepared this for you.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let me get it finished stirring it up.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll get that mint out of there.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Perfect.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've prepared you this mojito.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please take it.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Take a sip.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Make sure the mint's not too pronounced.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Sometimes my muddling gets away from me.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm still Justin McElroy by the way.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hi there, I am Travis hammock time.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
McElroy stop hammock time.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Take a little nap here.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've strung this hammock up over the cool white sand between these two palm trees.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can just slightly hear the crackle of a bonfire down the beach.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We're getting some roast pork ready for you.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But for right now, you just take a little nap here.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hi, I'm Griffin, coconut bra, McElroy.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And hey, where'd my plate with a nice fresh sandwich on it go?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, it looks like a couple little hermit crabs got it and scuttling down the beach.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's okay, little dudes.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can keep that one.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Just listen to that fucking tide roll in.

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So soft.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Welcome to our super chill, anxiety free oasis.

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Welcome to my brother, my brother, me island.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A place where you can get away from it all for an hour and just fucking chill.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's a lot going on in all of our lives right now.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And I mean everybody.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Some people are having babies.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Some people are about to have babies.

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's election stuff going on.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, man.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, excuse me.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm Gary.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And it looks to me like you brought some anxiety into the anxiety free episode.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So I'm gonna need you to put that in this basket.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're just gonna push it on down the river.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There's a river and a beach.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So put that right in here now.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Visualize it floating away.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Listen, I know you got some stress from freak out juice in there too.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I need you to just barf all that up right here in this basket and down the river.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It goes.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And where do the baskets end up?

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a mystery that will never solve.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's like lost season five.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A gator just ate my anxiety.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Does that make me feel better or worse?

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Feel bad for the gator.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, defo.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's the anxiety.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's the anxiety gator.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He's got the weight of a nation's woes upon his show.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
His scaly shoulders.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's a fucking hero.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, champion.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And we're not going to dwell on him though.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't look at the anxiety gator.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not your problem anymore.

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Welcome to this super chill episode of My Brother My Brother and Me.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's going to be so relaxing.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to do a Jimmy Buffett tune later.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, that'll be nice.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yeah, I think that'll be really nice.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That'll be up a little later in the show.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want to know more about Gary.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've got a kite museum.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A museum all full of kites?

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah, they're all my kites.

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I bought them.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, that's great, Gary.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Nobody's going to try to take them from you soon.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I know they won't because that would give me anxiety.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And that's against the law here.

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Is it just a room full of store-bought kites, Gary?

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, I did some decor on some of them.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Cut little holes in fun shapes.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now they don't fly so much anymore, but that's okay.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
These aren't flying kites.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
These are display kites.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You don't have any fighter kites like Doug Plenty's dad made?

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're right.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't have...

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
See?

100
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Damn it, Justin.

101
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't have those.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Damn it, Justin.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll get you one later so don't even worry about it.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh, nice.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That was close.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We'll get to our music a little later.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We got a lot of fun, easygoing questions for you.

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's just going to be a real chill episode here at the island.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So kick back, relax.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm going to routinely just smell my baby's head.

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Just smell that baby's head.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Take me away.

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Take me away.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So here's our first question.

115
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I go to college and my school has a shuttle system to help us get around the campus.

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's not real efficient, but it beats walking around late at night.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Tonight was really busy with lots of people getting on and off and I made the mistake of sitting in the very back.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The shuttle driver forgot about me and general social nervousness has stopped me from speaking up.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now the shuttle driver parked and went into a Popeye's.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I presume to pick up his dinner and he has left me sitting in the Popeye's parking lot.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I am locked in and oh my God, I have no idea what to do.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do I politely cough when he comes back?

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do I wait until other people come on and then leave with them?

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please help me.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This has gone on for far too long and I'm terrified I'll become the shuttle ghost.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please help my God help meek and marooned in Maryland.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And there's a postscript.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
P.S. this is not the first time this has happened, but last time it was just with the McDonald's drive through.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This may be the most lose lose scenario.

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Like lose lose lose lose lose lose scenario I've ever.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know if it's that I'm just a little bit like sleep deprived.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know what to tell you.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, first of all, the good news is you're at Popeye's.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So you can go in there and you can get some of that good chicken.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Also another sort of follow up question here is your bus driver Elliot Kalin?

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Cause if so, just like hang out with him.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ask him the good things to get. He's got the good records.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh I have an idea. I have an idea.

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Move up to the front seat of the shuttle and be waiting patiently.

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And when he comes back just say, did you grab those biscuits for me?

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And now it's on him. Now he's forgotten a whole interaction he had.

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Can you imagine Travis? You are this shuttle bus driver.

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The end of a long shift dropping off ungrateful college users.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And then finally dropped them all off.

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Time to lock this baby up and go in for my favorite part of my whole week.

146
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My Popeye's chicken meal.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
My doctor says I can only have one Popeye's chicken meal per month or else I'll instantly die.

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I'm really going to savor it.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So you get it and you have it and you savor it.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then you go and you open up the bus that you think is empty.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And some smart aleck is just like, hey where's my...

152
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You would have a lot to feed the anxiety gator after that particular run.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What do you do? Do you cough in the back and he turns around and just throws his Popeye's at you?

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm coming up with solutions and none of them...

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The problem I keep coming up against is this.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you alert him to your presence, he's going to feel obligated to drive you somewhere.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And his food is going to get cold.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And that's no good.

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And he's going to resist that.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm worried about you indirectly murdering this man.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That the shuttle driver is going to come back and you're going to go ahem.

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's just going to die.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yeah, he'll die.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's my main point of concern right now is how do you not kill this hardworking Popeye's man.

165
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here's an option.

166
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When he returns to the van or it's a shuttle.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When he returns to the shuttle, just stand up very slowly in the back and start slow clapping.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And then when he's like, excuse me, you say congratulations.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And he'll be like, what?

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And you'll say, well, I am a secret writer.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I am paid by the shuttle company.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've been evaluating your performance all day and you have done one hell of a job in all my years.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I've not seen better service in a shuttle driver.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So congratulations.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm going to be telling HQ if you could just drop me off at HQ, which looks like a dorm, very much like a dorm at your leisure.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Feel free to enjoy your chicken.

177
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You've earned it.

178
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But if you could just do that for me, I'm so proud of you and you've done such a wonderful job.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't.

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I've decided that this person might like shuttle ghost is the appropriate thing because you live in that shuttle now.

181
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But you do other people.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Other people, though, if you find yourself in this scenario, I would say that this is one of the few scenarios I can think of that out like outreaches anxiety and social anxiety.

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have to say something before it gets to this point.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Like you have like if you're the last one on the bus, you could just say, like, drop me off anywhere.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't wait until you're already parked and locked in the shuttle at the Baba's.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It might be too late.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I yeah, maybe too late for you.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I take Umbridge with the post script of this bus driver driving their bus through a McDonald's drive through.

190
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Because if I was working a drive through and I saw a fucking bus pull up to the to the, you know, the burger zone, I would just throw myself in the deep fryer.

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There is no way I want to handle an order that convoluted for everybody on the bus.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you think it was the same shuttle driver both times?

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But if you're like a ham, they're like, damn it again.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
God, they've still been on the shuttle. They haven't figured out a way to get get off yet.

195
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Can I read you a food related who?

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, is that like a who? Yeah, because it's got an exclamation point.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We don't always we don't always enunciate that.

198
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So I'm thinking we just sort of backload.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We make the word bottom heavy a little bit more and just pick Yahoo.

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's in its fucking death throes. And I just wanted I want to party with Yahoo before it's gone.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mm hmm. This one was sent in by Pete Carl to maybe the second.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But like he specifically mentions in the email that he wants to be called PK to which is a very good name.

203
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And also very kind of drug.

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thank you, BK to it's by Yahoo answers user.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, it loaded for a second.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sarah Sarah asks, How old do you have to be to eat out at a restaurant?

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
My friends and I, six of us in total are planning to go out to the mall.

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are restaurants in the mall and we're wondering if we're allowed to go out to eat at legit places.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
For example, Lazy Dog Cafe Bistro.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I hope there's not an actual place on Earth called Cafe Bistro.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's crazy. We're all we're all 13 years old.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If we can't go to restaurants like stated above, does anyone know what sort of places we could possibly go to?

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now, I know you're hearing this and you think, Griffin, this is a stupid question.

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is a stupid question for dumb people.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But there's a right answer to it in there.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Because if you're a host or a hostess at an outback steakhouse and a fleet of six year olds walks in.

217
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How's that going to how's that going to shape up?

218
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How's that particular encounter going to break down?

219
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel like it's interesting to me because had they said it's me and one friend, I would have said 13 is too young.

220
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But for some reason, six 13.

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm wondering if there's some kind of like conglomerate age rule of thumb that if your combined age is older than 75 but younger than 200, that group of people is allowed to go to that thing.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It has never been my experience that the more tweens in a flock, the better socially it is for everybody else around.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I guess as a patron of the restaurant, if I looked over and saw two 13 year olds having a meal together, it would be weird.

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But if I see six of them, I'm like, oh, they're celebrating something.

225
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Maybe if you see two 13 year olds eating together, they're filming a scene for Boy Meets World at the end.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Or they just got out of their first date at Prince of Egypt and they were just wowed by a beautiful historic tale with music by the Osmonds.

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And they just wanted to get, you know, a blooming onion and then maybe go home and see what happens.

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Prince of Egypt has inspired me, honey.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's go home and see what happens.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So it's six 13 year olds looking for a place to eat?

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Let's abstract it.

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're the host of the Olive Garden.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Justin, I know this is a fucking dream for you.

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Finally, I rose up.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Rose up the ranks.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are a host of Olive Garden.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And let's stick with two because I like the idea of it being two of them.

238
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We have important things to discuss.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm just going to say a number and we'll walk it up, okay?

240
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Two five year olds walk in and they're like, spaghetti please.

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Spaghetti pizza.

242
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That makes my night.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going to be on the nightly news, I think.

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In the local news, like, you'll never believe it.

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
These two five year olds had a spaghetti date.

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can definitely say, like Disney has taught me, that the gap between two dogs coming in for spaghetti and five year olds, I definitely don't allow between that, though.

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're either two dogs or five years old.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's obviously adorable, right?

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a fucking business.

250
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is a place of business.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And they're unaccompanied?

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
They are unaccompanied.

253
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
These are just two five year olds.

254
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Pa-scappy peas.

255
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you want spaghetti and peas or are you just like, do you have money?

256
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Like, you guys are not as concerned about these two five year olds as I am.

257
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
How did you get here?

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How are you getting home?

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Griffin, I just don't know how I would look them in their tiny eyeballs and turn them on.

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Go away.

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go away hungry five year olds.

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Here's a handful of Andy's mints.

264
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Never come back to the Olive Garden.

265
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay, then let's walk it up.

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ten year olds.

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Two ten year olds.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Hard no from Travis.

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hard no.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're turning them away?

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Not without parents.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What if they just got off work?

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They just want to relax.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah.

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's a good point.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't know.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
They can't go see a James Bond movie by themselves.

281
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't know if they could eat by themselves.

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You will need to cut their-

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm definitely going to need to see the green.

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're going to need to flash that wad before I let them in.

285
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
But that's discrimination now.

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's going to be hard.

287
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Okay, I'm rethinking the five year olds.

288
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Okay, thank you, C.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What if they're like, I'll have the Thai peanut noodles, please.

290
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And you say, do you have a peanut allergy?

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And they say, I have absolutely no idea.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's find out together.

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm a real bad ass five year old with a leather jacket, by the way.

294
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you know the number that makes the big ambulances come?

295
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Just in case I do have an adverse reaction to the peanuts.

296
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Do you know the big, they're big loud scary cars

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and they put sick people into them to go to the Hopsiddle.

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Is that right?

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Am I saying that correctly?

300
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've written down here just a list of all of my food allergies

301
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
just to make sure there's no confusion.

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is just like a squiggle, yes.

303
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, that's exactly right.

304
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't see the issue here.

305
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Do you take American Express?

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh, and I had an oopsie, if you could send someone out.

307
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I did have a Duke.

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And also, this is very important, I did see a fire truck today.

309
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
So excellent.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Thank you very much.

311
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll await my dish.

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I will need you to cut it up for me.

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What if two 150 year olds just sort of slug slop their way,

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
their skin masks in through the door,

315
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
leaving a trail of just spume behind them.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Two fit nurses bring them in in wheelbarrows,

317
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
just dump them onto the chair.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Just sort of filling the wheelbarrows with their self crud,

319
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and they say,

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Be secretly pleased.

321
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Travis, this one's for you.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Would you sit these two 150 year old wheelbarrow people?

323
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I would, Griffin, but not together.

324
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I would find them like a table with an empty seat,

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
two tables, I guess, with an empty seat each.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And I would just kind of force a Tuesdays with Maury kind of scenario.

327
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, for a five year old to one 150 year old.

328
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I liked the scene in Tuesdays with Maury,

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
where the small boy had to dump the spaghetti onto the 150 year old Maury man,

330
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and then he just sort of, he sort of sat there and he, Mitch described,

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,000
in graphic detail, how the spaghetti sort of just sort of formed into his 150 year old sloppy body.

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It just kind of was engulfed by his skin bag,

333
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
and it just kind of was Maury at that point.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Excuse me, waiter.

335
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When you bring the spaghetti, could you bring a lot of it in a small pool?

336
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes, I believe it's the Patch Adams.

337
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I hate to go off menu, but it's my life dream to sweat.

338
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Could you serve that?

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
A swimming pool full of noodles?

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
And the five year old leans over and says, I'll have what he's having.

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah, that's good.

342
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You guys hear that?

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I didn't.

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I actually didn't.

345
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, because my Skype is breaking up pretty bad right now.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I just hear like three seconds of silence.

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, it's weird.

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, that's so strange.

349
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I want a much!

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Squad!

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want too much!

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Squad!

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Squad!

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

355
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This is the anxiety free fucking island party zone, Travis.

356
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's go all in.

357
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't yell, it would wake my baby up.

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's causing me anxiety.

359
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Squad!

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There it is.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I said it with a smile.

362
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Is that better?

363
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A little bit.

364
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can tell that you want to hear the difference?

365
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Squad!

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Squad!

367
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Justin, what violent delights do you have for us this week?

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, who's, first I should say, who's hungry?

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I actually kind of am right now, but I bet that's not going to last.

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's not going to impact this.

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is it going to be a fucking kids pool full of spaghetti that a 150 year old man can just

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
kind of like slop around in?

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No, but slop's the right word because we're headed over to Carl Junior's or Hardee's

374
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
depending on where you are.

375
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And we're just going to keep on driving.

376
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We're going to pull in and we are going to order the Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger.

377
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No.

378
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No.

379
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Do you know, do you know how when you have Budweiser and cheese, you think, good.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
But when I washed one down with the other, I really liked that combo.

381
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, good news.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hardee's is there for you.

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like this is the equivalent of like it's a fresh new salad, but we washed it with toilet

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
water.

385
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do you know how they're known for pioneering in the quick service restaurant industry by

386
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
regularly releasing creatively charged industry first premium burger offerings?

387
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Well, according to this press release, they have done it again with the Budweiser beer

388
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
cheese bacon burger.

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Now, this is served on a brioche style premium bun.

390
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Brioche style bun, not brioche, but there's something in that style.

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
As inspired by the artist formerly known as brioche.

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's so far from brioche, we can't legally call it brioche.

393
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We'd really have the bread boys breathing down our neck if we tried to pull that shit

394
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
again.

395
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But do not sweat it.

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It is premium as fuck.

397
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is a primo fake brioche.

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This is the same like fast food restaurant that like put potato chips and a hot dog on

399
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
a hamburger, right?

400
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
They'll put fucking anything on a hamburger.

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah, they're crazy.

402
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
At Hardee's.

403
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But listen, this is a new burger with, and this is piled high with thick cut applewood

404
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
smoked bacon.

405
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Nobody knows still what applewood is and what that does to the flavor of the bacon, but

406
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
it is applewood and it's got Swiss cheese on it, but the cheese don't stop there.

407
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's topped with Budweiser beer cheese.

408
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Why did they double cheese this one?

409
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Can I ask who the chef was on this project?

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah.

411
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Who ate this without cheese and was like, not cheesy enough.

412
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah.

413
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But it's a hot and creamy cheddar cheese sauce blended with the classic taste of America's

414
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
number one full flavored lager.

415
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So when you drink Budweiser and think that getting drunk is fine, but I'm really here

416
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
for the flavor.

417
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I wish it was in a non-alcoholic cheese.

418
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
They've got you covered.

419
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Are you sure that the cheese, first of all, I'm still obsessed with this layer of Swiss

420
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and its purpose.

421
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I think it might be load bearing.

422
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I think it may be a low-carb layer of Swiss.

423
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It sounds like they had another burger laying around and they're like, okay, we'll just

424
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
serve this.

425
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, we've already served them.

426
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Are you sure, Justin, it's non-alcoholic cheese?

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Positive it is non-alcoholic cheese.

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That would really turn this whole thing around for me.

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:52,000
There is one situation in which Budweiser is your choice and it is when you are at some

430
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
sort of tailgating party and that's it and you don't want to be there and you want to

431
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
just sort of have like a cool friend in your hand.

432
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I actually think that's the Budweiser slogan, your choice of beer when you didn't get to

433
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
choose the beer that would be there.

434
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It is football happening and you didn't really get a say in it, have your cool friend in

435
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
your hand.

436
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But by the way, this version of it, there's no alcohol.

437
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So what are you fucking doing?

438
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And it's cheese.

439
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I got Brad Haley on the line.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And it's cheese.

441
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You can't even drink it.

442
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
And also it's cheese this time.

443
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I got Brad Haley on the line.

444
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
He's the chief marketing officer.

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What's he sound like, I wonder?

446
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Carl.

447
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Our new Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger combines the best of what we do with Budweiser

448
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
beer cheese sauce.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Applewood smoked bacon and caramelized onions on the char-broiled grass fed all natural

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
beef patty.

451
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It really is a beer and burger lovers dream come true.

452
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Hey, beer and burger lovers, dream bigger here.

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hey, hey guys, can you dream bigger for me?

454
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Can you do that for me?

455
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Burger and beer lovers.

456
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You're dreaming of Budweiser and fast food cheese on your burgers and beer?

457
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Here's what I want.

458
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Here's a dream I have.

459
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This will be a fun, crazy, weird, like a hamburger stout.

460
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's crazy.

461
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
That's a dream.

462
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
A burger that it sounds like maybe someone actually spilled some beer on and then it

463
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
sat long enough for it to no longer be alcoholic.

464
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
It's maybe not the dream I have.

465
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I don't know of any beer lover that's like, you know what, my dream, like if I could just

466
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
have Budweiser but not, not alcoholic and in cheese form.

467
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Now.

468
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
That's my dream.

469
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now.

470
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is there more quotes?

471
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Are there more tasty quotes?

472
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Because I have an idea.

473
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
It is being promoted with a documentary style new ad campaign.

474
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
No, fuck that.

475
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
See, this is my idea.

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Fuck that ad campaign.

477
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Okay.

478
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I think instead of doing the patented Carl's commercial, that's basically just like a,

479
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you know, a woman on a car and the burger is getting just all over.

480
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Same vein, but control F find Jessica Simpson, control R replace with one of the Budweiser

481
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
horses, one of those Clydesdales and this Clydesdale is up on a Ferrari and he is just

482
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
smashing this fucking thing to pieces cause he weighs two tons and he is not supposed

483
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
to be up there.

484
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But also he is just, he is just ruined with this beer cheese just all over him.

485
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And he's enjoying, I think he would enjoy the burger, but there is no way like he is

486
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
just slopping and he just like smashed a hoof through the windshield and is freaking the

487
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
fuck out.

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Yeah.

489
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
And then the last second of the commercial they cut to the Budweiser frogs and they're

490
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
like, now we're horny.

491
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah.

492
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That makes some sense.

493
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And then they fuck right there.

494
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And they have a baby and then they lay eggs and then out of the eggs emerges the Carl

495
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Jr. slash Hardee's Budweiser beer cheese bacon burger.

496
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Loving it.

497
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
And then the three frogs are on the car and they're eating the burger, but the hot cheese

498
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
falls on them and burns them to death.

499
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And they say, what a decadent, decadent way to die.

500
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
They take turns saying the words in it.

501
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I should have mentioned that Josh Halpern, who's the vice president of small format

502
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
and on premise for Anheuser-Busch was complimenting the Carl Jr. and Hardee's partnership.

503
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And he says, Carl Jr. and Hardee's are known for pushing boundaries and they truly share

504
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Anheuser-Busch's commitment to quality ingredients and authenticity.

505
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Could we leave some boundary?

506
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Did we, when we started pushing boundaries, did anybody stop for a second to think what's

507
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
on the fucking outside of those boundaries?

508
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And maybe we put those boundaries up for good reason.

509
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I have put some weird shit on a sandwich and no one's ever been like, no one's ever

510
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
said that Travis, he sure does push boundaries.

511
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They've just said that Travis, he sure has made some sandwich monstrosities in his time.

512
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
He's a human wreck.

513
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean, not anymore.

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Now I'm someone's father.

515
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah.

516
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Can we do a quick question?

517
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I think we've got time for one more quick question from the Money Zone, yeah?

518
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Yes, please.

519
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I own several calf high socks as a result of various circumstances.

520
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
However, as a big boy, my calf high socks quickly become very uncomfortable ankle socks.

521
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I get to the bottom of my sock drawer and I start wondering if garters can be everyday

522
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
wear.

523
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
How do I ensure maximum ankle comfort?

524
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
And that's from trying not to have a cow over my calves in Montana.

525
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I'm curious what everybody's sock choices are because I have evolved several times in

526
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
my life and I'm curious where you're all at.

527
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
And now you were into those tall, tall gold toe shits for a while.

528
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Used to be into that.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Then I got into like the sneaky ones that are real small and peep just above the shoes.

530
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Shh, shh, shh.

531
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Hello.

532
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Don't tell.

533
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Don't you tell.

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Tell you what I love.

535
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Black ankle socks.

536
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
They're like black.

537
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
They're like your traditional white sock, only black.

538
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
They go with nothing.

539
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah.

540
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
But they also don't ever get dingy and gross looking.

541
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I fucking got a subscription to foot cardigan, not a sponsor of the show, just a proud member

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
of their community.

543
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Every month I get a fun new sock pattern.

544
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'm like rip Taylor down there now every day.

545
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
But when it's time for something a little bit more serious, I have a 16 pack, a very

546
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
short, very sexy Puma socks that Rachel got me at Costco and I'll wear those and they

547
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
breathe.

548
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And then if I have to like leave the office and go to the basketball court, it's just

549
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
an all day thing.

550
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
It's an all day wear.

551
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I bought a bunch of dark socks right before we filmed our show because Maximum Thorn, Maximum

552
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Fun founder.

553
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I am Maximum Thorn.

554
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Maximum Thorn.

555
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Maximum Fun founder and style guru, Jesse Thorn, told me, quote, I don't want to be

556
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
on TV wearing white socks.

557
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,000
So I bought a bunch of dark socks because that had not even injured my, I had no idea,

558
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I guess, the white socks.

559
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
And I'll tell you the fun thing about starting to wear dark socks more is like they probably

560
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
look the best when you're wearing that outfit.

561
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
They're the least durable, I think, style wise.

562
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
You took one article of clothing away and you are a disaster.

563
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
This is true.

564
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You switch to shorts because it gets a little hot.

565
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oops, you're a mess.

566
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You're a total wreck.

567
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I really, I have a few pairs of the fancier patterned socks like Griffin described and

568
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I love them.

569
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I love them so very much.

570
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,000
But my chosen footwear is cowboy boots and it feels weird to have that kind of flashiness

571
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and no one can see it.

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It just feels like the most narcissistic sock choice to put on a flashy, like I have a pair

573
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I got from Loot Crate, not a sponsor of the show, just a big fan, that are Sonic the Hedgehog

574
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
themed with rings all the way up.

575
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Oh, well, don't wear those.

576
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And when I wear those.

577
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No, don't wear those.

578
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Don't wear those.

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But that's just a secret for me.

580
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But that's just a secret for me.

581
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
But now everybody knows, Travis, I'm going to assume you're always wearing them.

582
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
In my mind, when I picture you holding my beautiful new niece, you're wearing those

583
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
fucking socks and I can't take you seriously.

584
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm someone's father and I accidentally wore a pair of Deadpool socks to the NICU because

585
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
it was what I grabbed out in the dark out of the drawer.

586
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Now no one could see them because I was wearing long pants, but I knew, I knew I was someone's

587
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
father holding, wearing, holding a baby, wearing some Deadpool socks.

588
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Maybe also I wore the Sonic socks on a different day, but that was on purpose so I could have

589
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
my own little Sonic secret just for me.

590
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Did somebody else at the hospital look over and like look at your feet and look at you

591
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
holding a small human life and then you looked at them and smiled and just said, gotta go

592
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
fast, chili dogs.

593
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
And then I slammed with my free hand, because one hand had the baby, I just slammed the

594
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
chili dog in one, like one mouthful with my left hand.

595
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And then Dr. Robotnik came in and turned all the babies into bad robots.

596
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And then you had to fight them all off.

597
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Man I love that little blue bastard.

598
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I wish it was real.

599
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Gotta go fast.

600
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
God I hope that's what heaven is like.

601
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Going fast.

602
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's go to the money zone.

603
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:43,000
We talked a lot about socks here today and those are fine, but they don't touch your

604
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
dick.

605
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Unless you're the red hot chili peppers I guess.

606
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
But I want to tell you about me undies.

607
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It doesn't just touch your dick, it touches your genitalia you got down there.

608
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Whatever you're working with, me undies will cover it and keep that your secret.

609
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Imagine a world where putting on a new pair of underwear isn't just fresh, you're stepping

610
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
into a better day.

611
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
It's the first thing you put on, the last thing you take off unless you're nasty.

612
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Why would you settle for anything less than the best feeling underwear on the planet?

613
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I do want to say, sometimes I wear me undies as socks but that's just because I have a

614
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,000
very random personality and a very random like South Park humor.

615
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I do it but only because I have a very polished floor and I like to really slide around on

616
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
it.

617
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Yeah, it's fun.

618
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
That modal really, really go.

619
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
It's a real slickery fabric.

620
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

621
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's a special fabric made with the best in class raw materials that are scientifically

622
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
proven to be three times softer than cotton.

627
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Do you guys feel like, we don't do a lot of evening recordings, do you guys feel like

628
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I'm a really good voice tonight?

629
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I feel really, I'm articulating things really well.

630
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I feel really good about the instrument.

631
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
It's funny you say that.

632
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I feel like my throat is full of Anheuser-Busch beer cheese.

633
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Yeah.

634
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I actually-

635
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I just feel like mine's rough and raw.

636
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I coated mine in that good wet cheese because I went to Carl's Jr. and I said, hold the

637
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
burger please, just a small cup.

638
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Just take one of those free water cups, fill it in with-

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And cheese me.

640
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
You know that golden stuff I crave.

641
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
When Carl wants to please me, he's only got to cheese me.

642
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Yeah, they will actually put it on fries for you but they crumble bacon on top of it because

643
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
why not?

644
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Health is why not.

645
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Health.

646
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Oh yeah.

647
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Living.

648
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's-

649
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Living life with health in it.

650
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Not even a lot of health but a normal amount of health is why you wouldn't, I think.

651
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, and self-respect is the only other reason.

652
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
That's the only other thing.

653
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,000
There's just health and self-respect is why not to do it.

654
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
As a new dad, I would like to tell you guys about the most important thing in the world.

655
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Sleep.

656
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I was trying to come up with a joke there but you see, I'm so sleep deprived, I couldn't

657
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
think of anything funny to say right now and I'm going to keep this anxiety free.

658
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Sometimes I'm sleeping two hours at a time and then feeding for an hour, feeding the

659
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
baby for an hour.

660
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Damn, that's a hungry, thirsty baby.

661
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Yeah, well there's a lot of diaper changing in there too and unwrapping and rewrapping

662
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
of various onesies and swaddlers and stuff and then we sleep for two hours and I tell

663
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
you what, if we weren't doing it on a Casper mattress, I don't know that we would get

664
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
to really just savor those two hours like we are now.

665
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You know, but it's easy to lay right back down, fall right back asleep thanks to our

666
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Casper mattress.

667
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Casper is a sponsor of the show this week as well as we're still working on that episode.

668
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It kind of got thrown for a loop a little bit because-

669
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
On our Halloween special.

670
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, well we weren't anticipating a surprise baby and it kind of threw off the schedule

671
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
a little bit.

672
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But Casper is an online retailer of premium, obsessively engineered mattresses and the

673
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
best thing is they're a fraction of the price of what you would pay at a big box mattress

674
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
store because they keep their overhead down and it's all done online and when you open

675
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
it up, it's real fun.

676
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
They ship it to you in a box that looks way too small for a mattress to be in.

677
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You open it up, it kind of fooms out.

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It impresses everybody.

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
It's really cool.

680
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Everybody that you've invited to your mattress unboxing, which should be all your closest

681
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
friends really, but they have a risk-free trial and return policy so you can try sleeping

682
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
on a Casper for 100 days with free delivery to the US and Canada and painless returns

683
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
and the mattresses are made in America, which is always great if you love America like I

684
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
do.

685
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Pricing is about $500 for a twin size mattress and $950 for a king size mattress, which is

686
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
just a great deal for anyone who can tell you who's ever shopped for mattresses before

687
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and my brother, my brother and me listeners can get $50 towards any mattress purchase

688
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
by going to Casper.com slash my brother and use the promo code mybrother, all one word

689
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
at checkout.

690
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Terms and conditions apply.

691
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
We got some junk.

692
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
What's wrong?

693
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Nothing.

694
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I read the first personal message.

695
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh no.

696
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We're going to get there.

697
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I do want to say we have not had any openings for Jumbotrons lately.

698
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,000
It's because we just got all full up, but Maximum Fun is going to open up some slots

699
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
in 2017.

700
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So if you do want to get a message on the show, those slots are going to open up on

701
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Monday, November 28th.

702
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
That's Cyber Monday at noon Pacific.

703
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So the spots are again going to be in 2017.

704
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's weird even like having to like say this.

705
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's so humbling and great that folks are just like so excited to get messages on the

706
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
show that they are, they have filled us right the hell up for like a whole year.

707
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But if you want to get a message on the show in 2017, again, those spots are going to open

708
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
up Cyber Monday, Monday, November 28th at 12 noon Pacific.

709
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Justin, you want to read this message since you were goofing on it?

710
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Yeah, I just got a kick out of, and this is, this is adjacent to what you're just discussing.

711
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This is a message for Kate and it's from Leslie and it says it was between this or another

712
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
haunted doll this year.

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Happy birthday, Kate.

714
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's, it's like a D with 15 O's after it.

715
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And it just says, she'll know.

716
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So hopefully Kate appreciated that.

717
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Maybe that's her ASMR.

718
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The reason I laughed is because the preferred timeframe for this message to air is it says

719
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,000
next recording April 8th is, was her birthday, but I totally get if you can't make that date

720
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
happen.

721
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, that is putting it mildly.

722
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Y'all, we used to joke about like we're closer to the next birthday than we are like a month

723
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
closer to the next birthday than we are the last one.

724
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So maybe since we're selling all the Jumbotrons for 2017, like all at once, maybe they can

725
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
like be shuffled in such a way where that would be closer.

726
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Yeah, I don't know.

727
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
That sounds like a nightmare to try to do.

728
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
We should force Stacey to do that, but I have it when you, when you buy a Jumbotron, date

729
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
it for two that like say happy birthday in 2018 and then they'll all be hopefully early.

730
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I have another message here.

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
This one is for smart, sexy, science lady.

732
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,000
And it's from your bearded bus driver, Bo, maybe boy or maybe just Bo.

733
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know.

734
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,000
They say to smart, sexy, science lady.

735
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Hey, I want to just say how much I love you lady.

736
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I may not have the weekends off anymore, but we will try to find time to do things together.

737
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Like listening to all of the McElroy Brothers content.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Thank you for making my life easier and more enjoyable.

739
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Hopefully I do the same for you.

740
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Now this does sound like they know each other.

741
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm going to bring you home some good, good Popeyes later.

742
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
By the way, there's a ghost in my bus again and I'm going to need you to call the priest.

743
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This does sound like they know each other and this is definitely like a relationship

744
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
message, but there's also a world in which this is a bus driver who has seen like a sexy

745
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
science lady come on his bus and usually has the weekends off so he works Mondays,

746
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,000
but now they've changed his schedule so he doesn't have weekends off anymore.

747
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And this is like his missed connections, like this is his ad.

748
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
A woman that, that this person is attracted to walks onto the bus with two Erlenmeyer

749
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
flasks full of fluid and it's like blue and like green science fluid.

750
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And so he just knows what her field is.

751
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And she looks at them a lot and goes, hmm, and then mixes them.

752
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And there's a little like poof cloud that comes out of the top and she quickly jots

753
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
down her observations.

754
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
That's fun.

755
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hi everybody, I'm Justin McElroy.

756
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And I'm Dr. Sydney McElroy.

757
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Every week we release a medical history podcast called Sawbones.

758
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We go over the history of the dumbest, grossest, weirdest stuff humans have been doing to each

759
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
other since the dawn of mankind.

760
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But it's a funny show.

761
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
But it's also so disgusting and stomach turning you won't believe it.

762
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
But it's also like funny.

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
It's funny.

764
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
It is the wildest, grossest, nastiest stuff you can imagine.

765
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's a real hoot.

766
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It's called Sawbones and we release it every week on iTunes, wherever podcasts are sold

767
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and right here on MaximumFun.org.

768
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Do you guys want to Yahoo?

769
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Yeah, when are we going to do this musical number?

770
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I'm wondering when will be the best time to just sort of deploy that.

771
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I got a great Jimmy Buffett tune lined up.

772
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think maybe the end of the show or maybe.

773
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Okay.

774
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Yeah.

775
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
All right.

776
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
That sounds good.

777
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
What if we forget though?

778
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Probably won't.

779
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Probably won't.

780
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
What if we do though?

781
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So this one was sent in by Brandon Giles.

782
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Brandon Giles.

783
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, hey.

784
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Friend of the show, the fam.

785
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Brandon Giles.

786
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Thank you, Brandon.

787
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's by Yahoo Answers User.

788
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,000
They're anonymous and for good reason because their fucking question is, which is the baby,

789
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
the egg or the sperm?

790
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Guys, how is this not like a chicken or the egg, cake or pie, diaper or bucket situation?

791
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I think it's obvious.

792
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
The sperm is the baby and the egg is the house.

793
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
This is a good theory.

794
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Travis, can you talk for maybe like 10 whole minutes about the science behind what you

795
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
just said?

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Well, Griffin, let me explain.

797
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I'm pretty sure the egg stays in one place once it settles into the uterine lining and

798
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
it's the sperm that's active and mobile and finds the egg.

799
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Yeah.

800
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So it seems like the sperm is active before the egg is.

801
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
So it seems like it starts there.

802
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Yeah.

803
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
If you're going by motility or mobility, I can't remember which one's which.

804
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Do you just want to also point out that you just had a baby a couple of weeks ago and

805
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm expecting-

806
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
The doctor explained all this to me.

807
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
In less than a month.

808
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Yeah.

809
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I guess I just sort of wasn't paying attention about the whole birds and the bees process.

810
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I just know it's a lot of fun for me, right?

811
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Right, fellas?

812
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It actually wasn't until I held the baby for the first time.

813
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But the doctor kind of leaned her head around the corner and went, by the way, it started

814
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
with sperm.

815
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
And she just kind of ran away.

816
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Yeah.

817
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It was very confusing.

818
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
This was sperm first and it lived in an egg house.

819
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Bye.

820
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And the doctor's coat she was wearing, she was actually wrapped herself in toilet paper

821
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
in a reasonable simulacra of a doctor's coat.

822
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It was weird.

823
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It was weird.

824
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And I had never seen her before and I was at a 7-Eleven.

825
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Uh-huh.

826
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I have another theory.

827
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And I'm sorry, Dr. Travis.

828
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
No, please.

829
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's the inverse theory.

830
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And again, theory, because all of this is unprovable.

831
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,000
I think the egg might be the baby, but it's not active yet.

832
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And then my sperm is like a magic spell that just brings that egg to life.

833
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:22,000
So you're saying that the egg is an android and the sperm is like the wish that Haley

834
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Joel Osborn makes on a star in AI, basically.

835
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's one good way of thinking about it.

836
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Topical.

837
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I mean, crack open an ordinary chicken's egg to make a French toast or some sort of

838
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
late night egg meal.

839
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And what's in there is just like a chicken that didn't quite get the start it needed

840
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
from the magic spell cast by his daddy, Nut.

841
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
That's really good.

842
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Well, until you said that last part about Rooster Nut, but other than that, that was

843
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
actually a really well-posited theory.

844
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Think about it.

845
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,000
So I guess another way you could think about it is the egg is kind of like our body.

846
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
And that nut is sort of like the soul.

847
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Our bodies are just these fleshy exosuits.

848
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And this is the theory, guys.

849
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
This is it.

850
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
This sperm just kind of climbs inside the egg.

851
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And the sperm is like the alive thing.

852
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,000
But then the egg grows and grows and grows and becomes like the body, the baby body.

853
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But that sperm is in there sort of controlling it from within like the little funny alien

854
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
from Men in Black.

855
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Okay.

856
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So you're saying basically that the egg is sort of the Jaeger and the sperm is the Charlie

857
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Hunnam.

858
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But you're saying basically that's right, right?

859
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
That's basically it?

860
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah.

861
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I mean, any way you want to shake it.

862
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Any other sort of mech-based thing you want to reference.

863
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes.

864
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I'm out.

865
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
I'm out.

866
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Okay.

867
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
No, we think there's Voltron and then the five.

868
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,000
I was going to make a Duran Lagan poll, but I think there are listeners of this show

869
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
who would know that stuff better than myself.

870
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You guys have to agree with me, right?

871
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Because every other sort of thing you could think of is complete garbage.

872
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And really, well, I may have just sort of unlocked life if you think about it.

873
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Mm-hmm.

874
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Mm.

875
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Well, I'm trying to remember how Look Who's Talking starts.

876
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Yeah, what's the first shot?

877
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And I'm pretty sure the egg lands and you can hear the egg think like, I'm just a body

878
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
waiting for a little soul.

879
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And then a sperm shows up.

880
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And I think he's got a fun accent, but I won't do it because I can't do accents.

881
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And he says something like-

882
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Hello, hello, hello there.

883
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Pull this in.

884
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm a nut.

885
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'm a little bit of soul, aren't I?

886
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
And then he just like swims in.

887
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And then I think it's Bruce Willis.

888
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I think it turns into Bruce Willis.

889
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah.

890
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And I think the whole movie, like, I think Kirstie Alley keeps looking at the baby and

891
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
going, all this because some sperm animated my egg.

892
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Yeah, Justin-

893
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And she says that line a lot.

894
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah, a few times.

895
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It feels like Travis and I might be doing most of the scientific heavy lifting on this question.

896
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Just wanted to get your-

897
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Yeah, it's weird.

898
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Just wanted to get your beak wet.

899
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

900
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,000
No, I feel like you guys have really covered the scientific end of this.

901
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I can't help but take a more religious approach.

902
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So I'm kind of abstaining because I don't want to step on any toes.

903
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I mean, abstaining would be a more sort of religious approach to the process.

904
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
But I'm-

905
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I think I'm just-

906
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I'm looking at my body now.

907
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I'm talking, right?

908
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm moving my hands.

909
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm gesticulating.

910
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'm gesticulating.

911
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,000
All this is just coming from some coming.

912
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's inside me and it's just like, it's fucking pulling the tendons and the strings

913
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and it's like making me think the things I think.

914
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Wait.

915
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Hold on, Griffin.

916
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Are you pitching like a meet Dave scenario in which the sperms are controlling your body?

917
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Travis, Travis.

918
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Do not get it twisted.

919
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
That is explicitly what I'm saying everybody is.

920
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Everybody's just a sperm suit?

921
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I mean, that's a gross way of thinking about the beautiful miracle that is life and existence,

922
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
but yeah, Trav.

923
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Yeah.

924
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Here's a question-

925
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
You want to move on from this, huh?

926
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
You don't want to spend another 13 minutes sort of unpacking it?

927
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I have one I want to read really quick just to give a quick thumbs up or down, a quick

928
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
am I good clearance.

929
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I pranked a guy in college.

930
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I replaced his protein powder with Nesquik and he said I was dead to him.

931
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
I found out we're in the same wedding party.

932
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
If I don't go to the wedding, am I good?

933
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That's from Pranks Men in Charleston.

934
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I know you wanted to get through this quick.

935
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
We have to acknowledge the fact that this is a pretty bonkers prank to pull, right?

936
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
It's one of those pranks where it's like, so what?

937
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:52,000
You changed the beverage to a tastier beverage and also there's fucking literally no way

938
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:56,000
that this person would have known that they were not drinking protein powder anymore.

939
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Yeah, his roommate was going to the gym and cranking it, shredding it, goes home to give

940
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
his muscles what they crave and they just get that bunny milk.

941
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
That's not doing them any good.

942
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The problem is if you miss one serving of the protein powder, all your muscles deflate.

943
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
That's what they don't tell you.

944
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
It's a razor's edge kind of regime.

945
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
This guy deflated so much you could see the sperm pilot inside of him.

946
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
You could see his 21 sperm pilot.

947
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I know you wanted to move on, but I have to think that your body grows, right?

948
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Your sperm pilot probably grows too, so it's like the size of a big snake in you.

949
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Is that what your fucking spine is?

950
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Holy shit, you guys.

951
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
It's your skull and your spine.

952
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It makes sense.

953
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It all makes sense.

954
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
It looks like that nut.

955
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It just looks like the nut if you think about it.

956
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It looks like that nut.

957
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Your brain is there and your brain would be in the skull of the sperm telling it how to

958
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
swim good to get in the egg.

959
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
It all makes so much sense.

960
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It makes a lot of fucking sense.

961
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You've cracked this nut wide open.

962
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
They have to go to the wedding, right?

963
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
They still have to go?

964
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Oh yeah, you have to go.

965
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
You have to go.

966
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
This is the most innocuous prank ever.

967
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Don't sweat it.

968
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Don't sweat it.

969
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I went to a Halloween party with my friends.

970
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I didn't know what to expect at this party, and when I got there, I saw that there were

971
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
finger foods, which causes me pretty severe anxiety.

972
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
What?

973
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I smoked far too much weed and discovered just how serious my anxiety is.

974
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I had an emotional breakdown right there in front of the spinach dip.

975
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Can I come back from this and hang out with my friends or do I need to leave town?

976
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And that's for too high for this shit in Oregon.

977
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I don't want to rag on this person's anxiety.

978
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Obviously, this is a fucking anxiety-free zone.

979
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I could see why you would get, you know, freaked out.

980
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
I would request that we not put the finger foods into the anxiety basket and send it

981
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
down to the anxiety alligators who probably enjoy it for a change.

982
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I'll be the anxiety alligator for this particular anxiety, by which I mean, pass that dip down

983
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Griffin's way, because, Jesus, I'll destroy it.

984
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Oh, man.

985
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Do we need to record, like, a comedown?

986
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Let me say this.

987
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I will say this to you.

988
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
This seems so innocuous to me that I actually think you might have given your friends a

989
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
gift with this, because this is a fun story of that time one of your friends was so high

990
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
that they cried over spinach dip.

991
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
That's not – I don't know that there's a friend of yours right now who's like,

992
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I fucking hope they never show up again.

993
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Like, it's not like –

994
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I hope they always show up everywhere.

995
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That was amazing.

996
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Yeah, right?

997
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Like, that's a fun story of, like, I remember there was one time in college they got so

998
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
high they cried over spinach dip.

999
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
That's funny.

1000
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:56,000
They're not so drunk that you, like, wrecked their car or, like, set their couch on fire.

1001
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Sure.

1002
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But when you're – I don't know how to explain this to you, boys.

1003
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:12,000
When you're sailing on the SS Good Cush, you can do some stuff sometimes that may seem

1004
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
kind of whack to the outside observer in a way that makes them sort of, like, a bit

1005
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
uncomfy.

1006
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I don't know if you – I feel like I have a similar story to this where one time I was

1007
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:33,000
at a party and I was the first mate of that particular voyage and I saw an ex and it gave

1008
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
me a real bad, real bad feelings that I didn't –

1009
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
An ex?

1010
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, I saw an ex that my big sperm didn't really know how to handle and it's, you know,

1011
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,000
dubered up state and so my friend, who was the one who invited me on the boat, so to

1012
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
speak, he told me to grab onto the back of his shirt and the two of us ran from the party

1013
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,000
just squealing and giggling to the point of tears while he sort of quarterback, like,

1014
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
snuck me out of the party, like, through the fucking front porch that everybody else was

1015
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
hanging out on and I remember thinking the next morning, like, I need to shoot myself

1016
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
into space because I live on the fucking sun now.

1017
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I'm the king of Mercury now because I can never, ever face any of those people ever

1018
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
again.

1019
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But they don't know what was wrong with you.

1020
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
They probably knew what was wrong with me.

1021
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:42,000
At the same time, like, I don't – no judgment if I see somebody who's, like, on that ship,

1022
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
on that rocking and rolling boat and I see them having a bad time.

1023
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I don't hold it against them.

1024
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
It's just I get where this person is coming from and I can see them not laughing it right

1025
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
off.

1026
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I feel like you have to – before it gets to a judgment zone, I feel like everybody's

1027
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
seen the – like, if you party and your friends party, I feel like you've – probably everybody's

1028
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
seen their friends over party.

1029
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Everyone has partied too much.

1030
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I feel like you don't enter the judgment zone until it becomes, like, oh, they're

1031
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
the one who parties too much every single time.

1032
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Like, five or six times of crying at spinach dip or a big X apparently.

1033
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Or one time of you physically fighting the spinach dip.

1034
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Like, you show up to the party on the good cush and then you see the spinach dip and

1035
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
you immediately fight it before anybody can enjoy it and it's homemade.

1036
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
And you just keep yelling, I'm strong to the fennec.

1037
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah.

1038
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And just, like, over and over again.

1039
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Yeah.

1040
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Folks, that's going to do it for us on our anxiety-free cruise.

1041
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,000
We hope you enjoyed it.

1042
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Did we do a good job?

1043
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I hope you did.

1044
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I feel like it was pretty chill.

1045
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I think it was a pretty chill zone.

1046
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
I would like to pitch something.

1047
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Okay.

1048
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I would like to pitch, like, a 20-second bubble in which I can say something that may induce

1049
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
anxiety, but then Justin, you're going to swing it right back with your musical number.

1050
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah.

1051
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Okay.

1052
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Well, let's save that for, like, literally the end of the show.

1053
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
How about that?

1054
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
You got it.

1055
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,000
How about we finish this, we hop on the bubble, and then we get right back on the boat real

1056
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
quick.

1057
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Okay.

1058
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
That's the anxiety thing that's coming later.

1059
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
No.

1060
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's so fine.

1061
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I do want to say maybe this will help.

1062
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
I have a daughter now.

1063
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, yeah.

1064
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Yay.

1065
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
And she's doing great.

1066
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Her name is Barbara Lee McElroy.

1067
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
We're calling her B.B. Lee, and Lee is her middle name.

1068
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's not like a hyphen or anything.

1069
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,960
It's Barbara Lee McElroy, B.B. Lee.

1070
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,800
She was born on October 25th.

1071
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,000
She was a little early, but she's healthy, and she's home, and everything's going great.

1072
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And Teresa's doing great.

1073
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Can I ask you a question?

1074
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I've got to ask a question.

1075
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,160
You have a beautiful baby, and congratulations.

1076
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,240
But which was the baby, the egg or the sperm?

1077
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,240
Do you know?

1078
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,080
Because you're right up against it now.

1079
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,320
I mean, I really thought it was the sperm, but now I'm convinced that the sperm is just

1080
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,520
piloting the egg.

1081
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,400
And that really makes the most sense to me, Griffin, I've got to tell you.

1082
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,400
But B.B.'s doing great.

1083
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,400
Teresa's doing great.

1084
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,160
We're all doing great.

1085
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:22,480
You know, and I do want to say, I have been deeply moved by everybody on Twitter and Facebook

1086
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,400
and everywhere that has just, since she was born, poured out so much support and love,

1087
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,520
and everybody has been so happy to see pictures of her.

1088
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:39,800
And we spent a little time in the NICU, and it was very scary at first, and knowing that

1089
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:46,120
there was just this, like, squad of people, this, like, huge, like, support network of

1090
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:49,460
people telling us, like, hey, it's going great.

1091
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,460
You guys are great.

1092
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:51,460
Everything's going to be fine.

1093
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,460
She looks beautiful.

1094
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Like, all that stuff.

1095
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,460
It meant the world to us.

1096
00:55:54,460 --> 00:56:00,600
So we just want to say thank you for everybody who has supported us during the beginning

1097
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:03,600
of this new phase of our family.

1098
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
Thank you, everybody.

1099
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,960
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters for the use of our theme song instead

1100
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,760
of Parchoff, the album putting the days to bed.

1101
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Thank you very much.

1102
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
It's a good song.

1103
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,040
Also, I want to thank Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1104
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,720
Go to MaximumFun.org and just click on all the shows you see there.

1105
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,920
You're going to love more than six of them, I bet.

1106
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,520
Also, we have a bunch of other podcasts and video projects that we do.

1107
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,800
You can find all those at McElroyShows.com.

1108
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,920
Did you guys announce the February release date for the My Brother, My Brother and Me

1109
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,920
TV show on CISO?

1110
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:39,920
We did.

1111
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
We talked about that last week.

1112
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,920
But yeah, February, what is it?

1113
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,920
21st?

1114
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,920
23rd.

1115
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,920
23rd.

1116
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:45,920
23rd, of course.

1117
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,480
That is when the MBM Show is going to come out on CISO.

1118
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,640
We've seen some rough cuts of the episodes now, and guys, you're just going to love it.

1119
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,640
It's going to fix everything.

1120
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:54,640
Yeah.

1121
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,640
It's going to fix it all.

1122
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,480
Justin, did you talk about you and Sydney going on the JoCo cruise?

1123
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah.

1124
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,480
Well, I mentioned it on Sawbones.

1125
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,440
I didn't mention it here.

1126
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,080
We're going to be, Sydney and I are going to be on the JoCo cruise.

1127
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:10,360
We're going to be, it's going to be in March, I believe.

1128
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:16,180
We're there with a ton of cool people, John McColton, obviously, Will Wheaton, our buddy

1129
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:24,460
Hal Loveland, Night Vale is going to be there, a ton of, Gail Simone, like a ton of really

1130
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:29,320
cool folks, Matthew Weiner, Creator Mad Men, like it's going to be a really cool thing.

1131
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,680
If you go to JoCoCruise.com, you can get a cabin and come on the cruise with us.

1132
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:33,680
It's going to be fun.

1133
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:34,680
Yeah.

1134
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,680
Okay.

1135
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,680
Is that it?

1136
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,680
Real quick bubble.

1137
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
Hey, everybody.

1138
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,800
It's Travis.

1139
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Go vote.

1140
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Please, God.

1141
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:47,040
If you're hearing this on Monday or Tuesday, go vote.

1142
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,120
November 8th is mine and Justin's birthday.

1143
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,120
This is our special birthday episode.

1144
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,760
All we want for our birthday.

1145
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,800
If you're a registered American voter and you have the ability to go vote, go vote.

1146
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:03,520
I will also say, because it is my birthday, go vote for Hillary Clinton because I want

1147
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:07,920
her to win and I definitely don't want Donald Trump to win.

1148
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,920
Please do that for us.

1149
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,920
Yes.

1150
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:10,920
Anyway.

1151
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,920
Go vote.

1152
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,920
Now, wait.

1153
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:13,920
Wait.

1154
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,920
You hear that sound?

1155
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:15,920
Please go vote for Hillary Clinton and pop.

1156
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:16,920
That was the anxiety bubble.

1157
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:17,920
Oh, we're off of it.

1158
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,920
That means we're back on the cruise.

1159
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,120
Do you guys want to go ahead and sign off and I'll just play this out?

1160
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
How's that sound?

1161
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Yeah.

1162
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
You guys want that final yahoo?

1163
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Yeah.

1164
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,160
This final yahoo was sent in by level 9000 Yajujujujujubbb.

1165
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,160
Thank you George.

1166
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:40,760
It's Yajuranser's user, Becarella, who asks, Alice in Wonderland 2, book I'm writing.

1167
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,000
I'm Justin McElroy.

1168
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,400
I'm Travis McElroy.

1169
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:44,560
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1170
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,040
Kiss your dad, square on the lips.

1171
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,040
Boat drinks.

1172
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,720
Boys in the band ordered boat drinks.

1173
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,840
Visitors scored on the home rink.

1174
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:04,840
I'm going to do a mashup, keep going.

1175
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:23,840
You guys are ruining it, there's no way to do this, this is super-

1176
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:29,840
This is a nightmare of a sink, you're ruining everything.
