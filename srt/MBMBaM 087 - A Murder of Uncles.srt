1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:51,040
Live from the second library of Downton Abbey, it's my brother and brother and me, Downton Abbey

6
00:00:51,040 --> 00:01:01,680
Edition. I cannot believe we got permission from Lord Grantham and his fam to let us hang

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,320
here and record. We've got cords strewn all the way to the third kitchen.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
Well, we had to run an extension cord from 2012.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,000
Right, and that is a lot of cords. And then we have an internet antenna through time

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,080
in the livery. But Griffin, how did we get here? How did we walk us through sort of the process of,

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
you did most of the political aspects of getting us in here.

12
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,800
So you mean the political aspects and not the chrono magic?

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,000
The chrono stuff, that's old hat for my brother and my brother and me. It's like,

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,360
how do you get permission? Well, I actually married into the family. I married a gay footman.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,520
Griffin gay married a footman.

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,960
Much to the chagrin of granny, she was not pleased about that.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
I mean, we're very happy.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,460
That's nice.

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,660
And we every night, you know, polish the silver as it were, as it were, as we do.

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,380
Honk, honk.

21
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,100
Honk, honk, if you know what I mean. And what we do is we travel through time and give people

22
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:25,140
advice. Later on, we're going to tell Lady Sybil how to break free from the shackles of feminine

23
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,780
imprisonment that the early 20th century has placed her in. But for now-

24
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,540
And then we're going to berate the servants.

25
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:37,060
And later, later, we'll be berating the servants. For now, we're all yours, though. I'm your oldest

26
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,340
brother, Justin McElroy.

27
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,020
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

28
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,020
Well, technically, you're the second Duke of Grantham, Griffin McElroy.

30
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,900
I'm the second Duke of footmanship, your lordship, Griffin McElroy.

31
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,220
I assume that footman exists just to like give foot rubs, right?

32
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,340
I assume so.

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,980
Yeah. How is he doing with that? On that end-

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,700
Pretty good.

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,740
Pretty good?

36
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,300
Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,020
Well, that's good to hear. So let's get right into the advice. Hey,

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,420
I was wondering if you have any insight into how to find the line between being a nice guy

39
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,500
and being quote, unquote, whipped in a relationship. I'm a straight guy, but I guess

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,820
this could be applicable to the fairer sex or anyone in a relationship, really. That's from

41
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,820
The Mused in Britain.

42
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,380
You know, I'm going to say that this is just like when we blew the lid off of bros before hoes,

43
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,620
and I would posit that anyone who says someone is whipped in a relationship,

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,540
the person saying it is single.

45
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,020
Yeah.

46
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:46,820
Yeah. Whipped. I get the idea. And I have known people who... I mean, we've all known people,

47
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,540
right? Who are in relationships that don't seem to be good for them, and they are,

48
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,660
for some reason, blindly sort of adhering to.

49
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,540
Well, either that or they are so just puss crazed.

50
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,740
They're crazed for puss.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,020
And they'll do anything for it, like for a Klondike bar, only for genitals instead.

52
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,020
It's like a Scooby snack, you know?

53
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,900
It isn't. Oh, that's...

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,100
What?

55
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,180
I do think it's important to remember...

56
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,620
If you're the sort of person who maybe doesn't get into a lot of relationships,

57
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,780
if you're the sort of person who maybe has gone a while without the companionship of

58
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,980
the opposite sex...

59
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,020
Or the same sex.

60
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,420
Or the same sex. Yes. Thank you, Griffin.

61
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,460
Or a dog.

62
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,420
Or a dog.

63
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,540
Or a rollercoaster.

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,100
Not to equate those, of course. Not to say that someone who loves a rollercoaster is

65
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:49,460
the same as a gay person, but thank you for that. I think coaster crazy is a pretty far cry

66
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,100
from some living alternative lifestyle, but anyway.

67
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Justin, just because you said that, we're gonna get a whole bunch of shit from all of

68
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,500
the objectumsexuals that listen to our show.

69
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,780
Yeah, especially the homo-objectumsexuals.

70
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,820
They just love people, but it's a long story.

71
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,180
But only on rollercoasters.

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,340
Only on rollercoasters, they enjoy the people.

73
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,900
No, I think that if you've been a long time out of a relationship, it can be tempting

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,180
to sort of sacrifice whatever you are to try to make that other person like you.

75
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,460
And that's a danger.

76
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,300
That's a good rule of thumb if you say,

77
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,140
so are you doing it because you want to do it for the person?

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,940
Are you making the sacrifice or being, you know, very thoughtful and kind because you

79
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,420
want to or because you're afraid of upsetting them?

80
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,860
And I would say if you are doing anything in a relationship because you're afraid of

81
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,020
upsetting your partner, then you need to kind of take a step back and look at the way things

82
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,740
are going.

83
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:50,340
You should get married because I would say about 80% of the decisions I make, I have

84
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,500
a filter first that says, is this going to upset my wife because I should not do it.

85
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:55,940
No, no, no.

86
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,020
There's a difference between being thoughtful and not wanting to upset her and being afraid

87
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,740
to upset her.

88
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,620
I think it was either Gandhi or Hitler who said that half of love is fear.

89
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,180
And now that I said it out loud, that was definitely, definitely Hitler.

90
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,980
Definitely Hitler.

91
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,420
I think that might've been Machiavelli.

92
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,060
Okay.

93
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,780
One of those guys.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,820
Do you mean Machiavelli or do you mean Tupac?

95
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,580
It might've been Tupac.

96
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:21,700
Yeah.

97
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,820
The great philosopher.

98
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
Great philosopher.

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,700
Great mind of our time, Tupac.

100
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,060
Can we also give a piece of advice to the people who are unhappy and lonely and not

101
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,940
in a relationship?

102
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,260
Don't be that fucking person who's like bad relationships.

103
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,620
This guy, who are you even anymore?

104
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,740
It's like, I don't know you.

105
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,620
And even worse, don't, man, everyone knows that you're unhappy.

106
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,020
Don't grumble about it and make everyone uncomfortable.

107
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,500
Yeah.

108
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,140
That's all you're doing.

109
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,740
Another Valentine's Day alone.

110
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,020
Like, yeah, just get out.

111
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,580
If you're unhappy, don't grumble to your friends.

112
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,220
Just get out.

113
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,060
Valentine's Day is made by Hallmark and the Illuminati.

114
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,300
That's not accurate, but no, I get the idea.

115
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,580
Hey guys, I need some advice.

116
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,020
I don't.

117
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,980
It's a question to ask.

118
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,180
A girl gave me her number last weekend, which was a first for me.

119
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,100
Unfortunately, when I called her a couple of days later, I ended up believing the most

120
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,380
awkward voicemail.

121
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
What's my next move in that situation?

122
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,580
If she never calls back, do I ever try to call her again or have I lost my one chance?

123
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,180
Wondering was in Wisconsin.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,540
Hey, wondering your instincts have not served you wrong here.

125
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,460
You have in fact lost your one chance.

126
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,100
I find myself laughing, not at the predicament that you found yourself in, but trying to

127
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,700
imagine what the most awkward voicemail someone could leave is.

128
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,740
I don't.

129
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,340
I can't find cases and this is Steve.

130
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,500
Oh my God, I'm peeing my pants right now.

131
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,900
Oh God, there's pee and poop in my pants.

132
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,860
Put this pee here.

133
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,500
Did I call you good poop and pee in my pants?

134
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:50,980
Ah, Susan.

135
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,780
Your dad is here.

136
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,660
I'm making him watch.

137
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,140
Ah, mm, ah, one of them back.

138
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,620
Hi.

139
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,580
Talk to your mom.

140
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,100
Is your mom there?

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,900
I am a poopy robot.

142
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I am, I am a poopy robot.

143
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,820
Listen, if you call this lady back anymore, you are running a real risk of pulling a John

144
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,020
Favreau from swingers.

145
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,300
Yep.

146
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,860
And that is, that is my living nightmare.

147
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,740
So now what is that?

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,060
The scene in swingers where John Favreau gets a number and then he calls a girl and then

149
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,140
leaves something like a desperate voicemail and then ends up calling her 20 more times

150
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:30,100
until she answers the phone and answers the phone and says, please don't call me anymore.

151
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,940
That is what you're, that's what you're going towards.

152
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,860
And that'll ruin you in the lady community.

153
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,980
I feel like maybe if you had, if you had been like building up to making this call and you

154
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:45,780
finally made the call and you left an awkward message, then maybe you're just an awkward

155
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,380
dude and maybe you need to find the lady who celebrates that.

156
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:49,540
Yeah.

157
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,780
As I say, just wait and see what happens.

158
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,660
And maybe there's a funny story you get to tell your kids someday.

159
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,140
Yeah.

160
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,500
Either she'll respond with, oh, that's cute or, oh, he's a nut job.

161
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,460
He's a stalker.

162
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:09,220
You could call back and leave a more awkward voicemail or like an, like a very intensely

163
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,140
angry voicemail.

164
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,820
Now, what is that idea?

165
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,540
Isn't it?

166
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,700
I just thought you might be looping around the bend to a good idea, but it never came.

167
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,660
The turn never came.

168
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,380
The, the river of that particular hand.

169
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,900
Listen, it's, it's all about, it's like the first episode of the bachelor.

170
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,820
It's all about making an impression.

171
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,460
So you get that first impression rose, you know what I mean?

172
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,460
So like, it's not so much about offending her or playing to her sensibilities.

173
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,260
You just got to fucking get in her mind space.

174
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:45,940
You got to purchase a timeshare in her brain zone and then live in it and then be unforgettable.

175
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,900
What if you hired a proxy to call her and say, please disregard Mr.

176
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,860
Johnson's call, he would very much like to date you.

177
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,300
Please return at your earliest convenience.

178
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,020
Maybe just call her back and say, hi, Deborah, it's me, Philip.

179
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,540
I wanted to apologize because when I called you before, I was high on crank.

180
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,020
A lot of crank running through this bloodstream.

181
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,220
I was high on crank too.

182
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,180
That is not a practice I tend to give up.

183
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,620
I intend to give up, by the way.

184
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,260
If we enter into a loving covenant, I will still be getting high on crank.

185
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,860
I would say for future reference, I think that if you get

186
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,020
someone's number and you want to call them, don't leave a voicemail, anybody.

187
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,380
No, I think a voicemail is good.

188
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,060
Really?

189
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,300
Yeah.

190
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,180
I don't like people who don't leave a voicemail.

191
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,700
I think the idea of leaving a voicemail for someone that you barely know,

192
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,060
but would like to get to know better.

193
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,300
It just seems so weird.

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,980
I would be so afraid of them not remembering who I was right away.

195
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,380
I'd be like, who is this person that left me a voicemail?

196
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:56,180
It's a double-edged sword because it's a very low-stress sitch.

197
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,780
It puts the ball in their court.

198
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,340
If they don't call you back, you know it's because they weren't that interested,

199
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,380
and then that's fine.

200
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,660
You can move on from that.

201
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,020
On the other hand, if this is your first number,

202
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,100
it sounds like this is this dude's first number that he ever got

203
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,460
because he explicitly says it.

204
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,300
You're going to do bad.

205
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,220
You're going to do a bad job, and that's okay.

206
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,580
You got to fail forward.

207
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,540
You got to take some learnings from this and move on.

208
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,980
In the future, anybody really, if you're going to leave a voicemail,

209
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,020
please be tactical about it.

210
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,580
Know exactly what you're going to say and get in, get out.

211
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,260
Because there is nothing worse than being ready to call somebody back

212
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,020
after you hear what the message was and they're still prattling.

213
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,420
I feel like you just need to say, think of it like writing a letter,

214
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,340
and you need to have your greeting, the body of the letter,

215
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,260
and your sign off and get out.

216
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,620
Don't spend too much time in there, though.

217
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,180
Don't be like, hey, Debra, this is Steve.

218
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,300
We met last night at Dill's party.

219
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,780
I think we should hang out sometime.

220
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,740
Call me back.

221
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,540
Don't say, hey, this is Steve, and I met you at Dill's party,

222
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,060
and I met you at Dill's party, and if you don't remember me,

223
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,900
I wrote you this rap, and then rap.

224
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,380
Don't do that rap that you wrote for her.

225
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,660
Don't do the rap.

226
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,300
Don't do the rap.

227
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,140
Keep it under like 15 seconds and get out.

228
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:23,940
Hey, it's me.

229
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,620
I just want to say loved your boobies and would love to hook up.

230
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,820
Just really chat them out.

231
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,220
Hey, this is Steve, and I'm here to say I love your boobies in a major way.

232
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,660
Now, that guy would get a call back from me, but I myself am not a female.

233
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,460
I don't know if that would be an effective approach.

234
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,940
I suspect it would be.

235
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:56,500
Anybody who parodies a Fruity Pebbles commercial in a sexual phone.

236
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,300
Ho, ho, ho, I'm ho, ho hungry.

237
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,460
That's from the Fruity Pebbles Christmas commercial.

238
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:03,780
Sure.

239
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,100
Do we know any other Fruity Pebbles commercials we want to spoof,

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
or do we want to maybe move on to Yahoo?

241
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,220
We can come back around to the pub.

242
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,380
All right.

243
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,020
We'll circle back.

244
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,820
We'll put a pin in it.

245
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,100
Do you remember the one where Barney burned Fred's house down?

246
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,100
Barney, all my possessions.

247
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,660
Rise from the ashes.

248
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,340
Dance in the flame with me.

249
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,100
These are the bones, the bones of Bam Bam.

250
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,860
Watch him crumble around you.

251
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,700
Can I have some cereal?

252
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,980
You guys want to Yahoo?

253
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,500
Stare into the eyes.

254
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,340
Wilma's decapitated head.

255
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,220
I burned your house.

256
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,340
Your house is made of rocks.

257
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,460
I guess if you leave that voicemail, then you're probably done.

258
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,740
Yeah, you didn't do it right.

259
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,260
That would not be the right approach to take.

260
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,660
This Yahoo was sent in by Jacob Locker.

261
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,700
Thank you, Jacob.

262
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Becky, who asks,

263
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
where can I find an adult chew toy?

264
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,300
My boyfriend has a really bad chewing issue.

265
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,260
He chews on everything, mostly his shirt, collar, and plastic.

266
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,980
Chewing on plastic is starting to mess up his teeth,

267
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,860
and I'm looking for something he could chew on that won't mess up his teeth.

268
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,820
He hates gum, so that's out of the question.

269
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,740
Not looking for anything sexual.

270
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,380
If anyone knows where I can find something you can chew on,

271
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,420
like a toddler teething ring, except for adults, it would be great.

272
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,100
Thanks, smiley face.

273
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,620
Your boyfriend's a goat.

274
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,580
You're dating a goat?

275
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,540
You accidentally dated a goat.

276
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,380
You accidentally dated a goat.

277
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,180
You silly, silly Billy.

278
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,300
That's a Billy goat.

279
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,580
That's a Billy goat, silly.

280
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,620
Did it wrong with the dating.

281
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,860
Why can't an adult chew a baby's teething ring?

282
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
Would that just be too ridiculous?

283
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,060
He would just be too silly.

284
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
He needs a man-sized pacifier.

285
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,820
I would rather live in a world where an adult is chewing on a baby's teething ring

286
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,900
than there's adult co. out there making adult chew toys.

287
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,780
It's a niche market.

288
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,020
Hey, stupid, put this in your gob.

289
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,860
Thank you for the money.

290
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,700
I like that this guy is of discerning taste,

291
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:14,340
where he'll chew on his shirt collar and he'll chew on plastic,

292
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,180
but you do not offer him gum.

293
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,060
He hates gum.

294
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,420
He hates gum.

295
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,500
I think it's not so much that he hates gum.

296
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,700
It's that he's got pica.

297
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,420
Have you ever caught him eating paint chips outside?

298
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,140
Eats his hair.

299
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Is that a problem?

300
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,820
I like that this person specifically says he's not looking for anything sexual.

301
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:40,820
And if you guys can tell me a casual chew object that a person can have

302
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,980
and then be like, look at that guy chewing on that thing, how sexual that is.

303
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,460
I don't even know what a sexual connotation chewing thing is.

304
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,660
Did she really think one of the question responders are gonna say,

305
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,180
hey, maybe a big dildo.

306
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,260
Chew on this boner.

307
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,580
Why would anybody do that?

308
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,980
There's nothing more sexual than seeing a grown man

309
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,340
chewing a toy specifically designed for men to chew on it though.

310
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,220
If you think about it.

311
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,820
Maybe smoke a pipe.

312
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,900
I get it.

313
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,260
I get the oral thing.

314
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,060
Yeah, but maybe don't be like a toddler about it.

315
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,580
Maybe eat suckers like Kojak.

316
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,260
Yeah, that's cool.

317
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
That's a timely cool look.

318
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,180
You could do a toothpick.

319
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:27,940
Corncob pipe.

320
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,500
I used to do thumbtacks.

321
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,020
That's cool.

322
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,940
That's extremely dangerous.

323
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,300
Razor blades.

324
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:35,860
Yeah.

325
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,660
Well, gun.

326
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,300
Chew on a gun.

327
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,340
Chew on this barrel.

328
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,460
Actually, that would probably be the best for her relationship.

329
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,860
This weird shirt chewer.

330
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,980
Maybe you could play a game with him called, what won't he chew?

331
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah.

332
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,860
Well, we know gums out.

333
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,420
Yeah.

334
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,380
Chew on this lighter.

335
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,980
He's doing it.

336
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,780
Chew on this cyanide pill and let me get into a real relationship with a person.

337
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,620
Why does he have to die?

338
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,860
Why can't she just leave him?

339
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,740
He's a goat man.

340
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,940
He belongs in a circus.

341
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,700
He belongs in a museum.

342
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,300
He does.

343
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,980
Thank you, Indiana Jones.

344
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,620
Indiana Jones.

345
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,580
He stops by to tell us who belongs in a museum once a week.

346
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,700
And it's Billy Goat Man.

347
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,620
It's a new feature we're trying out.

348
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,700
It's called, Indiana Jones and Billy Goat Man.

349
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,940
This is my boyfriend, Billy Gruff.

350
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,900
That's a 1% joke there.

351
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,500
Maybe zero.

352
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,460
Oh, God.

353
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,100
In my life, this is a dark secret.

354
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:53,540
I've only beaten up one person in my life and it was in middle school.

355
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,860
And I was oppressed, I think it's safe to say, in middle school.

356
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,700
And so I sort of found the only person lower on the food chain than me.

357
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,260
And it was a guy who chewed on his shirt constantly.

358
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,220
Nice.

359
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,220
And I picked on him once.

360
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,300
So don't chew on your shirt, I think is the moral of the story.

361
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,020
Or Griffin will beat you up.

362
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,700
Or I'll beat the shit out of you.

363
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Well, I didn't like that.

364
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,220
I've only ever beaten up one person, but I did it three times a day every day for six years.

365
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,820
Last week, he killed my family.

366
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,500
Poor guy.

367
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,980
Poor guy.

368
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,540
I forced him into it.

369
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,740
Hey, I was recently cast in a movie, which is exciting.

370
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,820
The catch is that I have to gain about 20 pounds to look right for my role.

371
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,740
And we're shooting at the end of January.

372
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,900
What's the quickest way to put on the pounds?

373
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,780
Irritatingly thin hipster in Portland.

374
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Eat a bunch of fucking food.

375
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,020
Yeah, put some food down your face.

376
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,140
Get food and then eat it.

377
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,940
It's the best.

378
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,260
Now, if you have to put on 20 pounds, do you mean 20 pounds of fat?

379
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,540
Or do you mean 20 pounds of pure American muscles?

380
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,580
Protein, diesel.

381
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,340
Pure diesel.

382
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,780
Get pure diesel.

383
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,700
If you want to get ripped, and if you want to put on muscle mass fast,

384
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,820
the best thing for you to do is start lifting.

385
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:19,460
Because I think that that works a lot of your muscle sections.

386
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,900
It works your delums, your Michelle Newlone cellos.

387
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,420
It works those pretty well.

388
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,220
Your pervases.

389
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,340
It works your pervases out real tight, real nice.

390
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:37,060
If you lift it while you're lifting it, if you can torque it, you can boost your torkelsens.

391
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,260
And maybe you should back it up and reverse it.

392
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:40,760
Yeah.

393
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Yeah.

394
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,460
I'm just throwing it.

395
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,740
Torque it, and if you can, while lifting, twerk it just a little bit.

396
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,940
Twerk it and twink it.

397
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,540
Just make it twerk.

398
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,300
I think pure squats.

399
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:56,100
If you could just do pure squats with a big barbell, you're going to get really strong.

400
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,820
And I don't think anybody ever expects a hipster to be strong.

401
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,700
No, you should add 20 pounds, but all in your legs.

402
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,660
Ooh, that's good.

403
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,260
Just remain waist up, hipster thin, giant.

404
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,380
So it's like a big, stupid, upside down Popeye.

405
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,580
Twerk it while doing dumbbell squats.

406
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,780
Be careful because that is how people accidentally poop their guts out.

407
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,820
That's a real...

408
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,180
You guys know about that?

409
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,700
Everything that holds it in down there, if you squat it too hard, it just goes and then...

410
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,900
It just gives up?

411
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,020
It just goes and then all your insides are outside.

412
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,340
Whoops.

413
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,300
But you're going to look fantastic.

414
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,260
You're going to look great.

415
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,900
You're going to lose 40 pounds and also the ability to be alive anymore.

416
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,340
Some crucial pounds though.

417
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,780
Some really good pounds that you really need.

418
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,820
Have you seen Seven Pounds Starring Will Smith?

419
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,940
Kind of like that.

420
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,500
Sort of that.

421
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,180
I think that if you're trying to gain the weight, you should find yourself one of your

422
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,260
overweight friends and make a deal with him where it's like, hey, every time you're going

423
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,820
to eat, let me know and I'm going to eat with you.

424
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,540
Make enough for two.

425
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,100
You're talking about, or you take the food away from your fat friend and then you do

426
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,740
like a one pound in, one pound out sort of...

427
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:06,980
Yeah.

428
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,780
You're like, I'll eat that big plate of fried chicken and pasta you made and you can drink

429
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,540
this PBR I was going to drink.

430
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,020
Yeah.

431
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,180
Yeah.

432
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,620
Just make sure whatever you do, nothing too drastic.

433
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:24,260
Still take your vitamins, get your omega-3s, get your immunity-boosting super fruit gummies

434
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,300
from Genesis Today.

435
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,580
You can like carbo-load, right?

436
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,460
Yeah, that would be the thing.

437
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,300
When Ray Liotta started Raging Bull and he had to play Tony Montana at the end and be

438
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,260
a really fat boxer, that's what he did.

439
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,420
He ate plate after plate of pasta.

440
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,140
Because what you don't want to do is just eat like fistfuls of like Twinkies or something

441
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,940
because yeah, you'll gain the weight and also diabetes.

442
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,100
Yeah.

443
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,340
You don't want to overdo it with the sugar, but take your vitamins.

444
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,060
That's important.

445
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,180
You guys hear about...

446
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,460
Stop walking around everywhere.

447
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,580
Do you guys hear about Paula Deen?

448
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,420
What about her?

449
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,300
She got diabetes.

450
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,620
No.

451
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,100
Yeah.

452
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:08,980
Well, she probably didn't get diabetes.

453
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,980
It was always nestled inside her core.

454
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,100
Just waiting to strike, I guess.

455
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,340
Yeah.

456
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,380
The magic wasn't in the hamburger donuts.

457
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,900
The magic was in you all along.

458
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,580
I mean, let's not make fun of the lady.

459
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,940
Why not?

460
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,340
She has a debilitating illness now, Travis.

461
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,460
Yeah.

462
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,460
What do you, what do you...

463
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,860
Well, I mean, like she probably...

464
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,700
What I'm arguing is that she might have had an undiagnosed case of diabetes for the last

465
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,980
10 years or so.

466
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,460
Okay.

467
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:39,940
It's hard.

468
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,420
I don't know.

469
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,620
I don't know an exact number.

470
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,540
She had secret beatus.

471
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,300
Right.

472
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,940
Wilfred Brimley has extremely, extremely evident diabetes.

473
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,460
Public beatus.

474
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,740
He wears his beatus on his sleeve.

475
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,420
He's got beatus.

476
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,980
Anthony Bourdain, who once famously called Paula Deen the most dangerous person in America,

477
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,420
said in a quote, he said something like,

478
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,420
well, you can't really say this is much of a surprise.

479
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,660
Yeah.

480
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,940
Maybe this forces her to get fat and boring like Graham Care.

481
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Anybody, you guys remember Graham Care?

482
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,900
I have no idea what you're talking about.

483
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,980
The galloping gourmet who tried to get healthy and no one gave a shit anymore.

484
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,580
Like, get out.

485
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,380
We don't want our chefs to be eating healthy stuff.

486
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,180
We want to keep our chefs fat.

487
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:34,500
We want the two fat ladies that are like eating bowls full of butter.

488
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,540
I love those ladies.

489
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:35,780
Yeah.

490
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,700
You know what happened to one of those ladies, Trev?

491
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,420
What?

492
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:38,740
Dead.

493
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,500
Dead as disco.

494
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,780
Yeah.

495
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,220
Now it's one fat lady and that's not a cooking show.

496
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,540
It's an episode of Hoarders.

497
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,780
What if they flip it?

498
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,420
What if we get a Freaky Friday one in one out?

499
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,220
And we do Paula Deen gets real healthy.

500
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,420
I would watch a show about that.

501
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,780
And then Jamie Oliver just like loses his mind and just eats nothing but trans fats.

502
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,140
And if they were like doing it at this,

503
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,060
there would be like a moment on the show,

504
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,780
an episode where they were meeting each other.

505
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,860
Two ships passing.

506
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
And they would fall in love forever.

507
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:26,340
Paula, I've always really thought you were real fat, right?

508
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,980
But now like I'm sort of fat and you're like less fat.

509
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,460
We're both at 220 lbs.

510
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,300
We weigh 16 stones or however many stones it is.

511
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,180
I forget.

512
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,980
Sometimes I forget how many pounds stones are.

513
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,460
I know that's weird for somebody from England, right?

514
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:52,260
But like when you guys say pounds, we think money, but it's real confusing, right?

515
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,620
So like you say, I think you weigh 220 money.

516
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,580
Yeah.

517
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,700
And you look money to me though, girl.

518
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,740
I love your silver hair.

519
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,700
I want to call you a silver fox.

520
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,860
I really love, please ignore my stretch marks.

521
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,300
I've gained quite a bit of weight.

522
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,100
What if Jamie Oliver went to a poor city and then make that city fat?

523
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,300
Or you went to like a really skinny, like well-to-do city and said,

524
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,340
I'm going to mess this place up.

525
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,140
Let's plump it.

526
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,220
San Francisco, you're making everyone else miserable.

527
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,860
Let's get the average up.

528
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,500
Everybody plump it up.

529
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,340
Plump it up, right?

530
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,140
Just like me.

531
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:33,700
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,460
Fat Jamie Oliver.

533
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,620
Mr. Paula Deen.

534
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,620
Mr. Paula Deen.

535
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,580
That's right.

536
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,740
I took her away from that fat Santa Claus guy.

537
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,580
We're in love.

538
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,660
The lady and sons and me, Jamie Oliver.

539
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,700
We're all in love.

540
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,580
We're all in love.

541
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,700
No, that's not right.

542
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,540
Griffin, do you have any Yahoo's lying around?

543
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,340
Yeah, I got a bunch.

544
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,940
Let's keep the food train rolling.

545
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,620
This one was sent in by Galiayali.

546
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,500
Thanks, Galiayali.

547
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,740
It's by Yahoo Answers user Hi.

548
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,660
Hi?

549
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,740
That's H-I-G-H and then a question mark.

550
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,620
Who asks, yes?

551
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,540
You're on Yahoo Answers, I'm going to assume.

552
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,380
What do you do to make the lettuce on your sandwich feel sexy?

553
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,920
Wait.

554
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,420
Uh-huh.

555
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:29,300
The responses to this question really shows off that Yahoo Answers is just an Algonquin

556
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,500
round table of comedy.

557
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,100
Hold on.

558
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,780
Is there no more to the question?

559
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,180
That's it?

560
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,740
No, that's it.

561
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,240
That's it.

562
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:41,620
Megan responded, lay my meat on it real slow, then squirt mayo on it.

563
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,720
God.

564
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:49,940
I get it all wet, put it under water just to make it so much more important that the

565
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:54,020
rest of the lettuce, when really I'm just trying to wash any bacteria off, then I get

566
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,540
kinky with it and bite it.

567
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,540
That took a weird practical turn in the middle.

568
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,340
Yo, girl, you know DDT and what all, and then I funk it.

569
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,780
Dress it up in something sexy, not mayo, I can't enjoy it if it's dry unless it stays

570
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:14,740
completely naked, whisper naughty things to it, put it in your mouth to bite it and suck

571
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,240
on it.

572
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,260
It's lettuce.

573
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,060
Everybody, it's lettuce.

574
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,820
Like, what's the matter with you?

575
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:23,300
Let me suck on this sandwich, fixins.

576
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,100
I forgot, I've lost the place where it's griffin and egg.

577
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:32,020
Place where it's griffin and the yahu answers things and now I just think my brother's

578
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,100
this awful, awful mess of humanity.

579
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Add salad cream.

580
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,460
No, wait, hold on.

581
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,540
Does it say add salad cream?

582
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,260
Add salad cream in all caps and a smiley face at the end of it.

583
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,340
Hey, America, that's not even a thing.

584
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,060
That's not a thing.

585
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,780
You made up salad cream for your dumb joke.

586
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,780
You mean salad dressing?

587
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,180
A special secret sauce.

588
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,540
Why are you, why are you jizzing on your sandwich?

589
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,460
Why are you objectifying lettuce?

590
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,420
Put that away.

591
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,660
How about you just eat it?

592
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,220
How about you just put it in your mouth cause lettuce?

593
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,300
Hey, internet, stop what you're doing, put down the mouse, open the front door and walk

594
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,460
outside and remember that you live in a real world with consequences for your actions.

595
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,420
Call your dad.

596
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,380
Call your dad.

597
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,580
Just call your dad.

598
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,100
Tell him what you're doing right now.

599
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,700
You're talking about fucking lettuce.

600
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,740
Can I give you guys just the fucking straight dope?

601
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,060
Yeah.

602
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,860
And here's the truth.

603
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,380
And if you're sitting at home, you're gonna, you're gonna, at first you'll, you'll raise

604
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,060
an eyebrow and then you'll admit it's true.

605
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:38,980
The only reason anybody has ever put lettuce on a sandwich is so it looks more like a sandwich

606
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,020
on TV.

607
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,500
Yes.

608
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,100
That's a hundred percent, like, oh man, this really looks like a sandwich now.

609
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,380
Not just meat on bread.

610
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,580
It looks like something on TV.

611
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,380
If you want it, sometimes I do it to trick my brain into thinking that I'm eating vegetables.

612
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,580
There's people in our listening audience right now who are like, but I like it when the sandwich

613
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,300
is crunchy.

614
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,140
Then put Fritos on that shit because Fritos taste-

615
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,100
You put potato chips on that shit.

616
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Fritos taste great.

617
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,300
Fritos are great.

618
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,260
Lettuce is, is for appearances only.

619
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,460
It should feel sexy because it's, we only want it for its looks.

620
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:08,980
Right?

621
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,580
I'm personifying lettuce now.

622
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,820
And then I want to bite it and then I'm gonna bite it.

623
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,260
Suck on that sandwich.

624
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:14,980
Mmm.

625
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,140
What are you doing?

626
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,380
That's not how you consume it.

627
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,140
How you consume it, someone said, someone responded, I'd put it in between two big baps.

628
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,060
What?

629
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,780
Sorry, what?

630
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,940
I put it in between two big-

631
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,980
African princesses?

632
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,340
Is that what that is?

633
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,580
I think that's what a bap is, right?

634
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,740
Isn't that what Halle Berry taught us?

635
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,300
To the Google.

636
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,500
To the Google, Google away, to the baps.

637
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,740
I'm pretty sure that was Halle Berry and another lady who has not maintained the same level

638
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,580
of fame over time that Halle Berry did.

639
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,100
It is actually a, a flowery soft bread roll.

640
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,300
So not sexual at all.

641
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,580
Oh, used affectionately to describe breasts.

642
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:04,820
So why do you want to eat boobs with lettuce in it?

643
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,980
I want to put some lettuce between the girl's boobs and then she'll get real mad at me.

644
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,020
Yeah, this is going to be bad.

645
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,100
That's a weird thing to do to someone.

646
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,780
Oh, was that the voicemail he left?

647
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,740
Hey, listen, I want to put some lettuce between your baps.

648
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,500
Hey, this is Steve.

649
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,620
We met at Jill's party.

650
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,860
Had a great time talking to you and I want to put some lettuce in your boobs.

651
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,140
I would like to put some crisp iceberg in between your posomes.

652
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,820
Just let's come on over.

653
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,940
So call me back.

654
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,420
Let's split a posone and do this.

655
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,340
Get this done.

656
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,820
We'll eat a posone and then we'll take a piziz and-

657
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,180
I need you to sex up my lettuce.

658
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:47,380
You know, speaking of lettuce, the best way I know of getting Eckamore is by going to

659
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:56,900
the Money Zone.

660
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,580
This message is for Scott Hammond and it's coming from your buddy Josh.

661
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:10,660
And we just want to say, hey, happy 24th birthday.

662
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,860
I bet it's cold where you're at right now.

663
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,940
Northern Ontario, Canada.

664
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,300
Yeah, I'd say it's pretty chilly.

665
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,020
Pretty chilly.

666
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,700
I hope you're snuggling up with friends and loved ones.

667
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,140
Not that those two groups are always mutually exclusive.

668
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,940
I hope you're snuggling with strangers.

669
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:28,420
Yeah.

670
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,260
Making a love connection with some weirdos.

671
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,620
Like on the bus, right?

672
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
Yeah, or in a subway.

673
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,100
Like a restaurant subway.

674
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Yeah, like a restaurant subway.

675
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,860
You're snuggled up next to a sandwich artist.

676
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,860
Um, so happy birthday to Scott, 24 years young.

677
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,260
Uh, you got one more year and you start rolling towards 30.

678
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,780
You don't look a day over 12.

679
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,060
Yeah, gorgeous.

680
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,580
Scott has asked that I sing him something, but, um, uh, he spelled my name wrong.

681
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,900
So I'll just sing one note.

682
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,780
I feel haunted now.

683
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,580
That was haunting.

684
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,460
You can get the rest of the song on your next birthday just by singing it.

685
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
Just spell my name right.

686
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,140
God damn it.

687
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:20,580
Dan Rogers, uh, you got a message coming from Mike and Tony and Danielle and Colin and Kristoff

688
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,660
and Alex and Mark and Chris.

689
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,100
Jesus.

690
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
That's with a K-R-I-S.

691
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,580
You got a lot of friends, Dan.

692
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,860
I wish I had more friends.

693
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
Guys, do you know what today is?

694
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,220
Well, you can't because Dan has all the friends.

695
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,380
Yeah.

696
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,980
Dan took all your friends and it's Dan's 24th birthday too.

697
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,020
Oh man.

698
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,340
What?

699
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,820
Dan and Scott are separated at birth.

700
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,580
Well, he's a witty, well-dressed dude.

701
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,780
Now I have no proof of that.

702
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,860
This is, this is secondhand.

703
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,540
He likes great music and has an eclectic taste for fighting game characters.

704
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,580
He knows his boos.

705
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:54,020
Weird fighting game characters like Voldo from Soul Calibur.

706
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,380
Like Pepsi Man.

707
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,220
It's deep.

708
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,020
It's a deep cut.

709
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,580
Real deep.

710
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,380
Like Spawn.

711
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,880
Yeah.

712
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,180
And he introduced all your friends to Mabim Bam, which is the most important thing you've

713
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,740
ever heard of.

714
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,420
Bam, which is the most important thing you've ever done or ever will do.

715
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,580
So thank you, Dan, for that.

716
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,740
And happy birthday, my friend.

717
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,420
So go out there, enjoy some of the boos you know so well and enjoy doing the hustle.

718
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,300
Because that's, that's your life.

719
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,420
That's your day to day.

720
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,260
And you, you've lived 24 years of it.

721
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,700
No reason to change now.

722
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,500
Lean into it.

723
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,220
That's what I say.

724
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,820
Too old to change.

725
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,940
Keep talking about how Blanca is your favorite Street Fighter character.

726
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,980
You've earned it.

727
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,140
Hey, and speaking of people we love, because we do very much love Dan and Scott, we also

728
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,100
love the other podcast on the Maximum Fun Network.

729
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,500
So let's hear from one of those right now.

730
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,060
Hello there.

731
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,340
My name is Graham Clark.

732
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,620
And I'm Dave Shumka.

733
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,460
And together we host a podcast called Stop Podcasting Yourself.

734
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,460
This is a file that you download from the internet and then you listen to it in your

735
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:01,780
pod.

736
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,220
What's that about, you ask?

737
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,660
Well, who are you to ask?

738
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,780
Who do you think you are?

739
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
Yeah, get lost, bozo.

740
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:12,180
We're a couple of stand up comedians in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

741
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,820
And every week we bring a guest on the show.

742
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,180
Sometimes they're Canadian.

743
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,380
Sometimes they're not.

744
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,740
Sometimes they're a ghost.

745
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,020
It's like you're sitting in on a friendly afternoon chat.

746
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,060
Plus we're Canadian.

747
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,820
So you get a tax break.

748
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:30,340
You can find us on iTunes or online at Maximumfun.org.

749
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,820
Huh?

750
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,940
Ooh, spell.

751
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,380
Guys, a couple of months ago I asked a girl out.

752
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,060
She said yes.

753
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,260
So we went on a couple of dates.

754
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,540
Everything went fine at first.

755
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,300
But for the next few weeks she was constantly busy anytime I asked her out.

756
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,700
She would agree to go somewhere, but sometimes something would always come up on the day

757
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,180
of.

758
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,060
I got the hint.

759
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,660
Figured it wasn't going anywhere.

760
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:58,820
After about a month, she wanted to go out again, but yet stood me up a few more times.

761
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,020
I understand things come up, but this is ridiculous.

762
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,780
Should I continue trying to pursue a relationship or just move on?

763
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,260
That's from Confused in New York.

764
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,340
What's the fucking debate?

765
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,180
You move on.

766
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,220
Yeah, you get out.

767
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,940
Just leave.

768
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,260
And maybe take some of her stuff with you when you go.

769
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,900
I've wanted, listen, I have wanted to

770
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,300
like pickles for as long as I can remember.

771
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,580
And every few months I'll open up a pickle jar.

772
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:32,180
I'll get a nice, you know, long kosher dill, something that looks real crisp and great.

773
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,100
And I'll take a bite and I'll say, no, I still hate this.

774
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,580
Still no.

775
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,900
That's what she's doing with you right now.

776
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,580
She keeps forgetting that she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you.

777
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,660
So she'll call and she'll talk to you for a few minutes.

778
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,780
Then she'll say, hey, wait a minute.

779
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,140
I still don't like this.

780
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,580
I want to stand him up again.

781
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,460
That's what's happening.

782
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,460
At best, at worst, she's just a fucking jerk and you don't have to waste it.

783
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,980
She's saying, I'm bored.

784
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,820
Maybe I'll make plans with him until something better comes along and then cancel them.

785
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,660
You should do like pickles should have done to me long ago and dump me.

786
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,740
Do you know how many two thirds uneaten pickles I've thrown in the trash?

787
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,340
That's what your heart is like right now.

788
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,260
Yeah, it's like a two thirds uneaten pickle.

789
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,980
Yeah, you're better than this.

790
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,460
You're better.

791
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,940
You are.

792
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,220
Yeah, you deserve better than this.

793
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,340
There's somebody out there.

794
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,540
You're in New York.

795
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,020
Okay.

796
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,620
That's that's that's the Windy City, Windy City.

797
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,100
Yeah, but City of Brotherly Love and Big Shoulders.

798
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,900
Get in there and find somebody who is worth your time because this person is not.

799
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,180
And boy, howdy.

800
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:37,060
If you've never gotten the opportunity to really hardcore reject somebody out.

801
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,260
Oh, man, that's going to do wonders for your yeah, for your ego.

802
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,780
I, I think that it's I mean, I've been through this before.

803
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:50,260
That person where you see other people going through it and someone like keeps canceling

804
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,260
plans on them and like flaking out and you're like, hey, come on, why is that?

805
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,460
Look at what's happening.

806
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,780
But we've all been in that position before where it's like, you know, things are coming

807
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,100
up.

808
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,460
There's a good excuse here.

809
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,820
Like she had to hang out with her sister tonight, so she had to cancel.

810
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,220
It's always so much harder to see it from the inside.

811
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,500
Yeah, you know, yes.

812
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,580
And so this is us telling you from the outside, get out.

813
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,260
Let us into your heart first.

814
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
Let us inside.

815
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,420
And now that we're inside, we're telling you like, hey, this is a mess.

816
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,540
You need to get it sounds like she's a little bit evil.

817
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,780
She's giving you the little bit.

818
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,060
She's giving you the run around.

819
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,820
Why should want to give you the round run around?

820
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,740
I mean, it seems like a surefire way to heat things up, but it seems like all it's doing

821
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,460
is slowing you down.

822
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,060
That's just from us.

823
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,980
But us, us and our friend, John Popper, our dear friend, John Popper.

824
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,780
We all agree.

825
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,100
We talk.

826
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:40,820
Hey, John.

827
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,540
Hi, John.

828
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,340
Thank you for listening.

829
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,900
Thank you for listening.

830
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,380
Hey, John.

831
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,020
We'll see you right about next week at the Catskills.

832
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,980
Worry about your weight.

833
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,300
Worry about you.

834
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,060
Kind of up and kind of up and down with you.

835
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,980
Up and down, but I hope you're OK.

836
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,500
You need a lot of lung capacity, and it seems like sandwiches aren't helping in that respect.

837
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,740
He's like wicked thin, but like every time he gets super thin, I think, well, that's

838
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,860
a lot more Coke he's doing.

839
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,940
Yeah, and then when he gets super fat, I think, well, I cut back on the Coke, but now I love

840
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,580
sandwiches, so I don't know what to do with John.

841
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,940
It seems like Coke and sandwiches are giving him the run around.

842
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,420
Why do they want to give him the round run around?

843
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,260
Ironically, if every once in a while he would just get up and run around,

844
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,380
he would probably sit down a little bit, which would be really good for him.

845
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Yeah, but then the then the Coke brings him back.

846
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,000
Sure.

847
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,460
Stop it, Griffin.

848
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,940
Suck it in, suck it in, suck it in if you're into tanner rambling.

849
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,500
Uh huh.

850
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,220
Come on, Griffin.

851
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:37,940
You know all the words.

852
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,340
I don't.

853
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Please don't pretend like you don't know all the words.

854
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,540
You do you want to do it?

855
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:41,940
Go for it.

856
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,260
I don't.

857
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:42,500
Go for it.

858
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:42,980
I don't know it.

859
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,820
I get the I get the rap break of that song and the rap break of one week makes up in

860
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:53,540
my head because in my head, Blues Traveler and Barenaked Ladies are just one big blob of.

861
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,540
Blue naked average music of drug addiction.

862
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,500
Griffin, you know what I mean?

863
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,140
Don't hold back.

864
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,380
Are you talking about Yahoo?

865
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,660
Uh, no, I'm talking about a French kiss from a Parisian lady.

866
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,940
Yes, I'm talking about Yahoo.

867
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,140
I'm ready.

868
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:13,940
Here comes Yahoo.

869
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,540
This one was sent in by Lisa Holifield.

870
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,260
Thank you, Lisa.

871
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,780
It's by Yahoo Answers user Steveman3015.

872
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,380
That's a pretty good username.

873
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,420
Yeah.

874
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:34,180
Who asks, um, this, what would happen if Uncle Jesse, in parentheses, John Stamos, from full

875
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,580
house, do if he got shorted a nugget at McDonald's.

876
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,220
Say he orders a 20 piece nugget.

877
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,260
He receives his order.

878
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,460
He counts the nuggets and he sees he only received 19 of them.

879
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,100
What would he do?

880
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,180
Now, this, this could just be a thought exercise that this guy's doing, but I would like to

881
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:00,180
think that like this man has Steveman has been shorted a nugget and he's like, I don't

882
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,220
know what to do.

883
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:01,700
That's right.

884
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,020
Where can I look for advice towards John Stamos?

885
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,620
Uncle Jesse from full house.

886
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,380
His, his w w u j f f h d bracelet.

887
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,700
I, I think that John Stamos would get really mad at the person behind the counter, but

888
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,180
then after a moment's thought, he would have mercy.

889
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,620
Jesus.

890
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,420
I think, I think he would have mercy.

891
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,300
Give me another nugget.

892
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,820
I think he would, um, I think he would get up and he would leave the, he would leave

893
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,860
the McDonald's restaurant because he's god damn Stamos.

894
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,700
Why the hell is he at McDonald's ordering chicken nuggets?

895
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,340
Yeah.

896
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,860
He could be eating chicken nuggets.

897
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,740
Oh, Rebecca remains back instead.

898
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,500
He's there and McDonald's buying.

899
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,820
Maybe this person was writing some really shitty fan fiction and they're like, well,

900
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,540
I'm stumped.

901
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,380
I've hit a wall.

902
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,020
I don't know where to go with this story next.

903
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,020
Like, I, I.

904
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,260
Maybe you can choose your own adventure starring John Stamos.

905
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,980
I know I'm onto something with the missing nugget.

906
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,380
Pretty sure that's a pretty deep name.

907
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,660
Have you guys read that new book, John Stamos and the Case of the Missing Nugget?

908
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,620
You know what I bet happened.

909
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,500
I bet Comet got up on the table and nibbled it.

910
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,020
I'm just kidding.

911
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,780
Comet's dead as fuck, everybody.

912
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,300
And then Michelle looked over and said, how wound?

913
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,060
And it was adorable.

914
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,060
No, she didn't, Travis.

915
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,140
Cause she's 35 fucking years old now and John Stamos is dead.

916
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,500
And that was Stephanie, you dumb, you dumb bitch.

917
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,780
Hey, hey Justin.

918
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,580
It was an interchangeable catchphrase that both of them said.

919
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,420
That's uncorrect.

920
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,380
It is correct.

921
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,180
You are an asshole and a liar.

922
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,580
You sir, you have slandered me for the last time.

923
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,780
Full house trivia.

924
00:41:49,780 --> 00:42:00,020
Michelle, did you know that Ashley Olsen and Mary Kay Olsen had to wear flippers?

925
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,060
They had to wear false teeth because they came in at different speeds.

926
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,180
You didn't know that, did you?

927
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:04,820
Well, now you do.

928
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,540
Did you know that on that show, one kid was played by two kids and then two kids are played

929
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,260
by three kids?

930
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,180
Did you guys know that who could name the original name of Full House?

931
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:22,020
That's originally called House of Comics was the original bitch and it was not a good name.

932
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,100
Sourdough Sweethearts was the original name of the show.

933
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,220
What's with all these dudes?

934
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,340
Yeah.

935
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,380
Yeah, you know what the weirdest thing about Full House is?

936
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,580
If the mom wasn't dead, it would be the weirdest goddamn show on television.

937
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,660
Have you guys seen the new episode of Lazy Uncles?

938
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,140
At one point, one of them was living in the living room.

939
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,380
They just like strung up a sheet and that was his bedroom.

940
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,460
The theme song originally went, everywhere you look, there's an uncle.

941
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,900
There are uncles fucking everywhere.

942
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,140
And you know what's even weirder?

943
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,300
Only Uncle Jesse was related by blood.

944
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,100
Joey was just there.

945
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,900
Just there.

946
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,740
There's a fucking embarrassment of uncles in this household.

947
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,100
A murder of uncles.

948
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,500
That was actually the first title of the show.

949
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,980
The original title was a murder of uncles.

950
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,460
Do you know that for seven years, Joey Gladstone would meet a woman at a bar and she would say,

951
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,140
should we go back to your place?

952
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,780
And he would say, I'm not sure that's a good idea.

953
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,700
I live with my friend and his brother-in-law and his three daughters

954
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,460
and my brother-in-law's wife and their twin sons and our dog.

955
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,700
And Kimmy Gibbler from time to time.

956
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:41,700
And Kimmy Gibbler occasionally and also all of my puppets and Popeye toys.

957
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,100
Right.

958
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,260
And I have to record the Rush Hour Renegades.

959
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,620
I just probably get going.

960
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,820
You know, if that show recorded today, Rush Hour Renegades would be a podcast, right?

961
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
And I don't need the competition for it.

962
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,300
That's true.

963
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,380
And maybe the Smash Club.

964
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,260
Is that it?

965
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:54,740
The Smash Club?

966
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,180
The Smash Club lives in their house?

967
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,420
I thought so.

968
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,420
I felt like that show was like some kind of horrific like MC Escher drawing

969
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,860
where no one could escape the house.

970
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,900
Like Uncle Jesse got married and had twins and they put him in the attic.

971
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,380
Yeah.

972
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,620
Well, like some kind of crazy aunt.

973
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:18,820
Let's also remember that Jesse's last name changed midstream and no one commented on it.

974
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:19,140
It did?

975
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,780
So I'm not sure logic and reason hold sway in this.

976
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,180
True.

977
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,900
How do you know so fucking much about Full House Train?

978
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,900
It used to be Jesse Cochran, but John Stamos wanted something that sounded more Greek.

979
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,140
Yeah.

980
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:29,860
More true to his hair.

981
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,620
So he picked the most Greek name that there is on the earth.

982
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,340
Yeah, right.

983
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,540
A Stephanopoulos hero, mustache back hair.

984
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,540
Please.

985
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,420
Can that be my name?

986
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,620
Hey, I've been dating someone for a month now

987
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,940
and I've just been given a things have been moving too fast for me type speech

988
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,900
with accompanying positive comments about me and the relationship

989
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,740
alongside their request to slow things down.

990
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,180
Granted, we do have a high level of emotional and physical intimacy after only 30 days.

991
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,060
But is there any translation of this kind of talk that actually means

992
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,300
let's take things slower and work this out?

993
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:07,140
Or is this just the beginning of the ending?

994
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,780
And this is from no one to fold them.

995
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,780
And a little bit of additional details here.

996
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:15,620
This is from a girl talking about the guy she was dating.

997
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,660
Oh, interesting.

998
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,860
That flips it.

999
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:20,820
So this is the guy had the speech of we're moving too fast.

1000
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,460
I would suspect, and this is my cynical opinion,

1001
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,460
but I would suspect that the guy says that because, you know,

1002
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,220
he's not ready for that kind of commitment and wants to kind of look around.

1003
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,060
I'm not sure.

1004
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,560
I'm not.

1005
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,220
I don't know, Trav.

1006
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,620
I think this might be the one case where, like,

1007
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:45,060
I know coded language is huge in relationships and I get it.

1008
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,220
And I know it's like it's value.

1009
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,020
But maybe this is a situation where taking it face value.

1010
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,540
I mean, what's the worst that could happen?

1011
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,260
You know, if you get spooked and you start trying to hold on tighter,

1012
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,900
that is certainly not going to alleviate this problem.

1013
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
Yeah, you know, I completely agree.

1014
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,540
I think that, you know, now that you've said that,

1015
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,740
I think the worst thing to do is to try to read into it and try it.

1016
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,980
Because you look at it one of two ways.

1017
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,900
A, take it at face value and it is true.

1018
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,380
And he just wants to slow down and kind of take it slow, not rush it.

1019
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,660
B, he's not sure and he's kind of doubting if it's going to work out.

1020
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,660
Like, either way, play it cool.

1021
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,580
Do what you do and don't worry about it.

1022
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,660
Because if you try to rush it and you try to push and pull him closer,

1023
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,780
that's going to scare him away.

1024
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,660
And otherwise, you're completely going against what he's just asked to do.

1025
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,060
I'm going to give an informed opinion on this.

1026
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,180
I'm going to need to know a whole lot more about that physical intimacy.

1027
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,820
Yeah, Griffin needs you to describe, like, what's the lettuce doing?

1028
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:45,540
Yeah.

1029
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,020
Yeah, break it down like you were making a sandwich.

1030
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,940
Which one of you is the baps?

1031
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,020
Can I also say, and now I stand by the advice we have given.

1032
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,180
I think that that's the right play here.

1033
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,820
But I don't understand people who want to slow it down.

1034
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,180
I don't get it.

1035
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:14,420
Like, are you a different species whose lifespan is not already, like, cosmically insignificant?

1036
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,420
If all of human history were a football field,

1037
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:22,500
your life would be a blade of grass at the end of the end zone.

1038
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,700
Like, you don't have time to slow it down.

1039
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,940
Mine would be the goalpost.

1040
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:29,560
Yes.

1041
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,780
I lead a pretty important life.

1042
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:38,900
Your birth and eventual life achievements are the end point, the end game of human evolution.

1043
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,860
Everybody knows that.

1044
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,140
But for the rest of us.

1045
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,100
Oh, for everyone else.

1046
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,380
For the rest of us, plebs.

1047
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,740
Tim Tebow actually believes that it's like everything past the 20 yard line.

1048
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,540
It's like a whole bunch.

1049
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,060
Is that a Tim Tebow joke?

1050
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,460
That is a very, very obscure Tim Tebow evolution joke.

1051
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:58,900
Okay, great.

1052
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:04,340
I think that it just seems like when you're in a relationship and you met someone you really

1053
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:09,780
connected with and you have this passion and emotion, it just seems like the idea of saying,

1054
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,540
like, we need to slow down completely goes against everything.

1055
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,460
Like, hey, this is going so good and we're having a great time, so let's ruin it.

1056
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,420
Yeah, the best-

1057
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,420
Wait, see, now I'm flipping on this.

1058
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:20,920
Yeah.

1059
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,100
Like, why?

1060
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,900
Why should you be in a relationship with somebody who doesn't want more of a relationship with you?

1061
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:29,060
More of a relationship with you.

1062
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,980
And this is completely a personal thing.

1063
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,900
I just don't get it.

1064
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,420
If you like the person and you're getting along well, what are you waiting for?

1065
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,780
Yeah, why are you slowing down?

1066
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,300
Like, are you afraid you're going to use it all up?

1067
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,500
Let me play devil's advocate here because there is such thing as moving too fast.

1068
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:43,460
Like, let's not be...

1069
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,620
Like, if this person, and I'm not saying the listener, I'm sure they have a good head on

1070
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,660
their shoulders, but if you can move it too fast and be like, hey, baby names.

1071
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:54,020
Like, we've been dating three weeks.

1072
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,940
It's not baby name time.

1073
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:00,420
So maybe we don't know the extent to how fast this thing is, how fast this bullet train is moving.

1074
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,300
Counterpoint though, I think that you can...

1075
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,140
And maybe this is why he said it, and I think this is the way to look at it.

1076
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:12,420
The only way you can move too fast is if you're moving too fast for one of the people in the

1077
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:12,920
relationship.

1078
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,900
So I think it's not that there is a set speed that every relationship should move at,

1079
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:26,340
and it's like a template everyone should follow, but it might be that it is moving too fast for him

1080
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,220
and fine for you.

1081
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,940
Okay, here's what you do.

1082
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,060
I got this.

1083
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,100
I got this solved.

1084
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,940
I think we're close to giving good advice on this.

1085
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,440
So...

1086
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,260
I know, we're looping around the bend.

1087
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:42,340
I think you need to slow it down maybe even more than that person wants and make them really

1088
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:44,500
think about what they want out of the relationship.

1089
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:48,820
Slow it down to the point where, you know, the phone calls don't come as often, and that

1090
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,180
if they want out, let them get out.

1091
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,220
But if you pull back on some of the stuff, some of that good, good loving, both emotional

1092
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,020
and physical, then they're gonna realize what they've been missing.

1093
00:49:59,060 --> 00:49:59,540
Let me say...

1094
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,980
And maybe that's all it takes.

1095
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,460
I don't think that him telling you this, like being open and saying that things are moving

1096
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:09,860
too fast for him, I don't think that is as bad as him not telling you that but still

1097
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:10,580
acting on it.

1098
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,300
Everybody's had that happen to them, and it sucks where they just stop returning your

1099
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,900
calls or they, you know, they try to slow it down with actions instead of telling you,

1100
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:21,860
like, straight up, I feel uncomfortable with this.

1101
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:26,420
I think that that is better than them just acting like it and not telling you and you

1102
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,020
thinking that they just don't like you anymore.

1103
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,900
Just, yeah, slow it down.

1104
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:31,700
Pump the brakes a little bit.

1105
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:33,300
Pump the brakes.

1106
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,940
Don't be afraid.

1107
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,700
Don't be afraid.

1108
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:37,700
Don't be afraid.

1109
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:39,540
Shh.

1110
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,340
We're here for you.

1111
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,380
I take good care of you.

1112
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:43,620
Hand me that lettuce.

1113
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,620
Um, let's, let's continue this serious streak by jumping into a very, very serious Yahoo.

1114
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,460
It was sent in by Daniel Parker.

1115
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:52,180
Thank you, Daniel.

1116
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:03,380
It's, it's by Yahoo Answers user PokeFanJeremy who asks seriously, do you consider a Pokémon

1117
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,740
fetish as bestiality?

1118
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,420
I was arguing with my friends about that.

1119
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,780
I was saying, no, it's not as Pokémon are based off of animals.

1120
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,220
They are fictional and are not considered bestiality.

1121
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,580
They say that Pokémon are like 90% animal.

1122
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,820
So that makes it count as bestiality.

1123
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,780
What do you think?

1124
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,940
And BTW, no mean comments.

1125
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,140
I do not need them here.

1126
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,300
Yeah, you do not here.

1127
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,900
I think, I think you do.

1128
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,420
I think, I think PokeFanJeremy might have a vested interest in this discussion.

1129
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:45,220
I'm, I don't think this is just a logistical exercise for, I like, I enjoy that PokeFanJeremy

1130
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:49,220
felt the need to clarify that he was arguing that it wasn't bestiality.

1131
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,300
I think we could have inferred that.

1132
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,060
Yeah, we know the side of the argument.

1133
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,500
You're on Jeremy.

1134
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,140
I think, um, the, the, I don't know.

1135
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,940
It's sort of a damn if you do, damn if you don't like it's either bestiality or a sexual

1136
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:04,660
obsession.

1137
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,220
Or a sexual obsession with Japanese space monsters.

1138
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,140
Yeah, wouldn't you rather be bestiality?

1139
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:13,220
I think I would rather it be bestiality.

1140
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,780
Because then I could like go to conventions and stuff.

1141
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,420
I imagine the Pokémon fetish or community could probably fit in a very, very small room.

1142
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,700
Christ, I hope that that lasts.

1143
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:26,660
I'm willing to bet that if you go to the bestiality conventions and you, you reveal that the animal

1144
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,500
you're attracted to is Pokémon.

1145
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:28,820
Yeah.

1146
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,580
You're not welcome back to the conference.

1147
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,060
I'm sorry to disagree with you Griffin, but a Pokémon fetish convention takes up a very,

1148
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,100
very big space.

1149
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,300
It's called PAX East.

1150
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,820
Buzzing.

1151
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:42,340
That's probably not true.

1152
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,740
Pokémon are still a thing, right?

1153
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,740
The magic of Pokémon is still very much alive in some people's hearts.

1154
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,380
Okay.

1155
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,700
So can I get a, can I get a verdict on this?

1156
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,220
Like, can we actually rule on this?

1157
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,420
Is, is Pokémon, I mean, I'm going to say they're, they're beasts.

1158
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,540
Can we get the logical in nature, but they're still beasts, right?

1159
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:04,100
Let's get some opinions from the, uh, the peanut gallery.

1160
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,940
There's actually only one answer, but it was elected as the best answer chosen by voters.

1161
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:13,220
I think that it isn't and shouldn't be considered bestiality because of four reasons.

1162
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:19,860
One, like you said, one, God, one, like you said, they are based off of real animals.

1163
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,180
Two, it's not like you are having sex with them.

1164
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,380
They are fictional.

1165
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,460
I don't know.

1166
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,740
I think you could thread that needle.

1167
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:32,260
Three, even if they are 90% animal, having a lot of Pokémon is like having a lot of pets.

1168
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,220
Four, loving Pokémon and having a lot of them.

1169
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,780
Hold on.

1170
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:36,100
Yeah.

1171
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,340
Number three is saying it's cool because it's not bestiality if you bone your pets.

1172
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:40,660
Yeah.

1173
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,780
That's just great.

1174
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,020
That's caught me.

1175
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,300
Um, four loving Pokémon and having a lot of them is like being a cat lady.

1176
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,500
If you love cats and own 20 of them, does that mean that you have a cat fetish and

1177
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,940
it should be considered bestiality?

1178
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,940
Those are my four reasons why a fetish for Pokémon shouldn't be considered bestiality.

1179
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,060
Sources, my perspective.

1180
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,020
What did you do your doctorate on?

1181
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,100
Actually, I did my doctorate on whether or not Pokémon...

1182
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:04,980
I did it on a Yahoo!

1183
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,180
Answers forum.

1184
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,500
It was a five-part dissertation on...

1185
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,100
It's, uh, it's my, my capstone is called fucking Charmander.

1186
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:20,820
Um, the word fetish means not like you're really into it and interested in them and

1187
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:25,780
a collector and a fan, it means that you cannot become sexually aroused unless they are present.

1188
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,420
Right.

1189
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:31,140
So it's not like being a cat lady and owning a bunch of cats.

1190
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,700
It's like masturbating to a Pokémon poster.

1191
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,020
Yeah.

1192
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:38,580
It's not like I, I really like watching Gentle Ben.

1193
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,020
So I'm bestiality.

1194
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,660
No, like, just liking animals isn't the same thing.

1195
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:43,940
It's, it's completely different.

1196
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,420
It's like you like to sex them.

1197
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,020
You want to sex the Pokémon.

1198
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,380
You want to sex the Pokémon.

1199
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:50,100
And as I know...

1200
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,660
You look around and you choose them for sexing.

1201
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:53,060
Yeah.

1202
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:57,540
I don't want to be a stickler about this, but if you want to have sex with Pokémon,

1203
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,740
it doesn't really matter what label you put on it.

1204
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,300
Yeah.

1205
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,260
You're not, you're not going to...

1206
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,900
It's not like you need to make it easy to explain to your grandparents, okay?

1207
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,060
Like...

1208
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,780
For the last time, grandma.

1209
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,420
Okay.

1210
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,780
Listen, just follow me here.

1211
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,260
Just follow me.

1212
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,860
It's not bestiality.

1213
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,780
It's not weird like that.

1214
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,700
I just want to fuck Charmander.

1215
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,420
I just want to fuck his brains out.

1216
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,220
Is that okay?

1217
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:24,900
Except he's a fire type, that would probably be pretty, probably be pretty uncomfortable

1218
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,340
on your, on your business region.

1219
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:27,620
Yeah.

1220
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,580
That is simply ghastly.

1221
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,900
Do you guys think that Herman Cain has this?

1222
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,660
He's got a poke addiction?

1223
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,220
Yeah.

1224
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:47,540
No, I think he appreciates Pokémon for their, for their, the allegory to the humanity struggles.

1225
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:52,740
I guess, but I think that eventually that morphs, that metamorphs into sexual frustration.

1226
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,340
Well, yes.

1227
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,500
Why can't, just why can't I fuck Squirtle?

1228
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:57,860
That's a good question.

1229
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,580
It's right there.

1230
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,940
It's right there on my Game Boy.

1231
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:02,580
It's so close, it's so far.

1232
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,020
It's right there on my Game Boy Color.

1233
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,820
It's so vivid.

1234
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,340
I'm going to close the lid on my wiener.

1235
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,260
That's life.

1236
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:14,100
Hey, listen, thank you so much for joining us again for another episode.

1237
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,340
You can find us at nbmbam.com.

1238
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,500
Don't forget there are forums at maximumfun.org where you can go and discuss the show.

1239
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,700
And where you can also go to download all the other wonderful maximumfun.org podcasts.

1240
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:34,340
You need to grab the new episode of Jesse Thorn's show Bullseye, which is a, sort of a, a, a new

1241
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,140
branding for The Sound of Young America is called Bullseye now.

1242
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,900
And we were on the last episode.

1243
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,140
We did a segment about pop culture advice.

1244
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:45,940
And if you would listen to that, and if you like it, maybe send Jesse a note and say,

1245
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,700
Hey, I really like this.

1246
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,060
Let's, let's have it again.

1247
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,980
Cause I I'm, I'm enjoying it very much.

1248
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,220
Yes.

1249
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,220
Because we're enjoying being real famous and not just like you people famous.

1250
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:01,060
Yeah, you can actually hear, also hear that show on some NPR stations and it's on, uh,

1251
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:02,100
XM public radio.

1252
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,940
So radio guys heard of it.

1253
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,700
I bet you have.

1254
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:05,940
Yeah.

1255
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:06,500
Radio.

1256
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,660
I want a new thing.

1257
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,700
It's sweeping me up.

1258
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,540
I want a new thing is sweeping the nation.

1259
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,020
I want to thank, uh, John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song.

1260
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:19,460
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, which it seems like in the past

1261
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:24,260
week or two, like I've gotten like 50 people who are like, Hey, I bought that album.

1262
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,060
It's super good.

1263
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,740
Um, it is super good.

1264
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,700
You should buy it.

1265
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,300
Also, if you haven't listened to Roderick on the line, it's a John Roderick and Merlin

1266
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:32,500
Mann's new podcasts.

1267
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,780
That shit's super good too.

1268
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:38,500
It's not on the max fun network, but, um, although the max fun network is adding a new

1269
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,140
show, so we don't know what we haven't heard yet.

1270
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,340
It's a secret, but, uh, we're getting a new brother, a new little brother, a sister, uh,

1271
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:46,900
very soon.

1272
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,460
So does this mean that Jesse will love us less?

1273
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,020
Yeah.

1274
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,500
Yeah.

1275
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,980

00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,820
Oh, and, uh, I have a new show.

1288
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,020
It's about television.

1289
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,220
I do it with my wife, Sydney.

1290
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,180
It's called the satellite.

1291
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:48,260
It's called satellite dish with Justin and Sydney.

1292
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,420
You can find it on iTunes and get it there.

1293
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,980
Ross on Twitter at the sat dish.

1294
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,540
And I also have another podcast called in case of emergency where we talk about five

1295
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,420
step plans to survive all kinds of different emergencies.

1296
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,220
Check it out.

1297
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,340
I also have a podcast call.

1298
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:06,420
I wish my fucking brothers would focus on one show at once and give it all the attention

1299
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,700
that it needs so it can grow into the multimedia empire that I want it to become.

1300
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,900
And they obviously don't because they're fucking doing other shit instead of the shit

1301
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,460
that I'm on.

1302
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,300
That's on Twitter too.

1303
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:16,020
That's on Twitter.

1304
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,700
So Facebook it and tumble.

1305
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:18,820
Grindr.

1306
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,900
This final, this final, this final grinder question was sent in by Galiayali.

1307
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:31,860
It's by Yahoo Answers user Harlemkid82485 who asks, was anybody else touched by the

1308
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,460
curious case of Benjamin Button?

1309
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,140
I'm Travis McElroy.

1310
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,260
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1311
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,700
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1312
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:42,740
Kiss your dad.

1313
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,860
Swear on the lips.

1314
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,020
Keep your heart, three stacks.

1315
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:50,980
Keep your heart.

1316
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:53,140
Hey, keep your heart, three stacks.

1317
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:54,180
Keep your heart.

1318
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,460
Man, these girls are smart.

1319
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,300
Three stacks, these girls are smart.

1320
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:01,620
Play your part.
