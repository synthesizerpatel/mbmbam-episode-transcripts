1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's familiar, but not too familiar, but not too not familiar.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey I wanna, just say hey I wanna.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Like the Chilean miners emerging.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Like Chilean miners.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Is that a reboot? Is that what this is? Are we refreshing the franchise?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is just celebrating the hardworking miners of Chile.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of what?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This isn't like about anything. I'm just glad that they're there.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, my ice cream break's coming up too. You wanna maybe go to Chile? Maybe we could go chill on the beaches of Chile.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Like Chilean miners emerging from a mine. We've returned for another week.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know, a lot of people liked that when I did it right after those famous guys came out, so I thought, what if I brought it back?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I mean, Chilean miners are still coming out of mines.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sure, yeah. They haven't stopped, I hope.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right? I mean, they're going in there getting butane and gold. I don't know.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They're getting butane?

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They go down there with just plastic shopping bags and they just scoop up the butte.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So we're back for a second run on the Max Fun Network. Thank you so much for rejoining us.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is my brother, my brother and me, an advice show for the modern era. I am Justin McElroy.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're gonna pry that Chilean miner bit from my cold dead hands.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But again, we've reemerged. Second week on Max Fun Network.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The response from you guys was so, so nice. Really meant a lot.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you haven't been to the forums yet, over at Max Fun, there's a lot of good discussion, both NBNB AM and NBNB AM non-related.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So move over there and there's a thread, a new Max Fun podcast.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My brother, my brother and me. You can introduce yourself, say hi.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But everybody's getting acquainted there. Let's get acquainted here with some wisdom.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go with our first question. What do you guys say?

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Just get into it.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
My friends keep on telling me that if I don't go to my senior prom, I'll regret it.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Personally, I don't care for dancing and wasting money.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is this one of those things I'll regret not doing when I'm old?

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Anti-Footloose Gmail.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I actually made up that name because they didn't attach one and I really wanted to talk about footloose.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, good. Oh, good.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Good, Travis.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This show has become a construction.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Isn't that perjury? Isn't that what that is? Isn't that illegal?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't believe in perjury in this guy.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, but I think it's definitely about the ritual.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not inherently fun, but you'll be kind of a lonely heart, I think, if you don't go, right?

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have to go.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have to go.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, the thing is, this is that future, present tense time travel thing.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Look to the future 20 years from now.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't want to be the person that says, oh, no, I didn't go to my senior prom.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because everyone you tell that to will go, oh, why not?

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to go. It's part of your growing up. It's part of life.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Plus, there's got to be a girl, you can ask. There's always a girl.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I know you don't like wasting money and dancing, but you'll be surprised how little of the dancing you'll actually do.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And it's not a waste. It's like a traditional, I don't know.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, most importantly, you only get one shot at it.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's not like, well, I don't want to go now. I'll try again in five years.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is your only chance to go to your senior prom.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a good point.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's actually a common misconception, Travis.

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You can keep going to high school dances after you have left that particular educational institution.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Which reminds me, we do need to wrap this show early.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I need to get over to Skeffington's to pick up my tails.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Nice.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah, it's going to be rough, Anti-Footloose. It's going to be bad.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't think. I don't know. I never looked forward to my formal dances whenever I was in high school.

67
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I actually almost skipped one because I was going to go stag.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But instead, I just stayed home and I played EverQuest for most of the night.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I mean, it was right after the Dungeons of Narath expansion came out.

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, sure, sure.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But I did end up going, you've got to pay the money.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You've got to pay your dues and maybe you'll rub your wiener on a butt to hip-hop music.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's an exchange there.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It is a trade-off.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But yeah, you'll regret it if you don't go years from now.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Maybe not immediately.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it won't be fun, but at least you'll have been there.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And you can lie about it later.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's also a really good excuse to ask somebody out if you're even trying to work up the nerve.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Because everybody needs a date. Nobody wants to go solo.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So take advantage of that and prey on their desperation.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What should I do about a girl in my class who's a terrible buzzkill?

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
She always inserts herself into everyone's conversations and ruins the fun by talking about her divorced parents, human trafficking, or 9-11.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Was that good, Travis?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You like your little chuckle?

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I think that person would be awesome.

87
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A little chuckle from 9-11. Good, good.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm trying to imagine that conversation.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's like, do you guys want to go to Chipotle for lunch?

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you maybe want to hit up Panera?

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey, by the way, that reminds me. 9-11.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I remember the last time I went to Chipotle, it's when my divorced parents sold me into slavery.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If I remember correctly, it was September 11th.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Have a good burrito.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Enjoy. Enjoy your meal.

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to bummer all over your chips.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is it? Did you get the spicy aioli?

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's nice. You know who loves that? Osama bin Laden.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He gets it in his beard.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you going to get vegetables?

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll tell you about a vegetable I know.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I remember Terry Shivo.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Whoa!

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's not time for the Shive to come back.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I may have jumped the gun a little bit there.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A little bit, but somebody's got to push into the light, right?

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Somebody's got to determine how long the deadline is on stuff like that.

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'd let that one simmer for another six months.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I would say you've got to try to trump them.

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No matter how dark they go, you've got to go darker.

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Divorce parents, go Batman, talk about dead parents.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They won't see that coming.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Push them into a darker place until you're bumming them out,

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and maybe they'll get the message.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I have a way better idea.

116
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, good.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Better than bring up Terry Shivo?

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, it has nothing to do with that.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why don't you learn to play and then constantly carry around a cornet

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
or a small trumpet and just carry it around,

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and any time she opens her mouth to say literally anything,

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
just start playing a happy little St. Louis jazz number.

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Just like a little bit of Zadaran's.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Just get in there right in her face and just like...

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Nobody can speak, first of all, or be sad when they hear that music.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who could be sad?

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's an interesting point you just made about super aids sweeping across Africa.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'd like to counter with some Zydeco.

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Everybody buckle in.

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So either super dark or super light.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Griffin, do you have a Yahoo for us, a Yahoo Answers request?

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Sure, sure, sure. I have a few.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
How about this one? It was sent in by Jonathan Bartram.

134
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you, Jonathan Bartram.

135
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Dr. Know-It-All, who asks...

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's an ironic, unfortunate name for a Yahoo Answers user.

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've been sold a false bill of goods here.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dr. Know-It-All asks,

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you lived on a beach and overnight all the sand miraculously turned to cocaine, what would you do?

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Dr. Blow-It-All, that's who he...

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He mistyped.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Well, snow angel, right? Blow angel first.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You make an angel in that sweet, sweet coca, but that seems pretty obvious.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Coca-castles?

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Well, I think the first thing I would do is contact the Pope and say, there's been a miracle.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Coke miracle.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
First, alert the authorities.

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't take any chances with this.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It just seems dangerous, right?

150
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It just seems dangerous.

151
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Kids could wander in there.

152
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If I know one thing about the beach, sand gets everywhere.

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hey, what about some answers?

154
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What if I just read some of this special help?

155
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, what do people say?

156
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Steven Adler says, clean the beach.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Seems like it'd be pretty tough.

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yeah, it's all cocaine.

159
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Just get in there with a fucking Swiffer wet jet and get all the coca up.

160
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Alessa says, die of cocaine overdose.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's a pretty good plan, I guess.

162
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Two people rated that answer as good.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Pretty good answer.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Pretty good.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It is the apocalypse.

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You might as well wrap it up.

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Holy Phoenix said, get rod the fuck out.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How do you get rod?

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Spell that for me.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
R-A-W-E-D.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He went ahead and he took the word raw.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Just extended.

173
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And he done verbed it.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He verbed it out.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So get rod the fuck out.

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
How rod are you right now?

177
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm pretty rod.

178
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I have been sniffing this beach for a half hour.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know what irritates me is when you see the dealers out there dumping huge bags of flour.

180
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's like gift horse in the mouth.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
They're still going to cut it?

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on, man.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that baking soda?

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are you doing?

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Just back it up and sell it.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It would decrease the market value, though.

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That would be bad for dealers, I think, if there was a Coke beach.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah, I mean, there are a few people who are suggesting a little bit of profiteering.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
How are you going to sell that?

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, I have some beach here.

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Will you pay me for it?

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I think I'll just go to the beach.

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thanks.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There might be some shark's teeth in there, so a little bonus for the kids.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're all rotting down in nubs.

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Dr. House says, roll up a $50 note and have a snorkel.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's actually pretty good.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Oh, you still take bumps of Coca?

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Not me.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I take snorkels.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just did three snorks.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm tripping out my mind.

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You tripping?

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You trip on Coke?

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The greatest mind of our generation says, well, there's enough to experiment, so instead

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
of snorting it, we add some Kool-Aid and then make an enema.

208
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What?

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How does that thought process work?

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What I love, that seems to imply that he's often thought, man, I would love to have a

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Coke enema, but I just don't have enough.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah.

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't have enough to experiment with.

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think you've got to get out there for a Coke ball fight.

216
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Just mix them up and toss them at each other.

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Build a Coke man.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That seems like it.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That would be fun for about 35 seconds.

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I mean, I haven't done, I have never done the Coca, so I don't know how quickly it sets

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
off, how quickly it activates within you, but I imagine that it's pretty quickly, especially

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
when you're having a good time bouncing around throwing Coke balls at each other.

223
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You should come over to my house.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's the home of the world's coolest beach whale.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come check him out.

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He's a fun guy.

227
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He sits out there asking how into Mark McGrath you are.

228
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
His blowhole's just so crusty and terrible to look at.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's closed up.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mark McGrath?

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Mark McGrath, huge Coke head.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Mark McGrath, I bet.

233
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know either.

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's the Sugar Ray gentleman, right?

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sugar Ray?

237
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yeah, Sugar Ray.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't know good Coke music.

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What's Coke music?

240
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can't imagine that Sugar Ray is too low on that list.

241
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It seems like a Cokey band, doesn't it?

242
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Sugar Ray seems Cokey.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, I mean, everybody's seen that video, right, where Mark McGrath is walking into

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
some bar and some 12-year-old kid yells Sugar Yay at him, and he flips the fuck out and

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
gets in the kid's face and just takes a bite out of him.

246
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What?

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
That's the weirdest music video I've ever heard of.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He takes a bite out of a kid?

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He bites him?

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I mean, he doesn't literally take a bite out of him.

251
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I was speaking figuratively.

252
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He got up in his grill.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You know, I don't appreciate that.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Sugar Gay, that's pretty good, though.

255
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Should we talk about, because this is going to interrupt the flow, and I apologize for

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
that, but I have my reasons.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Last night, something big happened to the world.

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
A baby was born, but not a literal one.

259
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Well, a literal one probably was born somewhere, just statistically.

260
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But we had nothing to do with that baby.

261
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No.

262
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Or did we?

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Or did we?

264
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Get the blood test done, Jay.

265
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm speaking, of course, about Rocky Horror's My Brother, My Brother, and Me mixtape, available

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
now for kids of all ages.

267
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We'll have a link in the post for people to download it for free.

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It is the freshest thing ever recorded by mankind.

269
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We should put it on the Maximum Fun blog, too, right?

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's what I was talking about.

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you think I still use our old website?

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No.

273
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How gauche.

274
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
1.0.

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It really is super fresh, Rocky Horror did a great job with it, and I think if there's

276
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
ever a lull in this episode, maybe I can just splice in a few seconds of a track.

277
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There's samples online, and people can get it.

278
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's for free, right?

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You just get it.

280
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It is for free.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No problem.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Not surprisingly, my favorite track on there is a track called Travis Was Right.

283
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Don't ruin the surprise.

284
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That track is fresh.

285
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I won't say anything, but it may be the happiest I've ever been.

286
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The album has an arc to it.

287
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It has a narrative.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It is a narrative.

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yeah.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's a nice, they call them chill downs at the end.

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There's a chill down, right?

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's what they're called.

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There's a chill down, there's a chill back.

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's a beat flip, which is, I like that one.

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He does like two beat flips, and I was pretty impressed.

296
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He drops that bass so heavy low, and that's probably my favorite part of the album.

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We should just make this show about dance hall, dance hall techno dance, techno dance.

298
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is that the genre?

299
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's techno dance, right?

300
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's perfect.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
We can do an instructional thing.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We can talk about your best techno techniques, like when you drop that bass so heavy low.

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's important.

304
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There's a dance move associated with that, so we can say, when it's time to drop that

305
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
bass, you've got to twist your heels outwards and drop your knees down a little bit, and

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
shake two fingers to the floor like you're telling it no, and then we'll tell people

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:51,000
to do that, and then we'll put on a clip of the mixtape like right now.

308
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And people can get their learn on.

309
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Yeah, I think that this could be really super instructional.

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So are you saying that our podcast could become a vehicle for us to mention new music that

311
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
we discover in the world?

312
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh no.

313
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh no, I know where this is going.

314
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Say that one of the three of us discovered a mystery CD titled Fart Touch, and we played

315
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
that song, and it was magical.

316
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Travis, walk me through this, Travis sends us this email that says, I found a CD called

317
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Fart Touch.

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
No, no, no.

319
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is a much more mysterious event.

320
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm going through my CDs and Teresa's CDs, and we discover this CD simply titled Fart

321
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Touch.

322
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Neither one of us has any idea where this CD came from.

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Neither one of you will admit to having any idea where this CD came from.

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Gotcha.

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
At any point did you put this CD in your computer?

326
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It took me four days of just walking by as we're cleaning up the house, saying things

327
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
like, and where should we carefully store Fart Touch?

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And eventually I was like, fuck it, I have to find out what's on the CD and discovered

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
a song I strangely called Fart Touch.

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, imagine that.

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's perhaps the greatest song I've ever heard in my life.

332
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And here's the clip.

333
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You got that Fart Touch, who got that Fart Touch?

334
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You got that Fart Touch, who got that Fart Touch?

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have literally listened to that song nine times in the last two hours.

336
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let me ask you though, Travis, did you put the CD in your computer to listen to it?

337
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I imagine that you did, right?

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, I did.

339
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes.

340
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Okay.

341
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is where you get viruses and shit.

342
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If I saw a piece of digital media that had the words Fart Touch scrawled upon it, like,

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I wouldn't want to know what's on there.

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I certainly wouldn't subject my computer's hard drive to it.

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You learn so much about your brothers doing a weekly advice show with them, because if

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I saw something called Fart Touch, the signal would not be able to get from my eyes to my

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
brain to compute that it's a Fart Touch before my finger would be on the open button on the

348
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
computer.

349
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I would already be loading it just as my brain was like, Fart Touch?

350
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Like, I couldn't get that in fast enough.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Are you kidding me?

352
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Fart Touch?

353
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm there.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Like, yeah, of course, naturally.

355
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I think that says a lot about us though, because, like, I don't know, you two seem to take more

356
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
risks than I do.

357
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like, you see a Fart Touch CD and you just jump right for it.

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know that a ship in harbor is safe, but that's not what ships are for.

359
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
They're for sailing to the open seas and finding Fart Touches.

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm on the SS Fart Touch and I'm out there for adventure.

361
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You two's biggest risk was recording Fart Touch, I think.

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We've not given advice for a little while.

363
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think we gave some pretty, like, advice by association.

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Don't listen to Fart Touch.

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think it's a pretty good nugget of wisdom.

366
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I've been with my girlfriend for three and a half years now, but for the past year, she

367
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
lived in different cities, so we had to go do the long-distance thing.

368
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm planning on proposing soon, and after that, she's going to be moving back to my city.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The problem is, I've gotten incredibly used to this long-distance relationship.

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I've got a daily routine of work, taekwondo, dinner, and then playing games all night.

371
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
When we were still in the same city, we didn't live together, so I still have my personal

372
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
space, but that's obviously going to change.

373
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Do you guys, except Griffin, sorry buddy, find it hard to juggle your personal time

374
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
and your significant other?

375
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
For love or StarCraft, the muffin.

376
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
See, I just double down on my taekwondo time.

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Just more taekwondo?

378
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah, yeah, I take my love cavity, and I just fill it with taekwondo.

379
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going to hit you with something, the muffin, that's going to kind of blow your mind a little

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
bit.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was in the same boat you were, for a long time, because I've always been super into

382
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
to me time, to Justin time.

383
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The time that you spend by yourself is important, and I think you should still try to get that

384
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,000
time, but keep in mind that the time you spend by yourself playing video games, for example,

385
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
taekwondo is not a great example because it's helping you be fitter, but playing games all

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
night, that is without context.

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's time that it doesn't really edify you.

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You're the only one that it affects, and time that you spend with your significant other

389
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
has context.

390
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It has...

391
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Value?

392
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is that what you're saying?

393
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, it's not value less, but it's about finding a balance.

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You've got to find a balance between the two, and don't...

395
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can always play video games.

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can always do that stuff, but it's about finding a balance between the two.

397
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Of course, it will change.

398
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Everything will change when you move in with someone and you live with someone, especially

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
when you marry someone, but change for the better, and if you find it changing not for

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
the better, it's as simple as having a discussion and saying, hey, I really love spending time

401
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
with you, but I do need some me time here and there.

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yeah, no girl will ever understand that.

403
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Sorry, that won't work.

404
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Well, she probably enjoys her me time, too.

405
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's worth a shot, but I don't think that any...

406
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I mean, maybe she does.

407
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Maybe she will enjoy the me time.

408
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If she is a very not me time person, though, if you're like, I need some space, then it's

409
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
not going to go well, I don't think.

410
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Okay, well, how about this idea?

411
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Me time together.

412
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yeah.

413
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Ooh, I like this.

414
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You play video games while she reads a book, but you're together, you're in the same room,

415
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
you're hanging out, but you don't have to be constantly staring into each other's eyes

416
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
for hours.

417
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Deborah, I like you a lot.

418
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I want to be together alone.

419
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Can we do that?

420
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

421
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I want to be with you, but not with you.

422
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You sit over there.

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You sit over there, you do your crossword puzzle, and you drink your tea.

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm going to be over here practicing my Quan.

425
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm just getting my Quan on.

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm getting my Quan on.

427
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Do me a favor.

428
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Taekwon, don't talk to me for the next hour or so.

429
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Can we work that out?

430
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
We can.

431
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Just do anything else.

432
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You could try to get her hooked on something super addictive.

433
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Take her out to Coke Beach.

434
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You won't see her for days.

435
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But yeah, I mean, it's just a balance, and it is going to change.

436
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
But remember that, yeah, that's quality time.

437
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You'll find interest that you share.

438
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
But it is, you're right.

439
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's a huge adjustment.

440
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If it's too hard, get single again, my man.

441
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Chuck it.

442
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Chuck it back to the sea, you know?

443
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Forget about it.

444
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Luda!

445
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Get out the way, bitch.

446
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Griffin, you know what I need.

447
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This one is sent in by CurlyHeadPoet.

448
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Thank you, CurlyHeadPoet.

449
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's by Yahoo Answers user Amy, who asks, oh, man, does anyone know of any other grandpa names?

450
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, no.

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It can't.

452
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Listen to the parameters, please.

453
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Okay.

454
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
All right.

455
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
All right.

456
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It cannot be Poppy, Grandpa, or Pop Pop.

457
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Gramps sounds like cramps.

458
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Don't go there.

459
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Don't.

460
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't even.

461
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Additional details.

462
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And please, no names in other languages.

463
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
This is America We Speak English.

464
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Did she say that?

465
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Awesome.

466
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Awesome.

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's awesome.

468
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Definitely.

469
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Awesome, Amy.

470
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Cool.

471
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Any P vowel P.

472
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Vowel.

473
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Sound.

474
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

475
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
You can.

476
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You're fine.

477
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Like Pee Pee.

478
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Well, maybe not that.

479
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
No, not that.

480
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No.

481
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Papo.

482
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Papo.

483
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's good.

484
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Poppy.

485
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Peepums.

486
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
As long as there's two P's.

487
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Go see your peepums.

488
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is my peepums.

489
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Darrell, go see your peepums.

490
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
My peepums always has the hardest, crumbliest chewing gum.

491
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Don't.

492
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Now, Darrell, don't you eat peepum's nasty gum.

493
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You know what happened last time.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Peepum's nasty gum sounds like a product that we should copyright immediately.

495
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh, God.

496
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I just purchased a pack of peepum's old-timey nasty gum.

497
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're still in the Juicy Fruit?

498
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Oh, that's bitch gum.

499
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I'm into peepum's nasty gum.

500
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Fuck your fruit stripes.

501
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
The thing about peepum's nasty gum is that you have to put the emphasis on a different

502
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
syllable every time you say it.

503
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Peepum's not even good?

504
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh, peepum's not even good with that nasty gum.

505
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
It's just a lot of the care for it.

506
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Peepum's nasty gum is obviously the greatest thing any of us have ever said, but let's

507
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
give this person some much-needed help.

508
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm going to decide that grand peepum's is the best name ever.

509
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I like that, because you can expand on that.

510
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You can have a great grand peepum's without great gum gum.

511
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It should be noted that gum's not going to get you better.

512
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
What about Propu?

513
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Propum?

514
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Propur?

515
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Propy?

516
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Propy?

517
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
That sounds like an alien grandfather.

518
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Propy.

519
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Proteus.

520
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm proteus the peepums.

521
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm a peepum's proteus.

522
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Please eat my nasty spray scope.

523
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Are there any non-double P names that still work?

524
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
For some reason, and this is so cultural, I guess, but for some reason when you pull

525
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
away from P's it doesn't feel like a grandpa name.

526
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
You have to have the P in there somewhere, right?

527
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
There's probably some sort of root language explanation there, like paternal.

528
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Maybe paternal has something to do with it.

529
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I guess granddad does it, but who says granddad?

530
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That sounds like something you only refer to them as after they're dead.

531
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Yeah.

532
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This is my granddad.

533
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Granddad?

534
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
That's depressing.

535
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Yeah.

536
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What about master father?

537
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Whoa!

538
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
This is master dad.

539
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was thinking master dad.

540
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
What if the problem isn't the dad or the pop, but the grand?

541
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
What if we could switch the grand?

542
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No, but think about the one removed, and you can say this is my great grandmaster dad.

543
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
What about progenitor prime?

544
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
How do you feel about that?

545
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
How about just Philip?

546
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
No one calls him an adult.

547
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yeah, just call him by his name, which is even better if you're six.

548
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
He's like, would you like a Werther's?

549
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You're like, yes, Robert.

550
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I would enjoy a Werther's.

551
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Thank you, Robert.

552
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Thank you, Robert.

553
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Gum?

554
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No, I don't think so.

555
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I would prefer not to have it.

556
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
The Werther's will keep, sir.

557
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Unlike your nasty gum that I believe retrieved from a package of baseball cards circa 1987, peepums.

558
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What if we did it like Japanese math, and we just called him like daddy dad?

559
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Or dad dad.

560
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Just like expand it to whatever power.

561
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I feel like that would be a much shit.

562
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I just revolutionized the whole fucking system.

563
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
It's much better now.

564
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
We got rid of all these arbitrary titles, and we just expanded it based on how they actually relate to your nuclear family.

565
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

566
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yes.

567
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Your cousin will be your dad's sister's son.

568
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So you want to de-simplify the language, and instead of one word like cousin.

569
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
No, because who the fuck can keep cousins straight?

570
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Especially once you get to second or third cousins, who knows?

571
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Who knows?

572
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
It's very nebulous.

573
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm saying we simplify the entire thing, and we just go dad sister brother.

574
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Or I guess that would be your dad again.

575
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Do you understand what I'm saying though?

576
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Uh-huh.

577
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I do.

578
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
It's just like so terrible of an idea.

579
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't want to encourage you more.

580
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The one thing I was thinking is I talk about my extended family in public too much.

581
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I wish there was some way to complicate it to keep me from bringing them up all the time.

582
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, I know.

583
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Dad sister brother.

584
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Would you call them that to their face?

585
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
No, I would call them by their name.

586
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
This is my mom brother.

587
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
His name is Tom.

588
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
This is my mom brother Tom.

589
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Peabam's Nasty Gum.

590
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I just want to get that out there one more time.

591
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:13,000
It's too bad the mixtape just came out, because I feel like we could get an entire selection out of Peabam's Nasty Gum.

592
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:24,000
My wife started knitting four years ago, and that was all fine and swell until she started wearing her creations.

593
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
How can I tell her that I don't like it when she wears these creations without hurting her feelings?

594
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
That's from hip hobo.

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There's nothing hip about being inconsiderate.

596
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, wow.

597
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Burn.

598
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I don't like it when you wear that sweater.

599
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You know what?

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
It doesn't matter if she made it or not.

601
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
That's not your call to make.

602
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
You should never say that.

603
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Don't ever say that.

604
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Unless.

605
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Unless.

606
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
She's really bad at knitting.

607
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You can see through it, and you see all her face.

608
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Unless we have underestimated her terribleness at knitting.

609
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Hey, listen.

610
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah?

611
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I like that sweater.

612
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
She's a terrible knitter, and you can see.

613
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's like, I like your sexy shirt, but I can't have you wearing that in public.

614
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Is that sexy?

615
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Sexy if you can see through the yard, see some nipple, I guess.

616
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't know.

617
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Maybe.

618
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You can see your hungry, hungry nipples?

619
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That only happens in sitcoms.

620
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I don't think it happens in real life.

621
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You don't do it.

622
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Ask to borrow her stuff, and then lose it.

623
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
No, because she worked hard on that.

624
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Don't be a guy.

625
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No, that's, no.

626
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
No, no.

627
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Don't take Travis's path of least thought.

628
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You should, you should, like, just keep it to yourself.

629
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Dude, it doesn't matter.

630
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Trust me.

631
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,000
There's no situation in which your distaste for her clothing is going to be, like, harder

632
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
to handle than just her scorn.

633
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Just her deep resentment.

634
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I have it.

635
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I got it.

636
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, good.

637
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
No, I figured it out.

638
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're really good this time, right?

639
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's not going to be, is it burn it?

640
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Because that's not going to fly away.

641
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Nope, nope.

642
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Okay.

643
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No, this is a good one.

644
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Encourage her to sell her creations.

645
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Whoa.

646
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Whoa.

647
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Then she can't wear them, because she's got to sell them.

648
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
From downtown.

649
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Travis.

650
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah.

651
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Why are you wearing money?

652
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You're going to stain that, and we won't be able to make a living off of it.

653
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Take that off right now, and never wear it again.

654
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
We beg it.

655
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,920
Do you think Etsy actually got started when some husband was like, dude, that scarf, are

656
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,920
you serious?

657
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,880
You can't wear that.

658
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,640
Let's go ahead and give that one to internet, and...

659
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,640
Yeah.

660
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Now you get money.

661
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,780
Man, Travis, I'm sorry for doubting you.

662
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,420
That's a slam dunk.

663
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,160
You should tell her to sell it, but sell that one.

664
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,240
You have to say, like, this one is very special.

665
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,240
I think you should sell it right now.

666
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
You've already worn it.

667
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,960
You've filled it with your memories.

668
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,400
Now let's go ahead and give it to the world.

669
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,240
Let's sell your memories on Etsy.

670
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,800
Ask her to knit me something.

671
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,320
I've only had knit things for me one time.

672
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,160
I only have one knit thing.

673
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,840
Somebody knit me a peepum's nasty gum toboggan.

674
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
I would just want a peepum's nasty gum koozie.

675
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,520
Yeah, to keep your peepum's nasty gum warm.

676
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,080
I want a nasty gum holster.

677
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,440
A knitted nasty gum holster.

678
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,320
I just... That's slick Rick.

679
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,000
He's the slickest nasty gum dealer in the West.

680
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,640
You look at him wrong, he'll throw two pieces of nasty gum.

681
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm worried because we obviously had a lot of nasty gum in our youth because we had grandparents

682
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,980
that handed out nasty gum, but I'm worried that not everybody got to experience the nasty

683
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
gum phenomenon.

684
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,160
I'm pretty sure this is a universal thing.

685
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
Is it?

686
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,960
It's like, for those who didn't receive nasty gum from their parents, or their grandparents,

687
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,520
it's like the gum that comes in Mike Topps baseball cards packages.

688
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,640
It's just crumbly ass terrible nasty gum.

689
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,840
Yeah, you take a bite out of it and it shatters and disintegrates into a billion pieces.

690
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,040
I can't believe nasty gum communicates the whole experience like it's nasty gum.

691
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,720
In fact, I feel like we're actually siphoning a little bit of magic away from the word.

692
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
Yeah, you'll edit this out later, right?

693
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,120
Nah.

694
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,540
Yeah, okay.

695
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,320
Is calling someone a nerd considered an insult?

696
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,680
I've called him a BF a nerd on several occasions, and he thinks I'm downing on him.

697
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
But come on!

698
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,760
His favorite things are video games, Star Wars, and bacon.

699
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,080
Please help a girl out.

700
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,240
I don't have a problem when people call me a nerd or when people call other people a

701
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:33,920
nerd, but when people call themselves a nerd, I get the strongest douche chills.

702
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,240
It's pretty bad.

703
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,440
I feel the same way when people call themselves a jock.

704
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
Yeah.

705
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
It's like-

706
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Anybody who just-

707
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
God, it bugs me.

708
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,080
So forwardly just like picks a label and is like, I am slut.

709
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
What's up?

710
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah.

711
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,180
Or when it's, you know, the one that bothers me, regional.

712
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,480
I'm an Arkansas girl.

713
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
What do you want?

714
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Oh, fuck you.

715
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
Yeah.

716
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Seriously.

717
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,480
That is so New York.

718
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,480
That's-

719
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
Ugh.

720
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,480
I feel like we've gotten off topic.

721
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
Okay.

722
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
You know what else?

723
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Is nerd an insult?

724
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,200
It's like coffee out of the grinder and it's all stuck in there.

725
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Ugh.

726
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Yeah.

727
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,360
Now we're showing them.

728
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,520
You know, if he considers it an insult, that's the, I guess that's the, I mean, like, if

729
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,200
you know that and you keep saying it, then yeah, I think you're participating in this.

730
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,280
I don't think you can claim ignorance too long.

731
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,160
I can't formulate a sentence in which calling someone a nerd is a compliment.

732
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,560
Like you're such a great nerd.

733
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Yeah.

734
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,920
Even when you say it with like the best intentions, you're still being a little condescending,

735
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
I think.

736
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Yeah.

737
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,800
You're putting someone, you're labeling someone and that's never, that's never true.

738
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,980
You're saying, you're basically saying the things you care about are not significant

739
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:50,120
or important to the, the large, the larger tapestry that is our world.

740
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,480
Uh, my advice to your boyfriend, next time Elisa says you're a nerd, look her dead in

741
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,920
the eye and say, I prefer to think of myself as Otaku.

742
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I can't wait for her to leave you.

743
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,560
You'll never have that, you'll never have that problem again.

744
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Solved.

745
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,160
I'm literally shivering right now.

746
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
I know.

747
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,560
I am Otaku.

748
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I prefer.

749
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,680
That would be awesome.

750
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,520
I wish we, hey, I don't know who your boyfriend is, but I wish we could give him advice instead

751
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,080
of you because we would tell him to just like double his nerdiness quotient.

752
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Double down.

753
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,800
Make your kids smoke and, and, and double down on it.

754
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,560
Just double down and like start, uh, listening to nothing.

755
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,320
Nothing but J-pop.

756
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,700
Like just listen to the weirdest Japanese pop you can find, uh, do a little cosplay,

757
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,700
get really into steampunk.

758
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,280
Did I make something sense?

759
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,040
When is bacon nerdy?

760
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
I think bacon's nerdy.

761
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,080
I think we've been, I think bacon is nerdy.

762
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
Yeah.

763
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,640
Bacon went around the bend.

764
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
Yeah.

765
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Sorry.

766
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,800
I mean, you're still, you can still be on bacon.

767
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Like you can still.

768
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Yeah.

769
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
Like bacon.

770
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,360
Uh, what do we have time for?

771
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,000
Got another Yahoo on the, on the docket.

772
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Sure.

773
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay.

774
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,240
Um, this one, uh, was sent in by Cal.

775
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,240
Thank you, Cal.

776
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:10,760
It's by, it's by Yahoo answers user, the Christ puncher.

777
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
Okay.

778
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Cool.

779
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Cool.

780
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Okay.

781
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Okay.

782
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,440
The Christ puncher asks, what is a good quick way to make money from my dog?

783
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,280
My dog is expensive.

784
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,720
Usually we just feed her table scraps, bits of hamburger, onion rings, fries, extra ketchup

785
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
packets, et cetera.

786
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
Wait, what?

787
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Excuse me?

788
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,120
Uh, but things are getting tight financially around my house and we need every, every family

789
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,960
member to pull their own weight when it comes to expenses, even food.

790
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,080
My dog is pure bred and not fixed.

791
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:46,480
I was wondering how much I could make from a litter of puppies and how long they take

792
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,000
to gestate.

793
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,280
If this isn't a good idea, some suggestions on other ways for my dog to start earning

794
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,880
money would be appreciated.

795
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,640
I think you could just make him find his own ketchup packets.

796
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Right?

797
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,360
How, how fucking tight is it getting when you can't give your dog table scraps anymore?

798
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,360
You just don't have them.

799
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,760
You, you give your toddler a bone to gnaw on.

800
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,360
Hey, get the, I am eating every onion ring.

801
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,840
I'm eating all of these.

802
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:21,000
Um, I mean that the quickest, easiest option I guess would be to turn him into a celebri

803
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
dog.

804
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Right?

805
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Like get him his own features.

806
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,120
I'm pretty sure that, um, George Lopez has started casting for Beverly Hills, Chihuahua

807
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,120
two.

808
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:32,280
Um, Justin, give me a set title for that movie where you're not aware that that movie already

809
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
exists.

810
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Does it really?

811
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Yeah.

812
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
I shit you not.

813
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,280
I don't think it's true to the Google.

814
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,760
Uh, Beverly Hills, oh my fuck.

815
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Fuck.

816
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Yeah.

817
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Yeah.

818
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
Fuck.

819
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
It's out.

820
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
It's out on Blu-ray.

821
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,760
So you could get your, you could get your dog on Beverly Hills, Chihuahua three.

822
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,000
Can we stop the show?

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Trace, Trace Perros.

824
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,880
Oh, Ernie Hudson was in that film.

825
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,880
Good.

826
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,880
Oh good.

827
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,280
Like Ernie Hudson didn't have enough to deal with on a day to day basis.

828
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,560
Ernie Hudson, Ernie Hudson and Olivia Newton John?

829
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,080
That's a tour de force.

830
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,560
Oh fuck.

831
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,040
Were you out in theaters for Beverly Hills, Chihuahua two?

832
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,400
Did G-Lo make time for that one?

833
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,000
Oh man.

834
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Tell me.

835
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,720
French Stewart was in the mix.

836
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,400
Oh, French Stewart makes me so sad.

837
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
Not funny.

838
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Open your eyes, French Stewart.

839
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
See where your life is headed.

840
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Stop squinting, stupid.

841
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
You're running into oblivion.

842
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Open your eyes.

843
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
Your agent is a fax machine.

844
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Get out of there.

845
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Stop squinting, you bastard.

846
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Oh, stupid French Stewart.

847
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
I miss that guy, though.

848
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
He probably is a listener.

849
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Doesn't make sense.

850
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
I don't know.

851
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
I don't know.

852
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I don't know.

853
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
I don't know.

854
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:46,400
I don't know.

855
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,400
I don't know.

856
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
I don't know.

857
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,400
I don't know.

858
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
I don't know.

859
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
I don't know.

860
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
I don't know.

861
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
I don't know.

862
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

863
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
French Stewart.

864
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,400
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

865
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
French Stewart.

866
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,200
I want to go make Inspector Gadget four.

867
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,200
French Stewart.

868
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
God, I'm a bitch.

869
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:09,960
I want to punch the squint right out of this stupid face.

870
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,920
Oh, god.

871
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,920
This coffee is strong.

872
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,920
It is.

873
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,920
I'm wired now.

874
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,540
I'll punch French Stewart in the face.

875
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,500
Tell me if George Lopez was in Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 or not.

876
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Oh, fuck yeah.

877
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,620
Of course he was.

878
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Did this come in theaters?

879
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,300
In fact, I don't think that- I'm almost certain it didn't.

880
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,260
I don't think that George Lopez, like, arranged shit in any way.

881
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,220
I think he probably just did one of the voices, but I like to imagine him as the puppet master.

882
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,220
No.

883
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:42,900
I like to imagine that they just record him saying things in his day-to-day life and work

884
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,900
it into a film.

885
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,900
You think?

886
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Yeah.

887
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Yeah, definitely.

888
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,940
And Fred Stewart's like, no, I can work with this.

889
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
This is good.

890
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,460
Yeah, I'll pass the salt, George.

891
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,620
Like, it's- God, man, I do hate Fred Stewart.

892
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,540
He depresses me, though, because he was- he was so good, and if you looked at Fred Stewart

893
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,180
and Joseph Gordon-Levitt on Third Rock and said, which one of these dudes is going places,

894
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,260
I wouldn't have guessed Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

895
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
But there he is.

896
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Making it big.

897
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
Making it huge.

898
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,820
He incepted the hell out of that movie.

899
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Oh, God.

900
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:18,780
I seriously, like, my- my fucking drive to do the show, to do the show, to do the show

901
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,220
anymore is totally gone.

902
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,580
Like, when you guys were talking for the past couple minutes, I just was- I was just reading

903
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,580
this IMDB page.

904
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
For Fred Stewart?

905
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,580
For- for- for- for Chihuahua 2?

906
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,580
For Bev- for Bev 2.

907
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Bev 2?

908
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,580
Is there any ratings?

909
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,580
Are there any user reviews?

910
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:42,660
Can we advise people on whether or not they should see Chihuahua 2?

911
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,660
It's actually not out yet.

912
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,660
Okay, thank God.

913
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:47,860
Yeah, yeah, it's- it's got a release date of February 6th.

914
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:48,860
I'll be there.

915
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
It says-

916
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,860
I'll be there.

917
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,860
Oh, God.

918
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
It says France on the page.

919
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,860
No, no, no.

920
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:54,860
French.

921
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
That's a common misconception.

922
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,860
French.

923
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,860
French Stewart.

924
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,260
It's a common misconception.

925
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
None of this is usable.

926
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,460
None of this is usable material.

927
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
What?

928
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
For the show?

929
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,460
Yes.

930
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,460
Or for life.

931
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,460
French Stewart, you're not-

932
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,940
I think we can all learn something from French Stewart.

933
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,860
That's probably what director Alex Zam said when he went over the final cut of Beverly

934
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,860
Hill's Chihuahua 2.

935
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,860
French.

936
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,860
It's the Zamster.

937
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,860
Listen.

938
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,180
We gotta get these contracts inked.

939
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:26,460
I want you as Squinty the Squinting- I want you as Squinty the Seeing Eye Dog.

940
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,860
They'll be rolling in the aisles.

941
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,100
Did you say- did you say rolling in the- they'll be rolling in the aisles, French.

942
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,860
It'll be a laughter unlike you've heard in years.

943
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
I've seen.

944
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,860
Not since- not since IG2.

945
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Not since The Shredder Gadget 2.

946
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
Well, you've heard that laugh.

947
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:45,780
Now, I'm not the only one with French Stewart's IMDb page open right now, I think.

948
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
Are you kidding?

949
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
I'm not from Hart.

950
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,900
I know- I know French Stewart's history.

951
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,660
Third Rock, IG2, Chihuahua, DOS.

952
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,660
I know his whole thing.

953
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,660
Unemployment.

954
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,660
Six months.

955
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,660
Unemployment.

956
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,660
Considering suicide.

957
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:59,660
Last three years.

958
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,500
Well, it actually says all of this on his IMDb page, too, which is weird.

959
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,300
It is on the- well, he adds- he updates it himself.

960
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,980
What the fuck else is he gonna do?

961
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,860
He has this keyboard with the giant keys on it, because he can't see that well, obviously.

962
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,980
He's squinting all the time.

963
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,980
Where's the G?

964
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
I've- I've turned a corner.

965
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,980
I feel bad now.

966
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:18,620
I feel bad for French Stewart now.

967
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,980
I'm gonna- next week, all pro-French Stewart material.

968
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,980
It's guaranteed.

969
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,060
We- So, I wanna hear Griffin's-

970
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,820
We haven't- we haven't not answered a question as hard as we didn't answer that question,

971
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:32,520
I think, in the history of the show.

972
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,780
It's the hardest non-answer that we've ever- that we've ever given.

973
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,980
Let's do one more real one before we get out of here.

974
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,980
Okay.

975
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,940
I finally convinced a friend to join the MBMBA nation, so this question is for her benefit.

976
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,900
She recently moved from NYC to Ohio and is now being inundated with wang pics from guys

977
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,220
that get her number now and from several internet friends.

978
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:00,180
She's shy and swears she is not soliciting them in any way.

979
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,540
What can she do?

980
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,540
T-Rex.

981
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:03,540
Wait.

982
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
What?

983
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,740
I don't understand this question.

984
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,740
Excuse me?

985
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:13,660
She moved from New York to Ohio and somewhere in that-

986
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,300
She passed some cell phone tower.

987
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,940
There is some tower that relayed her phone number to- to wang mailers everywhere.

988
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,340
Yeah, to this shadowy organization.

989
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,340
And what I love is this is not one or two wang pics, she's being inundated with wang

990
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,340
pics.

991
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,340
Flooded.

992
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Just flooded with constant stream.

993
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,340
An embarrassment of dick shots.

994
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,700
I am- I am rolling in it.

995
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,260
She can jump like Scrooge McDuck into her big mountain of wang pictures.

996
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,780
I don't know- I'm not familiar with enough cell phone technology to understand how this

997
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,460
could happen to somebody.

998
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,260
I guess she could always get her- she could disable picture messages.

999
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,620
Is that a possibility?

1000
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,140
No, we need to go deeper in this because I understand, like, sending the wrong signals

1001
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,540
to one, maybe two guys.

1002
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,780
What is she doing?

1003
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,500
What if there's- what if someone- an ex-boyfriend that she left high and dry in New York wrote

1004
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,860
on a wall like- Oh, that has to be it.

1005
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,020
It has to be- I heart wang pics dot com.

1006
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,700
Yeah, I need your dick pics.

1007
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,740
Send them- send them to me.

1008
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,740
Yeah.

1009
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,380
And when you need something, it's a responsibility.

1010
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:25,740
I think, um, there's a lot of things you can do with this, but, um, my solution is you

1011
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,700
take those dick pics, uh, and you forward them to other people who are sending you dick

1012
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
pics.

1013
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,700
You- you- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1014
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:36,460
Just, like, someone sends you a picture of a dick and you send them back a picture of

1015
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
somebody else's dick.

1016
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
No, no, no.

1017
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:40,060
You send them fifty pictures of their dick.

1018
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,060
Oh, I love it.

1019
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,460
You're gonna make your- you're gonna make your kid smoke and give them fifty pictures

1020
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,460
of dick.

1021
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,180
Hey, do you like dick pics so much?

1022
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,140
Let me give you some in return.

1023
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,660
Or every time someone sends you a dick picture, just text back, I sent that to your mom.

1024
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,340
They won't- they won't know what hit them.

1025
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:02,420
Or, uh, maybe she doesn't- maybe since your friend's a girl, she probably loves it.

1026
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,420
What girl wouldn't love that, right?

1027
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:04,420
Pictures of- pictures of wieners?

1028
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,660
It's like, uh, she's- just pictures of wieners every day.

1029
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,860
That's what girls crave, right?

1030
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,780
Like they- No, it's the crazy crunch that girls crave.

1031
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,540
I- I totally, totally agree with you there.

1032
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,220
She can't- it's like a water faucet she can't shut off, but why would she want to?

1033
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,220
Yeah.

1034
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,220
Cause it's- cause the water is dick pics.

1035
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Cause it's wet.

1036
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Yeah.

1037
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,900
You just want to wash your hands with dick pics.

1038
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:31,580
Uh, yeah, I- I- I, uh, I feel like we've given you several action- action items ranging

1039
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,980
from possible to, uh, to whimsical.

1040
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,420
Uh, so- I don't know.

1041
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,100
I feel like creating a vault of dick pictures and swimming around it, I feel like we- we

1042
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,100
hit a high point there.

1043
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,860
Oh, tell her to release a book.

1044
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,660
Things- things my wang says.

1045
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,820
Uh, do a blog, put a Tumblr blog- Chicken soup for the wang pixel.

1046
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,300
Eat- eat prey wang?

1047
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,100
Eat prey wang!

1048
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,060
This is my- this is my novelty book.

1049
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:55,300
It's a gift book.

1050
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,260
Eat prey wang, $18 at Borders.

1051
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,740
There are only 60 pages.

1052
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,300
The girl- the girl with the dragon wang?

1053
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,380
Why don't you make a- why- I- I think a blog- I think a- make a Tumblr blog, and then just

1054
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,580
as soon as they send you the dick pic, you send them back the URL of the blog where you

1055
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,180
just put the dick pic up.

1056
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,180
Yup.

1057
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,180
You'll never see that coming.

1058
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,980
I want to hear Griffin's last question, but, um, first, couple real quick housekeeping

1059
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:17,980
things.

1060
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:24,660
MBMBAM.com is your- is your source, is your one-stop shop, your- your dick pic faucet,

1061
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,980
uh, as it were, of MBMBAM information.

1062
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:33,300
You can go there to, uh, send us, uh, questions.

1063
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,500
Our, uh, uh, our email address is there, we've got an automatic form where you can send in

1064
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:44,300
stuff, um, the Magic 8 Ball may be carrying over with us to the new MaxFun site, it may

1065
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,740
not be, so you might want to get your- your clicks in, uh, uh, today.

1066
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,900
You will, at some point in the near future, notice that it has switched over to- to MaxFun,

1067
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,900
um, but you know, everything you love will still be there, and we're gonna try to do

1068
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:04,180
more posts, uh, there on the Mac- on the MBMBAM, uh, blog, more stuff from us, just, you know,

1069
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,180
randomness, um.

1070
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,420
You'll definitely- definitely be able to find the- the download link for the My Brother,

1071
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,060
My Brother and Me mixtape up on there, um, we'll try and get that out right around the

1072
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,540
show time release.

1073
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:20,680
Uh, show time release, yes, um, also go to the forums, uh, MaximumFun.org, click on forums

1074
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,120
and go there and talk about this episode, say how much you loved it, um, and tell-

1075
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,700
While you're there, check out all their other wonderful podcasts.

1076
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,700
Oh my god, get down on them.

1077
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,220
Whoa, that was a very emphatic endorsement.

1078
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,980
Just stop our podcast right now.

1079
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:40,780
Yeah, just stop podcasting us, and start- stop podcasting yourself, I guess.

1080
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,340
Um, I see I turned that around.

1081
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,340
I heard it, it's good.

1082
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,340
No, I see what you did.

1083
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,340
It was good, right?

1084
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:52,140
Um, not too much, not too much, um, but yeah, thank you guys so much, uh, the response from-

1085
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,420
from you new MaxFun folks has been absolutely, uh, delightful and positive, and we really

1086
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,420
appreciate it.

1087
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,180
Um, if you get a chance this week, if you heard something funny on the show, you wanna

1088
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:08,100
tweet about it with the MBMBAM hashtag, uh, we love that, it's- I- I have a search that

1089
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,260
is open an embarrassing amount of time that I am constantly monitoring, uh, and I- and

1090
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:17,940
I always appreciate those, and, um, it's a good way to get people interested.

1091
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:23,380
I would like to throw out, um, French Stewart, if you are listening- Oh, I'm so sorry!

1092
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,460
Ah, it's so, so sorry, um, big fans.

1093
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,460
Just big fans.

1094
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,460
Huge fans.

1095
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,460
Um.

1096
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,460
Uh, who was out there?

1097
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,900
This- Wyn Myself, uh, W-Y-N-N-E Myself, uh, out there, he just listened to his first

1098
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
episode.

1099
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,060
He started at E1, uh, Meg Balls, out there- Shoulda done that.

1100
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,060
Shoulda done that.

1101
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,140
Nah, shouldn't start at one, but- Start at the top and work back, and stop

1102
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
at, like, maybe six.

1103
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:50,660
But yeah, this is- this is, uh, this is- this is a lot of fun, guys, and thank you

1104
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,460
to you two, as always, uh, for- for doing the show with me.

1105
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:55,460
I really appreciate it.

1106
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,460
Hey, you're welcome.

1107
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,460
You're welcome.

1108
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,460
Hey.

1109
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,460
It's the least I can do.

1110
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Give me one to grow on.

1111
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:01,460
Sure.

1112
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:08,100
Uh, our last Yahoo question of the day is not actually a Yahoo question, but a news

1113
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,700
item from the Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 IMDB page.

1114
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:17,420
It reads, you wanted it, Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2 sneak peek.

1115
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:21,460
Hitting DVD and Blu-ray on February 1, 2011 comes Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2, the sequel

1116
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,220
to your favorite film of 2008.

1117
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,220
Was it?

1118
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,620
You asked for more, and you got it, and I have a four-minute and forty-nine-second

1119
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,460
sneak peek for you directly below, but be careful.

1120
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,440
February is two months out.

1121
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:36,140
Maybe only watch this one in one-minute intervals so you don't burst from anticipation.

1122
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,860
Who's in this one?

1123
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,460
While they were able to get George Lopez back to lead, uh, to voice the lead Chihuahua Poppy,

1124
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,060
the same can't be said for Drew Barrymore as the voice of Chloe, but they got the next

1125
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:49,060
best thing.

1126
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,300
Odette Yusman of You Again fame, also starring our-

1127
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,040
What next best thing?

1128
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,720
Also starring our Zachary Gordon, Christine Lakin, and IMDB even has Ernie Hudson of

1129
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,060
Ghostbusters fame as part of the cast.

1130
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,820
Perhaps he saw it as an opportunity to do a little press and try and stir up more buzz

1131
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,180
for that much-bally-hooed Ghostbusters 3 feature.

1132
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,940
No one was talking about Ghostbusters 3, but now that Ernie Hudson was in Beverly Hills

1133
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:17,980
Chihuahua 2 on DVD, I really feel like we got some fucking heat.

1134
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,980
Like we're finally heating up.

1135
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:22,540
Hi, this is Bill Murray.

1136
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:23,540
Did I hear right?

1137
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:26,060
Ernie Hudson is in Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2?

1138
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,060
Direct-

1139
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,060
Sign me up.

1140
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,060
Sign me up.

1141
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,060
It's got heat now.

1142
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,060
I want that Hudson heat.

1143
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,960
I'll do an actual Yahoo answer now.

1144
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,960
This one was sent in by Cal.

1145
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Thank you, Cal.

1146
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:43,340
It's by Yahoo answer's user Ronnie the MLK of GWS.

1147
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:49,620
He asks, why is it illegal to steal someone's horse or a parakeet but it's perfectly legal

1148
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:55,180
to steal someone's girlfriend?

1149
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,580
I'm Ernie Hudson.

1150
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:58,580
I'm French too.

1151
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,580
I'm also French too.

1152
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:19,460
This is when my brother, my brother and me kissed your dad's square on the lips.
