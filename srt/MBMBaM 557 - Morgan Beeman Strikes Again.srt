1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,820
Hello thanks for having me a

9
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,860
Great sir solid

10
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,100
To what is sure to be extremely chaotic my brother my brother me. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,860
I'm your middlest brother Travis McElroy, and I'm the other brother Jean

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,980
Hi, Jean. Hi. Hi, Jean. Welcome. Everybody. This is this is our friend Jean gray

13
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,780
You may know her from God. What what what Jean things things? Yeah, I'm so excited to be here

14
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,200
And that you finally decided to let the show be my brother my brother and Jean

15
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,860
My brother and Jean actually sounds better now. Yeah, we've been dancing around it for a long time

16
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,340
I'm actually a little stressed out if I could say because you're one of the few people who I think actually gives good advice

17
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,380
Yeah, I'm worried about that kind of standard of quality

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,620
Coming to coming to our program. Oh, well, don't worry about that. It's really gone downhill since the pandemic

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,860
Nothing to worry about there

20
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm I'm worried because I'm Jean you are smarter than everyone. I know put together

21
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:28,700
And I planned a lot of me though. Come on. No, I said what I said, I got a 1280 on the SAT

22
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Come on, man. I got a 1400

23
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,040
What why have we never talked about this now? I know why oh, I didn't take my SATs

24
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,100
No, I'm not doing that and they were like you can't get into NYU unless you take these SATs and I was like

25
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm gonna get into NYU. Anyway, I did

26
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,540
See so cool Jean. Damn it. Yeah. I also just want to say before anybody

27
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,420
Access as the kids say this is before they changed like the number of the highest you could get on that

28
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,340
So 1400 used to be good. No, what used to be good thing? I

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,960
Don't know. They had like another 800 points in there somewhere

30
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:14,260
I think just for putting your name on emotional intelligence. Yeah, it's just like yeah, how good of a friend are you?

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,580
How caring are you? Are you open to new experiences? Yeah stuff like that. Yeah, you just do tick-tock dances and they score you

32
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm gonna take it now

33
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,260
Can you do like yeah SATs? Can you like retro? I'm sure you can't they'll take your money

34
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,700
You should be allowed to be like I'm here for an adult as I'm an adult. I've changed my mind

35
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,760
I just want to put it on Facebook what my score is and I'm ready

36
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,460
Once you're once you're over 25, you should be able to rent a car and take the SAT

37
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:49,060
But be able to write on different questions like not applicable. Yeah, not I would never you I'm 25

38
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,660
I haven't also am I allowed to smoke during the SATs? I am it's the adult SATs. I can smoke

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,620
I think you should be able to put on Game of Thrones drink have a little like sippy cup of wine

40
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,380
Have an ashtray

41
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,900
Have some in case you need to cry take a break and watch something

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,860
Yeah

43
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,340
renew

44
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,900
So this is an advice show obviously take obviously we're gonna take people's

45
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,140
Questions and turn them out. We like into wisdom with with Jean's help. Our brother Griffin is still

46
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,140
I don't know man, I guess

47
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,660
Recuperating from having a baby. I don't know that he did that much. Well, he pushed a baby out of his body

48
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,580
Yeah, I pushed a baby out. Wow, which part?

49
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,220
Yeah, well, that's what we're still trying to determine Jean

50
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:41,300
We have our best people on this and we're just basing this on his sort of like attitude and work ethic

51
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,140
It just seems like he took it really well

52
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,900
I'm saying that like depending on which part I'd be like, I understand like if it's his but I'm like

53
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,820
You definitely need a break but like come back to work

54
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:59,220
But if it's like his p-hole, then he should be out for three years. Yeah, that's that's probably true. No, we're very sympathetic

55
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,060
Congratulations

56
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,380
Yeah, congratulations Griffin would love to talk to you or see you again if you get this message

57
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,820
Love for you to dip back in and put down the piÃ±a colada and come back

58
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,180
The beach

59
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,300
Okay

60
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Well, I want to get started

61
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:25,020
Jean I have a special segment here and it's called riddle me piss. Oh, no. Yeah now Jean

62
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
This is our guest

63
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,220
This is our guest Jean now I've got some riddles here

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,860
These are a little bit shorter

65
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,340
Faster riddles than we normally do these are sent by hazel

66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,780
These are from of course the service riddles calm and Jean, you know, just do your best. Like I said, you're very smart

67
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,540
So I'm sure you'll get these Jean the thing with these that Travis finds is that they're

68
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,860
Extremely bad riddles that no one would have ever gotten. So please don't well, I don't know. Well listen to this first one though

69
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,580
What's my motivation?

70
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,340
Like do I get to cross a bridge or something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you answer all five of these

71
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,980
You can cross a bridge

72
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:09,540
Extremely powerful. Yeah, you get a powerful crystal that will grant you two extra life. Hmm

73
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,420
Two this first one what crawls and is yellow and black and doesn't fly and there's the ones obvious, I think oh

74
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,700
It's it's a bee with a back injury. Oh

75
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
very close Justin a

76
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Yellow and black caterpillar

77
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,060
I guess that's close to what crossing is yellow and black. It doesn't fly. Why a bee spider, of course

78
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,740
I was also gonna say Morgan Beeman. Oh

79
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,740
Oh, okay

80
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,020
He used to fly

81
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,780
This one I just like the core concept of a guy works at the poison factory

82
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,260
Poison like Bellevue DeVoe

83
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,580
Yeah

84
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:00,900
Where they just met at the BBD factory. Yeah demand for Bellevue DeVoe's poison is off the charts folks

85
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,060
We got a print these these kasingles vinyl is back vinyls back. We got vinyl and kasingles

86
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,060
of Bellevue DeVoe's poison

87
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,460
Man, I hope whoever came up with the word kasingles was very proud of themselves

88
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:22,260
He goes home from work and his wife tells him to wash his hands before eating so he doesn't die

89
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,100
So he goes washes his hand and the next day he's found dead. How is that possible?

90
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,100
Um

91
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,660
It's endless

92
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,220
I'll just go ahead and tell you cuz I want to discuss it when he went to wash his hands

93
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,820
He opened the tap. So the poison went on the tap and when he closed the tap, he touched the poison again now

94
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,260
I think I like about that he works in the poison factory

95
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,580
He worked in the poison factory and what this what this riddle presupposes is that he was just in there in

96
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,220
The poison with his hands that he was just working the poison with his bare no safety

97
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,040
But it doesn't get anywhere else. I guess drive home, you know

98
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,420
I think I get yeah, this is all I can think is that this is like Victorian London

99
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Um

100
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,220
There have to be procedures for you to like scrub out you would think you would think what is correct but it's always wrong

101
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:39,540
Yeah, and this one people at home are screaming the answer to this well we can't really it's that obvious

102
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,540
It's so obvious. The answer is a bee because it always stings but also helps. It's Morgan Beeman again

103
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,820
It's Morgan Beeman again. I was also gonna say that he might have stung the guy from the poison

104
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,100
He might have stung. They're all

105
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,900
Okay, so what is babble

106
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,420
Storylines interweaving one more so dot-dot-dot

107
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,500
There was this one time you were thirsty and decided to boil water, right?

108
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,700
Just go with it. All you had left were one thin wine glass and one thick glass

109
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,380
Which is more likely to break love a thick glass a thick do you have a thick glass?

110
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,700
We I took a long time selecting our the glasses for this house because I didn't want them to be too thin or too thick

111
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:32,540
Yeah, I want a nice heavy glass. Do you know what I did? I now that I'm 40 I have completely

112
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,580
This is kind of embarrassing to admit, but I'm just gonna go I have almost completely

113
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,060
eliminated glass

114
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:48,020
Where from my we have a three-year-old and a six-year-old and enemy and I just don't want anything glass anymore

115
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:53,980
Everything's like yeah recycle plastic. I don't I'm just out of the game. I'm out of the glass game

116
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,560
I can't handle the pressure. I set glasses down too hard and break them

117
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,940
I and we referred to mostly everything I do is shrekking around just shrekking around

118
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,020
I'm just out there shrekking around breaking glasses left and right. I don't need that. It was probably your thing glasses. So I

119
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,560
Mean, wait what I just why was I boiling the water or what?

120
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,860
So there was this one time you were thirsty and decided to boil water, right?

121
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,500
And then it says in parentheses just go with it in parentheses

122
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah, just hot or do I wait for it to call you had left I'm telling you all the details I have

123
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:41,580
You decided to boil water right just go with it all you have left for one thin wine glass and one thick glass

124
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,580
which is more likely to break the

125
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,980
Glass but the answer is uh, why would you be boiling water to drink in the first place?

126
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,980
But I but are you fucking kidding me?

127
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,020
That is the answer that is the answer but what if you're in like what if you're on naked and afraid, uh-huh?

128
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:05,960
That's a good point. They told Travis this naked and afraid and two glasses. This is actually the most irritating one

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,700
Gene this is not Travis is not making these up

130
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:15,740
There's someone who like wrote that into the website and they're like wrote it into the world. Yeah fucking good riddle

131
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,700
Riddle good riddle. Why would you write that and send it? What's your answer?

132
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,460
Yeah, I am so fucking furious the answer right at the answer. Let me talk try slowly talk

133
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,200
Yeah, I'm furious. Okay, because at the one point where it's like

134
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,420
You might stop to think this is weird. Maybe this is part of the riddle. They literally said just go

135
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,340
with it like they did you that's cheating to the worst to the great

136
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,700
It's like you lit it can't get more unfair and they were like don't ask the answer and they also don't give the I mean

137
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,580
The the answer isn't but the question isn't

138
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,100
Do you drink the water? It's which is more likely to break has nothing to do with the fact that you're boiling water

139
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,300
This is the one I love it so much. There should be more there should be more like this. Don't look at him

140
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,460
Uh, yeah, don't send any more of those in. It's obvious. Thank you. Hazel Hazel sent those. Thank you. Thanks Hazel

141
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Okay, then we're gonna help actual people. Here we go

142
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,380
I've started trading voice messages with a pen pal during quarantine and it's been really fun and exciting. Oh good

143
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,380
She's French, but speaks excellent English. So we've been communicating via English so far

144
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,580
But I have secretly been learning French through an app so that I could speak with her in her native language

145
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,100
Well, I started my last message off with 30 seconds worth of what I thought was decent French

146
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,020
But her response didn't mention it at all

147
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
What the fuck do I do?

148
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
Or should I never mention it or

149
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,660
French fool god

150
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,660
It's a difficult pill. Yeah

151
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,540
I

152
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
I'm very confrontational

153
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,980
so

154
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,740
This one is difficult for me because my next message would have been like in French being like, did you hear my fucking French?

155
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,980
What's up

156
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:23,100
Yeah, yeah, did you fool a fool my you know, the whole thing. Did you get it bitch like what happened?

157
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,980
What's up

158
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,420
Is it possible that like I'm not bilingual

159
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,260
I speak a little Spanish like enough to get around right but like my brain still has to do the computations

160
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,380
It's not happening. Like second nature. Is it possible your French was so good

161
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
That it just didn't trigger

162
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:50,060
Like they just kind of like processed it right? Like I don't know. I'm used to hearing both of these. It's not gonna like

163
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,700
Mess me up. Like if you if you hang out with people who are bilingual, especially like two people who speak a different language from you

164
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,460
you'll notice in conversation sometimes they'll just start like

165
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,480
You know, they'll switch without even really thinking about it. Maybe your French was so good that they didn't even really process

166
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I watch a lot of polyglots

167
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Trying to surprise people

168
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,100
With their own languages videos on YouTube. That's my weird hobby

169
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,740
And that happens that people are like immediately like oh, okay, and then just continue with the conversation

170
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,480
So, uh, that's possible. I said like when people are at like a like when the you watch the videos of like

171
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
an American going into like

172
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,520
Chinese restaurant or something and then they're just like

173
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,300
Like let me blow you away with the fact that I also know your language

174
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,740
Statistically speaking, isn't it strange that there's no video of someone walking up to someone to do street magic

175
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:53,440
But then the person that they approach is also a street magician who does street magic back to them

176
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:03,220
That should exist right that has to have happened right but that's like it's not gonna mix, you know

177
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,960
I just not gonna be impressed what I would be

178
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,100
Going and they keep doing street magic back and forth between until they die. Yeah

179
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,860
Until they die and eventually they're like we should buy some tigers together. Absolutely. We should let's take this show on the road

180
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,580
This is I enjoy France very much. I

181
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Especially because they call me John

182
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,540
And so when I was in France a lot of my

183
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,820
My way of communicating I was like, I'm never gonna be good enough right now

184
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,580
So let me just choose things that I know are are funny like the monkey smoke in the pipe

185
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,820
And I'd say a lot of things about bicyclette

186
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,480
And if I was charming enough, then they were fine with it. They were like, oh, oh stupid. I'm a con

187
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,860
French is hard and

188
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:03,380
yeah, no, it's I tried to learn it during the last year because why not and

189
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,700
They have if I'm not mistaken

190
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,740
20 words, but those 20 words each have

191
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,020
1,000,000 different uses and so like voo could be

192
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,020
Anything don't complain about a language that is unless you're like mainly complaining about English

193
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,700
No, English is the worst English is the worst because none of what we say actually means

194
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:33,460
I've tried talking to a four-year-old and you use like a turn of phrase and the four-year-olds like what the fuck?

195
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,220
What does that mean and you're like, uh, don't worry about it. It's dumb. Don't worry about it

196
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,260
What did you want the person to say? It's like what?

197
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:49,800
Yeah, right like that's what you're hoping for. Like you're telling me you learned French in addition to English a feat

198
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Which I demonstrated

199
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,920
I think you just nailed it right there. I think it's like, oh, okay

200
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,400
So you decided to do the thing that I'm already doing. I'm not impressed. I'm already doing that thing and I think

201
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:14,480
Mainly a lot of Americans are like look at the light and everybody's like, yeah, we all speak like 80 languages like okay

202
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
So great good for you

203
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,400
Um, yeah, we already do and also if you didn't contextualize it it probably seemed kind of weird

204
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Like have you been catfishing this whole time and you spoke French this whole time?

205
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,300
Wait, if you had started speaking Esperanto, I bet they would have mentioned that right that would have been like, whoa

206
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,800
What was that? I didn't understand what you just said

207
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:42,360
Can you back up only 2% of the population understood what you just said if that I mean keep speaking French

208
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,280
That's uh, it's it's a great it's a great language to learn and to know but definitely like yeah, just ask

209
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Just ask and it is the best way to

210
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,760
Do it because you want to do it and not to impress somebody and I'm sure they'll help you

211
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
That would be nice to have somebody to

212
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,840
Communicate a language you're trying to learn. That's the best way to learn. Yeah, right

213
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,160
It's the best way to practice maybe record some messages of yourself like

214
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,320
Congratulating yourself after you learn the French and then play it back for yourself so you can get the validation. There you go

215
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,060
But like draw a fake mustache on and some cool sunglasses. Yeah alter ego complimentary Tony

216
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,280
Yeah, just there to bully your spirits make you feel that was a real good French you did son

217
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,840
I'm proud of you. Did you call me son? Yeah, I'm also your dad. I

218
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,760
Could tell you've been needing this you earned my respect for the first time finally

219
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,180
I respect your son and I was wrong to change the channel so I could watch Mythbusters. You were right

220
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
it

221
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,820
Wasn't your fault that your mom and I separated

222
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:51,980
At the time it was your school, but no it's all on me I wasn't there for I was speaking in anger son

223
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,700
It's something I learned from my dad, and I'm so glad you didn't learn for me

224
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,900
I like that you're sensitive meet your new mother you guys are the same age to get along great

225
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,340
I just want to let you know you're trape in my book in my book. You're always trape in

226
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:12,980
I so I want to try out something new here to replace Yahoo. This is sent in this was a suggestion

227
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,300
Did you know the Yahoo answer service died it? Yeah? Well, it's not your empire

228
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,260
I built an empire at it is dying in front of us. You can no longer

229
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,900
Put new questions on it is not they've not pulled the book. Yeah, you can't answer that. It's read-only

230
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,260
It's everyone can stop by and say their last goodbyes

231
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:36,700
Um yeah, so what Sarah said phase of its of its lifespan so sack exchange calm has a

232
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,940
part of its website for life hacks

233
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,540
But it's life hack requests or someone is saying do you have a life hack for this?

234
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,380
So thank you for sending this in Michael this request for a life hack

235
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,020
was was asked

236
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,780
How to properly eat crumbly food with your hand?

237
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm

238
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,820
Talking about grated cheese the crumbs at the bottom of a pack of chips you get the idea

239
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:11,380
Basically anything that gets stuck on your fingers and or falls to the ground when you try to put it in your hand

240
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,860
Into your mouth is there a nice trick

241
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,580
Preferably without tools to get this kind of stuff inside your mouth without making a mess that was asked by max D

242
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,440
Yeah, you tip the bag

243
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,000
into your mouth it's

244
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,440
Funny you should mention that Jean because the first answer

245
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,880
For the crumbs at the bottom of a bag of chips hold the bag with the opening on top make it almost flat and slowly

246
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,940
Rotated about 45 degrees while shaking it a little bit so that the crumbs end up in a corner

247
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,840
Continue to rotate and shake it while forming a small lip which easily fits into your mouth

248
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:56,360
Once the bag is rotated slightly more than 90 degrees. The crumbs will start to roll into your mouth. No tools needed

249
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,600
I guess this works less well for grated cheese since they tend to stick more. Maybe you have to shake a bit harder

250
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,480
They get a tap

251
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,400
slow tap a

252
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:13,560
Slow tap, you know, it's it's a one of the few times when I really feel alive is when I'm doing this with a noose

253
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,080
At the bottom. There's a lot of like different leaf and so yeah, I don't know I have

254
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:27,240
No idea. What kind of speed or texture. I'm about to experience like I could get like a full

255
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,920
Fun dip mouthful of like just salt and pepper. Oh, yeah. Yeah, and ruin my whole day

256
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,700
I don't know but that you know what? I don't even stop to think about it. That's how alive I am

257
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,600
Yeah, and vibrant in the moment even at 40

258
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,780
That's how I feel with like when you when you're down to the crumbs of a pretzel bag and you know

259
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,620
You know, it's straight salt, but I still can't stop myself from doing it to feel alive

260
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,420
You know what? I mean?

261
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:56,660
Like I feel like Bodhi jumping out of the airplane, right and I know Johnny Utah's chasing me

262
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,940
But I can't stop myself from doing it Justin. I

263
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,140
Don't really get these. I didn't understand any of that

264
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,140
What it's a point break. Oh

265
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,540
Christ

266
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,060
Point break. It's a great movie. You guys should see it. Oh, I have seen it

267
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,900
I've seen it many times and I remembered nothing all the musical. Oh, the musical is good. Yeah

268
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,380
Now sometimes okay. Now the only time I've gotten into trouble is this

269
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,600
Sometimes you do the tip up and you realize that in the opening of the bag initially you've left a small sort of

270
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,460
Blockade in the corner. So what you've done is you've created a sort of stoppage where the salt and flavor

271
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,260
Is that right? Oh you try and then you're then it's like, okay

272
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,580
Now we're in a real dire situation because I'm gonna try to open this up a little bit, but that's real danger

273
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,580
like you could be throwing a

274
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,140
flavor all over the place at that point now I

275
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,500
What about an extra long one of those like candy sticks that comes with like the liquor made?

276
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,100
You know the liquor stick you lick it and then you stick it in the dust and the dust sticks to it

277
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
But maybe it's savory

278
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
Where would you keep those?

279
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Yeah in your wallet

280
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,180
No, no, that wasn't it

281
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,860
You're talking about breadsticks. First of all, damn it. You're right. You vented breadsticks. Congratulations

282
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,580
I think you you could keep like a tube like maybe like a sheath on your hip that you keep the breadstick in a

283
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,300
Sheath. Yeah, so it's like a sore about a straw. What about a very thick like milkshake II straw

284
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,780
You can definitely die. So I'm just gonna suggest a shaken tap

285
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,860
a

286
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:41,060
Slow shake and take your time. Take your time. Don't be too anxious unless you're just like I this is how I live my life

287
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,100
I live on the edge then, you know

288
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,820
Or just combine all of the leave-ins into one bag over a period of time

289
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:56,180
Mmm, and then just go for all at once just and lose yourself in the day. That's actually how they make everything seasoning. Oh

290
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Yeah, it's just everything

291
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,500
Well at this point in the show we're gonna ask another question. Here we go. Hello

292
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,700
I'm a middle school teacher in the Minnesota

293
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,700
Okay, I accidentally stumbled across one of my students and her breakup tick-tocks about another one of my students

294
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:20,300
One of her posts was literally a screen capture of their entire text conversation for the last couple months with the caption

295
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,100
Watch the love of my life fall out of love with me. So obviously I needed to know about the drama

296
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,820
I had to keep pausing it to read and I accidentally double-tapped and liked the post. I

297
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:35,780
Unliked it, but I'm afraid she will see that I liked her posts. What do I do? Help me brothers?

298
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,660
well, let me

299
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,980
Let me start with a quick clarification

300
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:48,580
You didn't that's where I was going. I bet you didn't stumble across anything right gene. They didn't that's double

301
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,820
that is not an act you did not trip and

302
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,880
And you're like, what's this? It's somebody I know it's one of my

303
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:06,700
What a coincidence that out of the millions of users I've stumbled isn't the world I should follow them

304
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,780
Just because of the happenstance

305
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm faded to see this because I've stumbled

306
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,740
I'm meant to be here. Think of the good I could do

307
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,500
Yeah, I

308
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,900
Think that's the answer to the question

309
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,020
Basically what we're saying is you called down the Thunder and now you got it

310
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:34,660
Yes, you lean into it just start liking all of them and when they're like, uh, mr

311
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:39,780
No, wait, no, okay Travis actually makes a good but trust it like you're a teacher. You're super old. I get it

312
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,500
I'm super old to what you could do at this point is just go through and start liking

313
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:51,740
Everything and just profess an ignorance of how the platform I like I like you

314
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,060
So just liking all your posts or go the other way and when they're like miss Thompson

315
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,780
Did you like the post about my break up like yeah good content good content. Say I'm loving it go viral

316
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,740
I think your choices are are there's there's no middle ground here because you've already gone full extreme

317
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,900
So you have to choose one of those options that have just been provided to you

318
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,660
You could use their sound to make your own videos. Mm-hmm

319
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,860
Yeah, just take the sounds from their videos and make just do at them

320
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,300
That's a thing you could do stitch it together and then post it in class

321
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,980
And then on the bright side after all of this you might go to jail and you won't have to see tick-tock again

322
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,100
That's the only thing that would get me off the top at this point

323
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,860
You gotta lock me up. Keep me away from it. Keep me away from that content

324
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,020
I still feel I still have the feeling when I'm looking at tick-tock that I have stumbled into some sort of like

325
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:54,260
Contraband like old-person contraband. Yeah, like I'm not supposed to be able to have access to this this amount of culture

326
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,260
Yeah, it feels wrong. I know that I'm not supposed to be there. It's um

327
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,340
I've I've now had the experience of like being in a bar or some instance where I'm like, oh

328
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,660
These these people are I'm old enough to be everyone's mom and I need to go

329
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,340
It's the record scratch moment, right?

330
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,580
But the way I use a tick-tock is like I walked in there was a record scratch

331
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,580
but then I also just sat down and

332
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,060
Ordered a drink and just stayed for a while while everyone just continued to stare at me the whole time. I enjoyed my drink

333
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:33,580
Hey, isn't that guy really old? Hey, should that old guy be did he order seconds? What's happening?

334
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:38,900
You don't know life until you actually walk into a nightclub where your very famous

335
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,060
DJ friend is DJing and they can't hear what you're saying

336
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:48,900
So you go up to the DJ booth and you actually bump the record player and do the record scratch

337
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,260
Thus the entire club turns to you

338
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,060
Haven't Wow at that point Jean

339
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,740
I guess you either leave or start doing a very good rap that blows everybody away

340
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,980
Like those are your options right yelled. I was like what I was saying was and then just

341
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,420
I was like just fucking lean into it. And that's where we're at one time Griffin and I

342
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,620
He lived in Cincinnati with me and we lived in Batavia, which is like outskirts not a fantasy kingdom

343
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,620
No, it's an area

344
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:25,660
Outskirts of Cincinnati and we anytime we wanted to do anything

345
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,280
We were always driving into Cincinnati to do something and so one day we were like, well

346
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,620
We're gonna go on a quest to find like a bar around here

347
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,620
That could be like a local place that we go to so we're not like driving 40 minutes

348
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,460
They do a bar and so we were just hitting any bar

349
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,700
We could find like on map quest or whatever the fuck and we found this one where we walked in and it was

350
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,260
Pretty much felt like the bar from Pee Wee's big adventure. Oh

351
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,220
And Griffin and I walked in

352
00:28:51,220 --> 00:29:00,020
Everyone literally turned and looked at us and we backed out and and left they should have I feel like bars

353
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:07,020
Should have a sort of vestibule breezeway kind of thing with with one side of glass

354
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,180
You know what I'm saying? We're like you could where you have like a 10-second grace period like oh, no, no

355
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
No, this is wrong. I shouldn't have done this

356
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,660
Right thing cuz I know I can't just turn and turn heel and walk. I tell you you guys are

357
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:24,700
Like this experience is based. I would love that vestibule

358
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,740
Because I would like to know driving across America

359
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,100
I'm like being black and stopping at any random bar always feels like that

360
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:38,260
And I would like to just know that there's a vestibule and it was like get out of here and I was like, all right

361
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,260
well

362
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Any further

363
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,380
We're just gonna get back I'd like a racist vestibule

364
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,700
Generally tell by the town the town is kind of the vestibule, but you know

365
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,140
How close is the cracker barrel to the bar

366
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:12,540
We're gonna take a quick break and do advertisements and then we'll come back and there will be more show

367
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
I'm I'm certain of it

368
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
Oh these pants Oh

369
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:33,260
These pants Justin these these pants that I'm wearing Oh these pants. Uh-huh. I got them through stitch fix

370
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,780
Good. Yeah, I love stitch fix. I thought you would then maybe say like what is stitch fix or something?

371
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:44,900

372
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,460

376
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:10,240
If you're like, I would never spend $50. That's if you look at a t-shirt that cost $50

377
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,660
And you say that's $50 for a t-shirt and and that's a problem for you. Yeah stitch fix can work around that

The one thing we can guarantee you stitch fix is that they have no dookie

381
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,860
You don't know that it's possible. You can't say that Justin

382
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,740
It says right here in the fine print says don't say we don't have dookie brown jumpsuits

383
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:40,260
There's no subscription required try stitch fix once or set up automatic deliveries

394
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,540
I forgot probiotic gummies at the store. I didn't get them

395
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,980
I don't know what I'm supposed to do now Travis

401
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:13,440

We don't have a choice

416
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,240
We have to put on a show

417
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,100
To six the final season on maximum fun

418
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:57,100
We're about to yell squad.

00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:12,100
He'll say munch, Gene, and then we yell squad.

420

Okay, now he's trying to impress you.

421
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,100
I want to munch, squad.

422
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,100
I want to munch, squad.

423
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,100
Welcome to Munch Squad.

424
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,100
It's a podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating.

425
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,100
And we have got such a mass.

426
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:44,100
This has never happened where a story has been this fucking fresh and hot off the presses.

427
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,100
It's happening now.

428
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
We're living in this moment.

429
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:53,100
Domino's Pizza has brought back the Noid.

430
00:35:53,100 --> 00:36:01,100
The Noid, which they successfully did avoid for decades.

431
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:09,100
The Noid has come home to Domino's Pizza, New York Stock Exchange ticker DPZ.

432
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,100
It's the largest pizza company in the world and they've brought back the Noid.

433
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:22,100
Now the Noid, they describe here as an anti-hero that has been trying to prevent great pizza delivery since 1986.

434
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:27,100
I would just say that is a villain in my book.

435
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:36,100
I mean, I guess it is literally the anti of a hero, but that's not what that term means.

436
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,100
This is a wild press release here.

437
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:48,100
And if you're I guess like younger than me at all, like if you're a young person and this is like lost,

438
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,100
he looks like kind of like a superhero.

439
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Kind of like he was in the Incredibles.

440
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Yeah, exactly.

441
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Like that vibe with big red ears and he was a big thing in the mid 80s and he would try to like mess up pizza delivery.

442
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Sort of like the Hamburglar, but for pizzas.

443
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Yeah, exactly.

444
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,100
And so you would try to avoid the Noid.

445
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,100
There was a video game.

446
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
There was a video game.

447
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
There was a-

448
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,100
And also shout out to rapper Big Noid.

449
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,100
This is huge news for you.

450
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah, that's going to get that Google juice going real nice for you.

451
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,100
So the big, not Big Noid.

452
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
Big Noid is not interfering with pizza delivery.

453
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,100
Well, that we know of.

454
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
That we know of.

455
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,100
Right, maybe.

456
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Who knows?

457
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
This is the press release.

458
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:41,100
The largest pizza company in the world has always had one nemesis, the Noid.

459
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
An anti-hero.

460
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:47,100
An anti-hero that has been- you would think it's other pizza, right?

461
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
Nope.

462
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,100
Nope, it's a villain they invented.

463
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:54,100
It's been trying to prevent great pizza delivery since 1986.

464
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,100
I can't believe they put this in the press release.

465
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,100
Maybe it was the chaos of 2020 that gave the Noid the confidence to return.

466
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,100
Hey, are you fucking sure that that's the angle you want to go with?

467
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Are you telling me that Noid was watching TV and he saw the global pandemic claiming millions of lives and was like,

468
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
I gotta stop pizza delivery.

469
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
I'm back, baby.

470
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Now's my time.

471
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Yeah.

472
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,100
This is my moment.

473
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Or possibly the fact that Domino's has continued to innovate around great pizza delivery with amazing technology.

474
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,100
Whatever the reason that Noid simply can't stand it anymore.

475
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,100
And the pesky anti-hero has returned in Domino's new television ads,

476
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:43,100
which began airing today trying to thwart the advanced technology of Neuro's R2 robot,

477
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:50,100
a completely autonomous, occupantless on-road vehicle out on a pizza delivery.

478
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,100
Wait, what?

479
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
What?

480
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Yeah, guys, here's what I'm saying to you.

481
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:03,100
I watched this new ad, if you go to YouTube and search for videos of the Noid that have been posted in the last week,

482
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,100
I watched it when it had literally 87 views this morning.

483
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:16,100
And it is a truck, a robot truck, that is trying to deliver pizza.

484
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
And the Noid's like, fuck that.

485
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,100
I'm going to stop this robot from doing its job with all my different tricks.

486
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:29,100
It just feels like it's a shortcut to vehicular manslaughter.

487
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
This little robot, by the way, is so wild, y'all.

488
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
I wish you could see it.

489
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:42,100
It's just a tiny little pizza delivery robot and the Noid in a sort of man versus machine thing.

490
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:48,100
He can't thwart people anymore, but maybe he can stop a super smart AI pizza delivery robot.

491
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I don't know why that would be the play.

492
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Can I just say just a little message to Domino's, if I might?

493
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Sure.

494
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:06,100
Maybe, y'all, maybe just make better pizza.

495
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,100
This seems incredibly elaborate.

496
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,100
You had focus groups.

497
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,100
You had so many meetings.

498
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,100
You hired new people.

499
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,100
You spent just maybe you could have spent that money.

500
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
I don't know.

501
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,100
Making better pizza.

502
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
You know, it's also strange, Jean, now that you mention it.

503
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:34,100
It is strange that they have introduced the idea, reintroduced the idea of the Noid at the same moment that they say,

504
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,100
also, just a side note, we got robots to learn how to make pizza.

505
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Also, have you seen the robots?

506
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Don't worry about them.

507
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
I'm sure they're fine.

508
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,100
But the Noid, right?

509
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,100
Don't worry about the pizza robots.

510
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
They're fine and they're not going to ever do anything wrong.

511
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
Did you say a robot truck that delivers pizza?

512
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

513
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,100
But look, he's back.

514
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Jean just raised a great point.

515
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,100
Did the robot kill the Noid?

516
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,100
The pizza robot can't legally kill the Noid.

517
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,100
You can't try a robot in court.

518
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Law of robotics.

519
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Law of robotics.

520
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Rule number one, don't kill the Noids.

521
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,100
So they basically have set up some murder robots.

522
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:20,100
Some murder robots that are designed to do two things, deliver mediocre pizza and kill the Noid.

523
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,100
The Noid, here's a quote, the Noid is Domino's oldest and most famous villain.

524
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
Wait, what are the others?

525
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,100
You all have a rogues gallery over there?

526
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Well, there's Cybernoid.

527
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:44,100
The pizza delivery testing we're doing with Neuro's autonomous vehicle is exactly the kind of technology innovation that could provoke the Noid to return, said Kate Trumbull, Domino's vice president of advertising.

528
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:50,100
However, after 35 years of practice in avoiding the Noid, we're pretty confident we know how to defeat it.

529
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
What are you talking about?

530
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
What are you fucking talking about?

531
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
You invented it.

532
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,100
What do you mean you know how to fucking defeat it, you lunatics?

533
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
What are you talking about?

534
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Yeah, if you close your eyes, he stops existing.

535
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,100
It's a manifestation of your own dark urges.

536
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:11,100
Well, he used to be Justin, but now we don't know.

537
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,100
Television screens are a great place for a classic nemesis to return.

538
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
What?

539
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:23,100
I hate the parts in these where I can tell it's a fellow human, same species as me and everything, that has to fill a paragraph.

540
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:35,100
And they're like, I guess one of the things that I could combine words into saying is, while television screens are a great place for a classic nemesis to return, mobile devices are the newest place for the Noid to cause problems.

541
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,100
So basically on May 7th, the Noid is going to join the new Crash Bandicoot game.

542
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,100
What?

543
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
In ways that I don'tâ¦

544
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:49,100
So the Noid will be featured as one of the game's mini-bosses, pitting players against the Noid as Crash progresses through the story.

545
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
Avoiding the Noid has never been so fun.

546
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Players will also have access to exclusiveâ¦

547
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
No, just stop. No, just stop. Just stop.

548
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Yeah, thank you, God. Thank you.

549
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,100
Domino's, you fucking make pizza and calm down.

550
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100
What the fuck are you talking about?

551
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:07,100
Nobody wantsâ¦ I don't want a Domino's video game or a villain.

552
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:13,100
I just wantâ¦ I don't even want you to make good pizza.

553
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,100
Just do your best at the pizza.

554
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
Know who you are.

555
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:21,100
God damn it. What are you doing?

556
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:32,100
It occurred to me that maybe, and this is hard to say, but the wildest thing about this has just occurred to me.

557
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,100
Neuros is a separate company.

558
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
Yeah.

559
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:42,100
So that means that at some point a representative of Dominio's had to go to Neuro and say,

560
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:49,100
hey, you know how you've developed a self-driving delivery truck and we're going to start using it.

561
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,100
We love that.

562
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:57,100
And so we think the best way to roll out that news is to bring back the Noid.

563
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Yeah.

564
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,100
Don't worry about it because there's also a limitedâ¦

565
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:07,100
The Dominio's has a limited number of hang in there and avoid the Noid t-shirts.

566
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,100
What? Is it like the kitten?

567
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,100
Yeah, it's just like the Noid hanging on something for purchase on Amazon.

568
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:22,100
And guys, if you go and look, it's literally just like no branding, no anything, just like a picture of a shirt that says avoid the Noid.

569
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,100
And it does have some great features on it, like a tearaway label.

570
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,100
And it does say here in the features Noid design printed on front of shirt.

571
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
Oh, cool.

572
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,100
So that's huge if you want to put the Noid on your shirt.

573
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:45,100
And yeah, you can share the Noid in GIF and sticker search engines on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok.

574
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,100
I don't want the teams to find out about the Noid.

575
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,100
Maybe some gluten-free options.

576
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:52,100
Maybe some keto or vegan options.

577
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:58,100
I'm just trying to suggest anything else that they could have done with this money.

578
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Maybe help the homeless.

579
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Yeah, so that's what's going on with the Noid.

580
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
Thanks for keeping me.

581
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,100
I've been worried.

582
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,100
I haven't heard from him since the last reunion.

583
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,100
That's what's up with the Noid.

584
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,100
I have another quick bit I want to try real quick.

585
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Oh, my God.

586
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,100
I've titled this bit, That's Interesting Trivia, Son.

587
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:23,100
And what I did is I went on IMDb, looked up one of my favorite movies, and I pulled three bits of trivia from it.

588
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:27,100
And I want you guys to guess the movie I'm describing.

589
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
Okay.

590
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
Is this going to be funny or is it going to be more of aâ¦

591
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,100
Is it point break?

592
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
Yeah.

593
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Is it point break?

594
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,100
It's a little bit of a point break.

595
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:40,100
I've titled it, That's Interesting Trivia.

596
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,100
I mean, it's interesting.

597
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,100
It doesn't always have to be funny, Justin.

598
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,100
That's not what my comedy is about.

599
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,100
My comedy is not about being funny.

600
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,100
Sometimes it's making other people look funnier by comparison.

601
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,100
The working title of this film was Hot and Cold.

602
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,100
Is that it?

603
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:00,100
That was the first one, yeah.

604
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,100
Any guesses?

605
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,100
Any guesses so far?

606
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
No?

607
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,100
Okay.

608
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:13,100
This was considered as a vehicle for Corey Haim and Corey Feldman early in production before it was decided to make the leads older.

609
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:15,100
Was their movie licensed to drive together?

610
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,100
No, it wasn't.

611
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:17,100
What was Corey's movie?

612
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,100
Was it Ferris Bueller?

613
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Oh, good guesses.

614
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
One more.

615
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
And I think that this one's a giveaway.

616
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Body count, one.

617
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,100
One person dies in this movie?

618
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
Ice-T.

619
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,100
Correct.

620
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Ice-T was in it because he was in Body Count.

621
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
I'd like to get really elaborate.

622
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,100
One person dies?

623
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,100
One person dies.

624
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,100
And it's a two-buddy comedy.

625
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Uh-huh.

626
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:48,100
And the working title of the film was Hot and Cold.

627
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Wait, is it a comedy?

628
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Yes.

629
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,100
And the Corys are in it or they were slated to be in it?

630
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,100
They were planned to be in it, but then they made the leads older.

631
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,100
And let me say that Body Count one is incredibly essential to the movie.

632
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
Oh, it's Weekend at Bernie's.

633
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,100
It is Weekend at Bernie's.

634
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:14,100
The working title of Hot and Cold is the most bizarre of that.

635
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
Because he was hot.

636
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
And then he was cold.

637
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
And then he was cold.

638
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,100
Then he was cold when he was dead.

639
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:26,100
Another slam dunk bit from Travis.

640
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,100
Okay, let's help more people.

641
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,100
I live in an apartment building.

642
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,100
At the end of my hallway, there's an edible arrangement.

643
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
I think those are two different.

644
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,100
I live in an apartment building.

645
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,100
And at the end of my hallway, that makes more sense.

646
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,100
Thank you, Travis.

647
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,100
There is an edible arrangement in front of a door.

648
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,100
It has been there for several days and it is starting to look bad.

649
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,100
I don't know these people, if they're home or not.

650
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,100
But should I knock on the door so they could check outside their door?

651
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:54,100
I'm afraid it'll look like I'm the person who delivered their fruit bouquet.

652
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:57,100
Or a weirdo who cares about the weird old fruit in the hallway.

653
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,100
Should I knock and escape through the stairwell next to the door immediately?

654
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,100
Will it appear as though someone brought them an old, maybe spoiled, edible arrangement?

655
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,100
What do I do?

656
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,100
That's from Gina.

657
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,100
I like to think it's from The Noid.

658
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,100
It's from The Noid.

659
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
Maybe The Noid's like, please take me back.

660
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:15,100
This is why The Noid is trying to stop pizza delivery.

661
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,100
Because he invested big in edible arrangements.

662
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:22,100
And it hasn't quite taken off the way he had hoped as a pizza replacement.

663
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,100
I like this question.

664
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,100
One of the reasons I picked this question is because it highlights to me

665
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,100
the way that sometimes the human brain can get spun up into anxiety.

666
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Because the idea that you would knock on this person's door and be like,

667
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,100
hey, there's an edible arrangement out here.

668
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,100
And that your fear is that they go, did you bring this?

669
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,100
I don't think that's going to happen.

670
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:48,100
But here's the problem is, I've been preaching this a lot on this show lately,

671
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
and I'm just going to keep reinforcing it.

672
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,100
You have to just act when the moment strikes.

673
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,100
Because you always make it weirder by waiting.

674
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:04,100
There's just no sense in, like, it's so much less weird to get to the end of the day

675
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:08,100
and be like, I bet they'd want this fruit to not go bad.

676
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
I want to give them a quick Nakarovski.

677
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:16,100
It's so less weird to do that than to knock on the door and be like,

678
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,100
did you want this rotten fruit or what?

679
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:23,100
Yeah, because you will inherently, like, doing it spontaneously,

680
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:28,100
you are more likely to nail the delivery than thinking about it for too long.

681
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Because the casual nature will be out the window

682
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,100
if you've thought about it for more than 30 seconds.

683
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
Fruit here, huh?

684
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,100
Why did you not?

685
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:42,100
Anyways, like, that's how I would do it.

686
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:50,100
Yeah, the anxiety and the overthinking and the overanalyzing that you're doing with this,

687
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,100
you could be spending your time doing a lot more.

688
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,100
And I know that you are thinking about this a lot in the day.

689
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,100
Like, so many hours and you've made so many movies in your head

690
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,100
of the different ways that this goes.

691
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
So you've got to knock.

692
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,100
Also, you live in an apartment building, it's at the end of your hallway,

693
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,100
and you don't want whatever is coming for these edible arrangements

694
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,100
to end up in your apartment.

695
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:20,100
And I don't mean like the Noid, I mean like vermin or roaches or whatever.

696
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:27,100
So it is also very important that you take control of the situation.

697
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
Just knock on the door.

698
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
Don't leave them a note, because I know you want to.

699
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
Don't put a note under the door.

700
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,100
Also, they could be dead in there.

701
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,100
Why don't you be a hero?

702
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,100
Why don't you find out what's going on?

703
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,100
Like everyone else, and because we are all sort of like everyone for themselves

704
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,100
and we're living in this place, and especially in apartment buildings,

705
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,100
I know that I didn't like to talk to neighbors or for whatever reason,

706
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,100
or you may be an introvert.

707
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,100
But right now you need to take control of the situation,

708
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,100
because no one else is going to do that.

709
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Just to clarify, Gene, do you think, and I guess this is more subjective

710
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,100
than anything else, but do you think that if you were the person to discover

711
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,100
that a neighbor is dead in their apartment,

712
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,100
would that get you to be considered a hero, or is that just?

713
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:20,100
And I'm asking this, I don't know the answer.

714
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
Oh no, I'd be a fucking hero.

715
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,100
Because you don't know what's going on.

716
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,100
Like they could have been, what if they've been like missing?

717
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,100
You don't know what's going on.

718
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
You don't know what's going on in there.

719
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,100
Or maybe they've just been very sleepy and you've woken them up

720
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,100
and they almost miss work.

721
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,100
The problem, if you had done it the first day,

722
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,100
it would have looked like you were concerned about them

723
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,100
getting some delicious bread.

724
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,100
When you do it four days later, I'm concerned about the mess you have here

725
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,100
and I need it removed.

726
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Yeah, but you have to do it.

727
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,100
You do have to do it, and you have to stop thinking about it.

728
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,100
Just do it. Just do stuff.

729
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,100
That's my motto.

730
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,100
I listened to this book called The Five Second Rule,

731
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,100
and the lady said that it was Mel Robbins,

732
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:10,100
and she said that if you just do five, four, three, two, one, go,

733
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,100
and just do it.

734
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,100
Don't think about it any more than that.

735
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,100
If you had done that, who knows what possibilities you could have.

736
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,100
They could have given you one of the strawberries.

737
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,100
Oh shit, maybe one of the chocolate covered ones.

738
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,100
What if they opened the door and they were like,

739
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,100
oh, your edible arrangements are here.

740
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,100
And they were like, that's great.

741
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,100
$1 million, and now you don't even know.

742
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,100
Thank you. You've passed the test.

743
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,100
This was a TikTok thing, and now you're rich.

744
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,100
Here, there is one.

745
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,100
I just don't know.

746
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:44,100
People said it was too elaborate, but I'm so glad that it worked out.

747
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,100
There is one problem though, Justin, with the just do stuff mantra,

748
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,100
is if you're a person that has impulse control problems,

749
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,100
and you think like, oh, I thought of a funny bit from my podcast

750
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,100
that my friends and my brother will like,

751
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,100
and then you don't really think about it beyond that,

752
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,100
and then you do the bit, and then the bit doesn't work.

753
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,100
You're like, why did I do that?

754
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,100
It still works, you just have to adjust it to 50.

755
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,100
Just count to 50.

756
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,100
Okay, I'll try that next time.

757
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,100
It also says it may be spoiled.

758
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:13,100
I'm saying it's a fruit bouquet, and it's been there for several days.

759
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,100
It has gone bad.

760
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,100
My metric for is something okay to eat now is like,

761
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:25,100
did it sit out long enough that I forgot it was there for a second?

762
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,100
And if the answer is yes, it's a problem now for me.

763
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,100
I watched too many, I worked a lot of food handling jobs in my youth,

764
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:39,100
and I watched one too many instructional videos about the danger zone,

765
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,100
and now it's way up in my brain.

766
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,100
I throw a lot of stuff out that Quelle thinks should still be fine,

767
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,100
and I'm like, you're insane.

768
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,100
This is why I'm glad my wife, because Theresa is the same as Quelle

769
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,100
in that respect, and the number of times that I've had to be like,

770
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,100
okay, well, I need you to smell this, because I'm already thinking about it,

771
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,100
and it's not going to work out.

772
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,100
I don't see how you see that this is fine, or that you can pick around it.

773
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,100
Don't do that.

774
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,100
Oh, I also want to go back to the same, because there's a question,

775
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,100
the part of the question says, should I knock and escape through the stairwell?

776
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Now, I think that you should knock, that you should have the conversation,

777
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,100
but then you should also escape through the stairwell,

778
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,100
and really present yourself as mysterious.

779
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, wait until they bend down to pick up the edible arrangement,

780
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,100
and again, then you're gone.

781
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,100
I've thought about how much different Batman would be perceived

782
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:38,100
if he just walked away from conversations, because one, it's not as mysterious,

783
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:41,100
but two, he always disappears in the middle of the other person talking,

784
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,100
and if instead they looked over and they're like, where are you going?

785
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,100
And he's like, I've got to go away now.

786
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,100
And they're like, wait, no.

787
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:52,100
No, we're still, I haven't told you where the asshole.

788
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:56,100
It's one of my favorite things, that he just leaves.

789
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,100
And in that, I aspire to be many different superheroes in many ways,

790
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:05,100
because of their strengths, but Batman's goodbyes,

791
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,100
it's so much further than Irish goodbyes.

792
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,100
He knows when he has all the information he needs.

793
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:15,100
And I wish someone would just like, here's how you fuck up Batman.

794
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:20,100
You just never, never lose eye contact.

795
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,100
And then you'll be able to see him clenching his teeth,

796
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,100
and it's like, he really wants to go, but just never give him the opportunity.

797
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,100
Never turn away.

798
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,100
You blink one eye at a time, right?

799
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,100
So you can keep the other one open on him.

800
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,100
You can clockwork orange your eyes.

801
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,100
And now by this time, the Joker has murdered a lot of people,

802
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,100
but you got one up on Batman.

803
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:47,100
He's like, oh my God, what would happen if you didn't give him the opportunity to leave?

804
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:52,100
And then the sun rose, and now Batman's just walking home.

805
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,100
I guess he would probably drive.

806
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,100
I have work, I have to go.

807
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,100
So how's everything?

808
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:02,100
I like that I made him sort of Louis Armstrong.

809
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,100
Yeah.

810
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,100
How's everything, Commissioner?

811
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,100
How come I only see you for work stuff?

812
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,100
We never hang out anymore.

813
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:18,100
I think if you just force Batman into the rest of the conversation that he refuses to have,

814
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:21,100
that he would also be different.

815
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:24,100
Hey, yeah, so the Riddler is attacking the Bank of Gotham.

816
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,100
But also, how are you?

817
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,100
How have you been?

818
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,100
Where are you going?

819
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,100
Come back, Batman.

820
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
I'm back.

821
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,100
Gina and I just had a whole conversation while you were gone.

822
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,100
Oh, was it for the show?

823
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,100
Yeah.

824
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,100
All right.

825
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
It's a lot about Batman, really.

826
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Thanks so much for listening to our podcast, My Brother, My Brother, and Me.

827
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,100
We hope you've enjoyed it.

828
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,100
A reminder, you can buy our merchandise at McElroyMerch.com.

829
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,100
But I'm more interested in talking about Gene.

830
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,100
How can people find more Gene Gray?

831
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,100
Right now, don't.

832
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,100
I'll find you, which sounds like a threat.

833
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,100
I currently have deactivated my Twitter because I'm working.

834
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:13,100
But you should be checking back with me in the upcoming months on my Instagram.

835
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,100
And I'll come back on Twitter on my IG.

836
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,100
It's GinaGrayzio.

837
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:24,100
And then you can find me at GinaGrayzio on Twitter with some very important updates of what I've been working on for the past year.

838
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,100
Yes, there are puppets involved.

839
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Whoa.

840
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,100
Oh, boy.

841
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,100
Justin, where can we find you?

842
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,100
Don't.

843
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:34,100
Don't.

844
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,100
Don't.

845
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:39,100
I'm deactivating mine too because it sounded cool when Gene said it, so I'm going to do it too.

846
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:41,100
I'm reactivating your Twitter.

847
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,100
Travis deactivated my Twitter.

848
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,100
No, I don't know.

849
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,100
I don't know.

850
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,100
You've already found me.

851
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,100
You're listening to my podcast.

852
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,100
Thank you.

853
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,100
Thank you for doing that.

854
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,100
I appreciate it.

855
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,100
Hey, here's my plug.

856
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
Go get your fucking vaccine.

857
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:59,100
If you can get your vaccine, go get your fucking vaccine, please.

858
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,100
Just go get it.

859
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,100
Please.

860
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,100
Please.

861
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,100
Please.

862
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,100
Please.

863
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,100
Please.

864
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:06,100
Please.

865
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:07,100
I want to see.

866
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:08,100
I want to hug a person.

867
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,100
Yeah.

868
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,100
I want to see other people hug.

869
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,100
I just want to watch people hug for money, you know?

870
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,100
Wait.

871
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,100
Hold on.

872
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,100
Wait.

873
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,100
Hold on.

874
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,100
Hold on.

875
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,100
Not through a TV.

876
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,100
Screen in person so I can see them shifting awkwardly.

877
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Yeah.

878
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,100
Okay.

879
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:30,100
Thank you to Montaigne for our theme song, My Life Is Better With You.

880
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:35,100
The full song will be available soon.

881
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:41,100
By the way, if you're in a place that can support a Eurovision vote, if you've got a

882
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:47,100
vote in the Eurovision, Montaigne is going to be battling it out.

883
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,100
And because of various travel restrictions, she's not going to be able to come to the

884
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,100
contest itself.

885
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,100
So she's going to need all the votes she can get.

886
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:02,100
So please support Montaigne in the Eurovision Song Contest, which I believe is on May 22nd.

887
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:08,100
Can I also sing a version of a theme song for this episode that I've been thinking about,

888
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,100
which is definitely not ripped from a commercial from the 80s about a product?

889
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,100
Yeah, please.

890
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,100
Sure.

891
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,100
That'll be huge.

892
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:21,100
My brother, my brother, wherever he goes, I'm going to go.

893
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:24,100
My brother, my brother.

894
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Who's that?

895
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:30,100
Me and my brother, my brother and Gene.

896
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,100
That's lovely, Gene.

897
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,100
See, you're a musical genius.

898
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:35,100
This is what I'm talking about.

899
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,100
How do you come up with this stuff?

900
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,100
And people who don't have video don't see that Gene had those lyrics typed up and did

901
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,100
not just in the moment come up with his shit music.

902
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:47,100
I had them handwritten onto the wall with a Sharpie, so it's really in there now.

903
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,100
It's permanent.

904
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,100
It's not going anywhere.

905
00:59:51,100 --> 01:00:00,100
Anyway, I'm realizing terrifyingly that the way we end this show is by Griffin reading

906
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:01,100
Final Yahoo.

907
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,100
We have neither of those.

908
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,100
I have a Final Life hack I can read.

909
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,100
Oh, thank goodness.

910
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,100
That's perfect.

911
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:12,100
This was also sent in by Michael and asked by Madula Oblangada.

912
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,100
How to roast a chicken in a hotel room.

913
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,100
My name is Justin McElroy.

914
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,100
I'm Travis McElroy.

915
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,100
I'm Jean McElroy.

916
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,100
Thanks for listening to my brother, my brother, and Gene.

917
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:50,100
Kiss your dad, screw on the lips.

918
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:08,100
MaxFun drives almost here.

919
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:13,100
It starts on Monday, May 3rd, ends on May 14th, and it's the best time to support the

920
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,100
shows you love.

921
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,100
Here are some folks like you sharing what MaxFun and our shows mean to them.

922
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,100
Most importantly, it's meant community.

923
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:26,100
And, yeah, just thanks for hanging out and making Joakim up and making my week a little

924
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,100
bit brighter.

925
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:37,100
So, thanks MaxFun for making me a better person and making sure that I'm surrounded by better

926
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,100
people.

927
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,100
Thanks again for all you do.

928
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:42,100
Love supporting MaxFun and keep it up.

929
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,100
Come back Monday, May 3rd for more details from your favorite hosts.

930
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,100
We'll have some of the best episodes of the year, special MaxFun Drive thank you gifts,

931
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,100
and maybe a few surprises.

932
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:53,100
That's Monday, May 3rd.

933
01:01:53,100 --> 01:02:20,100
Until then.
