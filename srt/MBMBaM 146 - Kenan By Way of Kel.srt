1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:50,320
Beat beat, all aboard, money car. Why is that car so small? We can't fit,

6
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800
we can't fit more than like three people in a car. As the trolley pulling into the station,

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,720
it's made of money. How about this? I like this, I like this analogy better.

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Ticket please, because you've been riding our comedy train for three fucking years,

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,560
and if you don't hand me that ticket, we're going to throw you off. We'll ban your IP.

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,720
Hey, it's me, the Piper. What's up? Hey, Piper's here. It's me, Piper Parabo.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,920
Time to pay for your favorite comedy podcast. Thanks, Billy Piper. Sincerely,

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,800
celebrity endorser, Billy Piper. This is Billy Maze. Billy Maze here for a new product

13
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,320
that you've been using for three years. Come back from the dead. I'm a spectral form now

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
to tell you you've been listening to this podcast for three years. Time to chunk up the change.

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Is that it? Time to chunk up the change with my brother, my brother, me,

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,360
special pledge drive podcast. It's time to pay the Piper. We got a big show for you today. We bet

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,880
as we record it, I'm sure its size will be revealed to us. It seems like it will be big.

18
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,720
Do you guys want to say anything on the podcast? Guys, thank you so much for your support because

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,360
I'm assuming that you heard on Twitter that it was Max Fun Drive Time and you immediately clicked

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,920
the link and you immediately just dropped, you just immediately junked us right there,

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
right there on the spot. You plonked it down, a big one. I also appreciate you, I assume,

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,560
choosing MBMBAM as your favorite podcast on the website, and then tweeting about it and telling

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,840
all your friends that they should be ashamed of themselves for not doing the same. We just jumped

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,720
right into it. Look, the Max Fun Drive, if you are a new listener, this is our third go round

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:42,080
with the drive with the Pledger. It's a two week long event that our parent company sets up. It is

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
a fundraiser. You can help support us and other amazing shows on the Max Fun Network. We do extra

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,720
super length episodes. We have bonus content. We have pledge gifts. We're going to get to all that

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
and more, but it's a special time. It's a special time to be part of the Max Fun family.

29
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,560
That boy, Griffin, you said a mouthful, and this year is like none other. We've got a ton

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,640
of great pledge gifts to tell you about, but there's going to be time for all that.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,320
First, let's just get into the advice. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm your middlest brother, Travis McElroy.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,320
I'm your sweet baby, Griffin McElroy. This week's show, I'm going to say all the syllables wrong.

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:27,360
Let's get the first kuyuyo. I'm 26. I have a degree in animation, but I decided a year ago

35
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,600
that it just wasn't what I wanted to do. I've begun a track for computer science programming,

36
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:40,480
but thoughts of my ever nearing death have had me thinking of other ways to spend the remaining days

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,360
on this sweet earth. I've always wanted to be a pilot, specifically flying helicopters,

38
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,600
but training is expensive and the career path takes quite some time to move up.

39
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Should I go even further into that to chase my dream, or should I follow the money and

40
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,040
spend the rest of my days in a cubicle? That's from feeling shackled in Chicago.

41
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,040
I am in no way being flippant what jobs are there for a helicopter pilot.

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,240
Oh yeah, there's hospital guy. You could work for park rangers,

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,240
for when idiot Aaron Ralston's out there get pinned.

44
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,960
You could go with news chopper guy. News chopper guy is one.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,520
Another one is- Oh, army man. Army guy. Army man.

46
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,360
Army man. Tourist guy.

47
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh yeah, tourist guy like volcano guy. That would probably be the sweetest,

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:41,680
most lending itself to a USA action drama or action comedy drama in the vein of Psyker Burn Notice.

49
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,200
Kevin Costner, both of those by the way, just got picked up by the Esquire Network.

50
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,560
Pretty cool network you got going on there Esquire. What was that fucking movie with Ash

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,960
Ashcon, Ash Kutcher, sorry it was Ash Kutch and it had Kevin Costner and they were people

52
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,080
in helicopter and then people would be drowning in the ocean and they would get them.

53
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,680
It was Dive Buddies. Dive Buddies.

54
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,200
With Ash Ash and Kutcher. You could be one of him.

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,720
So yeah, it doesn't seem like there are a lot of career ops. It seems like a lot of people would

56
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
want to do that. It seems like one of those jobs that maybe you don't get paid basically anything

57
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,920
because everyone's like, yeah, you get to be in a helicopter all day.

58
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,240
That's life's greatest reward. Oh fucking, you can be-

59
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,520
Man, I bet you bachelor employs so many people.

60
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh my God. Yeah. What if you started your own like limousine style helicopter business?

61
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,640
That's probably not legal, is it? I will take you to prom, the helicopter business.

62
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
Does your high school have a landing pad? No? Fuck it. We'll improvise.

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,520
How are you? How are you at halos? How are you at high altitude landing operations?

64
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Have I got some high altitude opportunities for you?

65
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,600
If you don't capitalize on these opportunities, you are going to have unbroken legs.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,200
I think that you should, as far as your actual question, I can't, I mean-

67
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,920
We usually say like follow your bliss, but- It sounds like you're doing that too much.

68
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Maybe you need to pick something that's your bliss and just chase that.

69
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,360
This bliss sounds fucking dope though. Is it something you could do like pilot

70
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
lessons where you could like be an amateur helicopter pilot, but maybe that's not like

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
your career path, but like you have a license to do it. You could do it if you wanted to,

72
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,240
but it's not your day job. Is that crazy? Is that a thing you think?

73
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,760
You're talking about recreation. It's not like fucking like pottery.

74
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,560
It's not like you build an attachment in your garage.

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,920
You can do that as a pilot. You can go to like a small airport and like

76
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,600
get your pilot's license, even if you're not like a commercial airline pilot.

77
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,320
Hold on. Hold on. That's something you can do?

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah. Guys, I've had fun doing this podcast,

79
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,400
but I just got a new hobby. Peace.

80
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,240
I got a hobby in the fucking clouds now. So you're saying he should be a computer

81
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
scientist who, as a hobby, helicopters. Yeah.

82
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,520
I think that could eat up a lot of his- Oh, it's not cheap.

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,680
You gotta feed and house the helicopter, which is already expensive.

84
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,600
And you never own your own helicopter, right? No, you gotta lease it.

85
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,240
Yeah. If you don't take good care of your helicopter,

86
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
the helicopter social services will come by and be like,

87
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
oh, come here, little buddy. What did he do to you?

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,800
What have they been feeding you? I've seen Helicopter Cops Houston,

89
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
and it is some messed up shit down there. I was thinking of cattle.

90
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,000
I got helicopters confused with cattle again. It sounds like helicopter pilot sounds like fun,

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,640
but it doesn't really sound like a career that you want to do.

92
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,480
It sounds like you just want to kind of fly helicopters, which is also fine.

93
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,000
But I don't think that you should bail on the... You don't have to make it your career.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,200
You can just be a guy that also flies helicopters. I have an idea.

95
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,160
It seems like a safer plot. What if you were a dude

96
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
who did the computer science and programming for helicopters?

97
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,360
Okay. What if you worked for an aerospace company

98
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,680
that made helicopters? Holy shit.

99
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
You program the artificial intelligence of the airwolf helicopter.

100
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
Nightrider 2. Nightrider, Skyrider, Cloudrider.

101
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
Skyrider, Cloudrider. Oh, there it is.

102
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,600
It's my new show. It's called Airwolf 2 Nightrider colon Skyrider.

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,800
Comma Cloudrider. And it stars a guy who's a computer scientist

104
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,360
that programs an AI for a helicopter and also makes a cartoon

105
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,400
about the helicopter that he draws. And he's a billionaire.

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,760
He's a billionaire. And also he has sex with all kinds of people all the time.

107
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,200
So look out for... Like keep it locked to UPN.

108
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,080
Keep it on the Esquire channel. Can we put some tits on that helicopter?

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,840
Done. I got another question for you guys.

110
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,560
I'm taking talking... Fuck!

111
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm talking to my friend who is a lady and she came to me feeling bummed out.

112
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
I tried to cheer her up just by being positive and making her laugh.

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,360
And although she did laugh, she seemed slightly annoyed for a second.

114
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,840
Is there a certain chemistry between people who are feeling depressed

115
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,880
and those who are trying to cheer them up that creates bad tension?

116
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
Or could I be experiencing a taste of schadenfreude?

117
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,920
It's from Gmail. Schadenfreude.

118
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,400
Man, I long for a lifestyle where I can think this much about what other people feel.

119
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
This seems like you're a really considerate person and I wish I had that inclination.

120
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,040
You're saying you fucking witnessed a micro-expression on this person's face.

121
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
You need to get in the police interrogation biz.

122
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah, he smiled, but his eyes for a millisecond were so angry

123
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,160
and that's how I knew he was lying about the treasure.

124
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,320
Hey guys, side note, because it just occurred to me.

125
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,360
Do you think in countries like England where they say bum for butt,

126
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
the word bummed out means something completely different and really dirty?

127
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,720
It means you hump their butt so hard the inside of their butt comes to be the outside of their butt.

128
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,000
She was really bummed out, if you know what I mean.

129
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,080
She was bummed out so hard that she died.

130
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
Why do you make it tragic?

131
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,120
She died from bum loss. It was awful.

132
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,280
Listen guys, time loss is bum loss.

133
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:23,760
Exactly.

134
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
I think, here's one that I had to learn the hard way.

135
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Okay, sometimes when your friend or significant other comes to you

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,720
and is upset or depressed or angry, sometimes they don't want to be cheered up.

137
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,360
I know exactly what you're saying.

138
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,240
Sometimes they just want you to say that it is in fact shitty what is going on.

139
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
Sometimes they just want to vent.

140
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,800
Sometimes they just want to know that what they did was right,

141
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,720
because like when you're trying to cheer them up and be like,

142
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,000
hey man, it's going to be okay, they're like, yeah, I know it's going to fucking be okay.

143
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm an adult who knows the situation.

144
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,920
I'm just saying it sucked at this time.

145
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
The idea though for us, specifically for the three of us and our fam and growing up,

146
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,240
coming up McElroy, coming up McElroy, the new name of the podcast.

147
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,160
Coming to Esquire channel.

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
Coming up McElroy, three zany bros.

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,440
The idea of something being not a laughing matter was incomprehensible.

150
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,160
Obviously if somebody's like, yeah, basically my whole family just died.

151
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,520
I wouldn't be like, oh, well.

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,800
Time to Batman.

153
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
Sometimes that is actually a fear in my life that I'll make a joke like that

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,280
and just everyone in the room will slowly turn to me horrified and be like, why would you say that?

155
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Our podcast is just an hour of that.

156
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,800
I don't know.

157
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm really bad at that when somebody is really pissed off about something and I'd be like,

158
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,160
yeah, well at least here's a joke about Ryan Lochte and then they'll be like, this isn't

159
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,640
that that I wanted.

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,760
I wanted something different.

161
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,440
I find it best that when someone comes to me bummed out, just to listen and say like,

162
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
yeah, man, I know.

163
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,840
Rather than try to be like, grass is always greener.

164
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,040
Sun shines tomorrow.

165
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,960
There's always another day.

166
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,840
Silver lining.

167
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,600
Because that shit can get annoying unless you get the feeling that that's what they're looking for.

168
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
But don't just assume that.

169
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Does that make sense?

170
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,520
If that's your natural inclination, though.

171
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,040
Oh, if you're like, Mr. Sunshine?

172
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,920
No, that's my question.

173
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,520
It's like, it is my natural inclination to try to cheer somebody up if they're upset.

174
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,680
I mean, it is just my natural impulse.

175
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,480
Is it right that I should subvert that because it's what the other person wants?

176
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,240
It's case by case, isn't it?

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,280
It's case by case.

178
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,720
I don't think you can say it's standard or uniform.

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's role play.

180
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
Let's role play and you guys can come in a different way.

181
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,920
So I'll be somebody who's depressing.

182
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,800
You guys come at me and see just how you handle the situation.

183
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,600
All right, Travis.

184
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,320
You'll be the comforting empathizer.

185
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:56,800
Okay.

186
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,520
And I'll be like, chuckles.

187
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,020
Okay.

188
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,540
Man.

189
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,840
My man.

190
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,320
It's, you know, they just, Burn Notice got picked up by Esquire.

191
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,040
I'm worried that they're going to change the plot and just like, everything fucking sucks today.

192
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,080
Yeah, man.

193
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,920
I hear you who like that's it.

194
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,480
That's all you got.

195
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,960
That's the fucking way you want to be like.

196
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,520
Yeah, I know.

197
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,960
I hear they also picked up psych.

198
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,680
Am I right?

199
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,560
They're going to ruin it.

200
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,840
I hear they're getting rid of delay.

201
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,960
They wouldn't dare.

202
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,640
That would be the biggest mistake.

203
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,120
I know.

204
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,360
Right.

205
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,120
And now it's cheered up because we're talking about delay.

206
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,000
Everybody's happy.

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,960
God, you know the ways to happiness.

208
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
Cortex.

209
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,600
All right.

210
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,720
Now it's my turn.

211
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,220
Okay.

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,080
All right.

213
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,800
Go ahead, Griffin.

214
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,160
You want the setup again?

215
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,440
Please.

216
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,960
Do you want the same one or do you want me to talk about another problem in my life?

217
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,840
Because right now that's really the most pressing thing I have.

218
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,320
Same one.

219
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,640
Same one.

220
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:52,880
Okay.

221
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,120
Okay.

222
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah, I don't know.

223
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,000
I was just, you know, I used to just, I knew which channel Burn Notice was on.

224
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,280
It was on USA?

225
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,560
Yeah.

226
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,360
TNT?

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,680
I used to just turn it on channel 32, USA.

228
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
That's where USA lives on my TV.

229
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,120
I would turn it on and just let it fucking cruise because I knew where the plot was going,

230
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
knew where the characters were going.

231
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
Now who knows?

232
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,840
Boy, Griffin, whenever I feel the way you're feeling, you know who I turn to?

233
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,960
My puppet friend, Walter.

234
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,520
Hey, thanks for getting me out of the box.

235
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,120
Wait, you're just doing Jeff Dunham.

236
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
You're doing a Jeff Dunham thing.

237
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
You listen to me, whippersnapper?

238
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,600
I think he's actually doing The Beaver, the Mel Gibson movie, The Beaver,

239
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,280
which started a Beaver puppet named Walter.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,440
You're doing Jeff Beaver.

241
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,280
It's me, Jose Jalapeño on a stick.

242
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
No, it's definitely Dunham.

243
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,840
Hold on.

244
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Now, let there be no doubt about it.

245
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,520
He has gone full Dunham.

246
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.

247
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,200
Justin has gone full Dunham.

248
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
There is only one punishment for me.

249
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,920
You guys got me.

250
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,680
It's Ahmed the dead terrorist.

251
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,520
Silence, I kill you.

252
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,640
Flip the kill switch.

253
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,320
I kill you.

254
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
I kill your switch.

255
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,200
Protocol black.

256
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,440
Sexy Garfield is compromised.

257
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,360
Sexy Garfield is compromised.

258
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,840
Flood it.

259
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,640
Flood the station.

260
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,720
Guys, my office is filling with water.

261
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,200
Blow it.

262
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,240
Blow the diodes.

263
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,520
Release the biotoxin.

264
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,080
We're done.

265
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,760
My diodes just blew in my office.

266
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,560
What are you guys doing?

267
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,040
The only way to kill Justin is to poison him with the biotoxin while he's drowning and

268
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,240
being electrocuted.

269
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
Once he gets going on that Dunham terror, he becomes like the fucking juggernaut.

270
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
You know who's like the fucking juggernaut?

271
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,320
My friend Bubba J.

272
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
Oh, God.

273
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,920
Why do you know so many Jeff Dunham puppets?

274
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Because I'm on Wikipedia, you dumb fuck.

275
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,440
Who's the dumb fuck?

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
Who's the dumb fuck now?

277
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,600
Google knows what's up with you and your Jeff Dunham lust.

278
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
Have I talked about the...

279
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,080
As soon as I moved to Austin and I was like meeting people and I was meeting people who

280
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,400
knew like my friends and it's that weird time and you don't know like whether this person

281
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,720
is going to become a close friend of yours or just an acquaintance that you're going

282
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,800
to meet exactly once, how I was meeting those people and for some reason I started using

283
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,840
whether or not they like Jeff Dunham as a metric and there is a horrifying, horrifying

284
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,560
amount of people who fucking swear by that dude's brand of comedy and it's the people

285
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,280
you least expect because I'd be like hanging out with somebody like, you're really cool.

286
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,880
I think you're going to be one of my new friends in this hometown and then I would make a Jeff

287
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,760
Dunham joke and they'd be like, I don't understand why you're...

288
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,920
I don't understand why you're making fun of Jeff Dunham because like his shit's so on

289
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,480
point.

290
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,600
Travis, I'm sorry.

291
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,840
Are you a bigger Jeff Dunham fan than I knew or are you like completely ignorant about

292
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
the work of Jeff Dunham?

293
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:29,920
Huh?

294
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,080
Okay.

295
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,360
You know he was on Ellen.

296
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,240
He was also on 30 Rock, which makes me think that maybe this dude, maybe, maybe, maybe,

297
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,160
maybe he's one of those guys that has like worked up this whole persona, but in real

298
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,040
life is like, God, I know that this is like the stupidest shit, but for some reason they

299
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:47,600
love it.

300
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
Like Larry the Cable Guy, you mean?

301
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,200
Yeah.

302
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,560
Exactly like Larry the Cable Guy.

303
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:50,800
Yes.

304
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,360
When in behind the scenes, he's like, please call me Lawrence.

305
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,760
Please.

306
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,000
My name is Lawrence, Cable Doctor.

307
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,040
I went to Cable University for seven years to get my doctorate in cabling.

308
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
I can't believe I've sunk to such a level.

309
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,680
I got that program finished.

310
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,800
Like got her done is like his thing.

311
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,720
Sure.

312
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,480
I'll allow it.

313
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,640
I recently found out the men I work with make more money than I do.

314
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm a lady working as a carpenter.

315
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
Cabinet maker, really?

316
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,080
In a small old fashioned town with a chance getting hired anywhere else is not likely.

317
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm really mad, but I'm not sure what to do about it.

318
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,840
Can you help?

319
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,880
That's from Equality Challenge on the East Coast.

320
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,560
Well, you've come to the right place.

321
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,800
You've come to just the right place.

322
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
As white men, we...

323
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,080
God damn it.

324
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,640
Can you carve secret messages in the cabinets?

325
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Like what?

326
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,720
Like when people buy the cabinet inside, it says like, made by an underpaid woman.

327
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,520
Yeah.

328
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
Oh, that's way better than what I thought you were going with it.

329
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,480
I thought you meant like magic spells to make it like Indiana in the cupboard.

330
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,720
Oh my god.

331
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,160
Wait, holy shit.

332
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,960
Wait a minute.

333
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,560
Travis, are you saying that you think she should carve incantations into the cabinets?

334
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,640
Listen, all I'm saying is that the Indian in the cupboard,

335
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,320
cupboard had to come from somewhere, right?

336
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,280
Okay, so it's like appear magically in the little boy's bedroom.

337
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:13,760
This is great.

338
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,880
You put Monopoly money in there, close it, and then all of a sudden you've...

339
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,280
That's like you create a toy version of the Lilly Ledbetter Act and you put it in there

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,760
and then it's been ratified into law.

341
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,040
Have you thought about asking for more money?

342
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,840
But that's horseshit.

343
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,040
She shouldn't have to.

344
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,600
Why don't you put your fucking boss in the cupboard, turn him into a toy?

345
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,120
It's probably a small cupboard, though.

346
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
You probably have to fucking kill him.

347
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,400
You know, I'm so embarrassed now, you guys,

348
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,360
because I just remembered that in India in the cupboard, it's not the cupboard at all.

349
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,320
It's the key, because at one point he uses it on a chest

350
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,960
and that's how he goes to visit a little bear.

351
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,240
I'm so embarrassed, you guys.

352
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,200
Yeah, this is humiliating.

353
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,200
We'll probably have to delete this question from the show

354
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,920
because people are listening like, it's the key, you dumb fucks.

355
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,600
All the people on my Indian in the Cupboard forums are just like,

356
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,320
oh my God, I can't believe Keymaster73 just said that.

357
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,200
I can't believe it.

358
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,480
He's got key in his username.

359
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,600
His avatar is a key.

360
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
I think talking to your boss is probably a good first option,

361
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,920
at least opening that discussion thread.

362
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,280
So may I suggest something much more passive aggressive?

363
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
Of course.

364
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,040
Thank you.

365
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,160
So say you're getting paid 77 cents on the dollar, right?

366
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
You should start doing 77% of the normal work of everyone else.

367
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,520
Or make all your cabinet parts 77% smaller than spec,

368
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,560
than spec requires, than the blueprint has demanded.

369
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,960
And then the boss comes to you and he's like,

370
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,680
hey, what the hell?

371
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,920
You're like, oh, this is all I'm getting paid for.

372
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:45,440
Oh, sorry, you only paid me to put saloon doors on this cabinet.

373
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:45,940
Sorry.

374
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, I know it's supposed to be for private unmentionables,

375
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
but now people are going to be able to see the tops and the bottoms.

376
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
I know that this was your unmentionables cabinet.

377
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,040
I'm a carpenter who works at an independent unmentionables cabinet agency.

378
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,680
We build cabinets to spec.

379
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,200
It's a small town with small unmentionables ideals.

380
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,080
And now my doors are going to be even smaller.

381
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,440
Because fuck these pigs.

382
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Why don't you carve that in your fucking cap?

383
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,120
Fuck these pigs.

384
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,240
I hope you enjoy your cabinet.

385
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,400
It was made by hate pigs.

386
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Are you all, are you maybe the youngest?

387
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,680
Are you the most, not even like physically the youngest,

388
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,080
but the most junior member of the staff?

389
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,120
Is that possible?

390
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,800
Or is that just me like wishing the glass ceiling wasn't there?

391
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,040
I actually know from other details from a longer email that she sent that she is not.

392
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,280
That there have been men that have been hired since her.

393
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,640
Well, that's dog shit.

394
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Well, that's dog shit.

395
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,440
Tell us who they are and we'll tell everybody not to buy their fucking misogynist cabinets.

396
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,440
Or start carving like a, you need to come up with some branding and carve that into the cabinet.

397
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
And then we say only buy cabinets that have,

398
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,920
that have equality challenge on the East Coast brand on it.

399
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,720
Or start your own cabinet company with us.

400
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,200
Fabbinets.

401
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,560
Fabbinets?

402
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:02,960
Yes.

403
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,000
Equal, equalblinets.

404
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,920
Equalblinets.

405
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,960
Equalblinets.

406
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,560
Equalblinets.

407
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,440
Equalblinets.

408
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,160
Hurniture.

409
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh my God.

410
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,240
That's pretty good, right?

411
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,040
Yeah.

412
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,800
So we'll start that company and fuck those guys.

414
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
Hurniture Fabbinets.

415
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,960
If you don't buy a Hurniture Fabbinet, you're putting your clothes in the garbage.

416
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
The good news is I watched Shark Tank.

417
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,680
Like one person can start a revolution.

418
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,520
You've got to go and tell this story to all the sharks and they'll be like,

419
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,560
I'm going to gobble this up.

420
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,840
You hooked me.

421
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
Can I say something though?

422
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,560
Please.

423
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
I do not think they'd bite.

424
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
I do not think they'd bite for Hurniture Fabbinets.

425
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,440
Why?

426
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,360
It just doesn't seem particularly lucrative.

427
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,440
You're charging a premium for an ideal.

428
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,160
And I'm just saying Mark Cuban is not going to fucking, not going to bite that bait.

429
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
Well, if you get his kids involved.

430
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,400
Mark Cuban will always invest if you, if the product involves his kids.

431
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,200
I saw him give a woman, an 18 year old girl, an 18 year old girl, five,

432
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,920
well I guess 18 year old woman, technically adult woman,

433
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,560
$500,000 for her eczema skin product line because his kids have eczema.

434
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,360
That's it.

435
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,760
That's it.

436
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
You make Hurniture Toy Fabbinets.

437
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,840
What do you, what do your kids got?

438
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,800
They, where are your kids going to put their fucking eczema medicine, Mark?

439
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,120
They're going to put them in a Hurniture Fabbinet.

440
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,480
It's got a little picture of eczema on it.

441
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,600
So the kids know what is stored in this particular unit.

442
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
And they got fun characters like Lawrence the Cable Gentleman.

443
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,600
Lawrence the Scaly Cable Gentleman.

444
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
He applies, he's in this caricature, he's applying a salve.

445
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,640
He's applying a salve to his rotten, rotten flesh.

446
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,960
Speaking of balms and salves necessary to keep your, keep your ship right.

447
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,560
It's Max Fun Drive time.

448
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,400
And we couldn't be more excited to, to present, I guess, this, this, this,

449
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,520
the donation rewards this year because they are fantastic.

450
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
Well, let's talk though first about where your money is actually going, Nitto.

451
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:26,320
It's going to, it's going to the Max Fun Fun Network to expand the network and bring on new

452
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
shows, which I don't know if you've been paying attention.

453
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,360
You really didn't have to be this year

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,040
to notice all the fucking shows that have been added to the Max Fun Network.

455
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,080
It's been like out of control rapid expansion.

456
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,680
We got One Bad Mother.

457
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,520
We got Risk was this year, I think.

458
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,680
Yeah, Memory Palace was this year.

459
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,800
Memory Palace was this year.

460
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,280
Throwing Shade wasn't this year, was it?

461
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,080
I don't think so.

462
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,600
I feel like it's been more than a year.

463
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,120
With Dave Hill.

464
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,480
Dave Hill's podcasting incident is this year.

465
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,480
Wham Bam Pow, our new podcast that I don't even think we've talked about with our good

466
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,200
friends Cameron Esposito and Rhea Butcher and Ricky Carmona.

467
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,920
I don't know if you guys listen to other shows other than ours.

468
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,640
It may be presumptive to even suggest that you don't, but like, seriously, it's an amazing

469
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,160
network of comedy that really is not reproduced anywhere else.

470
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,360
And it's not just us, it's you guys too, like the Max Fun Fun community.

471
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,600
I feel like I've been stressing this a lot lately, but it's, it's this unique, perfect

472
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,120
community of like no dicks.

473
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,120
So like that, I think is special and that is worth supporting.

474
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,840
So whenever you donate, it helps us make more money from doing the show and spend more time

475
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,400
on the podcast and do more stuff.

476
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,600
We bought new mics.

477
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,800
I think you'll notice after we joined, the quality of our podcast got much, much better.

478
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,720
And not only that, like if you're looking to donate, there are so many different levels

479
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,840
and you'll find one that fits your budget, something you can handle for the year.

480
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,240
It's, you know, it's separated donation by month.

481
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,520
It starts from five dollars a month all the way up to two hundred dollars a month.

482
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,040
There's going to be a level that works for you.

483
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,600
And all of those levels contain gifts.

484
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,880
Thank you for for helping out with the network.

485
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,720
You want to give ten dollars?

486
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
You're going to be a friend of the family.

487
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,760
That means you're going to get some awesome Max Fun earbuds or earbuds with the distinctive

488
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
Max Fun logo on the the ear part that goes into your ear.

489
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,640
And you're also now which part is because sometimes I plug like the audio jack in there.

490
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,280
That's where the sound hole goes, like the holes in your face where sound goes into.

491
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,120
Oh, yeah.

492
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,040
So that's that's the ten dollar a month level.

493
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,760
And you're also going to get at any donation level, you're going to get some really cool

494
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,680
exclusive bonus material.

495
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,960
We record a special episode of of of our program and there's a whole wealth of

496
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:00,480
prior year bonus material in there that you can get in and and including an episode we

497
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,960
recorded with our daddy and including some video of one of our live shows.

498
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
So that's right.

499
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,720
Yeah, there's a lot of a lot of digi content, not just for us, but for all of the all the

500
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Max Fun shows.

501
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,920
If you are feeling a little bit more supportive,

502
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:21,280
more supportive and Randy and Randy, there's a twenty dollar month

503
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,080
group you can go with the Diamond Friendship Circle.

504
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
You get the bonus episode, you get the earbuds.

505
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:35,600
You also get this is the fucking dopest, the intimate sensations pack, an erotic fucking

506
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,160
survival kit, fucking survival kit from Extreme from Extreme Restraints, which includes a

507
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,320
pocket sized velvafield turbo massager.

508
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,440
It massages it, whatever you want it to massage.

509
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,800
Maybe you've got a sore back.

510
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,200
Maybe you've got a hard balls.

511
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,000
You got the hardest balls.

512
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,040
It's got attachments.

513
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,920
So like I don't even know what the attachments are, but I'm sure there's one for your back

514
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,800
and one for your balls.

515
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,560
There is also and this is the best rocket lube, which is a high quality water based

516
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,120
maximum fun branded lubricant for your parts for your down there.

517
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,600
Down there for your parts or for other parts for other people's parts.

518
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Have you ever shoved it in and you used a lube that was average fun?

519
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,680
That's it's not.

520
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,040
It's just not cutting it.

521
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
Doesn't cut the mustard.

522
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,280
Have you ever used mustard?

523
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,800
That's that's absolutely ineffective.

524
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,920
That is not even an option.

525
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,760
That is negative fun lube.

526
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
We're talking about maximum fun lube.

527
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,440
There's also a black satin mask in case you don't want to see somebody putting mustard

528
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
on your on your balls and hitting you with a massager.

529
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,240
Thank you to our friends at extremetrains.com for that.

530
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,520
You also get a max fun rocket tee if you want to let people know what kind of lube you use.

531
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,360
Sure, absolutely.

532
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,400
And and for 35 bucks, you're going to be in Judge John Hodgman's Justice Squad, which

533
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:05,040
is going to net you two really sharp looking maximum fun shot glasses.

534
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,440
They're actually they're rocks glasses.

535
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,720
They're like the rocks glasses.

536
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,120
I'm sorry.

537
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,440
I didn't tell them from the from the scale.

538
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,600
What's their engraved with the max fun rocket?

539
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,360
They're beautiful.

540
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,240
They're fucking classy.

541
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm trying to think of what the it's not a highball glass.

542
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,280
What is it?

543
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,640
Tumbler glass, isn't it?

544
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
Yeah, it's thick.

545
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,200
It's got a thick bottom on it.

546
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,520
This is a this is a glass that you put ice in and you put a brown liquor on top of that ice.

547
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,000
Now, here's the thing.

548
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,680
Maybe you're like me and you're sitting there going, yeah, but I I joined last year.

549
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,280
I became a donor last year.

550
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,040
Well, thank you so much for all your support for continuing to support us throughout

551
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,360
the past year and the coming year.

552
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,160
And you think, but all these gifts, they sound great.

553
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
How do I get on board with this?

554
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,720
And it's easy.

555
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,680
All you have to do is upgrade to a higher level.

556
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,480
So I went and I decided to become a Justice Squad member this year so that I could cash

557
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,160
in on all of these sweet presents.

558
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,800
Yeah, we're not just we're not just podcasters.

559
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,720
We're we're donors, too.

560
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,600
That's donors.

561
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,760
That's how we that's how, you know, it's legit.

562
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,560
We would never I would never want to belong to a club that I'm not a member of as Woody

563
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,440
Allen once said in his hit film Members Only.

564
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,360
You will, however, even if you don't upgrade, you still have access to all that exclusive

565
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,440
donor content.

566
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,560
But you can't shove that donor content in your pussy and butt.

567
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:23,760
Yeah.

568
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:24,880
You know what I mean?

569
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
And if you try, it's going to be super dry because you're using a dry jump drive.

570
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
You need Max Fun Lube.

571
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,280
Maximumfun.org forward slash donate.

572
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,880
Make sure to tell them NBNBAM sent you.

573
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
They are your favorites.

574
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,440
Griffin, how about you get a Yahoo for us?

575
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,320
I have a treasure.

576
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,280
I have a treasure trove of Yahoo answers.

577
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,040
These are some particularly heady nugs, as it were.

578
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,480
Heady choice nugs.

579
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,560
I've stumbled onto the forbidden Yahoo's.

580
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,840
What do you got?

581
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:02,800
I'm afraid that these Yahoo's may be above our adversarial advice ability pay grade.

582
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:10,480
Uh-oh, that sounds like, we've never had, well, okay, more accurately, we've had many

583
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,880
questions that we don't know how to answer, but that's never stopped us before.

584
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
Right, but it's a new year in April.

585
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,600
Twenty dirt.

586
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,960
It's a new us.

587
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,320
I think we need to realize our deficiencies, and I think we need to reach upwards for a

588
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,480
hand that we can grab that can pull us up.

589
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
Do you know what I mean?

590
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,840
I have someone on my speed dial that I turn to, and maybe I can get him on the phone.

591
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,960
Hold on one second.

592
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,920
Let me try to call him on the phone.

593
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,480
This is fun.

594
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
That's not the standard Skype noise.

595
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,760
And you only dialed six numbers.

596
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,720
That's seven, okay.

597
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,760
So is he local?

598
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:59,200
Shut up, shut up, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.

599
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,000
Shit, he didn't answer.

600
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
Hello, hello, excuse me, hello.

601
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,600
Hello, hi, who's this?

602
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,560
This is Dan Savage.

603
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,200
Oh my God, Dan Savage.

604
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
How did you have Dan Savage's number?

605
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,520
I've got a question, why didn't you know it would be Dan Savage when you called him?

606
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,800
Why are you surprised by it?

607
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
Did you mean to call Fred Savage?

608
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,320
He's right next, I have all the savages in my book together.

609
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,040
Fred Savage is who I call when I need sex advice.

610
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,560
That was my big question, is who watches the Watchmen,

611
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,200
who gives the sex advice to the sex advisor?

612
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,000
Fred Savage.

613
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,560
Question answered.

614
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,440
And when Fred and I are stumped, we go to Chris Savage of Mythbusters for an answer.

615
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
That man has never had a sex.

616
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,040
Griffin, what's the, thank you, first off, so much for joining us, Dan.

617
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,960
Griffin has some, as he says, choice, choice, sorry, Griffin, choice nugs.

618
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,400
Choice, Hetty, the dankest herb that Yahoo has to offer.

619
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,560
Do we need, do we need to introduce Dan, or is he a man that requires no introduction?

620
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,840
Hopefully, if you're listening to our dumb show, you know that Dan Savage

621
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,360
began the Inconspirator project with his husband, Terry.

622
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,480
He has the sex advice column, Savage Love,

623
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,200
also the Sex Advice Podcast, and Rival Sex Advice Podcast.

624
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,720
Rival Sex Advice Podcast.

625
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
Not rivals, we share the podcast network together.

626
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,240
There's room enough in this world for all four of us,

627
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
so long as you three stay in one podcast.

628
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,640
If you branch out into three podcasts, there's no room anymore for us, and we will go to war.

629
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,280
Oh, those would be some lonely, lonely podcasts.

630
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,880
You're gonna stay in your straight podcast ghetto, all three of you together.

631
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,480
We, and only one of us knows, actually knows what we're talking about, so that's.

632
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,520
Yeah, that's one more than knows what they're talking about on my podcast,

633
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,440
so you've got that on me.

634
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,920
Griffin, I'm ready. Hit me with this first question.

635
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,560
Yeah, let's, let's get into it. How about this one?

636
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,360
It was sent in by Catherine Hoffman. Thank you, Catherine.

637
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tony, who asks,

638
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,640
how long can you wear edible underwear?

639
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,200
Plan to surprise the lady for Valentine's Day. Problem is, I need to work that day,

640
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,640
and I will not have time to change before I see her.

641
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,680
Is it okay to wear it for long periods of time? I work in construction.

642
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,320
Oh, no. That's the worst thing you could have said at the end.

643
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,040
That is not a real question. That's not a real question, you guys.

644
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,400
You're getting faked out. No one has ever, in the whole history of edible underwear,

645
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,560
ever worn edible underwear, which are fruit roll-ups in the shape of pantyhose.

646
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,640
Sure. Next, pass, pass. No, it didn't happen.

647
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
No. What happens to all the edible underwear, then?

648
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,440
Do you just get desperate, realize you have no fruit roll-ups in the house, and just go for it?

649
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,280
Yeah, and you pack them into your kid's lunch. Send them off to school.

650
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
You can impress his friends.

651
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:53,280
Do you at least cut them into fun shapes, or do you just, like...

652
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,960
Yeah, only if you're a helicopter parent, would you bother with that.

653
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,960
If your kid can't tear it apart with his teeth, like everybody else with fruit roll-up under panties.

654
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,480
These are some tough panties.

655
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,360
You're tearing all the kid's creativity away, too.

656
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,920
Let the kid tear the panties into whatever shapes he wants to.

657
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,720
Exactly.

658
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:15,680
Also, as somebody who has dived so deep into Yahoo Answers, who is...

659
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,720
I'm perpetually stuck in Yahoo Answers limbo. I am not convinced that there isn't somebody out there

660
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:26,640
who wears edible underwear for their comfort, for their... just for relaxation.

661
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,520
The thing is, the missing part there, though, the leap you haven't made is,

662
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,920
there might be somebody out there wearing edible underwear,

663
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,520
but no one in the whole history of edible underwear has ever slept with that person,

664
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,360
or any other person who wears edible underwear.

665
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,400
Oh, I see what you're saying.

666
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,400
That person wears edible underwear in theory that they might one day in practice have sex with somebody,

667
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,920
but it's never actually happened.

668
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:53,120
Sure. But if there were such a fucking psychopath on there, they would be an active user in the Yahoo Answers service.

669
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,720
That is 100% true.

670
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,520
Griffin, how about another question? I want to help someone today. This is our chance.

671
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,040
How about this? It was sent in by Emily Wall. Thank you, Emily.

672
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,920
It's by Yahoo Answers user dropdeadgorgeous, who asks,

673
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:16,240
Well, IDK how, I would ask this, but, um, how do you touch a girl's boobs?

674
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,720
You see, I've touched her boobs before, but IDK if I did it right, and I got real nervous.

675
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,200
Also, how do you do it while her shirt is still on?

676
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,920
Dan, I should have warned you before we started. Sometimes our show can get a little blue.

677
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
So, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Thank you, Dan.

678
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,920
Our show can get a little blue. So, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Things do get a tad racy.

679
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,880
We talk about things that could be observed as being sin in the eyes of the Lord.

680
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,720
Yeah. So, just a heads up.

681
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,360
Just a heads up.

682
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,080
How do you touch? If you know about this, I would love to hear it. How do you touch a girl's boobs?

683
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,440
With permission.

684
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,800
That's obviously number one key thing.

685
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
I would start with consent.

686
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,760
Absolutely.

687
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,400
Have you tried being super attractive and charming and, like, saying dope shit to women?

688
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,720
That does seem like people who are on all sides of the court, people who are very attractive

689
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,360
and say the right things all the time, they seem to touch the most privates.

690
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,440
I've also found that women really like it when you pretend to be a DJ on their boobs.

691
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,480
No, I don't think that's actually attractive.

692
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,960
100% of the time. Every time.

693
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,840
I'm going to have to defer to you guys on this. You're three straight guys, right?

694
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,080
I've only ever touched a girl's boobs under duress in my teen years when I was trying to

695
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,640
prove I was straight, and I'm sure I was bad at it.

696
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,600
A crowded subway car, perhaps?

697
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,680
No, a girlfriend. I had girlfriends. I said dope shit, and I got a girlfriend.

698
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,440
Then I had to do dick shit that I didn't want to do with her, and it was a disaster.

699
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,320
Apparently, pretending your girlfriend is Andy Gibbs is not a form of birth control.

700
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,880
I mean, there's a lot of methods you can...

701
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,880
I'll tell you this. Don't go to Yahoo Answers to ask this,

702
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,280
because one of the top answers is, who cares? Just grab it. That's not it.

703
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,440
That's 100% the wrong one.

704
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,280
Oh, no. That's not right.

705
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,960
Even with consent, just, like, blindly just, like...

706
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,440
Just latching on like an alien baby to...

707
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,720
Going with the double crab claw is a fucking...

708
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
Like a drunk guy looking for the light switch.

709
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,640
Have you guys all had sex with more than one woman each?

710
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,120
At the same time?

711
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,680
Simultaneously or...

712
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,040
No, not simultaneously, like, in sequence. I would assume that women, different women,

713
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,360
enjoy having their boobs touched differently. You know, some guys like to have their balls slapped,

714
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,640
and some guys just like to have them cupped. Is it not the same?

715
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,000
Ah. I like having one ball slapped and the other one cupped at the same time.

716
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,240
That's a big trick. That's a good trick that you can do.

717
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,360
I like it to be like that desktop thing where you swing one,

718
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,680
and then they kind of clack against each other and swing back and forth.

719
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
Yeah, sure. Oh, I forgot to mention, this is...

720
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,680
I mean, obviously Justin and Travis know this because they're my brothers,

721
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,040
but Dan, I have super loose balls.

722
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,040
They are crazy, crazy, crazy loose. It's...

723
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,360
Well, you should do your kegels. And you can actually get...

724
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,360
There's a surgery where they take in your scrotum.

725
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,200
They've done a lot of nerve endings in the scrotum, so you can safely have that adjusted.

726
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Just tuck it. Yeah. Well, I'll see about that.

727
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,360
See, you are... God damn, you're good at this.

728
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,520
Yeah, you know things. We should learn some things.

729
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,120
Yeah, I know things inside and out.

730
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,560
We should learn at least a few things before we start doing this again, guys,

731
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,920
because we really don't know any... know anything.

732
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,280
I think you got to start Tinder, and then you can ramp up from there if need be.

733
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,880
If the feedback... It's all about active feedback, isn't it?

734
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,560
It's all about doing some shit. Start with the most harmless shit you can,

735
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
and then just ramp it up.

736
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
Hey, can I tell you a funny story about my uncle,

737
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,080
another one of those straight guys in the world like you three?

738
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,440
Sure.

739
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,280
It's about balls, so it's kind of relevant.

740
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,640
He was a rock star in California in the 70s of this big regional band,

741
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,480
and he used to get a lot of blow jobs from... What are those things called? Groupies?

742
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,720
And because it was the 70s, he slept with a lot of virgin groupies,

743
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,960
and that was fine with him. And he likes a lot of pain during a blow job.

744
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,920
He likes to have his balls punched and slapped and his dick bitten.

745
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,880
Hey, Uncle Jimmy, if you're listening, how you doing?

746
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,400
Welcome to the show, Uncle Jimmy.

747
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,400
And so what he would always say to these girls when he would instruct them

748
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,560
on how exactly he liked his junk just mauled,

749
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,760
is he would pat them on the head and say, this is how all guys like it.

750
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Oh, no! Uncle Jimmy!

751
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,280
So that when they then slept with the next rock star...

752
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,320
That's the...

753
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,480
That poor guy got his junk just fucking beat down.

754
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
And that would make Uncle Jimmy, late at night, he'd just think,

755
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,360
oh, that girl I slept with last month is now sucking Mick Jagger off.

756
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,320
Wonder how that's going.

757
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,560
Not good!

758
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,280
You're creating psychological time bombs inside of these women's sex track.

759
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,360
That's actually what Paint It Black was written about.

760
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:08,800
Man, can you imagine thinking like, oh, you must be one of Jimmy's girls.

761
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,320
I can't believe you've been poisoning the well for everybody.

762
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,040
You carry his brand of ball trauma.

763
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,480
That might have taken care of your loose balls.

764
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,240
She could have taken a chunk out of them and you could have stitched it right up.

765
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,360
Right. Yeah, there you go.

766
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,860
Sure.

767
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
Surgeons, you can keep a secret.

768
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Griffin, I needed one more question.

769
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,520
I know you have one more.

770
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,680
I have a few.

771
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,400
Uh-oh.

772
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,040
This one, okay, this one was sent in by Valerie Rogers.

773
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,600
Thanks, Valerie.

774
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:44,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user D341255, which I imagine it's not their Christian name,

775
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,040
who asks, should mixed gender swim classes be allowed?

776
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,600
At my daughter's schools from sixth to tenth grade in PE,

777
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,320
she attends the swim unit and boys and girls have it together?

778
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,520
Why is this allowed?

779
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,240
Shouldn't this make the girls feel uncomfortable and give boys an opportunity to harass and

780
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,760
humiliate girls and cause distractions and goofing off among everybody?

781
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,680
Not to mention, young boys will be around with no shirt,

782
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,880
which I think is inappropriate for girls to be around of.

783
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,520
Woof.

784
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,160
Wow.

785
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,680
As do I, sort of.

786
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,720
I don't think there should be mixed gender relationships at all,

787
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,440
in pools and swimming suites at all.

788
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,560
In no situation.

789
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,960
Those mixed gender relationships, they never work out.

790
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:26,000
Right. I mean, I guess in defense of whatever principal or gym teacher has put together this

791
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,880
particular program, sixth to tenth grade is like, there's a bubble there in a young man's life

792
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,720
where he is incredibly sexually mature and he knows how to really handle himself around,

793
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,120
you know, temptation and his female peers.

794
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,600
And that bubble lasts from ages, you know, 10 to 15.

795
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,080
So this, I mean, I don't see any problem with it.

796
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:55,920
I would also say that the young men do not need any extra help to sexualize women at that point.

797
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,320
So I think whether they're in, you know, bathing suits or like full on parkas.

798
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,000
Or encased in iron maidens, it doesn't matter.

799
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,120
And if the water in the pool is growing increasingly opaque over

800
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,960
the course of the swim class, you have a problem.

801
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,960
If there's a half inch of spume on top of this, of foamy spume, there's an issue.

802
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,600
We brought out a UV light and the place burned down.

803
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:24,560
So it was a pretty, it was a bad scene.

804
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,480
I am stealing that.

805
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,280
That fucking graduating class is not going to be able to look at each other on the,

806
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,680
on the fucking podium and getting their diplomas.

807
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,080
You know, not that there isn't sexual tension, I must say in a single gender swim class that

808
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,200
I had to do in freshman year at Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, a high school,

809
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Catholic school for boys thinking about becoming priests where I shit you not.

810
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
Is that the whole title of the school?

811
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,160
Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, where I shit you not, swim class was in the nude.

812
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,960
We wonder where these problems in the Catholic church came from.

813
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,280
What?

814
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,200
Did this swim class happen next to the vomitorium because it took place in ancient Rome?

815
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,800
Basically.

816
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,640
And there were two priests on staff full time.

817
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,840
They were called disciplinarians.

818
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,120
They sat in an office all day having teenage boys sent to them to get spanked.

819
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,880
I was going to be a priest until they eliminated those positions.

820
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,760
And then I thought, you know what, I can wear dresses and live in a big house and

821
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,000
fuck boys without the whole ordination business.

822
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,640
Waiting lists a mile long.

823
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,520
Oh my God.

824
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:27,840
Yeah.

825
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,280
That position is like right below the Pope in terms of desirability.

826
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:31,920
I mean, I'd love to.

827
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,280
I don't have the grades.

828
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,240
I just, I don't have the grades and on the community service, I'll never get the job.

829
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,600
There's a whole line of dudes waiting to get that gig.

830
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:40,880
Although, you know, I think about it.

831
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:49,120
If your entire high school class had all been through this fucking obstacle course of sexuality,

832
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,040
maybe it would like get a bunch of shit out of the way and then you could focus on school and stuff.

833
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,440
Maybe this would be like the most enlightened high school class ever because they don't have to think about those things.

834
00:43:59,440 --> 00:43:59,920
Right.

835
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,520
Let me check my schedule real quick.

836
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,920
I got math first period and then I got English and then I got boners.

837
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,600
I had boners all day, every day for an entire semester.

838
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,520
So like I don't, I can't get boners anymore.

839
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm a high school student.

840
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,760
I'm just sensitized to boners forever.

841
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,400
Right.

842
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,000
Sixth grade though, like girls are, you know, more developed than boys.

843
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,280
They develop faster than boys.

844
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,560
Wouldn't that be, you know, people worry about the girls being harassed or slut shamed or made to feel uncomfortable.

845
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,120
Wouldn't the boys be the ones who feel uncomfortable in sixth grade?

846
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,680
Because the girls are a foot taller than they are and dating guys in college.

847
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,080
And there they are like still like hairless little monkeys with no hair on their nuts.

848
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,160
Wouldn't it be mortifying for the boys?

849
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:48,640
Listen, Dan, if I put off interacting with the girls until I'm sexually developed, I don't think I would have had, I wouldn't have met a woman until my late 20s.

850
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,640
So yeah, you wouldn't be married right now.

851
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,840
I wouldn't be married right now.

852
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,720
Yeah.

853
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:01,200
I don't think there's any age at which, I wore, I wore sweatpants all through my freshman year of high school because I didn't want to change for gym.

854
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,160
Like, and that was, I was 14 or 15 at that point.

855
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,360
Like, nah.

856
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:14,640
Not because I was afraid of changing for gym, but I did at one point have to have someone had to sit me down and talk to me about wearing dress shirts and tear away pants as a look.

857
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,200
So I don't think there was ever a worry about me interacting with the girl.

858
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,880
Can I tell you something that will make you want to get in a time machine and go blow your brains out when you're 15?

859
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,920
When I was 15, I had a girlfriend who was my older brother's ex-girlfriend and I lost my virginity in a three way.

860
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,200
Damn.

861
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,880
So I was doing well with the ladies at 15 because I didn't give a shit.

862
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,040
I was like, oh, all right, I guess.

863
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,480
Just think about how many more three ways you could have been in though if you were in tear away pants.

864
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,240
Because then there's no, you don't have to face no-

865
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,600
At any opportunity.

866
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,000
What are we?

867
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,200
There's no fumbling.

868
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,400
Yeah.

869
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,880
That fucking pool Travis would have evacuated.

870
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,880
At 15 I'd also mastered button and zipper technology and I could actually get my pants off when that, when the moment-

871
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,600
Well, some of us are not all that advanced, Dan.

872
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,080
Yeah.

873
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,200
Travis doesn't have prehensile.

874
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,040
Whoa, Mr. Braggy McGee coming over from his podcast and putting on zippers.

875
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,120
Dan's so great at taking his pants off.

876
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,160
Off and on, off and on.

877
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,200
Just saying, you would have gotten more pussy when you were 15 if you were gay.

878
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,000
That's all I'm saying.

879
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,520
Advice for everyone.

880
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
Dan, before we let you go, is there anything we can help you with?

881
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,360
I have to find that unfathomable, but okay.

882
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,560
I had girlfriends when I was 15.

883
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,360
I had sex with girls.

884
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
I never performed cunnilingus.

885
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,160
And if there's, you know, say I get arrested, I get thrown in prison and the men's prisons

886
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,400
are full and I'm sent to a women's prison and there's some like bizarre set of circumstances

887
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,640
under which I am required to perform cunnilingus.

888
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,760
How do you do that?

889
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:40,880
Yeah.

890
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,380
Okay.

891
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,440
I like to play like I'm a DJ.

892
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,200
The DJ is not, we're not doing that again.

893
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,640
We're not going to the DJ.

894
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,280
Let me ask you something.

895
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,840
Did you, Dan, did you listen to, did you listen to the radio at all in the 90s?

896
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:54,720
I did.

897
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,400
There was a man named, there was a, I asked because there was a man named John Popper

898
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,680
who was the front man for a band called Blues Traveler.

899
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,600
And the way that he does his thing on a harmonica is basically like that, except it's like sideways.

900
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,840
So are you telling me, are you, are you advising our friend Dan that should he be

901
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,000
in this alternate universe?

902
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,400
Which frankly sounds a lot like a lot of the slash fiction I've read over the years.

903
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,480
The women, the men's prison was all full.

904
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,600
I was the only dude and you're saying he should blow into the vagina like John Popper.

905
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,800
Close your eyes.

906
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,200
Close your eyes and imagine the bridge from Hook, the Blues Traveler song Hook.

907
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,920
I will try, I will try my best.

908
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,520
You could also close your eyes and imagine the final battle from the movie Hook

909
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,960
and just do that as well.

910
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,760
Peter Pan versus Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook.

911
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,280
Now let me tell you this, women hate it when you shout bangarang into their vaginas.

912
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,200
That is, that is, as long as you don't do that really, you should be fine.

913
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:57,840
You should be fine.

914
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,600
Anything else goes.

915
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,840
I will do what I can.

916
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,000
Also start gentle ramp up.

917
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,920
Maybe they do when you shout bangarang.

918
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,640
This is better advice than a bisexual friend of mine gave who said,

919
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,200
just pretend you're trying to extract a bullet from a wound.

920
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,720
Oh my God.

921
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,720
Pretend that your lady's vagina has just been bitten by a cobra.

922
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:20,320
Suck that venom out.

923
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,760
Get that venom out.

924
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,440
She's got to live, damn it.

925
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,080
Pretend the clit is a bullet and you are, without using your teeth,

926
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,600
trying to remove it from this gunshot wound that is her business.

927
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,880
That parenthetical in there is so vital.

928
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,840
It's so important.

929
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,000
Do not actually try to remove it.

930
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,080
It's in there for a reason.

931
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,560
Unless.

932
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:39,760
Unless.

933
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,320
Unless.

934
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,600
Unless, you know, everybody likes something different.

935
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,320
That's true.

936
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,160
You just got to ask her, your friend of Jimmy's.

937
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,880
Yeah, I was going to say she could be my Aunt Jimmy.

938
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,080
I mean, when we have the opportunity, do we have any advice?

939
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,600
Dan, I have a question for you.

940
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,280
The three of us were raised Southern Baptist.

941
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:03,680
I know.

942
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:08,160
Our parents are wonderful people and they taught us a lot of good stuff.

943
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,080
But in terms of becoming, I guess, what's the what's the word I'm looking for?

944
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,760
Modern in our approach to sexuality, we kind of all had to learn the hard way

945
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,280
in getting rid of a lot of the teachings, lessons that we learn,

946
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,600
like from especially from that religious background.

947
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,480
The Beatitudes.

948
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,560
The Beatitudes, for example.

949
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,080
Like, is there a better path to getting out, like to unlearning those lessons

950
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,360
rather than just looking like a dumb ass enough until it gets through?

951
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,320
Well, I think when it comes to men raised in the Southern Baptist tradition,

952
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:46,480
the quickest way to help them unlearn a lot of the sex phobia and hangups

953
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,840
and slut shaming and double standards is to bend them over the sofa

954
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,960
and fuck them in the ass really hard with a strap on dildo.

955
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,320
Is there an option B?

956
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,240
Hey, listen, I'm not ruling anything out.

957
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,280
I'm going to change.

958
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,800
I'm going to change.

959
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,000
I want to do whatever it takes.

960
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
You know, option B is just get out there in the world and live your life

961
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,000
and you'll encounter all sorts of different people

962
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,600
who disprove a lot of the bullshit that you're taught in your faith tradition.

963
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,320
You know, I was raised Catholic.

964
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,360
I was taught a lot of bullshit, too.

965
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,840
And you get out there in the world and you realize that it's not as simple

966
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:20,800
or as cut and dried or black and white or Jesus likes this and Jesus doesn't like that

967
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,760
as your parents and your preachers and teachers led you to believe.

968
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,120
It's a quick learning process.

969
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,960
I think Justin's hoping for a sort of a safe environment

970
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,360
where you can do this and maybe get it over within a week.

971
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,440
Maybe like maybe like some sort of camp experience where it's San Francisco.

972
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,080
There should be like camps for straight guys in San Francisco

973
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,760
where you just get dropped off in a speedo at the corner of Market and Castro

974
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:47,920
on a Friday night and you have to fight your way back to your hotel in San Diego

975
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,360
without any help from anybody.

976
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,040
Just go nuts.

977
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,720
A strength survivor will probably.

978
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,440
You just have to.

979
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,560
That's right.

980
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,000
It's like the new Hunger Games.

981
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,120
I would watch that.

982
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:03,280
You will have your eyes and your thighs opened for you, Dan Savage.

983
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,080
Thank you so, so, so much for joining us.

984
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,200
It was a genuine treat.

985
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,360
You're the second guest we've ever had after our dad.

986
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,680
And the only one who didn't ejaculate all three of you into the world.

987
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,080
I feel.

988
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

989
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,440
The only one.

990
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,280
You're our first non-ejaculate guest.

991
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,160
Let me posit this.

992
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,280
Didn't you?

993
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,440
Oh, yes.

994
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:27,040
Dan, thank you so much.

995
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,160
Thank you, guys.

996
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,120
My pleasure.

997
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,720
Thank you so much to Dan Savage for joining us.

998
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,080
That was such a treat.

999
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,160
And you know, he only does that because we're members of the Maximum Fun Network.

1000
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,000
If we weren't, he wouldn't have a time.

1001
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,040
He's a big deal.

1002
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,640
He wouldn't have a time of day for us.

1003
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,080
If you don't believe us, try getting him on the horn and getting him on your fucking podcast.

1004
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,000
You can't do it if you don't carry that cache.

1005
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,840
Okay, he is a very, very brand aware person.

1006
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,960
Dan Savage cares about one thing, labels.

1007
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,320
Super, super-duper appreciate Dan joining us.

1008
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,120
That was a real thrill for us.

1009
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,240
And this is the kind of stuff that happens on the Maximum Fun Network.

1010
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,600
And you could be supporting it right now by going to MaximumFun.org forward slash donate.

1011
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,800
And just donating a few bucks a month, kick us a few bucks.

1012
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:21,600
Ten bucks for that earbud and bonus content, or 20 bucks for lots of things for your vagina

1013
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,560
and your butt.

1014
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,960
And 35 to get drunk enough to try using Butt Lube, you know?

1015
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,560
And here's the thing.

1016
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:33,760
In all of this, as with our podcast, you are our best marketing tool.

1017
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,840
So if you are already a donor, if you already support, great.

1018
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,640
Thank you so much.

1019
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,400
Now go tell all your friends on Facebook and Twitter, say, hey, I'm a donor.

1020
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:42,960
Why aren't you?

1021
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,800
You, I know you listen to this, Jimmy.

1022
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,160
We've listened to it together.

1023
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,200
And now you're pirating it because you have the chance to support this network.

1024
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,840
And you're not.

1025
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:54,240
There are only two kinds of Maximum Fun listeners, donors and thieves.

1026
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,360
Which one?

1027
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,240
I was going to go with donors or boners.

1028
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,480
Donors or boners.

1029
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,360
2013.

1030
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,600
Which one do you want to be?

1031
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,600
Only two kinds of listeners come out of my brother, my brother and me.

1032
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,040
Donors and boners.

1033
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,000
Which one are you, son?

1034
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
What's that voice you're doing?

1035
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,600
I it was supposed to be like an army drill sergeant.

1036
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,920
But I don't know what it was exactly.

1037
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,960
Also, stoners, donors and boners and stoners who meant to donate but forgot.

1038
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,240
Oh, shit.

1039
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,800
I missed that.

1040
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,440
Two weeks.

1041
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,040
When's that pledge drive, dude?

1042
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,200
It's July.

1043
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,360
You missed it completely.

1044
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,280
You've been asleep for four months.

1045
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,680
Stoners are riffing.

1046
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,840
Rip Van Winkles.

1047
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,960
Just stoners and boners and donors and Rip Van Winkles.

1048
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,440
And gypsies and tramps and thieves.

1049
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,680
So on top of the three levels that we've we've described at length, there are other

1050
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:59,360
higher levels if you're a high roller and you want the dopest that our network has to

1051
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,880
offer gift wise.

1052
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:05,200
There is if you want to drop a hundo per month, you can be a member of Jesse's Golden Eagles

1053
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:11,760
where you are initiated into the inner circle, which is a club that discusses comedy, music,

1054
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,960
art and culture.

1055
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:18,160
And basically what that means is is the host of Max Fund programs.

1056
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,760
We will curate our favorite work each month and we will share it with you.

1057
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,000
The inner circle member.

1058
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,960
It's basically like comedy Illuminati, which almost rhymes.

1059
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:35,040
You also get the rocks, glasses and the vibrator and the earbuds and the lube and the digital

1060
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,920
content.

1061
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,640
But you also get to be a member of a secret society.

1062
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,360
If you want to go even higher, there's a two hundred dollar per month.

1063
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:46,720
Jordan's Platinum Angels, which gets you all that shit and free registration for fucking

1064
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,800
Boat Party Bizz for the Atlantic Ocean Comedy and Music Festival.

1065
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:55,200
It's a cruise that goes to the Bahamas with everyone who's ever been funny.

1066
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,520
You could trip to the Bahamas for listening to podcasts.

1067
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,400
Think about it.

1068
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,520
Listen, you can fucking hang out with Maria Bamford and John Hodgman and Josie Long and

1069
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,720
Marc Maron and Eugene Merman and go to the fucking Bahamas.

1070
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,080
Anyway, I got heated there for a second because it made me angry that I wasn't going to do

1071
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,560
that.

1072
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,440
But fuck.

1073
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,240
But you could.

1074
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,280
But you could because it sounds you could do something so cool that I'm not allowed

1075
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,760
to do it.

1076
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,800
That is how cool this thing is.

1077
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,240
It is very cool.

1078
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,680
So please go to maximumfund.org forward slash donate.

1079
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,240
Give support our show.

1080
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,320
It really does mean the world to us.

1081
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,160
We're trying to get a thousand new donors this year.

1082
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,080
We've done it, I think, two years in a row.

1083
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,800
We've swung it.

1084
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,480
Also, for every new donor, you can we have challenge donors who donate, like, you know,

1085
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,120
a quarter or whatever, based on how many new donors we get.

1086
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,360
So it's around six bucks a month for every new donor.

1087
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,240
So it's huge.

1088
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,920
It's that's enormous because that adds up.

1089
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,400
If we get a thousand new donors, that's an extra six thousand bucks a month.

1090
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,720
Everybody who tweets a link to our donate page with the hashtag maxfunddrive, you get

1091
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:01,520
entered into a giveaway to win a trip to Los Angeles and a tour of Max Fund headquarters.

1092
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,400
The best tweet wins.

1093
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,680
So that's awesome.

1094
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,400
Yeah, it's huge.

1095
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:04,960
It's awesome.

1096
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,520
So because I've been tweeting a lot.

1097
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:08,160
Absolutely not.

1098
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,280
We're doing a lot of shit this year.

1099
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,840
I know it's weird because we, you know, we do this annually.

1100
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,880
We don't do it every week.

1101
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,000
I know it's weird to hear us asking for for money.

1102
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,800
But like, seriously, it means the world that the people out there who donate donate like

1103
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,480
to support us doing this fucking thing that we do every week.

1104
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,320
I mean, I don't want to make it sound like we just fucking fart and a podcast comes out.

1105
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,240
Like, you know, it takes it takes it takes work, but it's still at the end of the day

1106
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,800
fucking goofing off with my my bros.

1107
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,720
So like, seriously, think about supporting if you listen.

1108
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,400
And I just thank you.

1109
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,120
Thank you so much.

1110
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,640
Questions.

1111
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,400
I got them.

1112
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,200
That's a new bed I've been working on.

1113
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,560
OK, like a bed that you do whenever you have questions.

1114
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,560
OK, I got them.

1115
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,800
Answers.

1116
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,440
You want them.

1117
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,760
It's my brother, my brother and me.

1118
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,480
It's a show.

1119
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,440
It's a podcast.

1120
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,240
It's a pyramid scheme.

1121
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,600
OK, don't tell anybody.

1122
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:20,080
I shouldn't have put that in the jingle and then the podcast made off with my money.

1123
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:20,960
Yeah, thank you.

1124
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,480
I've been working on that one for a couple of years.

1125
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,680
I said that podcast priest everything I had.

1126
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:30,560
My boyfriend of five months recently asked if I would help him deep clean his apartment.

1127
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,440
He seemed hurt by my immediate response of clean your own damn place, dude.

1128
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,560
To be fair, he did not ask me to clean for him.

1129
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,680
He just asked if I would be willing to help out as a favor.

1130
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,480
I have to admit his place is gross and I would love it if it was less so.

1131
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,080
But I can't help feeling weird about scrubbing my boyfriend's toilet.

1132
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:55,440
Was my response unreasonable? Should I be down with the idea of helping him clean his place?

1133
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,680
That's from perplexed in Portland.

1134
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,920
How about you don't scrub his toilet?

1135
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,480
How about you just clean his stove?

1136
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,760
He handles toilet, dude.

1137
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,480
I would never, ever, ever want someone else to clean my house.

1138
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,680
Where did you put everything I need?

1139
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,240
I don't know.

1140
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,480
I put it in a cabinet somewhere.

1141
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,200
Not just that, but like, I hope you enjoyed touching my fecal particles because it's not

1142
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,040
just, guess what, doesn't just live in the toilet.

1143
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,000
There's more of his fecal particles on his stove than in his toilet, which is horrifying.

1144
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,080
You need to ask him what he's been doing there.

1145
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,600
Why is he pooping on his stove?

1146
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,880
It's a great question, Travis.

1147
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,680
Thank you.

1148
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,600
Thank you, Travis, for asking the big question.

1149
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,400
The big, hard question.

1150
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,320
We're not afraid to ask the big question to you.

1151
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,920
Why are you pooping on your stove, Dylan?

1152
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,760
They're afraid to answer them or look at them.

1153
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,800
I, I, you gotta say no.

1154
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,760
This sucks.

1155
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,360
It sucks that he put you in this position.

1156
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,240
Now, hold on.

1157
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,560
Don't you think it could be like Breaking 2, Electric Boogaloo, kind of like a montage,

1158
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,520
cleaning, getting to know you, happy fun times?

1159
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,440
Get those cobwebs off the ceiling fan by dancing upwards onto the ceiling.

1160
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,520
I'm just saying that in every movie where you see people like cleaning up a new space,

1161
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,440
they found everybody seems so happy and they're growing closer as friends.

1162
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,920
Fuck me on these old pizza boxes at the end of the montage.

1163
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:13,520
We've been cleaning so long for so hard, we're real sweaty.

1164
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,960
Fuck me on these pizza boxes.

1165
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,560
Do that thing where you paint on his nose.

1166
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,520
You know with the roller?

1167
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,800
You're like, oh, you got me.

1168
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:21,920
You know what?

1169
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,120
Oh, and camera tricks may look like you're painting over the camera.

1170
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,160
Yo, I love that.

1171
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,360
I love that move.

1172
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:27,920
You know what?

1173
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,120
I would, I would be so mad if somebody painted on my nose.

1174
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,560
I don't care how little we are.

1175
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,160
Do you know how hard it is to get this shit off?

1176
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,400
I know it's latex and it'll like peel off, but still, you made me look like a fucking moron.

1177
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,080
It happens in Benjamin Button and they, it's him and-

1178
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:42,800
Cate Blanchett.

1179
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,680
Cate Blanchett, the love interest in Benjamin Button, and he paints on her nose and I thought,

1180
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,560
you, man, what an asshole.

1181
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,840
That's your day.

1182
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,360
That's your whole fucking day.

1183
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,240
You know when like somebody pinches your nose and it hurts like shit?

1184
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,280
Like it hurts when you apply any amount of pressure to your nose whatsoever?

1185
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,120
You gotta scrub that shit to get it off.

1186
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:02,000
You gotta use lye.

1187
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,880
He should not have asked.

1188
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,000
It was incorrect.

1189
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,360
It was a miscalculation to ask because like, no.

1190
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,080
Five months?

1191
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:12,640
Yeah. Okay.

1192
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:13,120
Here's the thing.

1193
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,440
I agree.

1194
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:14,080
Cause it's one thing.

1195
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,000
You feel like you volunteer like, hey, maybe pick this place up.

1196
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:18,960
I'm happy to help.

1197
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:19,520
It's another thing.

1198
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,760
You'd be like, oh man, my place is a dump.

1199
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,120
My turlet needs grouting.

1200
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,000
Grout my turlet.

1201
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,400
No, it does.

1202
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:26,800
Okay.

1203
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,000
But on the flip side of this, if you spend any sort of time there, a considerable amount

1204
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,800
of time, then, you know, if you guys are like splitting living places, I think it's a fair

1205
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,320
request to ask, you know, to ask you to pitch in.

1206
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,240
Why is this fucking place so dirty?

1207
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:44,000
Why isn't he fucking cleaning himself?

1208
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,960
It's one thing to be like, hey, we make dinner together.

1209
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,400
Let's do the dishes together.

1210
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:52,080
It's another to be like, man, I've been living in squalor for like six months.

1211
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,600
Well, he could find a way to work around.

1212
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,720
Help me throw out everything that I've been hoarding.

1213
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:02,240
I know you've used this turlet as well during your five months where you've been over here.

1214
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,880
So would it really kill you to help us both out?

1215
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,640
You're really doing us both a favor by scrubbing my turlet.

1216
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,880
Well, is he going to help you clean up your apartment?

1217
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,240
Oh, she doesn't.

1218
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,040
She doesn't need that.

1219
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,320
Okay.

1220
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,800
So then I think that she doesn't need to help him.

1221
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,040
Yeah.

1222
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,000
She doesn't need to help him.

1223
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,680
Tell those messy ass that you're not coming over anymore until he cleans up.

1224
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,000
Period.

1225
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:22,720
Yeah.

1226
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,760
Just saying no scrubs.

1227
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,920
No scrubs until you scrubs.

1228
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:35,920
Tell him to creep to the hardware store.

1229
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,040
Where do they sell cleaning supplies?

1230
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,560
Tell him to make a waterfall of scrubbing bubbles.

1231
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,080
I don't know what even the cleaning supplies are called.

1232
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,960
Have you cleaned stuff before?

1233
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,600
I don't produce any waste.

1234
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:01,760
I've managed to streamline my life so much that I don't produce any waste in any format.

1235
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,960
No oils.

1236
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,800
My body doesn't produce any natural oils.

1237
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:06,800
No sweats.

1238
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,560
I mean, I don't.

1239
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,560
I haven't evacuated in like 15 years is what I'm saying.

1240
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,560
I am so sick.

1241
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,320
Listen, this whole podcast is just a cry for help, you guys.

1242
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,880
Belly's the size of a sumo wheelbag.

1243
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,400
It's not a cry for help, Travis, because I can't cry is what I'm saying.

1244
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,320
I keep it inside.

1245
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:36,560
I managed to exude all of my body's natural toxins through a vapor.

1246
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,120
We should be introducing ourselves as your oldest, your middlest, and your lumpiest.

1247
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,120
Your most unsettlingly lumpiest.

1248
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,000
Your most jaundiced.

1249
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,520
Well, the lumps are just my toxin sacs, which is where I exude.

1250
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,080
No problem.

1251
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,440
And that's how Griffin became a Batman villain.

1252
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,640
Do not touch them.

1253
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:55,280
Oh my God.

1254
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,520
I know I produce a natural rattling noise that sparks the cure,

1255
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,880
that piques the curiosity.

1256
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,240
He often lures in small children that way.

1257
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,640
I got a question for you guys.

1258
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,600
I'm going to be caught in between two jobs in a month or so.

1259
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,920
I plan on relocating to a different state at the end of the summer where my girlfriend

1260
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,240
is starting grad school and will be continuing my civil engineering career there.

1261
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:24,720
However, at my current company, people are resigning left and right, indicating a sinking

1262
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,220
ship.

1263
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:29,040
I have a suspicion that I'll have the summer free.

1264
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,560
My question is this.

1265
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:35,440
What can I do for three months that can still put food on the table, but has only a short

1266
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,720
term commitment?

1267
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,080
I'm an outdoorsy, numbers nerd, and amateur tinkerer.

1268
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:43,920
That's from Future Carney in Chicago.

1269
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,040
OK, you want to know a secret?

1270
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:45,760
Hit me.

1271
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,560
Anything.

1272
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:46,960
Yeah.

1273
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,680
Let me hold on.

1274
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:55,120
Let me go ahead and type your metrics here into the job assistant that places you.

1275
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:58,880
So outdoorsy, numbers nerd, amateur tinkerer.

1276
01:03:58,880 --> 01:03:59,380
Hmm.

1277
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:00,880
Subway.

1278
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,840
Just go work at Subway.

1279
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:04,560
Not on the subway, at a Subway.

1280
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:05,840
Subway sandwich shop.

1281
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,520
You too can be a sandwich artist.

1282
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,520
Here's the important thing.

1283
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:14,320
No matter what interview you go into, you just want to keep that three month time limit

1284
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,520
right in your pocket.

1285
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,720
Do not pull that move out.

1286
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,840
I see a big future for myself here at the Walgreens.

1287
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,520
I got some big ideas about how you guys can change up the way that you sell your operating

1288
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:25,840
chips.

1289
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,440
Where do you see yourself in five years?

1290
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1291
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,760
Let's scale that back.

1292
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,000
Where do I see myself in 10?

1293
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:33,120
Here?

1294
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,080
Did you guess here?

1295
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,520
Because the answer is here.

1296
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:36,960
At Walgreens, I love it.

1297
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,320
I'm never going anywhere.

1298
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,840
I don't have kids, but when I do, they're going to work at Walgreens.

1299
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,560
This Walgreens.

1300
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:43,920
I want it to be a family business.

1301
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:53,360
The important thing is that one ploy you can take is found a softball league, an intro

1302
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,080
Walgreens softball league, literally weeks before you are to resign.

1303
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:04,000
Because then you can really quit saying like, I don't, I mean, I can't leave you guys right

1304
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:04,400
now.

1305
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:04,960
It's too.

1306
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:06,640
We got inventory coming up.

1307
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,760
There's the division playoffs against CVS.

1308
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,480
Like, I don't know.

1309
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,240
I don't know how we can, how I can leave now or maybe like drama, organize everyone.

1310
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,000
It's like a Walgreens union.

1311
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And then just before the strike, you quit.

1312
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,040
You did.

1313
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,440
I'm the sacrifice that this Walgreens demands.

1314
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,720
I'm sorry.

1315
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,000
You'll have to go on without me.

1316
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,440
I have to go into hiding like Batman at the end of Dark Knight.

1317
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,040
Remember the lessons I've taught you.

1318
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,320
I am not the cashier that this Walgreens deserves, but I'm the one it no longer has.

1319
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:40,640
Bye.

1320
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:47,840
I actually, I worked at a, I worked at a Jimmy John's in Norman, Oklahoma, knowing that,

1321
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:51,040
you know, the school year is about to end and I was about to go home.

1322
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,960
And it provides a lot of psychological freedom because like, if your boss yells at you for

1323
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,040
doing something wrong or like they work you a terrible shift or something, it's like,

1324
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,080
yeah, but in your head, you know that fuck that place.

1325
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:07,440
I don't want to put you on Blasthouse, but weren't you fired from that Jimmy John's?

1326
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,400
No, they actually wanted to make me an assistant manager and I left.

1327
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,440
I have been fired from a lot of places, Griffin.

1328
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:13,680
Yeah.

1329
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,920
So I understand why that is a safe assumption.

1330
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:16,480
I got it matched up.

1331
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,120
So this Jimmy John's, do anything you want to.

1332
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,960
This is a great time for you.

1333
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,640
Do write, do a job for three months that you can write a book about.

1334
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:27,600
I think that there's too many ex-Subway employees.

1335
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:32,640
Maybe that book's being pitched all over, like Memories of a Subway Artists and just

1336
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:35,680
people like, no, we already have 20 of those manuscripts.

1337
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:37,920
A lot of those in the hopper.

1338
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,960
A lot of those are cooking up in pre and post-production.

1339
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,240
Now if you could write a Subway based movie, now we're talking.

1340
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,760
Now we get, now you're quickly asking.

1341
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,000
There already is a fucking Subway TV show.

1342
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,840
I see ads on it for Hulu all the time.

1343
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:51,840
You know about this?

1344
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,640
What, sorry?

1345
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,480
It's called, I think it's called The Nine to Fivers.

1346
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,560
It's a Hulu only TV show as all the best television programming is.

1347
01:06:59,200 --> 01:06:59,760
Good job.

1348
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,360
And it's about people who work at Subway and it's not like fun way.

1349
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,480
It's not like an offshoot.

1350
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,440
It's fucking legit to quit Subway.

1351
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:07,760
It seems like-

1352
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,040
Sponsored by Subway.

1353
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,400
It seems like a pretty good show.

1354
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,440
I'd probably watch that show.

1355
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,160
It's pretty good.

1356
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,040
It's all about, you know, love, life, making sandwiches, of course.

1357
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:23,360
There's a, there's a lot of commercials for Hulu based programs that don't,

1358
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,040
that, I don't know, that look pretty good.

1359
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:27,840
I saw a lot of commercials from where I've been, been-

1360
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,280
Watching real shows?

1361
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,080
Watching real shows.

1362
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:30,800
Watching real television shows.

1363
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,000
We got fake shows on here.

1364
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,320
Yeah, do you know how they pay for all those fake shows?

1365
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:34,800
How?

1366
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,040
Because they have a fucking show that's all about Subway.

1367
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,840
They have Subway programming.

1368
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,840
Anyway, it makes me so angry.

1369
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,440
I have a Yahoo answer.

1370
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,360
If you guys don't mind the leap.

1371
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,760
Maybe this will calm, calm my nerves.

1372
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:49,440
It's sent in by Emily Wall.

1373
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:49,760
Thank you.

1374
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:52,000
It's by Yahoo answer user, Layla Bell, who asks,

1375
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,760
I'm a cat person and so is my friend.

1376
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,920
We understand each other's meows and other sounds.

1377
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,560
Wait, hold on.

1378
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:01,840
When in the dark, we are cat.

1379
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,040
Wait a minute.

1380
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:05,760
Holy shit.

1381
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,480
Wait.

1382
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,480
I actually, this is so weird because when you said the phrase, I am a cat person,

1383
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,640
my first thought was I've been doing this show too long because I know what this person means

1384
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,560
is they're a person who likes to own cats.

1385
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,320
I hear like I'm a half cat, half person.

1386
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,040
I tried to-

1387
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,000
When in fact-

1388
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,960
I tried to vocalize the hyphen in between cat and person.

1389
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,120
I am a cat person.

1390
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,920
When in the dark, we are cat.

1391
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,600
But in the light, we are human.

1392
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,880
My friend has sharp cat-like teeth, but I'm less obvious.

1393
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,400
We don't change shape, but we lose complete control and go cat.

1394
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,380
Please.

1395
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,360
If anyone has info on this or has the same experience, fill us in.

1396
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,160
Okay.

1397
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,040
So they want help.

1398
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:47,840
How do we fix it?

1399
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,720
We can't help it.

1400
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,440
Oh my God.

1401
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,560
I don't want to fix it.

1402
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,880
I want to hang.

1403
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,000
I just want to hang.

1404
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,500
Yeah.

1405
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,040
Can we get one hang going, please?

1406
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,560
But here's the thing, Justin.

1407
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,560
Think about the reality of that situation because let's be honest, lights, you know,

1408
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:06,080
the lights go dim and you're just watching a fucking real person.

1409
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:06,880
Well, you're not watching.

1410
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,080
Oh, now I'm a cat.

1411
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:12,480
Travis, if you can see them, if there's enough light to see them-

1412
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,280
Hold on.

1413
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:14,560
They're human beings.

1414
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:16,800
So even if you were doing like night vision goggles.

1415
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,960
See, that's the only way.

1416
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,680
That's the only way you can observe these fools in their natural environment.

1417
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,440
What cruel fate to be in a room.

1418
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,200
It's like Lady Hawk, you know?

1419
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,320
Like you're in a room with a cat person, but you can't-

1420
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,280
You can only see them as person because they can't really like go ham with the lights on.

1421
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,480
You need night vision goggles.

1422
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,000
You got to have NVGs.

1423
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:38,320
That is a secret weapon.

1424
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,880
Unless it's like a Cal Mitchell in real life.

1425
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,720
Cal Mitchell is only Cal Mitchell when he's being naturally observed.

1426
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,440
Otherwise he is Kenan Thompson.

1427
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,560
Otherwise- Oh no.

1428
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,720
I don't think that's it.

1429
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,400
Although I've never seen them in the same room at the same time.

1430
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,760
That's why the show is called Kenan slash Cal.

1431
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:02,880
Kenan or Cal.

1432
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,160
Do you watch Kenan or Cal?

1433
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:07,680
Kenan by way of Cal.

1434
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,080
Kenan stroke Cal.

1435
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:16,880
Oh man, this situation.

1436
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:17,600
Oh man.

1437
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:24,240
I just want to know what it's like to be in a room with two people that you think are otherwise

1438
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,120
people people.

1439
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:26,480
Person persons.

1440
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,400
Not cat persons, just person persons.

1441
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:29,840
And then the lights go off and you're like-

1442
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,440
Oh, there's a power surge.

1443
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:33,040
Why does this sound like you're pooping in a box?

1444
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,920
Where's my milk?

1445
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:34,960
Where's my milk?

1446
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,840
Where did it go?

1447
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,920
Sounds like it's being lapped, but that's weird.

1448
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,040
I don't have a cat.

1449
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,480
I only have two people peoples.

1450
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,880
This is a strange situation I'm in.

1451
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,560
I think I'd like to leave.

1452
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,240
You can't leave.

1453
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,520
I think I'd like to leave this room.

1454
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,000
Where's the door?

1455
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,560
I can't see it.

1456
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:50,320
The door, the door, because the lights are off.

1457
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,160
Here's the terrifying thing.

1458
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:56,880
They can see you because as cats, they have superb dark vision.

1459
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,080
So they're hunting you now.

1460
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,040
I have cat eyes.

1461
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,080
You're the prey.

1462
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:00,800
They're the predator.

1463
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:01,840
They're the predator.

1464
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,640
I can't.

1465
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,280
It's like if-

1466
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,560
What's that to your left?

1467
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,080
I mean, it's bright in my room.

1468
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,520
My real cat is outside.

1469
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,960
Maybe he's a person when it's dark.

1470
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,320
That would suck.

1471
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,160
That would suck if that happened.

1472
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,520
If there was like a two second window where the power goes out and it comes back on and

1473
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,680
there's just a fucking dude on my couch just like,

1474
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:23,120
sup, meow, he changes just like that.

1475
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,880
I would be fucking freaked.

1476
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,600
I would move out.

1477
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,960
The house is yours now, Cecil.

1478
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:27,520
I'm done.

1479
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:29,120
This one's yours.

1480
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,960
You are welcome, Stephen King.

1481
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:37,440
Hope that you send us a check when you make this into a book and a movie and a play and

1482
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:38,400
another movie.

1483
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,000
If you're going to fucking LARP an animorph, which if I had said that sentence 10 years

1484
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,920
ago to anybody, I would be committed to an insane asylum.

1485
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,200
Pretty much right away.

1486
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:53,280
But now, thanks to Yahoo Answers, I can fucking crack that cipher.

1487
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,560
If I were to LARP an animorph, why would you go with a fucking domesticated house cat and

1488
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,240
not a more exotic animal?

1489
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,440
Ooh, good call.

1490
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,040
A more erotic animal.

1491
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:06,080
Do they say house cat or do they just say cat?

1492
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:07,440
It could be a beautiful jungle cat.

1493
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,160
He's got a point.

1494
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,880
And it's a sinewy, like a cougar with sinewy muscles.

1495
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:14,000
I get it.

1496
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,480
Cougars are basically land dolphins.

1497
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,680
I understand.

1498
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,720
Okay, listen.

1499
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,160
Slick one of those bad boys up and you...

1500
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,120
Listen, you slick a cheetah up, you got a dolphin basically.

1501
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:28,320
That's basically what you're working with.

1502
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,080
Thank you all so much for listening to this podcast.

1503
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:32,640
They can't hear us.

1504
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,080
They're too busy jerking off right now.

1505
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,240
Stop jerking it for just a second while we give you this very important message about

1506
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,280
the Maximum Fun Drive.

1507
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,920
It is a two-week blowout of fun and laughs.

1508
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,800
Don't say blowout right after you ask them to stop jerking it.

1509
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,080
You're right.

1510
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,240
It's like talking about a waterfall when your friend has to pee.

1511
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,320
It is a two-week festival of fun and laughs.

1512
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,040
We really hope that you'll go to MaximumFun.org

1513
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,920
slash donate and choose one of these donation levels.

1514
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:06,560
For $10 a month, you can get those Maximum Fun earbuds that are really slick and the

1515
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,560
digital content for 20 bucks.

1516
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,080
A big sex pack.

1517
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,400
The intimate sensations from our friends at ExtremeTrace.com.

1518
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,000
The earbuds are in there.

1519
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,760
The digital content is not in there.

1520
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,040
It's in the cloud, but you know.

1521
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,360
Just go to MaximumFun.org slash donate.

1522
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,240
It has all the details, all the prize packs.

1523
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:29,520
By the way, to clarify on that $20 a month pack, you can, instead of the sex stuff, get

1524
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,480
a Maximum Fun Rocket tee if that is more your bag.

1525
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,840
Oh, so it's an option.

1526
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,840
It's an either or situation.

1527
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,160
Okay.

1528
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:38,000
You can do that.

1529
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,320
If you donate, thank you a lot.

1530
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:46,000
Go to that page if you need to like migrate from, you know, a shitty credit card to, you

1531
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,960
know, PayPal or you can change your donation options there.

1532
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,400
You can also upgrade your donations.

1533
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,560
If you don't donate, think about it.

1534
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,760
Just if you're sitting at your computer and we've given you entertainment and you dip

1535
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,880
into all the other shows and we give you all this shit and you want to support us, that

1536
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,000
would be the dopest.

1537
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,320
Just go to MaximumFun.org slash donate.

1538
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,200
We won't belabor the point, but just think about it.

1539
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,080
Just think about it.

1540
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,920
That's all I ask.

1541
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,120
Will you please just think about it?

1542
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,720
And we want to say thank you again to Dan Savage.

1543
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,280
Goddamn it.

1544
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,680
Thank you for casting on the show from Savage Love and Savage Love Cast over at The Stranger.

1545
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:23,440
So make sure you check out his shit if you haven't already because we assume that you

1546
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:23,680
do.

1547
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:25,760
But he's incredible and he's an awesome dude.

1548
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,560
Thanks again, Dan.

1549

Thank you, Dan.

1550
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,720
And thanks to John Roderick and the Long Winter's for using our theme song.

1551
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,800
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1552
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,640
You can find that on iTunes or Amazon, I'm sure.

1553
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,400
I'm sure you can.

1554
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,120
I'm sure of it.

1555
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,640
