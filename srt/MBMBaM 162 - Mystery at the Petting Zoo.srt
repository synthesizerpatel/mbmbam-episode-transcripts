1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Welcome, my brother, my brother, mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother,

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
Justin McElroy. I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,520
Boy, the excitement is palpable. It's Sunday morning. We're just two and a half hours

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,720
from learning the identity of the new Doctor Who. Do you know what this is? I know how to

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,440
equate this for people who don't watch Doctor Who. This is like nerd draft. Yeah, but it's not

10
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,280
really anything like what you just said. It's like nerd primaries. It's like here's the thing,

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,960
though. The one thing I wanted to say is that I like my chances. Yeah. Oh, I have. I mean,

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,040
have you been what? What step are you currently in in the casting process, Justin? Well,

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,880
I'm telling anyone who listened that I like my chances and those that's how rumors get started.

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
And you know what? Confidence is such is so key in this game. So key. And you took out a full page

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,440
ad in the in that one British newspaper that just said for your for your consideration and

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,000
for your consideration wearing a very long scarf. It just said Doctor Me question mark. Doctor Who

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,480
me? Maybe it's up to you. Do it Britain. How about I had an unconventional thing where like,

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:11,840
you know how like I wore the scarf that Tom Baker wore and I had like the coat that David Tennant

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:20,480
wore. And then I also had the coat that all the doctors have worn. And I wore them all on top.

20
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
You were wearing a fez like you sat down with the writers. You're like,

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,960
guys, cast me. I have a great idea. I'm like the mashup guy. I got through time and I got

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,080
all my garments. So I'm really all the doctors in one. And if you take away all my coats,

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,520
then I'm just inside. I'm just not real. Not a real doctor. Who would you guys like to see

24
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,080
as the new? Who's your ideal doctor? Oh, God. So tough. What's David Tennant doing?

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,320
So he's he's otherwise occupied. I think it'd be a ball. It'd be a real baller move for them to

26
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:08,480
be like, he is the 13th doctor. It does look like him. It was David Tennant. What do you mean?

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,760
For me, it's a toss up between because it seems to oscillate between like sort of the austere

28
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,600
doctor and the like playful, fun doctor. So for me, it's really between Jeff Goldblum or

29
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:33,120
Zachary Ty Bryant. I would love to see ZTB get back in the mix. It can go because like his would

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,160
be like a fresh. But like when people when they cast Matt Smith, they're like, this is going to

31
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,360
be a fresh, fun doctor. And they were right. He was fresh and fun. But if they want to go a

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,400
different route, something a little more a more something a little more dignified, something with

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,920
more pauses in his in his speech, you know, with the bloom, right? The bloom. But if you want to

34
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,720
keep it even fun. So you're saying if they need a 180 from Matt Smith to someone who's even more fun

35
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,760
and even more fresh, you turn to Zachary Ty Bryant, Zachary Ty Bryant, because really,

36
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,360
it's his fucking time to shine. What if you got an actor who already had experience as a doctor?

37
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,760
And you got George Clooney. He was great as Batman. He was great as Batman, Batman doctor,

38
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,680
basically the same person. You don't notice how you don't see the doctor and Batman in the same

39
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,960
room at the same time. Not in my fanfiction. I. L-O-D-E.

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,320
Geronimo. Who's the guy that people are floating right now? The real guy? Peter Capaldi. Peter

41
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:48,880
McNichol. Peter McNichol. From the hit show Alley McBeal and Slave to Viggo. They haven't had a

42
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,080
doctor with a forehead that's really like a seven or eight head. You know what I mean? Yeah. They

43
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,480
haven't put a slap of a dignified forehead on that doctor. And then they want some space time.

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,560
We've given enough advice to the people at BBC. We should help some actual people. This is still

45
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
an advice program after all. I mean, for crying out loud. Although side note, if you want a three

46
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,760
headed doctor, we will all play it together. Like in a Greek chorus. How about that art? Put it on

47
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,040
our Facebook and we'll send you a dollar. Can we put the dancing baby as the doctor from Alley

48
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,320
McBeal? I love that guy. Ooga chogger, right you guys? Where has he been? He's now a dancing

49
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,680
middle aged man. He would thwart anyone. Like what are you going to do to a baby in a long scarf and

50
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,680
11 coats that's just dancing? Do you want a jelly baby? How about a dancy baby? What about Johnny

51
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
Depp? Cause he's got like, he's got a pretty distinct style. You know what I mean? Like he's

52
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,840
already got all the scarves. He's already got, he wears mini coats. Thank you so much for having me,

53
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,840
considering me. I really appreciate the role. Would like it to be more of like a, like a racist

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,880
caricature. What can we, I was thinking what if the doctor is like, yo man, yo. What do you think?

55
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,000
How would that go? What if he said, I saw get in my tardies like that. What do you think? I think

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,160
it would be really a fresh day. It's about time for these, for these races to be represented

57
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
in our culture. Let's tear down these walls. I really think that I am the vehicle. I'm the

58
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,720
crucible through which these races will be presented. I think I could play Samoan. Am I right

59
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,360
you guys? Just a big fat doctor. Think about it. Big fat Samoan doctor. That's racist. Think about

60
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,040
it. That you think all Samoans are overweight. I don't think that, but that's what Johnny Depp

61
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,520
thinks. He's a racist in this. Cause Dr. Who's a racist, so it's a great fit. Remember that little

62
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,760
bit, that little gag he used to do about Dr. Who being a giant racist. Oh man, classic. Digging

63
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,680
out the archives. We already did one clip show. We can't keep fucking reviving the past. No,

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,400
we haven't done like a flashback clip show though, where it's like, you guys remember that time?

65
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,280
What did everybody think of the clip shot? I didn't see the reaction. Nobody liked it. Nobody

66
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,760
liked it. All right. Well, good, good to know. Let's do a new one then. Recently, my teenage

67
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,800
sister has begun to claim that she is gluten sensitive. She says she gets diarrhea whenever

68
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,480
consuming these products. This has resulted in a lot of inconvenience as we now have to screen

69
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,480
every restaurant's gluten-free options to see if we can eat there or not. She's the only one in

70
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,680
our family with any food allergy. However, she will often eat donuts, breads, and other snack foods,

71
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,760
or even whole dinners, which do contain gluten with apparently few side effects.

72
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,720
And when we were reminded of this, she said she doesn't care because she wants it.

73
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,760
Am I right in calling her out in these situations or should I just keep quiet and let her deal with

74
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,200
her own side effects, if any? That's from gluten trouble in Green, Texas. Oh, that's a tough one.

75
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,640
No, it's not. Fuck that noise. When she starts eating too many donuts,

76
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,440
you stand up, you point at her and yell, you're a gluten.

77
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,160
Well, no, you say, I had four fucking peanuts for dinner last night because we went to a nice

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,480
restaurant that catered to your delicate constitution. And now you're over here slamming

79
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,680
super donuts? That doesn't seem fair. Am I misreading the question?

80
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
No, you're absolutely correct. I think, okay, let me first and foremost state that there are

81
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
people in this world that are gluten sensitive and have gluten allergies and this is a real thing.

82
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,320
That said, I think that this is one of those things that especially younger people,

83
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,520
and it's going to become like a fad thing where people go, yeah, I'm also gluten sensitive because

84
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,760
I put on weight when I eat a lot of bread or, you know, I get a tummy ache when I eat too many

85
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,440
donuts. And it's just people trying to be cool and have something special about them that they're not

86
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,760
unless they really do at which point. That shit's no joke. When you get that,

87
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,720
what is it? Fucking the bone you get like Cialis. That's not what it is.

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,400
I don't think it's the Cialis boner pills. Yes. Yeah. I don't think that's what you get. I don't

89
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,120
think that's what you get if you eat too much like bread and pasta. No, I think that that's

90
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,560
although I've gone to the, I've gone to the spaghetti factory before and

91
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,960
have food that was so good that it chubbed me. I think that, I think that she can have it one

92
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:25,040
of two ways. Either she can stick to her fake gluten story or you can start flipping this on

93
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,400
her. And when she complains about going to a restaurant that doesn't have good gluten free

94
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,640
options, you just say, well, I want it. I thought that went in this family. If she has Cialis,

95
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,600
then like she wouldn't be eating donuts and be like, oh, I'm so bad. Special treat for me. She'd

96
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,240
be like, ah, my bones don't work. I would say it's in all probability, it's, it's an attention

97
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
getting thing where she's like, well, we need to go to the restaurant I want to go to because of

98
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
my gluten sensitivity. Maybe she just loves steak. She just fucking loves it. And she'll only go to

99
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,640
a place to have that. Listen guys, I'm sorry. We're going to have to go to Sizzler again.

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,640
I don't want to go to bread born. Yeah. I don't think, I don't think has wonderful gluten free

101
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,720
options by the way. I don't think is gluten sensitive the right term because this makes

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,840
her sound like some sort of, um, some sort of psychic, some sort of S S perfect. I feel the

103
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:26,880
gluten's pain. There's some sourdough nearby. I can feel it in my Cialis bones. Put both your

104
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:36,960
hands behind your back. Put a scone in one of them. Okay. It's fall from NBC. There's Brad

105
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:47,120
nearby. Get out of here. Seven Eastern, six central Cialis sisters Friday nights at 1120.

106
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:55,920
Jeff Goldblum is a 10 minute PSA disguises the television show produced by Jeff Goldblum.

107
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,600
Just like you used to watch in high school about basically any topic.

108
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Um, I don't think to anybody it's gluten insensitive. Whoa. If that was a real thing,

109
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,080
I'd know. Of course people are, but I wish I was. That's what I wanted to say. Is it basically

110
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,320
carbs? Is that what gluten is? Gluten is only in bread. So here's the thing about it though. This

111
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,240
is where they trick you. Think like, Oh, that would be great. Cause I could stop eating bread.

112
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,640
Maybe lose a few of these LBs, but then oops, twist beer. Yeah. That's how it's anything derived

113
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,120
from wheat, I guess. So I think gluten, I've learned from watching Alton Brown that gluten

114
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,400
is like the bonds that form with like wheat and stuff and bread and stuff with the sugars.

115
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,920
You turn to my brother, my brother and me for one thing and that's nutritional. That's how you get

116
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,920
that fucking Cialis disease is that gluten gets inside your bones and it's like, Oh, you want me

117
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,200
to, do you want me to stick these bones together? And it's like, no gluten, gluten. I want you to

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,680
be digested. And I want you to turn into energy for my body that I can use to play sports.

119
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,520
It's okay. So I'll just stick them together. Let me just get your hip and your fibia and oops.

120
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,440
I fucked up. Sorry. I'll do better next time. You won't. Hey, I made you have diarrhea. Sorry.

121
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,280
I hit a button or something.

122
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:18,400
I was carrying this tray and I bumped it with my hip. That was my bad. You guys.

123
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,160
I hope you liked that donut earlier. Cause I'm, I'm really taking you to do keys out.

124
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,240
Let me just get absorbed in your colon and up. Nope. I did it bad. Sorry guys. Try the best.

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,440
Oh, gluten. Gluten. It's so dumb. Griffin. How about Yahoo? Yeah. I got some Yahoo's. Thanks

126
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,800
everybody for sending in Yahoo's. I had two weeks worth to choose from, which is always very exciting.

127
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,240
This Yahoo was sent in by Meredith Mahan. Thanks Meredith. It's by Yahoo answers user question

128
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,920
mark. By the way, you guys know that when a Yahoo answers user name is question mark,

129
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,600
that means they've been kicked off of the Yahoo answer service, but their questions remain.

130
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
Somebody told me that that seems crazy to me. Like why wouldn't they delete the questions too?

131
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,520
Well, cause the wisdom is still permeating the system. Yeah. I like to think of this as

132
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:15,120
like their, their tombstone. They got who answers epitaph. Ever since I've done yoga,

133
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,120
ladies started to really feel attracted around me like a magnet. Yeah. Does yoga release a lot

134
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,920
of pheromones or something because females keeps staring at me and touch me as well. Also come

135
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,600
close. Is that at the end? Like, I don't know if that's a correct command. There's one other thing.

136
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,280
Um, it's that it opens your genital chakras. I mean, I mean, okay. All right. Let's, uh,

137
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:50,560
is there, we've, we've already debunked gluten, right? That's not real. Gluten doesn't exist.

138
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,320
Gluten doesn't exist unless it does. If you have Cialis, can we talk like, is there some shit

139
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,200
to this? Like, can you get like, Travis, you've done, you've striked me as the only person of

140
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,920
the three of us that has ever actually done yoga. I mean, I, I did bullshit theater yoga.

141
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,720
I've done some yoga in my time. I got a morning routine. Helps me wake up. You do that.

142
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,640
Sun salute. I do that. Sun salute to down face dog. Love it. Name two more.

143
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Upward facing baby. Bindo. Bindo is. Stork presses. The windmill swing. The life of pie.

144
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,480
Jedi attack. Dragon squeeze. You do that pomegranate slider. Mm hmm. Wolf yips. Jamba juice.

145
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:47,760
Pinkberry. Jamba Jovi. Um, that's just some of my yoga moves. I, uh, I, I mean, if I played

146
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,320
Street Fighter II, if yoga could teach you to spit fire at people. Sure. And shoot your leg across

147
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,400
the battlefield. Shoot your leg across there. I don't see why. God, we are making some gross

148
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:02,400
racial misrepresentations. I didn't do it. Street Fighter and David Tennant did. Or, sorry, Johnny

149
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:09,760
Depp. Yeah, David Tennant's pretty racist too. Slander, slander, slander. I, I think there's

150
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,400
probably some shit to this. I think if you, I think, I think, okay. Meditation probably has

151
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:23,200
some sort of, I mean, it definitely has some sort of psychological centering effect on you that,

152
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,400
that I think makes your, your brain game a little healthier. I think we can all, I think we can all

153
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,400
sort of just acknowledge that face value fact. That's why Buddhist monks laid on 24-7. Yeah.

154
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,400
Oh, um, I think, I think there's some shit to this. I don't know about like the, you know,

155
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,600
third eye and shit like that, but I think it probably does make you like more confident.

156
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,360
Makes, certainly makes you limberer and God knows. But he did it once. I just want to throw out in

157
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,280
this question, the question asker did yoga once. I mean, he doesn't, I mean, he did, he phrased

158
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:02,800
it as I've done yoga. So that does kind of make it sound like a last, he's completed yoga. He

159
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,960
solved it last Saturday. There was a free class at the JC. This is interesting because we had a

160
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:16,320
question from a yoga guy who, uh, everyone he dated thought he would be like really spiritual

161
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,480
and stuff. Right. And, and, and, and all the time. And he's not, cause he's like just a dude that

162
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:30,160
like watch his Ninja warrior at night and like eats Slim Jims and jerks off. Like he's just like

163
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,320
every other dude in that, in that those are the three things. Every other guy. There's something

164
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,120
in his aura from doing yoga that is attracting people to him that they're led to that. I think

165
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,960
maybe we just like anybody that'll take the time to stretch. Maybe that's it. Like if you, you are

166
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,680
like a man who doesn't pull his hammies. You like, you took the time to really stretch and I didn't

167
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,080
do that. And I've never done that. So I am envious of you. Yeah. I respect you. I think there's

168
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,760
probably some sort of, I think there are these power centers inside of our body. Now stick with

169
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,960
me. Okay. I'm in. No, I'm into it. Go on. Okay. There are power centers inside our body from

170
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,920
which we project our, our auras, if that's what you want to call it or care bear stairs, if you

171
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,240
will. And when, yeah, if you want to think about it that way. And then when you align that shit,

172
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:31,360
like, like the planets, then your shit gets like way more powerful and people can read that shit

173
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,920
and will want to fuck you. I actually read about that in a Malcolm Gladwell's, the outliers. He

174
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,560
said that exact paragraph. You're just cribbing. You know, is there, let me hit you with this other

175
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,480
thing that I have for you. This is another observation. A lot of times when you're

176
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
trying to get to the bottom of something, scientifically, you got to look at X factors.

177
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,640
What are the, what are the qualifying things that might also be causing a reaction so you

178
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:08,320
can separate causation? Do you maybe have some really cool pants you wear while yoga? Do they

179
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,040
have like maybe a sweet dragon on them? Or they say like, or an enumerated list of things that

180
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:21,040
make you an attractive sexual partner. Yeah. Like, like you put on the pants and up one leg,

181
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,680
it says like, number one, cool dick. Number two, I can't have sex for a super long time without

182
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:33,360
stopping. Number three, I don't sweat very much. Is it possible that this person was just like

183
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,280
perfectly balanced at unattractive and attractive. And then they did yoga and it was just like the

184
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,400
feather on the scale that just tipped it over into attractive. But you're saying that as if,

185
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,680
as if like every, every member of the opposite sex, it thinks of like people doing yoga is like,

186
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,520
like, oh, that's yeah. Want that goes even deeper because unless he's advertising it,

187
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,080
unless he's walking to the bar going by the way, ladies yoga guy right here,

188
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,480
then just that the ladies can sense it. I think if anyone ever did that thing that you just said,

189
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,640
it would clear the, clear the room. I think probably, Hey, yoga man. Hey, no big deal guys,

190
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
but yoga man right here. Hey, you ever been with a genuine yoga man,

191
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:25,520
the party can start right now. Folks. I'm not selling you snake oil. Although I will rub snake

192
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,960
oil essentially on your body while we yoga together sexually. It's better than yogurt,

193
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,680
man. That's what I try to get going for a while. That did not pan out. Sometimes I just walk in

194
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,920
and say good humor, man. And people are like, Ooh. And I'm like, no, I just tell jokes.

195
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,720
Yahoo answers user Maria said, it responded and said, girls, like when guys do yoga,

196
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,720
because there's lots of yoga moves that can be incorporated into sex and lead to a massive

197
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:00,160
orgasm. Two things, two points of two points of order. If I may go on, I don't think.

198
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,760
Are they talking about the massive orgasm for the partner or for the person doing the yoga?

199
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,680
Because I don't think any, I don't think that quote massive orgasm in quote is something that

200
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:19,120
the other person is ever looking for that person to have like, Oh man, here comes a bucket.

201
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:29,200
Did you just do the dragon squeeze Christ? Um, second. Oh my God. Was that a Chamba Jovi?

202
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,360
That would be an unconventional pickup line. Hey girl tonight. I would like

203
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,200
to have a massive orgasm and I would very much like your attendance to my orgasm.

204
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,440
I would like you to be there. I need a witness. I need a, I need a second.

205
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,720
There are some things I would like to incorporate into our lovemaking.

206
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,080
I need a spotter for the massive orgasm I'm going to have.

207
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,840
Just give me some orange juice afterwards and make sure orange juice. It'll be very,

208
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,920
very much like after giving blood. That is how drained I will be. Hey, listen, girl,

209
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,280
if you see me start to shake around, you just put a wooden spoon in her mouth

210
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,720
and just try to say back. This is going to be a massive. I'll give you a list of my

211
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
emergency contacts. So if you need to call my parents or something,

212
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:28,880
um, secondly, I don't think people actually look at people doing yoga and try and figure out how

213
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,920
the geometry of the shape of their bodies in those positions would, would align with a sexual,

214
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,640
like when I see somebody with their like legs bent behind them and their elbows bent behind them and

215
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,800
they are sticking their pelvis directly in the air, forming a circle with their bodies.

216
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,840
I don't look at that and immediately think like that would be, that would be cool to have sex

217
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,240
with. I think like trying to have sex with that is like when you go to the beach and your beach

218
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,560
towel like keeps crumpling up below, beneath you and you try to like flatten it out so you can get

219
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,680
a good sit going, but it's, it's uncooperative. You know what I mean? No. You mean it's like going

220
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,520
to like a pool and you can't figure out the chairs and how they collapse? That's exactly,

221
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,400
that's exactly what, thank you. That's a way, way, way better metaphor. Do you think that there are,

222
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:22,880
there is one yoga pose, like you could pair them off so that for every yoga pose,

223
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,400
there's a corresponding pose, another one that would have perfect sex. Like a complimentary,

224
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,480
like if you do downward facing dog and upward facing cat. Oh, look out. Then you get outward

225
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,400
facing orgasm everywhere. Oh, gross. I'm going to have to move again. What if you're in a yoga

226
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,640
class and your instructor said, now I've been working on this position for a while. It's going

227
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,000
to be really cool. And then he like, he folds himself up and transforms into a car and drives

228
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:01,840
away. He doesn't need to eat hot food. He just does it. He just just like that. That's the noise.

229
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,800
Okay. I got another question. I'm a guy. Okay. Whenever I see, sorry, I'm a guy. And whenever I

230
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,320
see friends who I've not spoken to in a while, I don't have any good catching up questions.

231
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,280
I feel like maybe this is a guy thing since girls seem to have long and excited conversations when

232
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,200
they see someone for the first time in some time. But I just go straight back to normal conversation

233
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,160
as if we hadn't had time away from each other. Is that normal? How do you guys catch up with friends?

234
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:36,880
How have you been doing? Doesn't demand anything other than fine. Thanks in response. And any other

235
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,760
questions I think of are too vague to generate anything worthwhile. I'm still in school, which

236
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,520
I'm guessing is pretty relevant. It's extremely, extremely completely relevant. It is super,

237
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,120
super Jermaine Jackson to this guy. The thing I remember most about going to school in Oklahoma

238
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,400
is every time I would return home to West Virginia, there were two different classifications of

239
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,600
people. There was one classification that were my actual real life friends that would be like,

240
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,680
oh, hey, and then we would just hang out. Like I hadn't been gone for four months.

241
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,520
And then there were people that without fail asked the question, so how's Oklahoma? Yeah.

242
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,960
To which my response was always very flat. It's very windy. Thank you very much. I think that

243
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,640
that you bring up the the role of gender in this. And I don't think it plays a part. No,

244
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,840
I think I think it I think it does to an extent, but not to not in the way that you think of it.

245
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,360
I think that everybody reaches an age where they sort of circle back around and say, man,

246
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,480
I have not kept in very good touch with my friends. I need to like make a more concerted

247
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
effort to stay involved in their lives because it's uncomfortable when I do see them and like

248
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,960
I have no fucking idea like what they're up to. I think that women do reach that point a bit

249
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,960
earlier than dudes do. Like I think like in most aspects of life, like women mature a bit faster

250
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,120
in that sense where they're like, I don't know, a few years before dudes, they have the realization

251
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,880
of like, oh, man, I need to I need to get on the phone more and like talk to my friends.

252
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,840
This will surprise no one. But I'm I'm just abysmal at this. I mean, just the absolute worst.

253
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,800
Because here's my fear. I mean, and I think it's legitimate. My fear is that I will.

254
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,960
I'll ask someone the question of the thing that they absolutely don't want to talk about.

255
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,120
So how's your girlfriend? Oh, we we broke up. Yeah, exactly. How's your family? Dead. That's

256
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,880
Falcone. My whole family's dead. Pray to me.

257
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,840
Yes, I think that the act of catching up is one that requires you to debase yourself on a level.

258
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,040
It is. That's exactly what it is, Griffin. It is laying yourself at their altar and like,

259
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,960
I am so sorry. This is my admission. I have no shit. I have no clue. I have no idea.

260
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,280
I am a fucking it really does require you to say, like, I'm a fucking terrible friend because I

261
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,200
didn't know that, like, you dumped this person two years ago, started dating someone else.

262
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,000
You're married and you have five kids. Like, I fucked up. That's here's the here's the other

263
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,600
side of that coin, though. When that happens to me, like if I say, like, so how's how's things,

264
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,520
you know, how's what's her face or whatever? And then they say, oh, you know, we broke up.

265
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,360
If they handle it well, if they're like, oh, you know, we broke up a while ago. I'm actually seeing

266
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
someone new. She's great. Right. And it's like, OK, cool. This is the type of person I want to

267
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,160
catch up with again the next time I see them. If they're above you, Dick, we broke up and it's been

268
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:49,440
real rough in my head. I mark out their names on a giant list. Next time, no eye contact.

269
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,280
Yep. Gave it a shot. But that one's done. You blew it. The funny thing about this is and I think

270
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,120
it's time to be if I'm being honest, I think when we are on the reverse side of the situation,

271
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,880
and there is a part of all of us that says, man, I hope they ask about that one thing because I'm

272
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,120
going to fucking drop the bomb on this wall. Please, please, please. I'm going to win this

273
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
catching up. You're saying that there's you're saying there's an inherent joy associated with

274
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,040
like fucking shaming somebody like dropping the bomb on them. Oh, I haven't been doing that for

275
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:32,320
like four years. What the fuck? What are you talking about? Here's here's the thing, though.

276
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:41,600
I. I think that like I get I get psyched after those conversations happen like after it's if

277
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,200
it's somebody that like I'm I genuinely like want to reconnect with them, I'm like, you have to get

278
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,040
curious about what those people have been up to. Like you have to want to genuinely catch up and

279
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,680
not be making small talk because after I do that, like after I catch up with an old friend, which

280
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,800
like I've been doing a lot of, especially with like getting married, like I've been sending out

281
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,120
invitations to people that I don't talk to other than like once a year where we have a very

282
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,240
superficial catch up time, like I get fucking psyched to be it's like it's like catching up

283
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,760
on a TV show that everybody's talking about. It's like, oh, I like I'm right there with you now.

284
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,560
And now we can like talk on the reg because I I am up to date with the latest and greatest of your

285
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,800
shit. The Griffin make a great point. And it's sort of central to this, I think, is that the secret

286
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:40,320
to it is you have to be if you're having a hard time coming up with a question for a person,

287
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,560
you maybe need to reevaluate getting interested in in that person getting getting interested in

288
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,360
people because like that's we've talked about it a lot. And it's kind of like an old Dale Carnegie

289
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,880
thing. But like that's how you make friends and keep them is you get you get interested in people.

290
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,160
But if you can't think of anything you're curious about, then that that may be a sign that you

291
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,440
maybe need to reevaluate like your approach because you should be curious if you care about somebody

292
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,720
even a little bit, then you should kind of be curious about what's going on. But I would say

293
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,560
that I think that there is a certain amount of that. Hey, how's it going? Haven't seen you a

294
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,800
while. Oh, it's going great. Like there's a reason that everybody does that, because that's that's

295
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:27,120
the agreed upon like exchange between two people that aren't actually close, but haven't seen in

296
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,880
each other in a while. And it's it's letting go of the shame of being like, oh, I don't care about

297
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,760
this person. They don't care about you. If you're going to dinner with like 13 old friends for an

298
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,800
hour, like that's not that that's not the venue to be like, tell me everything that's happened to

299
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,560
you. Like we lost touch in college. Tell me everything that's happened to you. Like you have

300
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,560
to like, you know, put in the time to call them and like just swallow it. Because here's the thing,

301
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,960
like they obviously haven't kept in touch with you either. So like if they're genuinely interested

302
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,520
in what you've been up to, then there's no there's no like downside to swallowing your pride and

303
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,360
admitting like, I haven't kept up with your shit. Like, let's let's let's reconnect now. And then

304
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,280
we don't. Hopefully, if we do a better job of staying in touch, we never have to have this

305
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:15,200
conversation ever again. Yeah, start walking with them before you just like start running,

306
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,920
you know, ask the little questions first and then get into like the big shit and start or start

307
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:25,040
running. They'll never catch you. They will not see it. I've got friends, you know, that I went

308
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,960
to college with. And there are some people that I see, you know, randomly running into what I'm in,

309
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,200
you know, a different city. And it's like, oh, hey, what's up? How's it going? And then I have some,

310
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,360
you know, my friend Trevor, I hadn't seen in like five years. And we just instantly dropped into

311
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,960
a conversation like, you know, we were hung out the day before, you know, it's just knowing how

312
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,120
to interact with different friends is kind of it's a case by case basis. But just, you know,

313
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:58,480
care, be friends, just care. That's all you have to do is care or are hide better. There's a part

314
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,400
of me whenever I get in a conversation like that, it's kicking myself like I should have gone

315
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,640
should have gone behind the winter coats. Why did I leave the house? They should have never,

316
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:14,000
they would have never seen you there. Oh, that's a grim window. And my psyche. That's the new name

317
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,800
of the podcast. I once ripped my little brother's foil Charizard Pokemon card in a fit of teenage

318
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:27,920
rage. It has been 12 years and my brother still has not forgiven me. He said the card was worth

319
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:33,040
$50 and I've provided him with money quite a few times over the years, but he still brings up that

320
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,600
Pokemon card every chance he gets. How can I get him to forgive me or at least quit bringing it up?

321
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,400
That's from Amber in Arizona. Oh, well, let me ask you this. Like Griffin, for example,

322
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,840
how would you make it up to someone if say you reformatted a PlayStation memory card and erase

323
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,920
someone's final fantasy seven game when they were moments away from beating the game and they'd put

324
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,680
like a hundred hours into it? How would you make that up to someone? And say they like collected

325
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:06,160
everyone's like final weapons and, and final limit breaks. Um, and they were very, very close to

326
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,520
beating the game and you reformatted the card. How would you make that up to them? I think,

327
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:15,040
I think setting them free from their Japanese role playing game prison that their mind had

328
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,520
been in their, their, their teenage, their, their vulnerable teenage mind had been imprisoned in

329
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,840
instead of like going around and like having sex with, with women and like, you know, making friends

330
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,880
and forging lifelong memories and friendships and like go into the football game and tailgating and

331
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,480
like getting in trouble and like, you know, staying out after curfew and like doing all

332
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,240
this shit from that Jack and Diane song. I think that that's a fucking reward in and of itself.

333
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,000
So you're saying that the action itself was a kindness.

334
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,320
Yes. I'm saying, I'm saying you had a very serious addiction

335
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,160
and I swooped in there like John Quinones. Maybe an option is to tell your brother

336
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,920
that you realized that that card was an idol to him and now shall have no false idols above

337
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,240
thy Lord God. So you were trying to save his immortal soul by destroying that card,

338
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,280
which he worshiped. Yeah. That's, that's precisely it, man. The ending of that game is so fucking

339
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,120
good though. I fucking hate you so much. I, you know what, man, I would still be angry too.

340
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,800
That card is so rare. It's like the kids in my middle school who had that card,

341
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,280
it was like a fucking status symbol. It had nothing to do with the value on a chain around

342
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,440
their necks. It had nothing to do with the value of the card. It had to do with like

343
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,840
the triumph. Cause cause you say it's worth $50, but it's actually worth however much money he

344
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,920
spent on Pokemon cards to get that card. Which was, which was probably in the thousands. I think

345
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,560
what you're going to have to do is name your first born child Charizard foil. I'm sorry.

346
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:59,920
Yeah. And then let your sister tear them in half. That's the wisdom of Solomon right there, Justin.

347
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,280
Here's okay. I can make this very easy for you. It is not a problem. Go to eBay. I just did it

348
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:14,080
for you. Type Charizard card and it's $30. Okay. Just grab one for $30. Do you understand the

349
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,240
difference? You get it. You throw it in his face and say they were square. Well, no. Tear it in

350
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,240
front of him again. This is my card. You can tear it in half now if you want. There's a Pokemon

351
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,760
Charizard first edition base set shadowless card graded PSA eight near mint hollow. You can get

352
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,680
that for $750 on eBay right now. One thing I do want to say about this listing is that 15 people

353
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:45,840
are looking at it an hour according to eBay, which is a great short story in and of itself.

354
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:54,960
There's 15 people are like, Oh, I'm going to get you. I'm sorely tempted. I fucking cashed out

355
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:05,040
way too soon. I fucking got out of this more out of this trade craft way too early, like a decade

356
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,920
too early. You know, but Griffin for every dude who got out of Pokemon is too early. There's a

357
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,080
dude who's just, there's like 30 dudes who are just sitting on pogs being like, they're coming

358
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:18,080
back. Here they come. This sweet Wolverine slammer. It's going to be worth something when he comes

359
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:23,280
out. I think I read a story in the examiner like a month or so ago about this family that spent

360
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,160
like 50, 50 G's, like 50 large stacks on, um, on Beanie Babies. And the headline was family regrets

361
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:37,440
amount of money they spend on Beanie Babies. Yeah, no shit dog. Like that's, that seems pretty,

362
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,000
I don't think you need that in 18 point font. Like I think, I think that's pretty,

363
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,400
I watched the little video that company that is a little documentary, uh, that accompanied that

364
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,080
and the dad who was sort of the driving force had his t-shirt on and I said, bankrupted by Beanie's.

365
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,480
Mm-hmm. And I think that he probably got it when Beanie's were popular and he could wear it and

366
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,720
other Beanie fans would be like, oh you. And now it's like literal. No, no, no, no, no. Listen,

367
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,280
I've been literally bankrupted by Beanie's. I brought so much shame to my family. It seems

368
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,960
almost accused. We've been eating Beanie Babies. We've been eating the beans that are inside of

369
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,800
them. It seems almost accusatory, doesn't it? That like you can't like fucking blame this on the

370
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,400
banking bust. Like somebody, all the banks sold me these predatory Beanie Baby futures. Like no,

371
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,320
you dumb shit. Like the Beanie Baby bubble is busted. Yeah. I can't, I can't deal with Pokemon

372
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,080
cards right now because I'm going to get the $750 one for Griffin for the birthday. What do you do

373
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:41,520
with a $750 Pokemon card after you buy it? Tear it in half and feel more powerful. You can.

374
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:50,640
It's me. It's Jay Z coming over the crib tonight. We're tearing in half $750 Pokemon card. Everybody

375
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,440
that walks in gets to tear in half a rare Pokemon card. We're using some as coasters.

376
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:00,960
We're eating some. I got a, I got a holofoil Jigglypuff I got from, from the launch of the

377
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,600
first movie back in 2001. We're going to roll a J with it. It's going to taste fucking gross

378
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,760
because I don't know what they put in holofoil. I bet like nickel and shit. We're never going to

379
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:26,480
afford these cards if we don't get rich. I want to tell you guys about my hot new podcast that

380
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,000
I don't make, but I heard about it's called, you're taking over. I'm taking it over. Check

381
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,680
out Justin McElroy's ninjas versus podcast on iTunes. And you can go head to arcade comedy

382
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,680
theater.com. This ninjas versus podcast is a weekly comedy debate show and they're performing

383
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:51,840
their first ever live show at the arcade comedy theater in Pittsburgh. Ninjas versus podcast

384
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,800
consists of three friends deliberating burning queries like Mumford and Sons versus Sanford and

385
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,400
Son and which is better, great comedic timing or great comedic miming. This show is going to be

386
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,760
August 15th, 9 PM. You're going to have to pay five bucks and there's free beer. So that's the

387
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,520
yeah. Mission is $5 and there's free beer. Yes. So what this is, is an ad from us to you for $5 beer

388
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,120
that you can drink. All you can drink. Well, they didn't say that. It could just be like,

389
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,520
like a Dixie cup. You show up and they give you like a Dixie cup of a Pilsner,

390
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,080
but that's probably so that's either way you're going to be laughing and that's maybe that's why

391
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,920
you can drink too. Maybe we've had like gastric bypass. Uh, maybe you're going to have a gluten

392
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,320
sensitivity. Become a fan beforehand. Good. Uh, ninjas versus podcast on iTunes. And then when

393
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,560
you're ready, heading over to arcade comedy theater to get some, uh, details on the show.

394
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,560
And even if you don't like the show, $5 all you can drink. You can listen to a podcast in the

395
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,840
background where you get blasted. Well, why not? I mean, I don't think they appreciate us saying

396
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,000
you can drown them out over the sounds of your own gulping because then what you might find is,

397
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,040
oh wait, I love this. You'll, you'll be too busy guzzling to laugh at the jokes.

398
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,520
No, I'm sure it's speaking of guzzling speaking of God, worst one ever speaking of guzzling

399
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,120
extremistrace.com is your adult super store. Oh, I don't want to guzzle up the savings. Yeah,

400
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm sure that's what it is. Yeah, that's what you meant. Travis, uh, extremistrace.com is

401
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,560
my favorite website for adult toys. I personally, uh, want to recommend this to you. Here's,

402
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,360
here's what I wanted to feature this week. The oppressor chastity device. Now what this does is

403
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:47,280
it hurts your wiener, but here's the other thing. It can also hurt your butt with a little spherical

404
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:55,760
ball, uh, that you, I think you sit on it and it can go in your butt and hold your wiener wherever

405
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,440
you want to feel unpleasant. One, one word to you, one word to you, butt sphere. Good luck getting in

406
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:10,240
there. Good luck. Have nice, have a good time trying, but, uh, I think you're going to find

407
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:18,880
it pretty difficult there. I tell you the item that I, now that I've received some, uh, things

408
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:26,160
from extremistrace.com as a, uh, in paid spokesperson, I think the one thing that they need,

409
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:34,320
uh, that they don't seem to sell, at least not that I've seen is secret box, which is these look

410
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,760
great when they're on your wiener and in your butt, but they can't always be there. So I need

411
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:49,440
them to invest in like secret horror compartments that I, no one can access and no one can know

412
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,320
about like, what if it was, what if it was just like camouflage things where it's like, this looks

413
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,400
like a flower pot, but what's that? It's your anal beads. Yeah. What, what if little, little Susie

414
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,520
and little Tim Tim are searching around for Christmas presents and what did they find?

415
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:11,360
The opposite of Christmas presents. Oh, what if it's just a box that says vegetables then?

416
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:23,280
Vegetable taxes, they sell a little box with a printed out piece of paper that says vegetable

417
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,760
taxes. Here's the thing is that they're in my house right now in my home where I live. There's

418
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,560
an, there's a foot long plastic dick that's four inches around and I've hidden it as best I can.

419
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,920
But let's say this, if anybody comes by my house and they need a tote bag, I hope they don't pick

420
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,720
that one. Or what if there's a fire and later they're cleaning up all of the stuff, the wreckage

421
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,480
and they move, you know, a burned chair and boom, there's a big unburned dick. Yeah. Oh, by the way,

422
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,200
everything sold at Extreme Restraints is completely inflammable. They should make airplanes out of

423
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,440

425
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,000
Snowden, for not leaking our shit. We really, really appreciate it.

426
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm Cameron Esposito and I'm the host of Maximum Fun's new podcast, Wham Bam Pow,

427
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,680
a sci-fi movie show and action movies. Also, did I forget to say action movies?

428
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,120
Every week I'll be joined by Mr. Ricky Carmona and Ms. Ria Butcher and we are going to chat about

429
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,720
films. We're going to tell jokes. We're going to be hilarious. We're going to play games. We're

430
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,560
going to have guests. We're going to give reviews. It's going to blow your mind. If you want to

431
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,840
listen to the show, you can find it at MaximumFun.org or you can subscribe on iTunes. Can you believe

432
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:53,760
how many things I just listed? So many things. Wham! That's great.

433
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:01,680
Hey guys, I'm feeling kind of rural right now. Oh, good. Yeah. And you know what that means.

434
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:10,080
It's time for farm wisdom. Farm wisdom. Pick up your pitchfork and fork a pitch. Farm wisdom.

435
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,840
Um, somebody accused you of stealing that shit. Did you see that? Somebody,

436
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,240
somebody put you on blast on Twitter. What did I steal it from? One of those, uh, Perry,

437
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:28,080
Perry Ellis songs. Now who's the guy who did the baby monkey riding backwards on a pig.

438
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,960
Yeah. Like all his songs sounded like that, but it's my song. I don't think he has one called farm

439
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:38,880
wisdom. I mean, no, but like the melody music melody, you can't claim music and lyrics by

440
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,160
Justin McElroy on that anymore in the credits of the podcast. I'm, I've been meaning to put

441
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,840
credit to the end of the podcast, but now I'm not even going to start guys. Did Travis,

442
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,440
Travis farm wisdom hit me? I'm ready. Did you know that farmers feed magnets to their cows

443
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,360
in order to prevent or treat hardware disease? Holy shit. Hardware disease is just like it sounds

444
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:06,400
when a cow eats a piece of hardware, a nail screw, a piece of barbed wire and get sick.

445
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,200
When you feed the cows, the magnet usually drops into the reticulum compartment of the stomach

446
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,080
and attracts any metal. The cow ate and the stomach muscles contract to help move food around

447
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,160
loose metal can puncture through the stomach wall and traveled to other areas of the body

448
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,720
and have been found puncturing the heart. The magnet helps keep the metal safely in the stomach

449
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,840
and that's from Jess. Okay. Wait a minute. Stop farmers. That's a pretty smart idea.

450
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:34,080
What's not so smart is calling that a disease guys. That's not a disease.

451
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,440
They squat. How dumb are you farmers? I thought you guys were on point.

452
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,480
Hard diseases are terms. That's not a disease. You swallowed a nail.

453
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,200
You just call like hardware. Oopsie. When I get stabbed, I don't say I have knife items.

454
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,120
I can't come in today. I've got a very, very bad case of knife.

455
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,520
Uh, this other one, I forget who actually always reads these traps. Always read them.

456
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,000
I'll let Griffin read the second one.

457
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,240
Mountain lions will chase down and murder anything that tries to run away from them.

458
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,400
Fuck. If you try, uh, if you find yourself being stalked by one, stand your ground,

459
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,320
maintain eye contact, make as much noise as possible. Start masturbating very, very, very fast.

460
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,480
Mountain lions hate masturbators. They are scared of, they are scared of,

461
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,400
they're scared of it. Humans do it. Never turn your back, uh, bend over or crouch down in any

462
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,600
circumstances. All this stuff about masturbation was fake. Sorry. Why?

463
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,560
It's a fucking dominant, it's a fucking dominant thing.

464
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,920
I see a mountain lion. That's Jordan by the way. Thanks Jordan.

465
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,600
I see a mountain lion and my reaction is to turn around and bend over.

466
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,000
Is this what you want? Is this what you want, mountain lion?

467
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,400
You like that hiding? Good luck! Super fucking tight!

468
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
I wasted like $20 on SherwoodShanks.com trying to find something to go in there.

469
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,320
I also, I feel like this is one of those pieces of advice that's like really great to hear.

470
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,840
If I see a mountain lion, what's not going to through my, go through my brain is,

471
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,840
now is the time to not run away.

472
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,600
Now's the time to prove, to prove, you got something to prove to this cougar.

473
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,840
I am not going to make eye contact with that mountain lion and I'm not going to say anything.

474
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,240
I'm going to be running and pooping my pants.

475
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,960
No, what you're going to do, Travis, is you're going to start taking your dick out and you'd

476
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,320
be like, wait, which was the real thing?

477
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:38,720
Ah, fuck. I just doomed Travis. Maybe, maybe mountain lions really don't like it.

478
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,200
Another hiker claimed by mountain lion masturbation disease.

479
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,920
You could probably, you could probably creep a mountain lion out pretty solidly that way.

480
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,760
Hey, whoa, whoa. Oh, I didn't say stop.

481
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,520
My, you guys want to Yahoo? Yeah, please.

482
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,920
This Yahoo was sent in by Ira Ray. Are you Ira Ray?

483
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,960
Who wants to know? It's asked by Yahoo answer. She's your question mark.

484
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,800
Another one. Another one claimed.

485
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,800
Can a 27 year old sign up for high school again?

486
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,400
I want to see if I can go back to high school. I have a car and bigger muscles now,

487
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,120
so I think I'll be more popular the second time around and I've always wanted to be prom king.

488
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,840
So what do I need to go back to high school?

489
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,360
Is this buzz marketing for 21 Jump Street?

490
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,120
I'm getting, I'm getting my masters in high school. I'm getting my post grad in high school.

491
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,560
What you need is a teaching certificate.

492
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:47,040
And then you can go back as a teacher. I guess that's true.

493
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,280
Yeah, that's the only way you can go like that and then beat up all the people who are mean to you.

494
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,360
I guess there's no loophole where you can, like, I recognize now at the age of 26 when I finished,

495
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,560
unless I go back for some, some master's program, which doesn't seem likely, like I've done all the

496
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:07,120
school I'm going to do. And it's only now that I realized like, man, I actually like learning like

497
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,040
fuck. I wish I'd paid attention to like anything. Yeah, I feel that way too. Now I'm, now that I'm

498
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:18,880
older, I'm like reading books to teach myself. I'm like trying to teach myself like complex

499
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,280
subjects that are impossible to teach yourself. And I'm like, man, if only I had fucking like

500
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,360
done anything, like any amount of work instead of just like the requisite shit to get by.

501
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,400
I think college should be something you get to do in installments. Cause that way you really

502
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,920
appreciate it. Cause as you get older, you, you want to learn. I like learning now. Back then I

503
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,680
hated waking up more. I think that after like when you complete your sophomore year, someone should

504
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,440
sit you down and be like, are you appreciating this? And you're like, yeah, I'm not. I'm probably

505
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,560
not. I'm like, okay, great. Cool. Cool. Cool. Um, just go off for a while. And, uh, when you do

506
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,920
appreciate this, we'll welcome you back. But Trav, you can't put that gene like that. If there's a

507
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,120
definition of what adulthood is, it's realizing that you didn't appreciate stuff enough. Cause

508
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:09,280
that's it. Cause if you could figure out how to turn back time and do that easy stuff again,

509
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,640
cause like, let's be honest, going to college for all its ups and downs is a lot easier than having

510
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:24,480
a job. Yeah. So what if, what if we start giving jobs to 12 year olds and then you work from 12 to

511
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:32,320
21 and then you get to go back to school? What if the only jobs that we give them are college

512
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:44,400
professors? I think your best bet is to procreate and then you and your child get into a very loud

513
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,680
and public fight in front of a gypsy and they freaky Friday you. That's just one of many options

514
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,280
you have. And then at the end of the movie, the gypsy is like, you learned your lessons,

515
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,320
time to switch you back. And it's like, actually, you know, I'm actually like, I'm like pretty cool

516
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,240
actually. As is our second big freaky Friday reference though. I think we referenced it like

517
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,560
10 episodes ago. Cause I think that in reality, every adult wants to be fucking 16. That's the

518
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,680
greatest lie of all. Cause if you're, if you're a kid again, it's like, Whoa, okay, I'm going to go

519
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:28,240
on the run now and let my teenager die in my old body. Fuck you, dad. Enjoy taxes, bitch. Enjoy

520
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,600
vegetables and or taxes, but don't look in the vegetable taxes box. Oh God. That would be the

521
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,760
only reason to switch back. Cause you're afraid of your child adult finding your vegetable taxes box.

522
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,760
All right, dad, son, it's tight. It's April. I really need to E file.

523
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:49,120
Where are they at? Where's the documents? I'm still trying to learn about documents.

524
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:58,800
Um, I don't do this. Don't go to a high school like you are as you are now as a man,

525
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:05,280
you won't, you won't be allowed in. They won't let you in like you are now you're old and they'll

526
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:11,680
know. They'll know that you, that you don't want to do great things there. So don't even, I wouldn't

527
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,680
even try. It probably seems like a good idea in the brain. Um, but I'm pretty sure hindsight is

528
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,880
going to be 20, 20 on this particular thing that you want to do. That's terrible. Especially when

529
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,440
you're on 2020. And they're like, what were you thinking? And you're like, you know, in hindsight,

530
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,800
this grown man tried to wear a Justin Bieber t-shirt and go back to high school.

531
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,320
What would you do? What would it, but fucking, what if he went four years and made to senior

532
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:45,440
prom and he was in the running and then like two days before, like, I don't know, some,

533
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,720
some kid lost his legs that it was also in the running, lost his legs in some sort of

534
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,680
industrial accident. And this guy's like, fuck, like I spent four years for this day.

535
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,280
And this is the worst day of my life. And this kid's going to fucking swoop in at the last

536
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,040
second. He probably won't be swooping. Like some sort of legless Tarzan.

537
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,360
Yeah. Son of a bitch on the plus side. Got to do it again. Do it again. Start all over in a

538
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:14,720
different town plus side. I'm sick at times tables and my cursive is off the chart. It's fucking

539
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,400
insane. They don't do cursive actually anymore. I don't think in schools. That's why no one writes

540
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,480
checks anymore. Yeah. It's state by state. Actually, I think that's no, that's no bullshit.

541
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,080
I think it's state by state. I was terrible. I got seat at why did that have to drag down my,

542
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,280
my GPA that I had a bad handwriting grade. I don't think that that is, I don't think that

543
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,480
factored in. It did. Justin is a mathematical genius, but he has some trouble with the cursive

544
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,800
lowercase z. 2.2. I just don't think that because I was bad at math and writing and Jim. Oh man,

545
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:56,880
was I bad grades in gym. When you say bad at gym, you mean you don't, you like weren't so psyched

546
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,680
about like having your dick out around other kids, right? That's right. I, you were supposed to dress

547
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,760
out every day and I didn't want to cause I was fat. So what I did was I wore sweatpants to school

548
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:10,080
every day. Cool. That was, that was, that was playing the short game. That's what they call

549
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:15,440
that. That was the short game I was playing. Hey, let's ask another question before. Ain't that

550
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,920
fucked up that your GPA was dependent on your ability to get your dick out around other people.

551
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,000
That's kind of fucked up, isn't it? Like, Hey, Hey McElroy, go take your dick out in a room

552
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,320
full of your peers. Though I will say that was the only thing that trained me for any real life

553
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:33,840
situations in adulthood where you had to get your dick out. I mean, it trained me in sense that like

554
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,600
when I'm an adult now and somebody says, Hey McElroy, take your dick out. I know now to say

555
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:43,360
like, no bad touch. No, no, thank you. Absolutely not. I don't think also I'm better at badminton.

556
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,080
That's true. My boyfriend and I wanted to know what is the socially acceptable age group for

557
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:52,880
visiting a petting zoo. We don't have any kids, but he really likes animals. They have reindeer.

558
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:00,720
That's from Zany and Zaftig at the zoo. Don't reindeer give you a... Reindeer disease? No,

559
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,520
they give you a, like their, their, their horns have, ah fuck, what's it called? When your skin

560
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:12,400
falls off. What? Fertilizing fasciitis? Um, no. Leprosy. Leprosy. Yeah. The Bible shit.

561
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,680
Are you telling me reindeer have leprosy on their horns? They're just carriers? I don't

562
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,040
think it's like, I don't think it like they're affected by it or else fucking

563
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,840
every Christmas tale ever would be like a horrifying saw-esque experience. Um, but yeah,

564
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,320
I think they have, I think they give you leprosy if you like touch their, their antlers are coated

565
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,800
in leprosy. So, okay, let's assume that the reindeer antlers have been de-leprosied and try

566
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,240
to answer the question. I don't think you can. I think it's like a natural excretion.

567
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,360
I don't think when they're born, somebody comes, the fucking leprosy fairy gives them their only

568
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:55,840
coating of leprosy. Like what kind of fucking sense does that make? Idiot. That's our reindeer

569
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:02,400
like moose in that every season, like their antlers fall off and regrow. I don't think that's

570
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,160
real either. That that's true with moose every year. That's why they have leprosy. It's what

571
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:12,560
causes their shit to fall off. Oh, it makes their horns fall off their antlers, please.

572
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:18,240
That's why reindeer are known as God's funniest joke. These things are beautiful. I'm going to

573
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:27,600
put leprosy in them somewhere. Good luck, Santa. Why does God hate Santa so much? He's trying to

574
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:33,200
like take over. That's true. Do you think every animal has a place where it can get leprosy?

575
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:43,200
Where's your leprosy compartment? Oh God. Yeah, you can't. If it's a regular zoo,

576
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,560
mm hmm. If it's a if it's a petting zoo inside of a regular zoo and like you're an adult there,

577
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,240
I think it's OK because like parents will see you and be like, oh, they're being ironic.

578
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:01,200
Here's the thing. I think that the answer is as long as you are paired off, there is no problem.

579
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:08,480
If you are by yourself, that's yeah, that's a completely different case. Like because here's

580
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,840
the thing. OK, real life experience. Me by myself, like, you know, making faces at a baby

581
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,080
creeps people out. I'm a grown man with a beard and I'm making faces of their children.

582
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:26,160
But if Teresa's standing next to me, it's adorable. But isn't that true for literally any situation?

583
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:32,000
Like any time you see a dude by himself anywhere, don't you just like and like instinctually like,

584
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,720
oh, he's fucking creeping on someone. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's like as long as

585
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,200
you're coupled out, you're safe. I think that's part of our fucking I think it's part of the

586
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,960
genetic human experience. I think that's why we seek out partners to like make it through life.

587
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,240
So when people see us, they're not instantly skis. Now, that's a hundred percent true. If I

588
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,440
that's we we try to talk about I think we try to tear down gender walls here on my brother,

589
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:02,560
my brother and me. The one I can't help is that if I see a woman standing by herself, I think,

590
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:07,680
well, she's probably working or waiting for someone or just relaxing. If I see a guy by

591
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,160
himself, I immediately who is he trying to fuck? Is he trying to fuck me? I hope not trying to

592
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,800
kill somebody or fuck somebody or steal something or. Yeah, I just assume he's going to punch me.

593
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,440
I don't know why, but like every time I see just like a random dude, I'm like, I'm going to get in

594
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,840
a fight with you. Do you know why? Do you know why? It's because that like speaking from experience,

595
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,840
like whenever I'm out somewhere alone, the only thing I'm thinking about is, man, I hope nobody

596
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:35,040
thinks I'm going to fuck somebody or kill someone. And when you do that, you put on a grimace on your

597
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,040
face that just like screams like, here it comes. Get ready. I think there is one circumstance in

598
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:46,480
which being coupled out does not protect you from judgment. What's that? And it is if you are at a

599
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,320
children's playground, coupled out, no kids. Then that's an easy fix, though. That's no problem.

600
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,760
Just all you got. And this I was actually going to suggest this for the petting zoo.

601
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,240
When you're at the petting zoo, every three minutes or so, just go Dylan and then look around.

602
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,720
Don't put your fingers in its mouth, Dylan. Just like you don't know where he is. Dylan,

603
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,560
get back here. Don't do that if you're the only two people there, though, with the farmer.

604
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,840
Or if there's like two parents and two kids and you're like, Dylan, and they're like,

605
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,480
I can clearly see. If the law of large numbers is not in your favor, then don't.

606
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,960
If that happens, you have to carry out the con and keep screaming and just lose your mind

607
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:29,120
and call the police. There's only one other family there with one kid. They're like,

608
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:34,800
man, their kid is super lost. I haven't seen that kid in the whole time I've been here.

609
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:43,440
Fuck. How did you fuck up this bad? I haven't seen another kid in like three hours.

610
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,000
What have you been fucking doing? Why have you not widened the perimeter of your search?

611
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,800
So we got super into this goat for like three hours. Oh, we fucked up so bad.

612
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,600
What if our kid got leprosy so bad he just dissolved? Ah, fuck, man.

613
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,720
Listen, we didn't find him this week. We'll have to come back next weekend

614
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,920
at approximately the same time, pet some more animals, just hope for the best.

615
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,840
Also, how much is that vending machine that gives you pellets you can feed this in?

616
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:15,600
Just a quarter? That's a really good deal. Do you have some kind of season pass

617
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,960
so we can just keep coming back here unrestricted to look for our sweet Dylan?

618
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,360
This is the last place he saw us. He'll return here.

619
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,080
Oh, we're so exhausted from looking for our Dylan for like three hours.

620
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,520
We're just going to pet this goat for a bit.

621
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,600
We're really stressed out. Do you guys have any like treats or anything you could give us?

622
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:35,680
Don't you fucking judge us for giving up on the search so quickly. We're tired.

623
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,880
And these animals are soft. Let me just touch this goose for a second.

624
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:45,120
I'm just going to touch it for a second. Can you get off? Sorry, I'm not Miss Perfect.

625
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:51,440
Sorry, you know where your kids are, okay? Pet dad of the year.

626
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:58,480
What if this same family is there every time you're there, every weekend, and they're like,

627
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,800
yeah, yeah. After two years, like, yeah, fucking sure, there's a Dylan.

628
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:08,480
And then on like year five, a pre-teen with a stubbly beard comes running out of the woods,

629
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,480
like, mom, dad. I was in the bathroom.

630
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,520
I was in the bathroom for five years. Got a goat in there.

631
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,760
I've been living off toilet paper. He taught me, taught me to read.

632
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,800
Not like raised by toilet paper. I mean, like he ate it.

633
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,240
No, I meant like there's a goat. So you're saying he would become sort of

634
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,920
like a Tarzan figure. Yeah.

635
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,840
But the only thing he'd be great at is peeing and watching people pee

636
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:38,960
and not be seen watching people pee. This family would eventually put it together like,

637
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:46,800
like what if the bathroom monster is Dylan? Hey guys, have you been in the bathroom?

638
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,120
Cause there's like a totally crazy kid in there.

639
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:59,040
How you've been here every weekend for five years and you haven't gone to the bathroom.

640
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,680
We go before the goats know the goats know where you have to go.

641
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,640
And like, they don't like it. We should have checked the bathroom though.

642
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,480
In retrospect, that was our fault. That was our fault.

643
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,000
It's like the only building here. It's like the only building.

644
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,440
Now if you'll skewer this, we have to try to re indoctrinate our son

645
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,560
in the society, keep him out of the back. Has anyone seen him?

646
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,680
We're going to restart the search, I guess.

647
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:31,280
Let me just go over to the reindeer pen for like two or three hours more.

648
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,000
But then that family catches you in the parking lot paying off the actor.

649
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,120
You've paid to live in a bathroom for five years. Wait a minute.

650
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,160
I wonder what happened to Zachary Ty Bryant.

651
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:51,840
He would make a great doctor who now that he's fucking feral.

652
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,440
Now he's a feral bathroom monster. Hey, listen, everybody.

653
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,520
Thank you so much for listening to our, our program. We hope, uh, we hope you enjoyed it.

654
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,360
Um, thanks to so many people tweeting about the show.

Nikki the rat, bourbon ghost, everybody. Thank you so much.

659
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,960
I sure appreciate you tweeting about the show and sharing it.

664
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:58,000
Um, seriously, everybody, thank you for the warm response to the, um, to the, to the clip

665
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,240
we did last week. I think people seem to enjoy it because a lot of that shit is like apocryphal

666
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:08,720
at this point. Um, we may do, we make the good news is if we do another one, the sound quality

667
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:14,400
will be better. Man, seriously, like how the fuck did anybody start listening? Like it sounded so,

668
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,200
so awful. Um, yeah, we made, I'm glad you guys replaced the original Travis.

669
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,280
Yeah, I sound totally like, I sound like, like a hundred times nerdy here. I don't know what

670
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:31,600
happened. Um, we may, we may do more of those. Maybe there's going to be a lot of traveling and

671
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:37,360
wedding shit over the next few months. So I hope we don't because what started out as a clever plan

672
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:45,200
to save myself from having to, uh, work on a new episode turned into like a 10 hour project where

673
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:51,120
I was going through every old episode, trying to find something not awful. Yeah. Trying to find

674
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:57,360
something worthwhile. Um, so, so thank you. I'm glad you liked it. Um, I want to remind everybody

675
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:04,480
that this is the last week to help out our buddy Trist in the Marine. Uh, we are working with, uh,

676
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:12,000
operations supply drop to, uh, bring him and his, uh, his, his fellow soldiers, his brothers in

677
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,320
arms and sisters in arms, if you will, uh, some, some games and cool stuff. Uh, this is the last

678
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:24,320
week to donate. We really want to make a big push, big showing a huge thanks to James Bromwell. Who's

679
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:32,480
going to ship out a game cube and, and controllers, uh, to, uh, to, to the guys. They, they were very

680
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:37,440
much wanting some retro stuff. So we're getting that in their hands. We've got $380 raised right

681
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,760
now from 12 contributors. I know we can do better than that. Bambinos. I'd love if we could just

682
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,840
like really blow it out. Let's blow it out. Really show us some support. If you've been waiting,

683
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,880
this is the time. Go to operationsupplydrop.com. Look for modern era. There's a button on the front

684
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:59,600
page, uh, and, and donate to that so we can, uh, help those guys out. Um, they're fighting for your

685
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:05,600
fucking freedoms. So just, I don't want to guilt you, but they're fighting for your fucking freedom.

686
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:11,360
So there's another donation on there right now. That's beating us by $75. And I just want to

687
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:19,760
dominate. I want us to be the greatest podcast ever. Create an enormous divide in the military

688
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:26,400
of like, I want those dudes to see what we did for Tristan and his pals and be like, fuck,

689
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,680
like we should have backed that horse. We should have listened to that podcast.

690
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:36,240
Oh, it looks like we got another one. Uh, DJ Lockhead, uh, from, uh, said on the Facebook

691
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,160
that he was going to send them a game cube and some controllers to smash brothers too. So we're,

692
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:47,040
we're going to be hooking those dudes up. Uh, and you can, you can help out operationsupplydrop.com.

693
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:53,600
Go there right now. This is your last chance and, uh, and help. Um, it's very easy and it's awesome.

694
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,760
So, um, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme song,

695
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,840
which is the song. It's a departure, which is off the album, putting the days to bed.

696
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:09,920
Um, go buy it, buy it on Amazon, then buy it on iTunes. Um, and then erase it and then buy it

697
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,480
again. Yeah. Just keep, keep doing that like every week. And that's your hail Mary for the week.

698
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,600
Uh, thank you so much, Griffin. I believe you have a last question for us.

699
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,760
Sure. To enjoy, uh, this Yahoo, this final Yahoo was sent by Crystal Whalen. Thank you,

700
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:32,880
Christa. It's by Yasu Yasu's answers. It's by Azu's answers. It's by, um, Pawnee Mahajan who

701
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:43,680
says, I love green day very much. Where do you live? I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy,

702
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:58,480
