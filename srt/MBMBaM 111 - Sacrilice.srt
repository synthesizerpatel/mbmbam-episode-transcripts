1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,120
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:51,040
Hello, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, and Me. I am Justin McElroy.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
I'm Travis McElroy. What? What's going on?

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,640
Hello Griffin, I believe this is a podcast. You see, when I was-

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Justin, what is this new character?

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,960
It's like some sort of like, if John Waters was living in a cave for two decades.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,280
No, while I was, I've been without electricity for a week,

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,760
and while I was without electricity, I started reading books.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,680
Oh, I, okay, so this is, this is books, man.

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,320
This is educated Justin.

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
This is your, this is your brain on books. This is what they do.

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
So in your mind, this is what educated people sound like?

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,920
They, I, in, in circles, I am in electoral circles. This is what my friends and I,

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
this is how we speak.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
Justin, I want you to know, I picture you right now surrounded by bookcases,

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
but your brain has swollen and you just have like a giant forehead.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Tell me.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,760
I have become top heavy.

22
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,320
With this voice, did you inherit a proclivity for going to community pools and not swimming?

23
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,960
Just sort of standing on the sidelines and just sort of soaking it in, soaking into you.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,680
I have, let me put it this way.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,760
I have memorized the different popsicle flavors available at the concessions.

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh no.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,120
It is, yes.

28
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,120
It's very, in part, everyone's trying to beat the heat, they say.

29
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,560
But without electricity, I was not able to watch my programs.

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
I was not able to play video games.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,240
And I was forced to read, and now I've been exposed to all the great culture of the world.

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
How, how sallow is your skin?

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
Can you give me some sort of sallowness rating?

34
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
It looks like an orange fruit.

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

36
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,400
Did you get book jaundice?

37
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,120
What happened?

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,360
No, he was just reading books and eating carrots the entire time.

39
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,720
As they ran out of power, they had to eat their stock of baby carrots.

40
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,920
I was forced, I was forced to eat the butterflies I've preserved over the years behind glass.

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:24,720
Nutritionally devoid, but surprisingly very pleasing to the palate.

42
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,080
All that voice wants to do is eat something beautiful.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
So this is our advice program.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,720
My brother, my brother and me will dole out intellectual conversational advice.

46
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
He writes hard right.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,160
What is this voice doing?

48
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,040
I think he was just, I think he's turning into a condor also.

49
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,360
It's bucking underneath me.

50
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,480
Bucking wildly.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,120
It wants desperately to go to Scar's garden.

52
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,240
I won't let it.

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm holding onto the reins as sadly as I can.

54
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,640
Oh God, it's devolved into Ed Grimley.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,000
Somebody help me.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
I think it started at Grimley and went down from there.

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
Started at Grimley and went down from there.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Hey everybody, this is our advice show.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,840
I've been exposed to the internet now for 15 minutes and I'm dumb again.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,320
That's enough time fooling.

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Let's get deep into the advice.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,000
You know, that was the original title for Back to the Future.

63
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,000
Time fooling with your buddies, Dr. Doc.

64
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
Dr. Doc and Marty McMarty.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,080
And Martin.

66
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,320
Martin, one of the characters in Dawson's Creek is this hyper literate bartender who

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
it's a very good will hunting sort of vibe, especially since they're in Boston.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,120
And he wears exactly Marty McFly's outfit and no one ever comments on it.

69
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
He was fully wearing like orange vest with blue denim shirt.

70
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,560
And like no one calls him out like, hey, you're dressed like Marty McFly.

71
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Get it together, Dawson's Creek bartender.

72
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,680
Um, let's all, let's thank, thank you.

73
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,600
Thank you listeners for being so patient with us after we got so, so blasted by the derache.

74
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
The derache took me down.

75
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,800
The derache just, it, it, it kissed Travis.

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,760
I didn't see it.

77
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,680
You know what, let's do the first question.

78
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,040
Cause I think it'll tie in.

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,280
Okay.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
What do you do in case of a prolonged power outage to stay sane?

81
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,760
I've been drinking, playing guitar and reading dark tower graphic novels by daylight,

82
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
but daylight is waning.

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
However, I'd rather be playing video games or editing a podcast help.

84
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,040
Board games are not an option and I have no light by which to read.

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
That's from Cole Ross.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
Now, Cole Ross, I know that you are in Cincinnati because you came to our live show.

87
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
So we lost power here.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't know, two, three days.

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,720
Like we, we were without it in my home for about nine hours and there were people in

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,200
town that were without it for three or four days.

91
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
And Justin, you went without it for.

92
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
It came back.

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,520
It went out Friday at, let me describe to you the store.

94
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,080
Cause like, I think people hear like a storm and they think like, oh, this was like nothing

95
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
I've ever seen before.

96
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
We were driving downtown to go to a black sheep, the delightful burrito place in the

97
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,480
downtown Huntington area and it literally looked like this wall of black clouds that

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,880
were, that were moving sort of swiftly towards us.

99
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,480
But as you got downtown there on third Avenue, there's like a, it's sort of industrial

100
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
right next to the university.

101
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,120
And there are like these dust clouds blowing from the industrial thing and like making

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,720
it almost impossible to see.

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,600
And then all of a sudden like a paper starts flying everywhere and rocks and like signs

104
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
are blowing over.

105
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
And I mean, it, it took, it did like some serious damage in some parts of this.

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,280
I mean, it took out like there are whole signs that were pulled off and like the the sporting

107
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,480
goods store glens, like it tore its whole awning off.

108
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,680
Like it was crazy.

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,840
We were getting hit with 90 mile an hour winds.

110
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,720
It flipped a plane in Charles at the Charleston airport.

111
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,560
And they had to like get a crew to come pick it up.

112
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,440
It was insane.

113
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,200
So like we have not only do we not have the infrastructure for that, like we don't have

114
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,880
power lines underneath the ground or anything.

115
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,200
We have like, it hit so many places that we couldn't just like call better states and

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,120
be like, Hey, are we done?

117
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,400
We done did it again guys.

118
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,160
Ready to take on our refugees.

119
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,720
Yeah.

120
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Please come bring us ice and skull.

121
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Bring us snooze.

122
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Sweet snooze from Kentucky.

123
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
I need snooze from Kentucky.

124
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,600
And they're like, listen, we got our own derecho related problems over here.

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
You can't have our snooze.

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
So that was crazy.

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,120
And I was without power for it.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
And I didn't.

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,120
This shows you how like dependent I am on the grid.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,920
I didn't even realize that you could be without power for a week.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:16,400
I guess I just assumed like President Obama would come save me or something like, listen,

132
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
this has gone far enough.

133
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,120
Let's go save Justin.

134
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,600
Up to this point, whenever I lost power, I always pictured it like when you blow a breaker

135
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,040
and you have to like go down to the basement and there's just a giant switch somewhere

136
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,480
that somebody in a hard hat goes over and they got to pull it down and push it back

137
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:30,960
up.

138
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah.

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,800
And then power kicks back on.

140
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,440
When I was growing up and we used to lose power and like we would call the power company.

141
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:44,160
I don't know why, but it always occurred to me that they would go, Oh, Oh, I had no idea.

142
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,560
Okay.

143
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,160
Well, I guess we'll check it out.

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,720
You mean the thing that we supply to the state?

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
The thing, the only thing that we supply to the state, we're not doing it?

146
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,040
The one product we produce.

147
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
Oh, I'm glad you told us because we don't have meters.

148
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,520
Be the dude who answers the phone when you lose power to like an entire eastern seaboard.

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,120
I don't know if you know this, but there's no power.

150
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,000
Like, yeah, I know.

151
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,040
So here's how I dealt with it.

152
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,280
Day one was sort of charming.

153
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
It was also, we were having a record heat wave here.

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,880
I should also mention that day one was almost sort of nice.

155
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
You know, we were enjoying each other's company.

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,800
My wife and I came back to the house and we sat outside with a bottle of wine and some candles.

157
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,840
It was almost romantic.

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,760
And that lasted until the next morning when the power was still out.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,960
And then we lost our minds and went to Louisville for two days because we couldn't handle it.

160
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,320
We had to escape the storm.

161
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,440
I mean, to give you some idea of how bad it was, like, you couldn't buy.

162
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
I went to a pump and tried to buy gas and it didn't have any in it.

163
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,680
What?

164
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:50,800
Yeah.

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
It's always supposed to work.

166
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,360
That's the one constant is I know I can get more gas.

167
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:55,920
I had to get-

168
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
You instantly feel like you were in a zombie movie because I've had people describe to me

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,960
being out of gas in West Virginia and it sounds like the beginning of an apocalypse.

170
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,640
Yeah, it's, well, and everybody, here's the thing that's so weird about it.

171
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,080
There's no reason for everybody to get all this gas.

172
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,600
We're not out of gas.

173
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,560
If it was like the electricity store got us a fresh supply in, go get it.

174
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,720
And I mean, like, some people have generators, but-

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,760
It was panic.

176
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
Just panic.

177
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,280
That's exactly it.

178
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,160
People were freaking out.

179
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,480
And like, I was, I know why I needed gas because the only way I had to charge my cell phone

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,760
was plug in the car adapter.

181
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,680
I know that's like the least efficient charging method ever.

182
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,240
But I don't know, man.

183
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,280
I wish I had an answer for you.

184
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:37,920
I lost it.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,480
I lost it.

186
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
I couldn't get it together.

187
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,520
I was without power for nine hours and I couldn't stand it.

188
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,840
Like, I was doing a show at the time, so I was downtown and we had power there.

189
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,880
And when I came back, I called Theresa and we were still without power here.

190
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,520
And so I was like, okay, well, I'll grab something, you know, I'll grab some fast food

191
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,920
or something so that we can actually eat dinner.

192
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,000
I had to drive all over town to find somebody with power enough to make me a hamburger.

193
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,040
And there were lines around the block to get into the Wendy's.

194
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,320
Because they had hamburger power?

195
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,920
Because they had hamburger power.

196
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,120
We have enough watts to produce 10 burgers.

197
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,720
They're a hundred dollars each.

198
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
Please don't tell Dave Thomas.

199
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
I don't know if you guys know this.

200
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Candles do not produce a lot of light.

201
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,800
Yeah.

202
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,560
You can't do shit by candlelight.

203
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Yeah, nothing you can, well, I know one thing.

204
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,680
What?

205
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,080
That's, oh, nevermind.

206
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,800
What is it, Dustin?

207
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
Fucking reading.

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
I thought you were talking about your desires.

209
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,560
I thought you were talking about fucking.

210
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, gross.

211
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
So those are the two things you can do.

212
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,760
So eat hamburgers and fuck.

213
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
People did it for hundreds of years, I guess.

214
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,640
Maybe even thousands.

215
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,360
As many as thousands of years without electricity before electricity was invented.

216
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
But like, our brains aren't built that way anymore.

217
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,840
I don't have a brain for that kind of thing.

218
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,400
Here's the thing.

219
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,360
I was driving around and you take for granted how much light there is in the world at night.

220
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,960
Street lights, house lights, Porsche lights.

221
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,960
I couldn't see stop signs.

222
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
I couldn't see intersections.

223
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,560
It was the cone around my car that was headlights.

224
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
It was terrifying.

225
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,680
I was so afraid I was going to just hit somebody having no idea they were there.

226
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,800
I don't understand why this guy's counting out board games from the jump.

227
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Like, if my power ever goes out, it's like, oh yeah, it's board game time.

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,840
It's like an excuse to play board games.

229
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,880
I don't understand why you would want to discount that right away.

230
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,760
I don't think you should.

231
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
Clue can get really scared.

232
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,280
Oh, I know.

233
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,080
Because he's alone.

234
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,400
Well, guess what?

235
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,160
You can play Mastermind.

236
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,160
I guarantee you play Mastermind, you're going to forget what your pegs were instantly.

237
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,960
What if it's like a Mastermind drinking game?

238
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,000
You set up the board, right?

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,800
And then you take like 10 shots of tequila, and then you sit down to play against yourself.

240
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah, it's called, it's called Mastermind.

241
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,280
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

242
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
Yes, absolutely.

243
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,000
This Yahoo answer was sent in by Alexander Hawk or Hatch.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,560
One of those two.

245
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,280
Thanks, Alexander.

246
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,080
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Av, who asks, question about smelling?

247
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,000
Okay.

248
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,440
Hi, okay, I have a question about smelling air like with your nose.

249
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,120
Okay, so like, I never thought about it, but what if you breathe in a lot of stink air?

250
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:47,360
Does the stink air lodge itself into your lungs and you get the smell inside of you

251
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,600
until the end of time, AKA forever?

252
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,520
Because I went to a farm last year and there was a bit cow poo and I smelt it

253
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,920
and I still smell it sometimes.

254
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,440
Additional details.

255
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
I saw it on the news.

256
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,040
Okay.

257
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,160
So this gentleman is worried about eternal smell.

258
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,120
Yeah.

259
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,400
He's worried about the smell getting inside of him and living forever, AKA the end of time.

260
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Actually, this is, this phenomenon is well known.

261
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,160
We just call it something different, memories.

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,560
Yeah.

263
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,080
That's how, this is how memory works is you get a smell inside of you

264
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,960
and it never lets itself go, let's self out.

265
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,280
And then, it's actually my favorite kind of memory and sense memory.

266
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,000
And it's like when you smell something and it connects to something else,

267
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,760
but I really want to know what kind of memory is attached to the smell of cow poop.

268
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
Cause wouldn't that be like the worst sense memory?

269
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,520
Every time you smell cow poop, you think of that girl you made love to on the farm.

270
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,720
Yeah.

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,840
Why does that doesn't make it?

272
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
Why would that, why would the smell of,

273
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,920
you should never ever connect the smell of poop and sex in your mind at the same time.

274
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,480
If you, if you smell poop, you can't have sex.

275
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,520
Like that's the rules.

276
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,040
You say, well, listen, baby, you're a red and white checked shirt

277
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
that you've tied into a knot in front of you.

278
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,600
Like farmer's daughters do look so sexy.

279
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
And I know I'm a traveling hairbrush salesman.

280
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm a traveling hairbrush salesman.

281
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,560
But listen, it smells like poopy right here.

282
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,320
You're giving me, you're giving me come hither eyes, but the air around you

283
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,760
is giving me go away.

284
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
Run, run, run eyes.

285
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,680
I know your, your father, the farmer told me not to touch you,

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,200
his beautiful virginal daughter.

287
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,760
And I should be moseying along to, I don't know, Piscataway or someplace like that.

288
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
The traveling salesman go, but I smell poop.

289
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,920
Is that just me?

290
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
Is that just me?

291
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,840
I like to mosey.

292
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,040
I'm going to Albuquerque.

293
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,080
Albuquerque.

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,960
Albuquerque.

295
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,640
Albuquerque.

296
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,040
I, I don't know guys.

297
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,440
I still, I used a port-a-john at Bonnaroo on the last day once.

298
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,720
And that's, that, that smell is like, I still, it comes up from time to time.

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,120
And it's not like I think about Bonnaroo and then I get the smell.

300
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,280
It's like, it lives in like my shoulder blade or something.

301
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,600
And every once in a while, if I jostle it, I'll break the seal and it'll come back to me.

302
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,960
I think the smell lives inside me forever and ever at the end of time.

303
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,440
Now, did you think this before you read this question or is it just an idea?

304
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,600
It's a problem I deal with every single day, but it's okay because sometimes I'll like be

305
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,760
walking down the street and I'll get a whiff of Heiners Bakery, which is in Huntington.

306
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
And I haven't been to ever.

307
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,120
I've just driven by it 10 years ago.

308
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,040
You just driven by it and it gets stuck in your knee.

309
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
You get that smell on my knee.

310
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
I am a man.

311
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,760
I am composed of smells basically.

312
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,120
I think everybody is made.

313
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah.

314
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,760
Everybody is basically made of smells.

315
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,040
You know, it's something you learn in psychology that basically you, the you that is you is

316
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,480
just a, you know, it's just a building of all the smells you've ever smelled in your life.

317
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:54,720
Right.

318
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,320
That's how you get your personality.

319
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,600
Your personality is just based on a collection of smells.

320
00:16:59,600 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah.

321
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,800
That's why people who like make barbecue for a living are like so jovial.

322
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It's because they are made of barbecue smells.

323
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,520
Right.

324
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Do you remember that time that you laughed at wedding crashers?

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,440
You found that funny because of that time that you smelled barbecue when you were in Memphis.

326
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:15,680
Yeah.

327
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Wait, how are those two ideas connected?

328
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,800
Well, smelling the barbecue gave you the ability to find things funny.

329
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,040
Yeah.

330
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
I'm, that's why, that is why Amish people are so bitter.

331
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm actually a strong proponent of completely and totally dismantling our public school system

332
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,680
and just creating these facilities where you come in and you plug in some sort of oxygen

333
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:47,280
apparatus into your nose, sort of like an oxygen bar and then instead of making children

334
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,640
read traditional books and receive tutelage from professors, they just get steak smells

335
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,080
blown into their face, into their face holes or maybe not even steak.

336
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,440
Maybe it's a, you know, fresh bun cotton candy or a funnel cake or maybe instead of

337
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
getting sent to the principal's office, you put a little poop in there, you know?

338
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,120
This is in your body now forever.

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm sorry, Steve, you're going to get 30 seconds of poop.

340
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,240
Yeah.

341
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,720
You're going in the poop.

342
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,560
The poop chokie is what we'll call it.

343
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,800
This is why kids in Africa always look so sad in all those show this commercials because

344
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,960
all they ever smelled is zebras and dust.

345
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,200
Yeah, that's probably the two smells that they have.

346
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,760
I remember when I first read the book, The Giver, and I thought that is what we're talking

347
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
about. That's so good, Travis.

348
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
That's not in Africa.

349
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Well, I was just thinking of sharing smells with people.

350
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Yeah, yeah, no, no, no.

351
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,200
Nobody there can remember anything except for one guy.

352
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
They don't even see colors.

353
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
He does all the smells for everybody and he gives them to people.

354
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,600
I remember that time I taught a young African child what sledding was.

355
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,000
Yeah.

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
And it was pretty epic.

357
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,880
Through the smell of fresh store-bought sled.

358
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,520
And you can read in my biography, What's That Smell?

359
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,880
The Story of Travis McElroy.

360
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Can you keep a sachet of some sort of certain smell that will teach someone to love our

361
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,400
podcast that you just carry around with you?

362
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,560
He just carries around a lot of glass baubles and you open them.

363
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,800
I'm going to juggle these baubles like Jared from Labyrinth and then I'd like to crack

364
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,200
one open for you if you could just inhale this perfume.

365
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm a merchant of exotic perfumes.

366
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,520
Please enjoy this eau de toilette.

367
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,880
If you inhale it, it will make you a much better typer.

368
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
It does smell like Wendy's.

369
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:26,800
That's right.

370
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,600
It smells like Wendy's.

371
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,280
Enjoy the Wendy's memories.

372
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,400
These are my Wendy's memories.

373
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,000
The plot of Labyrinth 2 is me trying to go find Jared.

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,440
It's just Justin wondering the streets of Huntington with a bunch of mason jars yelling

375
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
for David Bowie.

376
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,920
I never- and people ask me like, have you been to Wendy's?

377
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,720
I have no memory.

378
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,080
If I have, I don't recall ever having gone to Wendy's.

379
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,760
It seems like I would go.

380
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
They're pretty prevalent.

381
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,440
But Jared stole all the memories.

382
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,600
I'll eat no chicken sandwich, no nuggets, nothing.

383
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,440
I don't remember a single Frosty because Jared stole all my Wendy's memories.

384
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,840
Dance, dance, Wendy's dance.

385
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,240
Jump, Wendy's jump.

386
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,160
Uh, you remind me of the crispy chicken sandwich.

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,080
Which crispy chicken sandwich?

388
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,040
The power of Dave Thomas.

389
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,280
Fuck.

390
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm gonna need to take a two hour break here so I can go watch Labyrinth again.

391
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,000
I need a 30 minute break to go eat Wendy's and then poop it out, which is about how long

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
it takes to do that for one day.

393
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,200
What if the smell of a certain food made you forget the fact that you ate it and you would

394
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
be locked forever?

395
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
And like, my belly seems fuller.

396
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah, I'm dead like that guy in Seven.

397
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,600
This gazpacho looks great though.

398
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,640
I can't wait to eat it.

399
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,040
I can't believe I got to drive back to Wendy's.

400
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,680
What's Wendy's?

401
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,720
I've never heard of it.

402
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
Oh shit, Labyrinth 2.

403
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,920
Tagline.

404
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,800
Come get the new Inception Burger.

405
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:16,160
Come get the new Inception Burger and remember that time that your uncle died.

406
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,560
Whenever I go out of town, my roommate likes to bone down in my bed.

407
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:26,000
I've been told by friends of mine, and I also know he has gotten some mouth action

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
in my closet.

409
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Oh, come on.

410
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,080
What?

411
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,240
I've tried locking my door, but it's pretty easy to unlock.

412
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,320
Is there anything I can do about this or do I have to sleep with it?

413
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,520
Any suggestions?

414
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
And that's from Bill Zillionaire.

415
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,920
Your roommate is the worst asshole I've ever heard.

416
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,680
He's addicted to it, right?

417
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,080
Like you lock your door and you're like, please don't have sex in my room.

418
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,360
I've locked the door, please don't.

419
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,640
And he's like, okay, you got it.

420
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,800
And then you dip, and he's like, I cannot wait.

421
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,080
And he breaks down your door.

422
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,320
That's breaking and entering and mouth action.

423
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,560
Girl, you look so fucking good.

424
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, I'm going to bang you so hard.

425
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
Just let me get this lock open.

426
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,560
I got to take you on David's bed.

427
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,400
This is not my bed kind of action.

428
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
If I don't do it on David's bed action.

429
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
If I don't do it on David's bed, then I can't vanish.

430
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,120
Pretend I'm David.

431
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
Pretend you're David.

432
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,840
Two Davids in perfect harmony.

433
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,400
There's two Davids in the closet getting mouth action.

434
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
Can we stop?

435
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,200
Can we just not say that anymore though?

436
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,160
If we could just not say mouth action.

437
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:36,160
Mouth action is like when you're like you're scatting or beatboxing.

438
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,000
When you're scatting, that's worse.

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
Oh, no, no, no, no.

440
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,520
No, no, I'll never forget the smell.

441
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,400
Oh, man.

442
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,920
Why is your roommate such a freak?

443
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,360
He loves it.

444
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,400
I'm not just a freak, but like you locked your door.

445
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,760
It's like the quintessential like boundary issue.

446
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,840
This is, this is such a, this is like one of those things that is so, such a big deal.

447
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,720
That it informs so much else about this person.

448
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,560
Like this is not a good guy.

449
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,920
Like you can't, I don't care if he makes muffins every single morning and like save your, save

450
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,320
your.

451
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Here's some fresh muffins.

452
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,120
I look forward to fucking in your bed when you leave for the weekend.

453
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,480
I don't care if this dude like saved your dad from a house fire.

454
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,640
Like, yeah, there's no excuse.

455
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,600
But the good news is, as with every question on my brother, my brother, me, I have a solution.

456
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,920
Okay.

457
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,320
You ready?

458
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,520
One word, lice.

459
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,560
No, hold on, stay with me.

460
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,440
You know, you're going away for the weekend.

461
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,680
You put lice in the bed.

462
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,180
Okay.

463
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,680
The girl and the guy get into your bed.

464
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,480
That can't be helped.

465
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,160
They get in your bed.

466
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,720
They, I don't know what people do in beds, but they do it.

467
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,440
And then you, then they leave and the girl has lice.

468
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,160
And then she says, you gave me lice.

469
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,480
I mean, we got to break up.

470
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,560
You're a dirty kid.

471
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,920
And then she calls like the telephone scene and by my birdie, she calls all the girls.

472
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,720
She knows she's like, did you hear the news?

473
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,600
David has lice, but you don't see how this could backfire is if she says David's roommate's

474
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,400
bed has lice.

475
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,440
Oh, you're saying that you're saying that there's a lot of sacrifice going on here.

476
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,760
There is a lot of, it's worth sacrifice.

477
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,000
Yes.

478
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,760
There's a lot of sacrifice going on there.

479
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,640
And you know what?

480
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,320
Part of the sacrifice is that David is going to have to get lice too.

481
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,280
You know, you got to commit to the goof.

482
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,080
You got to commit to the, to this plan we're laying out here.

483
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,800
I think my favorite part of your plan is when you said that they would have to break up

484
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,440
as though his roommate has a girlfriend and the girlfriend's totally okay with fucking

485
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,360
in the other bed.

486
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,720
So why is she just bringing home like random, random skanks?

487
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,000
That's what it sounds like to me.

488
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,920
I mean, like I can't imagine that his roommates been dating this girl for like two years and

489
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,120
they're in a loving relationship.

490
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,600
And every time she comes over, he's like, so you want to do it?

491
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,640
And David's bed.

492
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,880
She's like, yeah, I do.

493
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,000
Why wouldn't I?

494
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,840
You're thinking he's just bringing home random.

495
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,800
It's like, oh yeah, no, no, no.

496
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
That's, that's totally me.

497
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,960
That picture is that's me and my, uh, yes, my family is black.

498
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm adopted.

499
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,360
And also I used to be black like David, but that's me.

500
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
That's totally me.

501
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,640
I really want to be there when this guy like confronts his roommate about this in the room.

502
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,760
It's just like, I gotta be me.

503
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,440
Listen to that.

504
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
What if you, what if no boundaries?

505
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,800
I wish I could stop too, but you know, we've all got our hangouts.

506
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,680
We've all got our things.

507
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,560
You know, you like, you don't do the dishes sometimes.

508
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,400
And sometimes I have sex in your bed.

509
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
Like we all got idiosyncrasies.

510
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,560
What I think you should do is, uh, do dishes in the bathtub and pee in his laundry hamper

511
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,720
and try to cook eggs on the TV.

512
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
And then when he comes home, you'd be like, oh, I, I thought that's just what we do here.

513
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,920
We just like do things in the furniture that we're not supposed to do them in.

514
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,400
I wasn't aware.

515
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,760
That's just something you get to do.

516
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,120
I didn't, I thought.

517
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,440
Next time he has sex on your bed, you burn his bed down.

518
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,280
You set his bed on fire.

519
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,640
Cut it in half with a chainsaw.

520
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,760
Cut it in half with a chainsaw.

521
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,640
If you're not going to use this bed, apparently no one's using this bed.

522
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
So I'm going to cut it in half with a chainsaw.

523
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,720
Yeah, this is a continuum household.

524
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,880
We all fucking sleep in one bed.

525
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,640
What if when you left town, you put rubber sheets on your bed?

526
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,920
Ew, grody.

527
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,800
I love it.

528
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,040
And so then when he brings the girl in, all it takes is about three seconds of contact

529
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,000
to your bed before they're like, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

530
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,200
Take your mattress with you.

531
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,400
That's good.

532
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
I'm going back to my folks place.

533
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
Get a Murphy bed.

534
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,160
So when he comes into your room, there's no bed.

535
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,080
You find him in the wall, laid her dead.

536
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,480
What didn't you tell me?

537
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,920
I deserve better than this.

538
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,480
It's like the cask of a matalato for dirty dorm kids.

539
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm better than this.

540
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
Throw some cold pennies and jacks up in there.

541
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh, that's the worst.

542
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,120
People love that.

543
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,240
Oh, we're just crumbs.

544
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,800
Yeah.

545
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,240
Just eat some Funyuns in there.

546
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,800
Like, ugh.

547
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,640
Or cums.

548
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:22,640
There's so many cums in this bed.

549
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,200
I don't want to be in here or around it.

550
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,040
Install a black light on your ceiling.

551
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,520
Uh-huh.

552
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,120
Get a picture of yourself doing horrific things and just slip it between the sheets.

553
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Get some Buzz Lightyear sheets.

554
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:40,240
Put a mirror on the ceiling, but on that mirror, stick a giant sticker of yourself,

555
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
like looking disapprovingly.

556
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Find a picture of your roommate's mom and then have sheets made that have her face all over it.

557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,000
Nothing's happened in that bed.

558
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,760
But all these suggestions are contingent on the fact that this roommate is a normal person.

559
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

560
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
Which, of course, he is not.

561
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,440
I mean, because he's just like a wild animal.

562
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,280
He's like breaking locks so he can get into his friend's bed to bang.

563
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,560
What did you do to your roommate in the past?

564
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,520
Yeah.

565
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,640
That has made him this single-minded revenge machine.

566
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,040
You're right.

567
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,080
There is a wrong somewhere that he is attempting to right.

568
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,560
That's the only thing that makes sense.

569
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,720
And you'll bust in on him and he'll be like, do you remember that time you ate the pizza

570
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,360
Hot Pocket?

571
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,320
That was my pizza Hot Pocket, David.

572
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
That's some Genghis Khan shit, though.

573
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,240
Like, if you fucked in this guy's bed and he was like, well, in payback,

574
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm going to fuck in your bed exclusively for the rest of my life.

575
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,920
Hope you don't want to-

576
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,760
Even if you move out, if you-

577
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,160
Yeah, I hope you weren't planning on starting a family.

578
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,800
Yeah.

579
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,680
I- I-

580
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,400
We don't normally do, like, follow up on questions.

581
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,800
This is one where I really want you to talk to-

582
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,280
Like, I have to know.

583
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,320
You have to ask him, like, what is the attraction?

584
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,560
Does he just not want to get crabs in his bed?

585
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,200
Or he thinks I'm a lot of really, real duds?

586
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
Like, what is the idea?

587
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't get it.

588
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:00,880
I really don't.

589
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,920
And I have to know.

590
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,720
I'm captivated.

591
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,840
You live a fascinating life, David.

592
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,960
You live a fascinating life.

593
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,200
You guys are in Yahoo?

594
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,320
Absolutely.

595
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,200
I've got a few.

596
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,320
This Yahoo...

597
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,040
Let's go with this one.

598
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
This Yahoo was sent in by Elliot Harmon.

599
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:17,680
Thank you, Elliot.

600
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,040
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

601
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,160
I doubt it too, who asks,

602
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,120
does wind have free will or does God direct every puff?

603
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,200
Come on, somebody has to know or at least pretend to know.

604
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,600
Somebody has to know or at least pretend to know that-

605
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,200
The Yahoo Answers story.

606
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,800
Yeah, right, exactly.

607
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,560
I like any question that starts with, come on.

608
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,040
Yeah.

609
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,840
Come on, guys.

610
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,000
Has this gone on long enough?

611
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,560
Do you know how sometimes, like, you can't get a kite going?

612
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,560
Oh, a kite?

613
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,120
Yeah, kite.

614
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
When you're finding a kite and you can't get it.

615
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,440
All right, Jesus.

616
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,360
Sometimes you're flying a kite and you can't get it going.

617
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,640
Is that proof?

618
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,680
Good grief.

619
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,080
Yeah.

620
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,520
And then Snoopy walks by.

621
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,560
Maybe, is that proof that God is dead?

622
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,600
Is that what that means?

623
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,720
No, it's proof that God's napping.

624
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,200
Okay.

625
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,120
He's just taking a nap right now.

626
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,520
Or it's proof that you've done something terrible in your life

627
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
and God doesn't want your kite to fly.

628
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,440
Yeah.

629
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,640
Maybe if you lived a more pure life.

630
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,440
The other question is, like, when a breeze comes along and, like,

631
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,240
blows a girl's skirt up and everyone can see her underpants.

632
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,840
Does that mean God's a pervo?

633
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,080
Yeah.

634
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,280
Maybe God's just giving us a little something, you know?

635
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,920
For being good.

636
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,600
I'm sorry, zapped?

637
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Is that something that happens to you in, like, your day-to-day?

638
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,520
Pretty frequently?

639
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,200
Every single day.

640
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,280
It's even if the girl's wearing, like, pants.

641
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
It blows her pants up.

642
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,560
The wind blows the pants up.

643
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,200
What the fuck?

644
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,720
And then somebody comes along and sharks her.

645
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,220
Yeah.

646
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,600
That's true, no.

647
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
And God directed that man to do that thing.

648
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,400
Thanks.

649
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,600
Once you start assigning things that have happened that God did,

650
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:16,120
like, did God, this Yahoo Answers person has hit on something very primal.

651
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,360
Did God make the derecho and knock out my power?

652
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,920
Why?

653
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,440
If God has control over it and he knows we need to record my bim bam,

654
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,000
why would God use a derecho to knock out my power?

655
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,640
And here's what I – so, in my Zen training,

656
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,640
and this idea of, you know, that there is some guiding force in everything,

657
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,000
it makes me think that if we had done My Brother, My Brother and Me last week,

658
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,440
everyone would have died.

659
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,680
Yeah.

660
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,440
Oh, right?

661
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,480
It was so funny?

662
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,400
And people were like, oh, it's such a terrible thing that there was no episode this week.

663
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,760
But what they didn't know –

664
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,880
Right, there was a joke in it.

665
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,560
There had been, if there had been, rampant death.

666
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,920
Yeah, a joke is so – one of the jokes would be so funny that you would –

667
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:09,880
Everybody would be driving, listening to it via their FM transmitters, and they would just die.

668
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,720
And it – yeah, it would be like The Ring.

669
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,960
Like, seven days after you hear this joke, you die.

670
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,640
I don't think it has to be that widespread.

671
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,720
Like, I think we – what's more likely is we'd say something mean about French Stewart,

672
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,560
and then he'd hear the podcast and kill himself.

673
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,040
Oh, that was the one he would listen.

674
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,520
Yeah, we – I don't think I would send him that one.

675
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,480
I like his work.

676
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,360
I mean, like, I think he would enjoy the show.

677
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah.

678
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,120
But maybe not the one where we say mean things about him.

679
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,440
Have you been sending him episodes?

680
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:38,760
Oh, yeah.

681
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,480
Every – yeah.

682
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,840
Wait, that was – we told you to – you've been – you were on French Stewart duty, I think, Trav.

683
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,560
Oh, God.

684
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,280
Yeah, you were supposed to be reaching out to French.

685
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,600
Oh, I thought you said to be Frenching out.

686
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,640
And that's what I've been doing.

687
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:53,800
No.

688
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:03,320
I don't like our two options here, because the options are either God shoots a wind gun

689
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,640
at the Earth in ways that please him, for the people who please him.

690
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,760
That's a little – that's a little Greco-Roman for my tastes.

691
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,480
Or the wind itself has free will, and it's like, God, there's a skirt!

692
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:15,960
Get it!

693
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,480
All wind is dirty perverts.

694
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,320
Look at that stupid kid with that kite!

695
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,840
Let's knock it down!

696
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,840
Now, Griffin, I'm going to give you a third option.

697
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,080
Okay.

698
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,400
Wind does have free will, and God is constantly battling it.

699
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,160
Oh, my God.

700
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,280
That's how tornadoes happen, right?

701
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:35,720
Right.

702
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,160
It's when the wind just wants to blow a lady's skirt up so bad, and God's like,

703
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,600
no, you dirty pervy wind!

704
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:45,000
That's why all tornadoes move in the direction of ladies with skirts.

705
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,120
All wind is a ghost of a dirty old man.

706
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:48,520
Okay.

707
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,400
So we know that.

708
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,320
So it's always trying to either blow ladies' skirts up –

709
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,680
Just like in The Giver.

710
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,240
Yeah, just like in The Giver, just like in The Giving Tree,

711
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
all wind is the ghost of a dirty old man.

712
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,320
Right.

713
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,360
So it can either blow skirts up – that's the one thing wind does –

714
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,000
the other thing wind does is play with little kids with their –

715
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,960
with whatever, like, wind toy that they have.

716
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,800
And as we've already established, it watches people fuck, or tries to.

717
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,360
Yeah, right.

718
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,320
Whenever you – don't leave your blinds open, because you know what's out there?

719
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,720
Wind.

720
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,120
And it's watching you get it on in your roommate's bed.

721
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,080
Yeah, wind is the – wind is the enemy.

722
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,360
Now, God – God's like, I don't know why I thought it was a good idea to make this –

723
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,480
Sentient wind.

724
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,360
Sentient wind?

725
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,320
What was I thinking?

726
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,040
I was young.

727
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,840
I was making – I was young and in love.

728
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,080
I was – I was 40 trillion back then.

729
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,440
I was only 40 trillion.

730
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,000
I was making a lot of mistakes, a lot of crazy stuff.

731
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,600
And I didn't mean to make sentient wind.

732
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,560
That was my bad.

733
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,040
But I'm infallible, so I can fix this.

734
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,480
I meant to make sentient dirt.

735
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,920
I meant to make sentient dirt, but it slipped.

736
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,200
Sentient dirt would be the worst.

737
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,080
Wouldn't it, though?

738
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,520
As soon as it got a tree in it, it'd be like, look at me, everybody.

739
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,720
I've got flowers.

740
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,000
What do you want, fruit?

741
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,880
I can make it.

742
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,080
I've got so many nutrients.

743
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,520
I got some gold in me, but I'm not going to tell you where.

744
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,880
Hey, look over here.

745
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,320
There's an arrowhead.

746
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,160
It's a secret.

747
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,240
It's my secret arrowhead.

748
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,120
I'm never going to tell.

749
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,520
Oil?

750
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,280
There's some oil in here somewhere.

751
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,440
You've got to fight for it, though.

752
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,560
All the worms moving all up in me, too.

753
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,480
That's a nice pocket of natural gas over here.

754
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,520
Come on and get it.

755
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,520
Stupid dirt.

756
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,760
God, I'm glad you're not sentient dirt.

757
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,080
Because that would be all dirt's day.

758
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,600
And then if you start digging, forget about it.

759
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,960
How could you do this?

760
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,600
I would have just told you where the arrowhead was.

761
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,120
And then, of course, golems.

762
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,720
Got to fight with those.

763
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,080
So that was all science.

764
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,240
This has been our science podcast.

765
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,080
We should seriously do a science-themed show.

766
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,360
That would be the best.

767
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,360
Let's do one whole episode on space.

768
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,720
Here's my idea.

769
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,000
Start sending in your science questions now.

770
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,120
This is such a good idea.

771
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,000
We go to COSI in Columbus.

772
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,480
We go to COSI in Columbus.

773
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,680
We do a kid-friendly science show.

774
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,560
And we do it at COSI on the stage there.

775
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,840
Would COSI approve of us saying that wind is ghosts?

776
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,120
I feel like COSI has an exhibit called Wind is Not Ghosts.

777
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,720
And we would be doing our show in front of that.

778
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,840
And it would feel a little disingenuous.

779
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,080
I feel like we would be watching people, like COSI employees,

780
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,280
lining the back wall.

781
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,960
And they'd start laughing.

782
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,120
And then by the end, they'd just be restrained physically.

783
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,720
Science is dead.

784
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,920
None of this is true.

785
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,040
You guys killed science.

786
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,000
Don't listen to them.

787
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,640
To me, doing our show in front of an audience of 30 kids

788
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,800
would be like working without a net.

789
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,800
I think it would be terrifying.

790
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
All you got to do is slip one ghost fucking fuck.

791
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,480
And you're like, oh no, my childhood is over.

792
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,360
And you just see Mr. COSI go, shut it down.

793
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,000
Shut it down.

794
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,760
And three sniper rifle lasers just train on us.

795
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,640
Put him in the time tunnel.

796
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,360
COSI has an exhibit about checking your balls and boobs

797
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,560
for cancer lumps, which you do by watching a video

798
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,960
and feeling up prosthetic balls and boobs.

799
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,320
I don't think we can get any raunchier than that.

800
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,680
Yeah, that's true.

801
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,240
COSI is already pretty raunchy.

802
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,440
You should do those things.

803
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,760
It's important to learn how to check your stuff.

804
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,880
But then you have a thing there that you're like, yeah,

805
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,400
feel up on these boobs, Griffin.

806
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
You're on a church trip.

807
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,080
Wait till the-

808
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,000
Hey, nine-year-old Griffin, go to town.

809
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,840
Wait till you're in your pastor's blind spot,

810
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,120
and then go to town.

811
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,920
I don't know if you guys know this,

812
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,160
but COSI also has that thing with all the corpses now.

813
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,400
What?

814
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
They have the bodies?

815
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,280
Yeah, it's coming in October.

816
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,000
Oh my god.

817
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,520
So that'll be pretty crazy.

818
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,840
You can just feel up all the bodies.

819
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,040
Yeah, just touch the butt.

820
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,680
Oh god.

821
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,560
Yeah, we gotta do this science show.

822
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,800
You know, for kids.

823
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,120
Yeah.

824
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,840
Yeah.

825
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,120
Well, that would get in the way of our longstanding policy

826
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,720
of being drunk while doing this.

827
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:20,760
Yeah.

828
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
We could be drunk on science.

829
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,840
I think any kind of drunk is drunk on science.

830
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,360
Can we do a tape delay?

831
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,760
Yeah.

832
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,360
Is that possible with a room full of children?

833
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,280
If we're speaking like really, really far away from them,

834
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,520
then the speed of sound will give us about a second.

835
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,680
And we can figure out what the speed of sound is,

836
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,920
because we'll be at COSI, so we'll just do some research.

837
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,680
You know, the speed of sound is as fast as it fucking wants to be.

838
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,080
That's not actually true.

839
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,240
Yeah.

840
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
It's as fast as you can throw a microphone.

841
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,280
You know the fastest way to my heart?

842
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,680
What's that?

843
00:38:52,680 --> 00:39:02,920
Money.

844
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,760
Griffin, who is this message for?

845
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,920
This message is for Luke Jordan.

846
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,960
It is from Abby, Matt, Sam, Ashley, and Tucker.

847
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,080
They would like to wish their brother Luke Jordan

848
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,080
the happiest of 29th birthdays,

849
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,120
and thank him for introducing all of his siblings to my bim-bam.

850
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,400
Thank you so much for watching.

851
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,320
Luke enjoys rock climbing and snowboarding, but most of all, being an evangelist for the Chuckles,

852
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,520
for the brothers three.

853
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,760
Here's to getting him, here's to him getting it done in 20 does.

854
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,040
Squatly pride.

855
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,200
Can we examine what that means?

856
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,280
I don't know what squatly pride means.

857
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:39,400
And I do, I have to confess that knowing that people listen to our show

858
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,560
that are that active physically.

859
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:41,960
Yeah.

860
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,800
Like, what are they trying to prove?

861
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Is it a situation where they're like,

862
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,440
like what are they trying to prove? Is it a situation where they're trying to prove something?

863
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,000
Or is it a case where the fact that they are doing it and we are inspiring them to do it?

864
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,920
It's actually Luke and I have an accord.

865
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,880
He is my surrogate exerciser.

866
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,240
So he is getting fit.

867
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,440
He's getting fit for me and that I'm living vicariously through his sweet abs and delts.

868
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,520
And you're just filled with squatly pride.

869
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm filled with squatly pride.

870
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:18,600
I'm filled with squatly pride for Desiree Gonzalez from her friends, from her friend, Julie Hill.

871
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Not to say that she only has the one friend.

872
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,880
Not that she has, she probably has more than one friend besides Julie.

873
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,760
But Julie is clearly her best friend because she's wishing a happy 30th birthday to her best friend Desiree.

874
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
They both love poop and bam.

875
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,040
And I love her so much.

876
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,720
And then at the end it says, yay.

877
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,640
You don't love her as much as I love you.

878
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,920
All right, listen, Julie, you don't, you don't know Desiree like we do.

879
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,680
You back off.

880
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,640
You back off.

881
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,360
You're done here.

882
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,400
She might be your best friend, but we are her best friends.

883
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:45,880
Right.

884
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,160
We're her best friends that are brothers.

885
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
Best brother friends.

886
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,960
Happy Dirty 30.

887
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,400
Happy Dirty 30.

888
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,080
Megan Garland Tyler, I have a message for you.

889
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
I just ran into the room.

890
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,680
I'm out of breath.

891
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
I've brought a message.

892
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,960
Extra, extra.

893
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,720
Read all about it.

894
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,640
I've got a message from Steven Tyler here.

895
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,120
He says, happy 32nd birthday to my amazing wife.

896
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,120
She and I are both huge fans of your podcast, and she'll be extremely excited about the mention.

897
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Especially if she can make it into a song.

898
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,080
Here's a song.

899
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,680
We don't do songs for people.

900
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,280
Terrence and Philip.

901
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,600
I want you to know that.

902
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,960
You should be our business.

903
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,480
So happy 32nd birthday.

904
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,880
You know what?

905
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,600
I was going to make an Aerosmith joke, but Steven, you've done such a nice thing here

906
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,600
that I'm sure that you get this joke all the time, and I'm not going to do it.

907
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
And that's my birthday present to you.

908
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,160
Nah, fuck it.

909
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,880
That's why I want every single Mabim Bama listening, every Mabim Bambina listening,

910
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,160
when you eventually meet the Aerosmith Steven Tyler, ask him if he's named after that awesome

911
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,720
dude who bought the mention on my brother, my brother, and me.

912
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,040
And then run away.

913
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,720
And run away before he unhinges his scary mouth and eats you whole.

914
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,760
Like a snake gobbling a mongoose.

915
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,600
So thank you to everybody.

916
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,480
Uh, if you guys are looking for the perfect way to celebrate any birthday,

917
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,600
I direct you to ExtremeRestraints.com.

918
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,680
I know what you're thinking.

919
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,960
Justin, is our sex toys really the best gift for-

920
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Don't finish the sentence because the answer is yes.

921
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,520
I was going to say quinceañera.

922
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:20,920
Still?

923
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,220
Still?

924
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,040
Yes, absolutely.

925
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,240
Listen, she's a woman.

926
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:27,480
Okay.

927
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,200
Okay, for a quinceañera, a sweet 16, or a disappointing 17.

928
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,280
Griffin, what is the deal with ExtremeRestraints.com?

933
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,000
uh, using the coupon code MIDDLEST, right?

934
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,060
Yes.

935
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:11,000
Using the coupon code MIDDLEST, you can save how much?

936
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,720
If you use the coupon code MIDDLEST, M-I-D-D-L-E-S-T, you get 20% off of your purchase.

937
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,680
Which is, that's so much off.

938
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,080
Yeah.

939
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,960
That's a crazy amount.

940
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,640
From the week of this broadcast.

941
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:23,880
Yeah.

942
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,200
And then every week after this, if you use it, you get 10% off.

943
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,040
So it's an amazing deal.

944
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,800
Um, but they sent us a list with no names, very discreet.

945
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,000
Uh, they sent us a list of things that people have bought using the coupon code,

946
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,320
and it's awesome.

947
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,480
Things like the One Shot Inima Launcher.

948
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,840
Things like the Super Snake Bite Suckers.

949
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,400
Things like the Blossom Glass Dildo T.M. from the TV show Blossom.

950
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,880
The Ostrich Tickler, which isn't what I think it is.

951
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,120
Uh, they have everything for animals, too.

952
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,840
The Japanese Nipple Clamps, which I think you can use even if you're not a black Japanese.

953
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,200
There's also, uh, it's, if there's, there's, there's one reason that you should absolutely

954
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,360
go to their website, go to the sections for dildos and insertables, and you'll see that

955
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,840
in the, uh, picture for the inflatable dildo section, there is inexplicably a can of Coca

956
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,440
Cola next to it.

957
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,920
Uh, so go there and try to figure out why that is.

958
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,160
Don't try to do it with a regular can of Coca Cola.

959
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,200
Can't stress this enough.

960
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
No, don't use this.

961
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,240
They are not made of load-bearing materials, that's all I'm going to say.

962
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,400
Um, but yeah, they have, they have a wide selection of things for, uh, you know, varying

963
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,360
levels of kink.

964
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,600
So, so go check it out, Extreme Restraints.

965
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,600
If you have used, if you've used the Cubone Code mid-list and you've bought some of these

966
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,560
products and you've used them and you've enjoyed them, go back and, uh, go to their website

967
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,080
and write some product reviews and say, you know, tell them my brother, my brother and

968
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,880
me sent you.

969
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,120
Put it in the product reviews, talk about all the great, uh, experiences that you've

970
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,000
had with them and how much you've enjoyed the products.

971
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,720
They appreciate it.

972
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,520
We appreciate it.

973
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,320
Can I say my new favorite thing on this list?

974
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,600
I've just read the entire thing.

975
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,240
I mean, everything is so exotic with things like the Dougie Style Enhancement Strap or

976
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,400
the Trinity Silicone Vibrating Butt Plug.

977
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,440
What I like is that there's a thing on here just called the Probe.

978
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,360
It sounds like serious business.

979
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,600
ExtremeRestraints.com, Cubone Code mid-list.

980
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,000
Get it.

981
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,000
I got a question.

982
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,680
In a couple of months, my older brother and his wife are going to move in.

983
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,760
It's great that I'll get to hang out with my brother more, but there's a small problem.

984
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,400
I love beer, but my brother is straight edge, meaning no drugs, alcohol or other stimulant.

985
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,320
I know he will constantly judge me for drinking.

986
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,840
I'm responsible when I drink.

987
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,520
Not that I ever go beyond buzzed.

988
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,640
Who gets drunk off beer?

989
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,680
Lots of people.

990
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,040
Everyone?

991
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,240
But I know that won't matter to him.

992
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,720
Is there any way I can get my brother to get off my back and stop being so judgmentalist

993
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,640
from beer fan in Florida?

994
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,600
Uh-uh. I think every time he judges you, you just say,

995
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,440
oh, and how do you like living in my home?

996
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah.

997
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,040
Right.

998
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,400
Yeah, how would you like it if you just lives elsewhere, sir?

999
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,560
You wouldn't like it?

1000
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:12,600
Well, then chill out.

1001
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,200
Let me kick back this brew.

1002
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,840
Is this a former party monster scenario?

1003
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,760
He used to be, they called him the Ogre in college.

1004
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,640
And that the Ogre could pound so many?

1005
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:27,800
Yeah.

1006
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,280
Like no village was safe.

1007
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,640
They called him Chow-Rat.

1008
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,880
He would drink out of like a trophy and beat up nerds.

1009
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,120
Yeah.

1010
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,080
I can't go back to being the Ogre.

1011
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,600
I can't be Shrek anymore.

1012
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,440
I had hair on my palms.

1013
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,840
Help me.

1014
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,160
I had a pet donkey and everything.

1015
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,600
It was ridiculous.

1016
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,200
I don't think it was actually Shrek, Travis.

1017
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,400
Oh, I want him to be.

1018
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,080
I lived in a swamp.

1019
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,160
I fought a tiny John Lithgow.

1020
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,440
I am a fairy tale.

1021
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,760
I had bugles on my ears.

1022
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,000
I was in a movie by DreamWorks.

1023
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:01,880
Hi, I'm Mike Myers.

1024
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,520
Good one.

1025
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,720
Good zinger, Travis.

1026
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,360
Thank you.

1027
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,200
Why do you really keep the bit momentum going?

1028
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,360
You're the gingerbread man.

1029
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,160
Are you the Ogre?

1030
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:11,960
Me?

1031
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:12,920
Yes.

1032
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,800
I'm a commie Ogre.

1033
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,160
I take bits and I crush them.

1034
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,560
Crush them like somebody paps blue ribbon cans against your forehead.

1035
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:26,520
I think that it, okay, if it's a party monster situation,

1036
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,560
I don't know, if it's a situation where he just happens to be,

1037
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,200
like happens to be not an intaker of those things,

1038
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:41,080
I think that's something that actually will get better after exposure.

1039
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,840
Like the three of us grew up in a house where neither of our parents drank.

1040
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:48,680
Our mom might have the occasional glass of wine on a very rare occasion.

1041
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,880
Not that I think I ever-

1042
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,000
I never saw it.

1043
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,360
I saw it once.

1044
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:54,440
And it was when I was 21 and I looked at her and he said,

1045
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,640
I'm going to order a beer and she said, then I'm going to order a glass of wine.

1046
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,840
And I said, very well, mother.

1047
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,920
So that was a, it was a huge rarity at our house.

1048
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,360
And I think there's still some lingering,

1049
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:10,600
like when you, when I see someone drink for a long time,

1050
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,920
like especially like in college and stuff,

1051
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,960
I had associated people who drank with, with bad people,

1052
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,080
like with, with, with like not bad, like evil,

1053
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,680
but like it was something you're not supposed to do.

1054
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,640
And, and that was mainly just because I'd never seen my parents do it.

1055
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,800
So I think if he's living in your house and seeing like you are drinking

1056
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,800
and it, and it, it is not something that like impairs your life or anything,

1057
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:39,720
then, then I think he'll sort of get used to the idea.

1058
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:44,120
I think some of you who don't have never drank or, or what have you

1059
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:47,160
are under this impression that like you have one drink

1060
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,880
and all of a sudden you're a different person that they can't relate to.

1061
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,560
There's a lot of nuances question because if, if it's a situation where like

1062
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,560
he's a recovering alcoholic or he's in an A,

1063
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,600
like maybe it is a little insensitive to, I mean,

1064
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,000
it's still your house and you should be able to do what you want to do.

1065
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,960
But, but if he's, if he's recovering from something.

1066
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,040
Oh, but even that, I know a lot of recovering alcoholics that are like,

1067
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,560
no, fuck it. It doesn't bother me.

1068
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:16,200
Like enforcing, enforcing their lifestyle on you.

1069
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,960
That is not the case for everyone though.

1070
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,440
And if you, you're, this is your brother you're talking about.

1071
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,000
Like if it was me and one of you guys was in that situation,

1072
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,520
I probably just wouldn't drink because I wouldn't want to,

1073
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,760
I don't know. I just wouldn't want to put you guys.

1074
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,880
But I have to ask like how much of the judgment do you think is like perceived?

1075
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,960
Like how, is your brother actually going like, you shouldn't drink. It's bad.

1076
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,680
Yeah. Maybe when you drink, you get paranoid.

1077
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:39,000
Yeah.

1078
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,000
But maybe this guy like walks up to him every time you crack a beer

1079
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,520
and slaps out of your hand. It just feels.

1080
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,480
No, no beer in my house.

1081
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,040
Yeah. Wait a minute.

1082
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,480
In your house. No beers.

1083
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,040
Your house.

1084
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,040
Enjoy this, this Topo Chico.

1085
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,440
As long as you live under your roof.

1086
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:54,680
Yeah.

1087
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,480
That's quite literally a buzzkill, isn't it?

1088
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,120
Like, why do you want to be around your straight edge brother

1089
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,640
when you're trying to hoist a few?

1090
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,960
Why don't you go out to a little watering hole?

1091
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,400
Trying to just hoist a few.

1092
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:06,760
For once.

1093
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,080
I don't, I don't know. I wish I knew more about the situation.

1094
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,600
I think tentatively, you should just secret drink in the bathroom.

1095
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,240
No, maybe you get him drunk.

1096
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,840
No, wait a minute.

1097
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,680
I understand like spike some stuff and then be like, who's judgmental now, Steve?

1098
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,760
I roofed you.

1099
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,280
That's awful.

1100
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,280
Who's in charge now, Steven?

1101
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:39,160
I, I don't, here's what this, this guy's question does not give me any indication

1102
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,360
that like, he says he will constantly judge him, but like, what is he doing with his life?

1103
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,080
That's so great.

1104
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:49,560
Well, the background, the background is they're moving into his house because he got really drunk and set their house on fire.

1105
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:55,160
One of you drinks and one of you doesn't, and one of you is homeless.

1106
00:50:55,160 --> 00:51:00,840
So maybe, maybe it's time for your brother to get off his fucking high horse and kick back a few of these.

1107
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,560
Drink a few pebers and just relax.

1108
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,720
Are you saying that pebers are the secret to universal security?

1109
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,360
The secret to universal success.

1110
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:14,120
No, but I'm saying the president drinks PBR and he's the president.

1111
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:22,280
If you're homeless and you're, maybe it's a good time to start drinking because you need to forget about that fact that you don't have a house anymore.

1112
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,000
Yeah.

1113
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,120
Like move it.

1114
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,600
Yeah.

1115
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,880
I don't understand.

1116
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,040
If you, if you don't want to drink, I get it.

1117
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,360
I don't, but I get it, I guess.

1118
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:38,360
To chastise people who decide to, I mean, but that's very easy for me to say, right?

1119
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,280
Like if you were, if one of you guys started doing blow, like I would probably get a little judgey about that.

1120
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:51,080
If we were problem drinkers, if we were, if we drank to feel and shit, like then it would be a problem.

1121
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:55,800
But this guy sounds like he's responsible because he says it and that's really all I have to go on.

1122
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,400
Maybe he's not.

1123
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,600
Maybe, uh oh.

1124
00:51:58,600 --> 00:51:59,160
Oops.

1125
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,240
Yeah, the sentence of who gets drunk on beer is kind of, kind of scary to me.

1126
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:07,800
I drink like 30 or 40 of them and I'm fine.

1127
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,760
I can't be drunk.

1128
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:09,960
I've been having beer.

1129
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,160
It's mostly water anyways.

1130
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,200
It's mostly water.

1131
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,640
I'm just sleepy.

1132
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:20,440
I'm tired and I didn't want to wear clothes.

1133
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,560
I got hot.

1134
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:23,000
I took my pants off.

1135
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,520
It has nothing to do with me.

1136
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,880
I just need some sprees and then I'll be good to go.

1137
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,200
I must have just gotten food poisoning.

1138
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,640
That's the only thing that makes sense.

1139
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,080
These beers are rotten.

1140
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,280
I wanted to sleep in a swimming pool.

1141
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,240
It's like camping.

1142
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,200
Let's move on.

1143
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,560
Guys, this Friday and every Friday at 10 PM on IFC, you got a tune for comedy bang bang.

1144
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,960
It's an absurd half hour comedy show that only looks like a talk show.

1145
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:53,400
They got a host Scott Ackerman band led by Reggie Watts.

1146
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,000
They got great guests Amy Poehler, Zach Galifianakis, and Seth Rogen.

1147
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,240
I don't know why I said Galifianakis like that, but I did.

1148
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,800
And this Friday they got Paul Rudd and there's going to be a robot inventor

1149
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,240
and Todd Barry will be there and also Chris Parnell.

1150
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,400
So tune in this Friday at 10 PM on IFC for comedy bang bang.

1151
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,720
Comedy so nice, they banged it twice.

1152
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,600
Can you give me a Yahoo, please?

1153
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,040
Yes.

1154
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,720
It was sent in by Trevor.

1155
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,080
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1156
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,600
It was sent in by Lisa Holowfield.

1157
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:25,720
It was asked by Trevor.

1158
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,360
Thank you to both.

1159
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:26,860
Trevor.

1160
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,120
Trevor asks, is it illegal to make a movie about a cat?

1161
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,480
I would like to make a movie about a cat named Trevor,

1162
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,240
but I'm afraid to do it and a lady across the street from me is a lawyer

1163
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,960
and I'm worried to do it once my sister made a movie,

1164
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,720
but I'm not sure if I could do it or not.

1165
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,320
I really do not know what to do.

1166
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:56,040
Okay, wait, is the question asker named Trevor or is the cat named Trevor?

1167
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,160
It's a bio pic.

1168
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,600
It's a bio pic about a cat.

1169
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,520
It's like that movie Fluke, pretty much.

1170
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,680
Is this a cat using Yahoo answers?

1171
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,200
That's my first question.

1172
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,560
So I, this is a child.

1173
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,680
It has to be a child.

1174
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,400
It has to be a child.

1175
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,360
And this child, there's a lawyer, a lawyer, spelled with an O,

1176
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,600
who lives across the street.

1177
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,120
Lawyer the barbarian.

1178
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,240
He knows that lawyer the barbarian lives across the street

1179
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,600
and in his mind, the way that their whole litigious operation breaks down

1180
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,920
is they kick in the door and say, no, no, no.

1181
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:30,600
I'll put you in jail for doing it.

1182
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,200
Lawyer is just looking out through the blinds at him filming this cat.

1183
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,560
It sounds like his parents have told him like,

1184
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,560
you know, don't write on the walls or else the lawyer,

1185
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,200
the barbarian will come down and eat you whole.

1186
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,160
Additional details in the film, I will be killing the cat.

1187
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,800
Now that is a crime.

1188
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,080
Are there any additional details and or answers?

1189
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,640
No, it's not illegal to make a movie about a cat.

1190
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,600
It's only illegal if you hurt the cat, let the creative notions flow.

1191
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,000
No, what is the creative notion about a cat?

1192
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,360
Like it, like I saw Milo and Otis.

1193
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,320
I know it could be charming with a lot of post-production,

1194
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,040
but at the level of a six year old, I'm assuming six is going to be filming.

1195
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,720
It's basically just going to be a lot of like,

1196
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,320
like I'm a cat, I'm a cat.

1197
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,520
My name is Trevor.

1198
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,640
This is a story of Trevor the cat

1199
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,000
and how his parents didn't really love him after the new baby came.

1200
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,080
He started packing his bag to run away

1201
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,680
because he hated his new baby brother, Skyler.

1202
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,240
Hey, but then with the economy being what it was, Trevor was very sad.

1203
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,560
Bad news guys, I kind of want to see this movie now.

1204
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,520
I hope it doesn't get caught up in a lot of legal red tape.

1205
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,720
Did you guys hear about Peter Hewitt,

1206
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,680
the director of Garfield the movie is doing 25 to life.

1207
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:57,960
Did you know?

1208
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:58,840
What?

1209
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,640
Sorry, is that true?

1210
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,120
Yeah.

1211
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,560
Oh yeah, right.

1212
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:03,880
Okay.

1213
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,240
For cat-based crimes.

1214
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,720
Idiot.

1215
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
You stupid asshole.

1216
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,720
That was going to be the goof of the century.

1217
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,920
Did you know that that studio that produced Garfield the movie

1218
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,880
was called Davis Entertainment and also Paws, Inc.

1219
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,120
Now is that true?

1220
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:21,240
That is a hundo true.

1221
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,560
Maybe this kid is talking about like the lawyer, the barbarian

1222
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,840
and their role in like settling distribution rights.

1223
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah, or maybe the movie he wants to create is Garfield the movie three.

1224
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,840
Three fast, three furious.

1225
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,040
Garfield three kitten play.

1226
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,280
And that would probably get him in a touch of hot water.

1227
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:52,200
What if he's making a propaganda film starring a cat named Trevor?

1228
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,240
What if it's a sequel to a pot?

1229
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,640
Maybe it's like girl in the dragon,

1230
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,600
girl with the dragon tattoo and it's the number two.

1231
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,280
And it's a movie starring his cat.

1232
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,560
Because that's going to get you in this.

1233
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,520
He's making Ghostbusters three starring his cat.

1234
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,600
That's a problem.

1235
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,440
If he uses, you can't get what he uses.

1236
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:14,200
Like if the whole soundtrack for his kitten movie

1237
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,320
was by Dashboard Confessional that he like ripped off of a CD, that's an issue.

1238
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:22,360
This is my movie Cat to the Future starring Trevor.

1239
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:23,960
Trevor the cat.

1240
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,360
And all of the Huey Lewis music I could find, which is three songs.

1241
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,360
And the smart bartender from Dawson's Creek.

1242
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,840
I got him really cheap actually.

1243
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,800
Surprisingly enough, his schedule was like wide open.

1244
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,600
It wasn't even a big deal.

1245
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,280
If his cat's name is Pepsi, this is an issue.

1246
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,800
You're going to run into problems.

1247
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:41,960
Yeah.

1248
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:48,600
This is my movie A Day in the Life of Trevor, music by the Beatles.

1249
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,120
This has been our comedy show, my brother, my brother, and me.

1250
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,760
We hope you've enjoyed it and had fun listening to it.

1251
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,240
If you have, could you maybe go do a review on iTunes?

1252
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,120
Or maybe a subscription on iTunes?

1253
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,880
That helps to spread the word about the show.

1254
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,640
And also tweet about it with the MBMBAM hashtag.

1255
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:18,200
You can be just like, buzz click, cool teen Naruto, jerk face killer, Andrea L Hill,

1256
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:29,880
Dirdlin, the Meowthram, Krista Whalen, Smeat, Notencolor, Landon K, Lord Wolfington,

1257
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:30,920
and so many others.

1258
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:34,120
Thank you guys for tweeting about the show and hanging in there with us

1259
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,840
when we missed a week.

1260
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,960
I had an idea.

1261
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,360
I had a brilliant sort of pay it forward-esque epiphany for a way that people could spread

1262
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,320
the word about the show.

1263
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:50,840
Is you take a jump drive and you put your favorite episodes on it and you give it to

1264
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,680
somebody, maybe a stranger, maybe a friend, and you tell them to copy and paste the episodes

1265
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,960
off the jump drive onto their computer and then they hand it off to somebody else.

1266
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,280
Oh, I love this.

1267
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:00,840
Isn't that nice?

1268
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,760
And maybe you could even write pay it forward on there.

1269
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,400
And then people will think that the jump drive has pay it forward on it.

1270
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,360
And like, oh, I love that movie.

1271
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,560
I haven't seen it in a grip.

1272
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:10,040
And then they plug it in and like, well, I don't know what this is, but I'll watch it

1273
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:10,520
anyway.

1274
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,440
And then they figure it out and hand it off.

1275
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,800
Yeah.

1276
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,320
And you write MBMBAM on one side and the other side, pay it forward.

1277
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,400
And then you just keep passing it around.

1278
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,440
I love this idea.

1279
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,160
So there's an idea.

1280
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,280
Just something to get started.

1281
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,880
We talked about doing like branding on CDs, but that's, I mean, that's environmentally

1282
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,440
unfriendly.

1283
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,400
That's so 2000.

1284
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:29,720
Yeah.

1285
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,120
Yeah.

1286
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,640
Do that, make that jump drive, then take a picture of it and send it to us on Twitter

1287
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,800
and we'll retweet you.

1288
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,240
And then we'll, so you can, we'll pin it.

1289
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,480
So just to be, pin it to Pinterest.

1290
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,720
I want to think, I want to thank John Roderick and the long winters for the use of our theme

1291
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:43,960
song.

1292
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:48,280
It's a departure off the album, putting the days to bed, which is a really good album.

1293
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,040
Real, real nice tunes, nice strings and strums and drums.

1294
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,120
And I want to tell you guys about an epic opportunity for you, our listeners.

1295
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:58,840
Okay.

1296
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:01,240
So maybe you've never made it to a live show before.

1297
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,440
We haven't done that many.

1298
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,120
And we have some posters that are only available at live shows, right?

1299
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,760
So maybe you want one of those posters and you want one that's signed by not only the

1300
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,840
three McElroy brothers, but also the artist, Justin Russo and Sydney McElroy.

1301
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,040
It's pretty exclusive.

1302
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,240
Well, here's your opportunity.

1303
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:20,040
You can get one and benefit Wesley Johnson.

1304
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,320
He's having to have some surgery done and he's trying to pay for it.

1305
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:27,960
And you can buy the poster and help him to pay for the surgery.

1306
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,200
Just go to bit.ly slash help.

1307
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,760
We Joe W E J O.

1308
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,960
And you can bid on the poster and possibly win it.

1309
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,240
And then you have your own piece of my brother, my brother, me memorabilia.

1310
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,000
And you've helped out an awesome guy.

1311
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,040
So check it out.

1312
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,280
You've kept a mountain of a man alive.

1313
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,400
So yeah.

1314
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
So lend a hand if you so lend a hand if you can.

1315
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,800
And thank you so much for listening.

1316
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,720
Be sure to tune in next Monday.

1317
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,240
We'll return with a new episode.

1318
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,800
But until then, thank you for being you.

1319
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,200
We love you.

1320
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,160
We love you very much.

1321
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,080
Oh, and give right now give a listen to the other Max Fun shows.

1322
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,120
If you haven't throwing shade.

1323
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:00,280
Yeah.

1324
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,040
Jordan, Jesse, go judge on Hodgeman.

1325
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,400
Stop podcasting yourself.

1326
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,360
Bullseye Jesse.

1327
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,760
Jesse hinted on his Twitter that they're going to be announcing a new show on the Max Fun

1328
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,240
lineup.

1329
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,760
I don't know what it is yet.

1330
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:11,720
What the fuck?

1331
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,040
Yeah.

1332
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:12,600
But yeah.

1333
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:13,640
Yeah.

1334
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:18,840
Like we just got used to throwing shade and having to share the love of our pod father.

1335
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,040
And now better not having to do better not having brothers on it.

1336
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,880
No advice.

1337
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,800
If you give advice, I'm going to burn it down.

1338
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,240
And this final Yahoo was sent in by Earl Parsons.

1339
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,200
Thank you, Earl.

1340
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,520
It's by Yahoo Answers user Sky who asks.

1341
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:37,000
If I die, is there Yahoo Answers in heaven?

1342
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,040
Oh, shit.

1343
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,680
I'm Justin McElroy.

1344
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:41,880
I'm Travis McElroy.

1345
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,320
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1346
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,600
It's been my brother, my brother and me.

1347
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:45,400
Kiss your dad.

1348
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,600
Square on the lips.

1349
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,040
Keep your heart three stacks.

1350
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,080
Keep your heart.

1351
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,240
Hey, keep your heart three stacks.

1352
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,200
Keep your heart.

1353
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,560
Man, these girls are smart.

1354
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,200
Three stacks.

1355
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,320
These girls are smart.

1356
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:25,880
Play your part, play your part.
