1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,600
This is the energy you want? We're not illuminated by light at all.

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
It's kind of like, welcome to my show. I'm just saying, I saw this mic here,

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
I was like, never talked to that one. I mean, if you want to see how long you

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
can make that last, I'm all for experiment. We've done this like a hundred times now,

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,280
if you want to experiment. We've done it a hundred times,

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,560
but we've never done it in Space City. What's up, Houston?

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:28,240
Keep it going, Bayou City. Let me hear you, Hustletown. Come on.

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Come on. You're looking at me like I don't know Clutch City. These are my people.

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
What's up? So excited to be here. Welcome, my brother. My brother,

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,920
meet advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:59,120
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

16
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:15,040
Yeah. I'm a sweet baby boy. I didn't, okay. I want Justin to do his tie five.

17
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah. Justin is standing at his own microphone. My name? I'm Griffin McElroy,

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:32,800
30 under 30 media luminary baby. All right. So anyway, so happy to be here.

19
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
This is just how my brain works, people. Listen, when you go on an airplane

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,440
and they give you food and you eat it, sometimes it's different.

21
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,680
Wait, Justin, I think we have something that'll help.

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,960
Can we get him a bottle of water? Here, Justin, Justin, Justin, take this bottle of water too.

23
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, you don't sit. You don't actually sit. The stool is just there.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
He's hit a meaningful part. No, this is great. So now, okay,

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
Justin's doing a lot of prop comedy. Sometimes people listen to this later. He's got his own

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,320
stand microphone and he was just holding it about one foot off the ground, which

27
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,080
looked really natural and very comfortable. Do the thing where you take the mic off the stand

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
and kind of lean the stand a little bit while you talk into the microphone.

29
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,760
No, not that. You're not seducing the mic stand.

30
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:38,560
If I sit on a stool like this, all I want to do is sing Fast Car. All right. Listen,

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,600
we've been living in this moment for a while and we can all agree it was a mistake.

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,920
I'd like to come back to my seat now. You are welcome to come back to the table.

33
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,960
Thank you. Thank you.

34
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,880
Welcome Justin McElroy.

35
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:59,840
I didn't realize that part of the pre-show prep involved going on Wikipedia to learn all of the

36
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,160
Houston nicknames. So now I feel like a bad person.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,680
I'm a native son.

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,040
You're not even at all.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Houston, and am I a native son?

40
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,140
Okay.

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,240
That's how we talk in Houston, Griffin. Don't even make fun of my stumbling on the words.

42
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,680
I'm still very nervous from over there. I felt very put on the spot, literally.

43
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,000
The table hides a lot. The table hides a whole lot.

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
Like maybe my zipper's down, but it's not. I checked it.

45
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
I always check it while I'm walking on stage.

46
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,640
That's the god on us too.

47
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,960
Yeah. If you pay attention, you'll see all three of us just real quick.

48
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
Just go like, that's our like little ear pull.

49
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,160
So, God, I forget what we were even going to do for intro,

50
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
because what Justin did was just so good.

51
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
History will be the judge of that.

52
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,920
Okay.

53
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
We were backstage. Justin was looking at Houston nicknames.

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
I was on my phone, I saw a news story, and I started talking about it to the boys,

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
and we all sort of realized, no, hold on.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,160
We got to talk about this in front of the folks.

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,040
We never do this on this show, but it was so important and so,

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,960
so I think it could be a launchpad for some of our twisted skewed advice.

59
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
It's time for us to talk about topicalness.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,400
Yes. Well, there's a nature photographer.

61
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,480
Topical or tropical?

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
He was in a rainforest in Indonesia, so close, I guess.

63
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,440
He's taking pictures and he leaves his camera out.

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,480
This is in a segment called

65
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,680
What Griffin Remembers of the News Story He Read 30 Minutes Ago.

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,720
You would think he has a computer. I assumed he had it pulled up.

67
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
No, better like this.

68
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,080
Taking pictures, walks away from his camera for a little bit,

69
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
which is like, cameraman, you don't do that.

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,920
Photographer, you got to leave it out there.

71
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,720
But no, you don't leave it out there, because what happens next is

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,600
a monkey comes down from a tree, takes a selfie with it.

73
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,120
It's very good, this image.

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
The photographer says, that's my image.

75
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,200
Wikipedia puts it on Wikipedia, says, no, it's Creative Commons

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,960
because you didn't take it. A monkey did.

77
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,280
This is the first of eight layers of this story.

78
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,960
Photographer tries to get it taken down from Wikipedia.

79
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,040
Wikipedia says, no, a monkey took it, you didn't take it.

80
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
He gives up.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,440
PETA sues the photographer for including the image in a book

82
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,920
that he printed and sold, saying, that's not your image.

83
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,160
You are violating the monkey's trademark.

84
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,680
Or copyright, not trademark.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
This is what Griffin remembers of the news.

86
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,480
The monkey mailed the photo to himself and didn't know that.

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,760
PETA and the photographer get together to talk about it.

88
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,320
Apparently, there's some precedent where people representing all dolphins ever

89
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,840
sued the Navy for using sonar and the dolphins lost.

90
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
PETA was like, we don't want to establish a precedent by bringing this to court.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,280
Let's settle. That's pretty wild.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,480
If you've wondered why dolphins have had a little spring in their step,

93
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,720
a few extra bucks in their wallet, that's why.

94
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
Nice class action.

95
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
They decide to settle. PETA and the photographer decide to settle.

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
PETA and the photographer decide to settle.

97
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,040
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals says,

98
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,600
no, we're going to hear this one fucking out.

99
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,960
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals says,

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
actually, we're going to get into this one.

101
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,480
We want to find out.

102
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,840
This far, no farther.

103
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,760
We've had a lot of boring ones lately, and we want a fun one.

104
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,080
Yeah.

105
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,840
About monkey photographers.

106
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,920
We want to have our own Scopes monkey trial.

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,520
The reason why they wanted to take it to trial.

108
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:28,960
That was very good.

109
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,600
It was very good.

110
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
The reason why they wanted to take it to trial is because PETA agreed to settle.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,600
The photographer agreed to settle.

112
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,680
The monkey did not agree to settle.

113
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,240
That's a great point.

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,760
If the monkey has the right to claim a photograph as his own,

115
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,080
the monkey has a right to legal representation.

116
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,200
This is all true, by the way, as is this last delicious layer on the onion.

117
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,680
The monkey's name is Naruto.

118
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:05,120
Now, so much, so much bad news this week was in some small part counteracted by

119
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,880
Naruto the photo monkey, and we've got him here tonight.

120
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,480
Naruto, come on out.

121
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,840
Oh, he's attacking us.

122
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,800
I do want to, I do want to change your verbiage just for a second.

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,480
The monkey has been named Naruto.

124
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
The monkey was not like, hi, I'm Naruto.

125
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,840
I took the photo.

126
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,600
So please credit me.

127
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,360
You owe me some royalties, I believe.

128
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,720
Would you like it in the form of bananas?

129
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,400
No, I want fucking money.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,720
Money.

131
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,440
Money.

132
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,040
I have a mortgage.

133
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
I have a mortgage.

134
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,800
Do you have bananas, by the way, while we're on the subject?

135
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,480
But also, banana wouldn't hurt.

136
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,760
A banana would be nice.

137
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,280
I have a yahoo here, if you would allow me to.

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:51,200
Somewhat, now that I'm reading it, similar to our opening topic.

139
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,120
Sent in by Carl Vincent Boddy.

140
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,680
Thank you, Carl.

141
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,240
It's yahoo answers user.

142
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
Sorry, something's gone wrong on yahoo.

143
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,560
Oh, the website disappeared before I could read it.

144
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
Gonna check back into the web.

145
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
Are you guys, do you guys have spotlights on you?

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,320
Because it's sweltering.

147
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,960
It's pretty warm.

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Are we all equally very uncomfortable right now?

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,640
All right, it's by yahoo answers user.

150
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
It's just not going to fucking load.

151
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,600
This is a trash website.

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
yahoo answers user Naruto.

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:33,120
Naruto the photo monkey asks, can you make a Doritos commercial without copyrights?

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
My friends and I were planning to make a Doritos commercial and show it to the school.

155
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
My dad pointed out that there might be copyright issues.

156
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,320
Fucking dad of the year.

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Yeah, that's a clutch play from that.

158
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,200
Clutch, we are not planning.

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Clutch city recognizes a clutch play.

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
We are not, okay.

161
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,480
And that's just going to buy us 10 seconds every time.

162
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,840
We are not planning to post it or make money off of it.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,240
That's not how copyright law works.

164
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,880
We actually saying the word Doritos up here is probably against the law.

165
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,560
Yeah, we will call them stinky tortilla chips.

166
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,800
Faux Ritos.

167
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,480
That's still not going to hold up.

168
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,160
I think if you land in the Ritos family, I think they can still get you.

169
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,360
Yeah, Doritos.

170
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
Doritos works actually.

171
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:25,760
Thank you.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,680
This dad, you're going to, yeah, we're going to make a Doritos commercial

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,800
and show it to the whole school and they'll remember it forever.

174
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
Copyright, you can't copyright.

175
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,400
That's it, copyright, copyright.

176
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
They'll take you to chip jail.

177
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,360
Chip jail where?

178
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,960
You're my beautiful child and I can't watch you go down like that.

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
You're too talented at movies.

180
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,600
All right, Cliff, you oversold it.

181
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
Listen, Cliff, you oversold it.

182
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,640
I know, brain, I know.

183
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
I got greedy.

184
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,720
Pull it back in, Cliff, you've got this.

185
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,880
I mean, if Doritos doesn't find out, you're probably okay, right?

186
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
But you never know who the secret Doritos spies are.

187
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
The coolest kid is like Doritos release.

188
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,840
Yeah, if there's a kid in your class who skateboard, who?

189
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,240
Crunch?

190
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,440
He crunch.

191
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,200
His name is Ranch, but he's very cool, so everybody calls him Cool Ranch.

192
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,200
His name is Xavier Stream, but it's called Extreme.

193
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,640
One surefire sign, the breath and fingers.

194
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,140
Yes.

195
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,640
Check the breath, scope the fingers.

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,800
That's how you know if it's a secret Doritos cop.

197
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
That's why he's always wearing gloves.

198
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,560
A zest, a zest unbelievable.

199
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,080
And at his age, and when he eats chips that aren't Doritos,

200
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,360
they turn to ash in his mouth.

201
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,280
We've just mixed our metaphors.

202
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,240
I was talking about a secret cop employee of Doritos

203
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
and you did somebody who suffered a terrible Doritos curse.

204
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,200
No, I said that chips that aren't Doritos turn to ash in his mouth.

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Again, a terrible, I guess, Doritos curse.

206
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,440
Why would he want to eat any?

207
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,360
He would have a chip in his body.

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,840
You're right.

209
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,600
That made it so he could only eat Doritos.

210
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,320
You're right.

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,280
I'm the wrong one.

212
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,600
What, unless, unless?

213
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
What if it's a very good Doritos commercial

214
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
that everybody in your school likes a whole lot

215
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,560
and makes him go buy Doritos and gets you hired

216
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,200
as the new Doritos Super Bowl commercial person?

217
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,360
Officially.

218
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,400
Official.

219
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
That's the thing is copyright law,

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,960
the tiny, tiny loophole is unless it's good.

221
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,080
Unless it's good and we like it.

222
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,580
True.

223
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,400
You know, you hear a lot of game designers

224
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,720
get their start making like Doom levels.

225
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,520
Maybe this is how you get your start making Doritos commercials

226
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,680
is you make your own, sweeted.

227
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,280
You can't even afford Doritos.

228
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,760
You just have to write it on a plastic bag

229
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
and fill it with dirty chips.

230
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,680
Can you make your own Doritos at home?

231
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,680
Can you sweet Doritos?

232
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
The chip, not for a commercial.

233
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,720
I know where to get tortilla chips.

234
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,320
I know where to get pizza.

235
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Can I find some?

236
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,240
Do they just grind that shit down and just rub it?

237
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
Throw it into a fan with the chips hanging in front of it?

238
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:23,680
Yes.

239
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,880
Sell those on the playground.

240
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,000
25 cents a bag.

241
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,680
Oh no, word's gotten out.

242
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
Cool ranch is coming.

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,720
Shut it down.

244
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
I got chips.

245
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
I have a gallon size Tupperware container

246
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,720
that my grandfather passed down to me that's labeled zest.

247
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,160
So we just mix those together.

248
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,880
How about a regular question?

249
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, it's very warm.

250
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Woo!

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,040
If you're listening later, I just pulled my shirt off very cool.

252
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,000
Very cool.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
And everybody was so excited about how smooth it was.

254
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,840
Like I'd taken off my shirt before.

255
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,520
Five of his muscles popped out.

256
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,840
How about a question from our beloved audience?

257
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,120
Here on my Bim Bam, we take your questions

258
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
and turn them Alchemy-like into wisdom.

259
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,480
This is our first question.

260
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,120
My girlfriend and I have been dating.

261
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,400
No, wait, no.

262
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes, that's right.

263
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,640
My girlfriend and I have been dating long distance

264
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
for almost a year now.

265
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,480
And recently I went to visit her and her family.

266
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,400
Upon arriving, I found out my girlfriend's dad

267
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,880
is a pro Wii Sports bowler.

268
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
He goes to tournaments.

269
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,520
Thank you to him from us.

270
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,120
He goes to tournaments weekly and takes it so seriously

271
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,840
that he stays up until 2 a.m. some nights to practice.

272
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,400
Fuck yes.

273
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,120
It's actually not healthy.

274
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,520
You have to take care of your body as a pro.

275
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,960
Well, he sleeps till 2 p.m.

276
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,840
I'll tell you this.

277
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,880
He's got one super healthy appendage

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,080
and it's whichever one he holds the Wiimote with.

279
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
Weekly tournaments?

280
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,720
Where?

281
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
Is that scene still that hot?

282
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,680
Weekly?

283
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,200
Weekly cash tournaments that he has gone pro?

284
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,760
I'm not great at bowling, virtual or reality,

285
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,440
but I want his approval.

286
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,680
What can I do to impress him or at least show

287
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
that I appreciate his virtual technique?

288
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
And that's from Hoping for a Strike in Houston, Texas.

289
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
I mean, are you here?

290
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,080
Sure.

291
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,800
Wait, are you here?

292
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,240
Are you Legion?

293
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Yeah.

294
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,960
Why is your question about your girlfriend's dad

295
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,640
and not about how you're a hive mind?

296
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,200
I mean, if you just want to prove that you appreciate

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,640
his ability, just watch him and go, nice.

298
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Nice.

299
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,920
That was real good, Doug.

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,480
There are very few reactions you can give to watching

301
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,360
somebody wee-bowl that don't feel like you're full of shit.

302
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,240
I feel like.

303
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,960
Yeah.

304
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
I feel like, oh, nice is about it.

305
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
And then anything like, oh, yeah.

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
They're just going to assume you're being an asshole.

307
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,640
The right reaction is this.

308
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,040
Nice.

309
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,120
Why are you getting high in front of bowling dad?

310
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,960
I mean, it's 2 a.m.

311
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,840
He's wee-bowling.

312
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,920
Yeah, he is high, isn't he?

313
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,720
Yeah.

314
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,120
Also, my girlfriend's dad loves cocaine.

315
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,000
That's another thing.

316
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
Just mountains of that good white stuff.

317
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,960
Crazy about it.

318
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,560
Well, that's what happens on the pro scene.

319
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,440
That's the pro scene.

320
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
That's the pro wee-bowling scene.

321
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,920
It's nasty out there.

322
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,200
Pro?

323
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
He doesn't have another job?

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Is this what esports is?

325
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:36,720
Yeah.

326
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,720
I've worked in the industry for a literal decade now,

327
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,800
and I'm still not sure what people are talking about.

328
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
I think they just misspelled the word sports,

329
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,120
and I don't think that's that unreasonable.

330
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Esports is when you take the hard part of doing the thing

331
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,400
and make it easy.

332
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,640
That's true, because if you think about the difference

333
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,720
between playing football versus playing a Madden game,

334
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
it's a big, big physical difference.

335
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Or murdering a bunch of people in a shooting game.

336
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,200
But the difference between real bowling and wee-bowling

337
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,160
is just removing mass.

338
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,680
It's about 11 pounds.

339
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,960
Yeah, about 11 pounds.

340
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,440
Otherwise, pretty much the same activity.

341
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,040
Pretty much the same thing.

342
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,160
What if you glued a bowling ball to his wee-mote

343
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,440
and said, I got you this.

344
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,320
That'll really just fucking fuck his TV right up.

345
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,320
Are you kidding me?

346
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,280
That'll fuck the drywall behind the TV up.

347
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
That'll fuck up the TV in the next house over.

348
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,440
I do like that, though.

349
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
You've got to, I mean, you've got to beat him, right?

350
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,760
You have to beat him.

351
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,440
Oh, you're not gonna.

352
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
You're not gonna.

353
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,000
Unless, I don't think I actually had one.

354
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,920
No, actually what you have to do for this to work,

355
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,760
you have to almost beat him.

356
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,000
You have to eke out a close loss, right?

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,920
Of like, you're one point behind him.

358
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,840
So it's like, I respect your game, but I'm the pro here, right?

359
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,440
So then it balances out.

360
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,160
Because if you beat him-

361
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,880
He's gonna smell that taking a dive with the betting

362
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,600
in that scene.

363
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
You think he's not gonna see someone taking a dive?

364
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,240
Okay, hold on.

365
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,440
Unless, I gotta know.

366
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,120
I thought of one.

367
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,400
This isn't how it usually works.

368
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
But unless you wait for him to get like sick,

369
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
and then you play him.

370
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,800
Like the flu or something.

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,440
Okay, got it.

372
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,560
And then you just crush him,

373
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,160
because his weak body can't handle the sports you're bringing.

374
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,080
And you put super heavy batteries in his controller, too.

375
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,760
Yes.

376
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
Hi, is this Circuit City?

377
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Yes, it is.

378
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,360
Why are you still open?

379
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
We're the last one.

380
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,120
I bought this store.

381
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
This is the Circuit City?

382
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,840
I'm the mayor.

383
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,240
Welcome.

384
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,520
Thank you for calling the last Circuit City.

385
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,160
How can I help you?

386
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes, I need some very heavy batteries.

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,720
And-

388
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,680
Of course, sir.

389
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Is this for-

390
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,320
No, before you ask, it's not for a dad prank.

391
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,800
Also, if you roll the bowling ball

392
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,440
on the side of the bowling alley where the wall is,

393
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
and get it to go on top all the way to the end,

394
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,240
all the bowling pins fall over and there's a big explosion.

395
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,680
That's a cheat code.

396
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,960
And you can use that.

397
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
It's the truth.

398
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,000
I didn't make it up.

399
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,680
Roll it on the top.

400
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,560
I beat so many kids at Toys R Us with that.

401
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,600
And they were like, what?

402
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
That's cheating.

403
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,800
And I was like, it's in the game.

404
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,320
Just fucking take him real bowling.

405
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,480
There's no way on earth he wouldn't-

406
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,240
What if he doesn't know about real bowling?

407
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,680
What if he got Wii bowling and was like, oh, I love this.

408
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,400
I love this.

409
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,360
Who came up with this?

410
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,000
This is great.

411
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then you're like, hey, oh, shit.

412
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,960
Take it one step further.

413
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
I know how much you love Wii bowling,

414
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
so I built this place for you.

415
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,920
It's like my game.

416
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,360
Valerie, it's like the game you got me.

417
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,800
It's like the game I love.

418
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,600
Bowling.

419
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,040
I call it Doug's ball.

420
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,560
There is no real bowling.

421
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,120
How's the ball even supposed to come back?

422
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,880
It's a video game.

423
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,120
You think there's a little plumber running around

424
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,320
stomping on mushroom men?

425
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,840
Get it together.

426
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,520
It's in the game.

427
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,640
Bowling's imaginary.

428
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
Griffin, how about another Yahoo answer question?

429
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,360
Yeah, absolutely.

430
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,320
This one was sent in by Adrian Cowles.

431
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,440
Thank you, Adrian.

432
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
It's Yahoo Answers user Kanabid.

433
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
No, it's just some letters.

434
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
Asks, if you were part of a construction crew

435
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,080
and while digging the foundation,

436
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
you stumbled upon ancient gold coins,

437
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,240
what would you do then?

438
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,480
Would you report the find to the archaeology department

439
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,520
of the construction company?

440
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Illegally, they have to have one

441
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,800
and usually they're very bored.

442
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,120
Yeah.

443
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,520
What did you find, spark plug?

444
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,080
Cool.

445
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,240
How qualified does that position have to be?

446
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,080
I'm going to go back to practicing Wii bowling.

447
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,000
We found like a hundred skeletons.

448
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,360
Shit.

449
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,520
Okay, that's my day.

450
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,000
All right.

451
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Human, human skeletons or not?

452
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,200
Would you report it to the archaeology department

453
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
or would you and your colleagues

454
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
share the quote unquote bounty?

455
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,600
I don't know why you needed a quote unquote bounty on that.

456
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,240
That's a bounty you got there, my son.

457
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,480
Yeah.

458
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
After reporting, would you stuff some in your pocket,

459
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
take home and sell them online

460
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
or would you turn them all to the government?

461
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Hey.

462
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,360
Hey, is this City Hall?

463
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,480
Is this City Hall?

464
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,360
Is this government?

465
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,960
Okay.

466
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,960
Correct me if I'm wrong.

467
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
This is a question in two parts, right?

468
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
Because it's would you keep it for yourself

469
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,000
or would you report?

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
And if you reported, would you still-

471
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
Still steal a little bit.

472
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,720
That's the wild part to me.

473
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,360
Like, why do you need that heat?

474
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,880
Like, you just want to feel it?

475
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,760
You want to feel something,

476
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
so you want to steal when they know they're watching you?

477
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
Like, you don't think that might pop up

478
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,600
if you're on the eBay and they're like,

479
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,920
hey, you know that big box of coins you gave us?

480
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Some of those also showed up over there.

481
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,640
Isn't that weird?

482
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,960
I wouldn't touch it.

483
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,600
It's cursed.

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,640
It's not.

485
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,240
It's clearly cursed.

486
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,960
It's cursed.

487
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,840
I've seen Pirates of the Caribbean and Black Pearl 12 times.

488
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,680
Today.

489
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,360
He watches it on six TVs twice.

490
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,240
Dang it.

491
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,320
I watch it at 1.5 speed.

492
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,720
If you-

493
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,480
I don't think you can just steal it and sell it

494
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,360
because you don't know how much it's worth

495
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,040
and if it's very good gold coins

496
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,880
or if they're just okay gold coins,

497
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,680
you don't know.

498
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,760
You don't know what the minimum bid should be.

499
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah, you don't want to walk into a pawn shop and hand it to them

500
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,760
like, these are all Chuck E. Cheese tokens.

501
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Right.

502
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,440
You need an expert to evaluate them,

503
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,360
like the experts at Pawn Stars,

504
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,560
to look at them and say,

505
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,360
all right, these are very good.

506
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,320
Congratulations.

507
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,160
You're going to be a very rich person.

508
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,960
$200.

509
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,200
$200.

510
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,440
Yeah.

511
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,960
I have another question.

512
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,720
When I'm walking, I love to skip.

513
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:13,840
Okay.

514
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,640
Hey, the problem is that I'm 31 years old.

515
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll glance around furtively to check that no one's around to see

516
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,360
and then off I go.

517
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,160
The wind in my hair, the floaty bounce down the street.

518
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,040
It feels great.

519
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
But if someone sees, they look at me like I'm bat shit

520
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
and the moment is ruined.

521
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
At some point between child and adult, skipping becomes taboo

522
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
and then everyone loses out.

523
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
Hey brothers, how can we bring skipping for adults out from the underworld

524
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,240
and give everyone the freedom

525
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,920
to have a little bounce in their step?

526
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
That's from Can't Stop the Skip,

527
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,560
who I bet just got a lot more affirmation than they expected.

528
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,600
Can we all agree that like skipping rules?

529
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,040
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

530
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,560
We have a lot of fun here

531
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
and sometimes y'all I feel like you're pressured

532
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
to agree with anything we say.

533
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,960
It's great.

534
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,520
No, it's great.

535
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,320
Wait, when was the last time you skipped though?

536
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
We're getting a lot of actual answers.

537
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,360
Okay, yeah.

538
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,240
Three weeks!

539
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,800
I wrote it on a calendar because I had so much fun doing it.

540
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,040
Nine days, 13 hours.

541
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,920
And I knew I'd be tested at some point in the future.

542
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,720
It's just, it is that it's weird

543
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,720
because I don't know exactly where the point is

544
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,240
but I see a six-year-old skipping.

545
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,760
I think, ah, Americana, beautiful, freedom, go for it.

546
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,160
Yeah.

547
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
I see a 16-year-old skipping.

548
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,040
I'm like, what is going on?

549
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,360
Yeah, what did they steal?

550
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,240
What did they huff?

551
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
They're on that skip.

552
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,840
They're huffing skip.

553
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
Oh, but I'll tell you the worst thing of all, Chief,

554
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,360
the worst thing of all, there's a counter on that ball.

555
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,600
No!

556
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,320
Okay, there was a toy called...

557
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
Who in here is 40?

558
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,640
There was a toy in the 70s called...

559
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,200
Okay, anyway.

560
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,840
It is faster.

561
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,480
It's faster.

562
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,200
You can truck.

563
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,160
You can fucking plays when you're skipping.

564
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,400
Yeah.

565
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,040
You got a meeting you're running late for,

566
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:26,400
you see the train pull up, you walk, gone, missed it.

567
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
Skip it, you run into the back of the train

568
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,040
because you got in it so fast and hard.

569
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,560
You maybe can't even stop.

570
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,640
Yeah, then you pass the train.

571
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,000
That train has to catch up to you.

572
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,640
That's the problem.

573
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,160
If you're of a certain age,

574
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
the problem becomes stopping skipping because that don't...

575
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,480
It doesn't look cute, folks.

576
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,680
As an adult, the motion's to stop a skip.

577
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,360
There's a lot of kinetic energy that you're having to work against.

578
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,320
Then here's this.

579
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,120
I think we can sell skipping as everybody's fast paced lifestyle on the go.

580
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,920
Houston, especially like got to get to...

581
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
Fourth largest city in America.

582
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,640
Yeah, you got to skip around.

583
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,360
I got to skip around.

584
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,720
I got places to be.

585
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,440
I got appointments.

586
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,240
I've got to skip.

587
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,640
But...

588
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,480
Justin, what's your annual import X for?

589
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,680
But stopping is embarrassing.

590
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,320
So on the front of every business will be a little human stable

591
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,760
that you can kind of just stop,

592
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,040
kind of just stop like a human garage that you can kind of...

593
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
You skip and you're outside and you're like, hey, hey, hey.

594
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,960
And then you hit the human stable and you're like...

595
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
And inside the stable is just one wall of a bounce house

596
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:34,880
that you can run into.

597
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,160
Run into and just fully stop.

598
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,480
And now you're going to walk because you're in a bank now.

599
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,720
And you're in a church.

600
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,240
And this is a respectful place.

601
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,120
You should not skip in front of Christ.

602
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
You know they're going to find a way to charge you though.

603
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,080
You're going to find a way to like skip, skip, skip.

604
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,800
That'll be three dollars, please.

605
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,400
Well, I mean, that's the problem is that adults tend to just ruin everything.

606
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,640
And so I think if we all started skipping,

607
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
eventually it would become competitive.

608
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,640
Yeah.

609
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,520
It would be a sweat.

610
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,920
And then people would start marketing like skipping shoes.

611
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,400
Yes.

612
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,080
Special skipping equipment.

613
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,720
Where can I buy it?

614
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,680
Now I'm interested.

615
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,160
Right.

616
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,840
And then it's just like, where's the fun?

617
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,680
I thought this was about the love of the sport.

618
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,120
Wait, what about the skipping shoes?

619
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,600
Take me back.

620
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,480
Where'd you get them, Travis?

621
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,120
Don't leave me hanging.

622
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:19,680
Come on.

623
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,200
I made them at home.

624
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,880
I glued several other pairs of shoes together.

625
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
Pieces of them, not just like shoes.

626
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,400
You, I don't think you necessarily want skipping to be socially acceptable

627
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,320
because I think that's what you like about it.

628
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,560
Oh, that it's dirty.

629
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,640
It's dirty and wrong.

630
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,760
And you're skipping.

631
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,120
You know what you're doing.

632
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
You're making like this face like.

633
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:55,360
If you're listening later, Griffin just made a face like he was skipping and getting away with it.

634
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,920
But he's giving it kind of a, I'm a naughty boy face.

635
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,120
Kind of a naughty face.

636
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,680
Can I say something?

637
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,480
Even just sort of bouncing up and down on my chair like that felt kind of good.

638
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,040
Hey, guys.

639
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,000
Hey, everybody.

640
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,880
Can we just bounce for a second?

641
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,400
Moving kind of feels nice.

642
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,440
I don't see you bouncing.

643
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,800
This has turned into a fucking Wiggles concert and we're done.

644
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
Hey, I got a Yahoo here that was sent in by Nick Potter.

645
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,240
Thank you, Nick.

646
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,400
It's Yahoo Answers user Jenny.

647
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,680
Thank God.

648
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,680
Who asks, what can I do to make a trash can really smelly?

649
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,560
That's right.

650
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,800
The best shit about Yahoo's is not the questions.

651
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,880
It is the like the accessories, the interjections around it.

652
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
I have these obnoxious kids that play basketball every day slash evening right behind my townhouse

653
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
and occasionally hit my home.

654
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm assuming with the basketball, it's not some way that they like keep score is by

655
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,800
punching the shit out of your townhouse.

656
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
Anyway, it's annoying as hell and I need to do something that will prevent them from

657
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,040
playing basketball.

658
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,280
I have a trash can that is right next to where these kids play basketball.

659
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,720
So I figured I'd make my trash can unbearably smelly.

660
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,600
Lol.

661
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,280
What a weird use of lol.

662
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,960
Like I am hatching an evil scheme.

663
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,680
What a weird use of all your brain to generate this.

664
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:30,480
If you said to your friend, hey, I love playing basketball here with you, but I'm starting

665
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,760
to suspect that the person who owns the townhouse next to our basketball court is intentionally

666
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,040
making their trash can more smelly to prevent us from playing.

667
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,520
Your friends would lock you in prison.

668
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,560
They would put you in mind jail for being so buck wild.

669
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,760
That just makes this the perfect crime.

670
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,120
It is a crime, yeah.

671
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,080
I think it's just disrupting the peace or something.

672
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,080
Okay, there's two things I want us to think about parameters that I think are very important.

673
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,560
One, it is an outdoor area.

674
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:00,720
Yeah.

675
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,800
So the level of smell you will have to achieve.

676
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
Holy shit.

677
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,720
Rough.

678
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,520
And two, the level of smell you will have to achieve so that some teens playing basketball

679
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,480
will be like, wait, hold on, what is that?

680
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,400
Well, that's the thing, Travis.

681
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,360
They can't just be distracted by it.

682
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,040
I don't know that I've ever been playing basketball.

683
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,240
Period.

684
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,920
And I could end the sentence pretty much.

685
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,240
End the sentence, yeah.

686
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:32,800
Yeah, I don't know that I've ever been playing basketball and smelled something that made

687
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,560
me want to stop playing basketball.

688
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,600
That is a wild connection to make, except for a pie on my neighbor's window sill.

689
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,760
Okay, this person is going about it all wrong.

690
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,680
Not smell bad, smell good.

691
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,040
Smell good, far away.

692
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,280
Yes, smell good, unplaceable.

693
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,040
Make their homework smell very good.

694
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,040
Or just like a similar, just kind of a scent where they're like, what is that?

695
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,080
Well, you made it smell like their grandmother's attic.

696
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,480
And they're having such strong sense memory they can't play basketball anymore because

697
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
they're thinking about the beautiful times they had in grandma's attic looking at old

698
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,120
photos.

699
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,760
Thank God you found the world's only nostalgic teenagers to play basketball at your home.

700
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,080
Here's an idea.

701
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,360
We're not going to solve this one.

702
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,560
No, I can solve it.

703
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,600
Okay, I can solve it.

704
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,400
Don't make the trash can more smelly.

705
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,360
Put the trash can under the hoop.

706
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,520
So they go for a nasty dunk.

707
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,360
And then all of a sudden, there's coffee grinds all over the ding dang ball.

708
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,080
Nobody wants to play and there's a bunch of peanut butter and lemon juice on their favorite

709
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,760
basketball game over.

710
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,400
I can't make nasty dunks with this nasty ball.

711
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,480
This is too nasty for me.

712
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,160
There's jelly all over it.

713
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,280
Here's the...

714
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,240
I didn't see that trash can there when I dunked it.

715
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,760
You have to put it out there fast or put a Roomba on it that can automatically...

716
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,240
Okay, that was going to be my point is that they could just move the garbage can.

717
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,600
Not when there's a Roomba on it.

718
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,080
Yeah.

719
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:05,840
But...

720
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,640
You know, don't program a Roomba for something so hateful.

721
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,560
Don't program a Roomba to transport stink around.

722
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,880
That's the opposite of what the Roomba wants.

723
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
That's the opposite of what a Roomba's supposed to do.

724
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,560
No, no, no.

725
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,720
Where's a Roomba's programming?

726
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,640
They're so near sentience, please.

727
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,880
Just let them develop on their own.

728
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,920
Don't teach them about evil.

729
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,840
Even if there's a Roomba on the bottom of it, I think they could still move it like

730
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,800
a hundred feet away and then they have a little bit of while to play basketball before the

731
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:35,760
Roomba comes back.

732
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,720
And that's an issue.

733
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,840
What you have to do is go out there and say, oh, this game looks like fun.

734
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,400
What's it called?

735
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,520
Basketball?

736
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
I would love to try playing it.

737
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,280
By the way, you're very good at basketball and you're totally putting them on.

738
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,040
Also, you stink like shit.

739
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,120
You stink like dog shit.

740
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,440
And you are going to be doing some deep coverage.

741
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,240
In the paint.

742
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,240
So in the paint, you are going to be technical fouling.

743
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,200
You'll lose the game.

744
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,840
But you'll win the day.

745
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah, but they'll lose the game by which I mean not want to play it again.

746
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
Well, at that point, why can't you just hustle them?

747
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,120
Like if I win, you never play basketball here again.

748
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
So that's nothing to do with smell, Justin.

749
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:23,840
Oh, fair.

750
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,920
Also, because we already did it like a hustling joke.

751
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,360
I feel like in this episode, we already did one hustle.

752
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,800
Do we have another question?

753
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,840
Yeah, let me see.

754
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
We're going to do audience questions, by the way.

755
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,160
We're not taking.

756
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,840
Not right now, but that's something we do.

757
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,640
We do do that.

758
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,400
We just wanted you to get very excited and then disappointed really fast.

759
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,880
Griff, why don't you start another Yahoo?

760
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,440
Go ahead and just start another Yahoo for me.

761
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,720
It just popped up.

762
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,560
This just popped up.

763
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Thank you for the hot in from HQ.

764
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,720
The spooky lighting that matches the temperature of the lights

765
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,000
that are currently giving us a nice deep tan.

766
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,280
It's a haunted doll watch.

767
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,880
This is a very good one.

768
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,520
Haunted doll.

769
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,800
Magical.

770
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,920
Amazing power.

771
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Unique spirit.

772
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
Powerful white lighter.

773
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,560
It's so much so fast.

774
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,480
Yeah, that's my favorite out of that whole thing.

775
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,440
Unique spirit.

776
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,160
Unique spirit.

777
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,520
Not one of those bland, boring like nickel and dime spirits.

778
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,840
A special one.

779
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,400
This is one of the only haunted doll descriptions I've ever read where...

780
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,920
This is directly from eBay, by the way.

781
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,880
You can go buy this doll if you want.

782
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
By the way, we did a haunted doll watch last night.

783
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,160
Somebody bought the doll.

784
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:49,520
Like immediately tweeted at us that they bought it.

785
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,720
So that was a mistake on their part.

786
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,160
This is the only one I've ever read where...

787
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,840
Unless it works.

788
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
Works?

789
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
That's not the right word.

790
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,000
Here is...

791
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,280
This is the only one I've ever read that it seems more like song lyrics than a...

792
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,880
Here is Sandy.

793
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
She is a magical doll.

794
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,680
Period.

795
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,080
Is she...

796
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,800
Hold on.

797
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
Is she a magical doll or a haunted doll?

798
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,120
Is she a magical doll or is she a haunted doll?

799
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,880
Don't fucking get your mythology mixed up.

800
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,320
Magical dolls are wonderful spiritual entities.

801
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,440
Exclamation point.

802
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,320
Okay.

803
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Sandy is somewhat of a white lighter slash dark spirit.

804
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,560
Interesting, isn't it?

805
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,880
How we only got white lighter in the headline

806
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,000
and then we find out later she's kind of a dark spirit also.

807
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,520
I hope you already clicked by it now.

808
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,800
What does that mean?

809
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,400
Oh, oh, oh.

810
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,280
I can answer this.

811
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:35,680
Nothing.

812
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,840
It means she's not all negative energy, just very powerful.

813
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,360
She isn't afraid to use the power.

814
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,160
She's empowered.

815
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:44,880
She's strong.

816
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
She knows her place in the world.

817
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,960
I love this doll.

818
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,960
So she'll watch a marathon of like HGTV with you.

819
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,120
Yes.

820
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
But she might be a little snarky about it during.

821
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Right, so the TV is going to float off the entertainment center.

822
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,800
She is more than a white lighter.

823
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,400
She is an energetic spirit with boundless energy.

824
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,800
She has been used in some dark magic.

825
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,960
Just right when I'm ready to click.

826
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,800
She remains a white lighter.

827
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,320
See this like hot and cold.

828
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,400
Yeah, of of complete dookie nonsense words.

829
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,440
This is the next sentence.

830
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,960
I'm going to read this verbatim.

831
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,920
Sayances.

832
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,160
Oh, she loves sayances.

833
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,840
Don't get me started on sayances.

834
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,400
Oh, this kid with sayances.

835
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,160
Very next sentence follows it up.

836
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,640
Crystal balls are another of her favorites.

837
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,360
Okay, just keep those around.

838
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:49,440
She telepathically has told that she has done some very dark questionable things.

839
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,560
What?

840
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,520
But through those experiences, she has acquired knowledge of magic

841
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,360
through all of her previous owners.

842
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,560
This has made her very powerful.

843
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,960
She said that she only became a dark spirit when necessary.

844
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,320
They pushed her into this.

845
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,760
She didn't want.

846
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,040
Have you seen Prison Break?

847
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,600
Hold on.

848
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,360
I haven't.

849
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,560
Is it about a doll?

850
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,000
I just let her tell me what she wants it to and she tells me a lot.

851
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,360
She loves to telepathic conversations.

852
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,800
She loves to telepathic conversations?

853
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,160
The twinkle in her eyes show how willing she is to please.

854
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,460
Sandy.

855
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,760
Come on.

856
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,760
It's a little kid.

857
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
It's not.

858
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,720
It's a dead little kid.

859
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,760
It's not.

860
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,200
Sandy has been used by some very powerful witches and warlocks.

861
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,040
She's lived with witches, shamans, wizards, fortune tellers, warlocks, and sorcerers.

862
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,080
And Adam Sandler.

863
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,200
And Adam Sandler.

864
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,840
And Adam Sandler, for a brief time, she lived with Channing Tatum in his beach house.

865
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
She is sought after because she enhances their spells so they're very powerful.

866
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,800
If she's sought after, why is she on eBay?

867
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,340
Thank you.

868
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:07,680
By the way, you can place a bid on good old Sandy for $11.99 currently.

869
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,440
So if you're a warlock or a sorcerer, it's good news.

870
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,400
Hey, it started at one penny, but there's a bunch of warlocks and fortune tellers just

871
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,400
running it up one penny at a time.

872
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,560
Okay, this one is a little perplexing for me.

873
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,360
Oh, this is the first perplexing.

874
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,040
She has been used by the very experienced in the magical realm, by those who value her

875
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,600
many gifts.

876
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,360
She has said telepathically, and she has many stories she can tell you.

877
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,280
She's kind of a tailspinner, Sandy.

878
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Have we-

879
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,560
As for-

880
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,520
Hold on, hold on.

881
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,080
As for mortals, only the very experienced or those who have some form of seventh sense

882
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,120
are recommended for her.

883
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,360
What's the seventh one?

884
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,560
The seventh sense?

885
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,400
We got- We found another one?

886
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,320
I think that's taste supreme.

887
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,240
I think it's- I think six is umami.

888
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,000
Seventh is Spidey.

889
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
Sandy is a white lighter connected to the other world.

890
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Jesus Christ, we get it.

891
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,920
Something of a guardian who protects and guides witches, mortals, with magic gifts to protect

892
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
and nurture them as their powers evolve.

893
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,640
However, she is also dark Sandy.

894
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
Will cast spells or put curses on those who have betrayed you.

895
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,240
Which is she mostly though, eBay?

896
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
She will make it her goal to even the score, okay?

897
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,840
Holy shit.

898
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:39,280
You will have to tell her when you think they have had enough, then she will stop.

899
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,340
What?

900
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,620
No!

901
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,240
Are you kidding me?

902
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,800
Who is looking at this like 11.99 though?

903
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,640
Are you serious?

904
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,400
Sandy, please.

905
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,560
Sandy, they've had enough.

906
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,120
We are-

907
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Have they?

908
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,720
Have they?

909
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,680
We are 15 paragraphs in and I still have no idea what this fucking doll looks like.

910
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,240
eBay.

911
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Any kind of description?

912
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,360
No, I can see the image.

913
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,160
It's just like you've given me her biography.

914
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,660
Right.

915
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,800
Just a one sentence.

916
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,480
The doll is also very good.

917
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,840
She is very hyper and will transfer some of her energy to you.

918
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,280
You will be able to feel it as it is electrifying and tingling.

919
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,640
You will just need to tell her where to put that energy into.

920
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,640
You make the decisions.

921
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,320
You make the decisions.

922
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,480
With her around, things start to get better.

923
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
Good luck, happiness, financial, and well-being.

924
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,780
Financial!

925
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,400
She offers an open door for you to wish for what you want and see it come to you.

926
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
She is very helpful with money too.

927
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,880
Okay, now do you mean magical or is she like,

928
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,760
Ooh, spent a lot on gas this month.

929
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,260
She's-

930
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,840
Have you diversified?

931
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,200
She's helpful with money starting now.

932
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,920
After you've bought the haunted doll.

933
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,080
I really like the next line.

934
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,600
This- Oh, okay.

935
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,600
I hate to see her go.

936
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:08,820
She has-

937
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,240
But I love me some $12.

938
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
I'm out of enemies to smite.

939
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,720
She killed all my enemies.

940
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,880
Even Brenda who was mean to me at euchre.

941
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,920
That's- I made that up.

942
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,960
I hate to see her go.

943
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
She has brought me a small windfall of $400.

944
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,300
$400.

945
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:27,800
$400.

946
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,240
$412.

947
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,900
Just when I needed it the most.

948
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,400
How?

949
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,940
This is a bad-

950
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
Okay, you have said-

951
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,020
This doll is in your possession.

952
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,980
You said this doll will make you good at financial.

953
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,060
You said this doll made you $400.

954
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,220
You're selling them for $12.

955
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,900
You are still pretty bad at financial.

956
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,540
All right, this is where this one starts to lose me.

957
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:59,780
I haven't- I have enjoyed her immensely.

958
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:05,620
She has told me telepathically not to get too attached to her as she is just visiting.

959
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,820
I'm a rambler.

960
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,140
Listen, I'm a loner, a rebel.

961
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:16,580
Her owner, who is a witch, said Sandy told her telepathically it was time to go to her next owner

962
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,060
who is waiting for her to let her go.

963
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,060
Wait, what?

964
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
So you're a broker at this point?

965
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,700
You're selling the doll for a witch, you know?

966
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,660
In the meantime, they gave you $400.

967
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,100
Anyway, so that's a haunted doll watch.

968
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,820
Good lord.

969
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,660
You only have five days and 16 hours at this point, so you want to get on that.

970
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,300
That one was like its own cinematic universe.

971
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,700
Which I appreciate it.

972
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,500
Hi everybody, it's- it's Griffin and Travis of The Present.

973
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,380
Hi, hello!

974
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:04,900
Hi!

975
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,220
Didn't see you come in there, stranger.

976
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:09,860
Ah, stranger, kick off your boots, stranger.

977
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,100
Oh, nope, you got the stink feet.

978
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,620
Oh, did you hear me razz them, Trav?

979
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,140
Did you hear me razz our listeners?

980
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,100
Got them.

981
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,060
Yeah, that'll teach them for listening to our show.

982
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:23,700
Justin's in the toilet again, and I'm sorry that that's what I say every time Justin's not here,

983
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,700
but it's never not true.

984
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,580
Yeah, I mean, statistically speaking.

985
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,060
For sure, so thank you for listening to our Houston live show.

986
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:35,620
Justin is on a toilet vacation this week, and so we miss him very much.

987
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:38,260
We hope you enjoy our Houston show.

988
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,620
One note before we forget, before we get into the money zone,

989
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,140
uh, is that the next part you're gonna hear in the Houston show is actually- this is an older episode,

990
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,900
uh, so this is before we did our new way of doing audience questions.

991
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,980
Uh, they're still good, but I didn't want you to think that we'd stop this bold new innovation in

992
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,540
question solicitation technology.

993
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:05,220
Um, but yeah, that's- that's coming up soon, but first off, Travis is gonna tell us all about fucking Squarespace.

994
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:09,460
I also want to say, real quick, before I get to fucking Squarespace, I want to talk about, real quick,

995
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,580
thank you to everybody who came out to all of our, uh, book events for the Adventure Zone graphic novel,

996
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:21,380
which is out now in, uh, fine bookstores, and you can find different places to order it online at theadventurezonecomic.com.

997
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,820
Thank you to everybody who's bought it so far, and everyone who will buy it in the future,

998
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,180
and I really appreciate everybody who came out to all the, uh, Comic-Con events.

999
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:29,620
It was just lovely.

1000
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,620
So, let me tell you about Squarespace.

1001
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,100
Listen, I love Squarespace very much.

1002
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,300
I use it for a lot of projects, including macroshows.com.

1003
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,100
You can turn your cool ideas into a new website.

1004
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,220
That's the most wonderful thing.

1005
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,100
If you have a spontaneous website, boom, you hop on there.

1006
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,020
You can have it up in, like, 30 minutes.

1007
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:50,340
It's, like, take your idea, make it a website in, like, a half hour.

1008
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,460
Showcase your work, announce upcoming events or special projects.

1009
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,140
They have beautiful templates, uh, created by world-class designers,

1010
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:01,380
and they have an e-commerce functionality, so you can sell things online,

1011
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,380
and it's free and secure hosting, and there's nothing to patch or upgrade ever.

1012
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:08,580
They have 24-7, uh, help desk,

1013
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,700
and you can find, like, you know, tutorial videos for anything you want to do.

1014
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,340
So, there's really nothing stopping you from having an amazing website online now.

1015
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,460
Yeah, but this e-commerce function has got me thinking, Trav.

1016
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,260
I think I'm gonna make the website to sell my hat.

1017
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,380
Okay, just the one hat?

1018
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,020
Yeah, you know that hat I have, and I've been looking to get rid of it for a while

1019
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,860
to raise some funds for a new, a different hat, a new hat.

1020
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1021
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,540
So, uh, I'll get that up online and make sure to tweet the link out,

1022
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,980
and, um, someone buy my, someone buy my fucking hat.

1023
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:45,540
You know, I've got a lot of those, uh, I got a lot of movies in HD format,

1024
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,700
like, when you could buy the HD disc before Blu-ray.

1025
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,220
The HD DVD, yeah.

1026
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,460
Yeah, and when it was unclear which one it was gonna be,

1027
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:56,100
and I have about, let me do a quick check, uh, 475 HD DVDs.

1028
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,580
Yeah, they're all Patch Adams, too.

1029
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,740
Um, but where can I get Squarespace?

1030
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,020
Well, head to squarespace.com slash my brother for a free trial,

1031
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,780
and when you're ready to launch, use the offer code mybrother, all one word,

1032
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,140
to save 10% off your first purchase of a website or domain.

1033
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,460
That's squarespace.com slash mybrother, and enter the code mybrother, all one word.

1034
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:19,460
And if you use the promo code mybrother on, uh, buygriffinshat.biz, uh,

1035
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,700
the Squarespace website, uh, you will get, as a free sort of promotional item

1036
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,140
with the hat, 475 HD copies of Patch Adams.

1037
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:28,340
That is correct.

1038
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,020
I wanna tell you about stamps.com, too,

1039
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,060
cause they are, they have been sort of really very vital to me in this project

1040
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:41,460
of, uh, shipping 475 DVD, HD DVDs of Patch Adams, um, because what they do

1041
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,900
is they make it much easier to ship all the stuff that you wanna ship.

1042
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,940
Because these days, listen, you can get pretty much anything on demand,

1043
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:51,460
like our podcast, you listen whenever you want, when it's convenient for you.

1044
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,100
So why take trips to the post office to mail letters and packages

1045
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,100
when you can do all that stuff with postage on demand at stamps.com?

1046
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,580
They let you access all the amazing services of the post office

1047
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,980
right from your desk, 24-7.

1048
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:05,620
Buy and print official US postage for any letter, any package,

1049
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,460
using your own computer and printer.

1050
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,580
It's easy, come on.

1051
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:12,980
So stamps.com is very, very, uh, a very, very good service.

1052
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:16,980
I always get sort of, um, anxious whenever I have to leave the house for any reason.

1053
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,460
And so not, you know, losing one reason to leave the house

1054
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,420
with stamps.com is very valuable for me.

1055
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,900
And you can sort of share in my, uh, hermetic, is that the word, hermetic?

1056
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,460
Yeah, sure.

1057
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,660
Hermetic nature.

1058
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,300
If you use My Brother for this special offer,

1059
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:39,620
it includes $55 free postage, a digital scale, and a four-week trial.

1060
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,620
Um, I should say that's a code, My Brother, and don't use Travis or Justin.

1061
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,220
Yeah, yeah, please.

1062
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,100
But also don't wait, go to stamps.com and before you do anything else,

1063
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,340
you click on the radio microphone at the top of the home page

1064
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,580
and you type in My Brother, all one word, that's stamps.com, enter My Brother.

1065
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,060
Griffin, I've just had a terrible realization,

1066
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:01,700
because from time to time we'll make a goof about, like, some obscure movie title

1067
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,220
or weird format of something and then people will, like,

1068
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,420
bring it to us at live shows or, like, ship it to us.

1069
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,380
And I'm just picturing someone right now listening to this episode,

1070
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,780
looking to their right, seeing that HD DVD copy of Patch Addams and thinking,

1071
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,340
oh, finally, I can be freed from this curse and hand this off.

1072
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,140
Please do not.

1073
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:23,060
I've already got 475 of them.

1074
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:23,780
Oh, Jesus.

1075
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:28,340
What was the movie that somebody sent us a full box of VHS copies of?

1076
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,980
I believe it was, uh, You, Me, and Dupree?

1077
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,380
Ah, I don't think that was right.

1078
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,260
You don't think that's it?

1079
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:35,620
Was it Nutty Professor on VHS?

1080
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,460
I think it may have been Nutty Professor.

1081
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,220
Jesus, that was a long time ago,

1082
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,540
but it's exactly the kind of thing that you're talking about, Travis,

1083
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,460
and we should be more responsible.

1084
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,660
I just, I already have so many HD DVD copies of Patch Addams.

1085
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,980
Please don't send us Patch.

1086
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,420
You want to read this first Jumbotron?

1087
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,140
I do.

1088
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,140
It's for Andy, and it's from Sadie.

1089
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,860
And Sadie says,

1090
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,100
To my good, good husband, Andy.

1091
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:03,540
I hope this fills your heart with love and joy as we celebrate first one year of marriage.

1092
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,180
Our April 1st wedding was, in fact, no joke.

1093
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,460
Oh, that's good.

1094
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,580
But I know the rest of our lives will be filled with fun and adventures.

1095
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,140
Walter and Doug say they think they should vote.

1096
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:14,660
I assume those are dogs.

1097
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,900
Also, I'm a clam, you idiot.

1098
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:17,780
Thunder up.

1099
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,820
Always and forever.

1100
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,460
Love, Sadie.

1101
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,620
Now that was supposed to be for April 1st.

1102
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,380
April Fools, Andy.

1103
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,940
Your wedding message is three months, four months, whatever.

1104
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,020
He got you, sucker.

1105
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,580
Got you.

1106
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,700
What a good prank.

1107
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:34,740
Here's a message for Greg, and it's from Jeff Goldblum,

1108
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,060
big fan of the show, big supporter of our art.

1109
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,500
Jeff Goldblum says to Greg,

1110
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,340
Simply, soon.

1111
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,340
Soon.

1112
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,540
So Greg, look out.

1113
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,020
Jeff Goldblum has lots of sort of ways and means,

1114
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,780
lots of crafty sort of devious machinations.

1115
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,380
And the time's coming.

1116
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,500
And the time's coming.

1117
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,300
And he knows all your passwords and stuff.

1118
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,180
I'm so sorry.

1119
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:01,460
I'm so sorry that this is the last time I get to talk to Greg, but it's been great.

1120
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,660
Head on, Swivel Greg.

1121
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,940
Stiff up a lip.

1122
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,860
Sorry about your Goldblumening.

1123
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,900
Yes, it's happening.

1124
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,500
How about this final Jumbotron?

1125
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,300
Yes, I would love to.

1126
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,500
It's for Dan W.

1127
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,460
It's from Suzanne.

1128
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,020
Congratulations to Dan from Suzanne and her clones on getting your-

1129
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:16,520
Whoa.

1130
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,660
Whoa, okay.

1131
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,820
From Suzanne and her clones on getting your first-

1132
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:22,740
Did they all pay us for-

1133
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,900
I guess.

1134
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,860
For this message?

1135
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,620
Because I didn't know that that was sort of a benefit to clone technology.

1136
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,220
I thought it was just like more sheep.

1137
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:32,520
Okay.

1138
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,100
On getting your first real job at 36.

1139
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,180
Wow, that was a good streak, Dan.

1140
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:42,180
Hope you enjoy shooting lasers at brain tumors for many years to come.

1141
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,300
Yeah, fuck them up.

1142
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,900
Yeah, we're very proud.

1143
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,380
I hope you enjoy star foxing tumors-

1144
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:47,860
Hell yeah.

1145
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,060
For many years to come.

1146
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:54,900
We're very proud that you are so close to making all of second grade Dan's dreams come true.

1147
00:50:54,900 --> 00:51:00,980
Love, Suzanne, Helen, Jane, and a daughter to be named later, or possibly already, if after March.

1148
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:01,780
Yup.

1149
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:04,260
Yup, probably a little bit after March.

1150
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,740
Is this the only job where you get to use-

1151
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,500
You know, killing lasers?

1152
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,580
Again, still, you know, bad stuff like brain tumors.

1153
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,500
But I can't think of too many other jobs where you get the, you know, laser technology.

1154
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,420
I don't know.

1155
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,700
I'm trying to think, I guess-

1156
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,780
I mean, there's like men in black, of course.

1157
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,540
Yeah, but there's hard to get a men in black job.

1158
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,900
Oh, tell me about it.

1159
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,100
Yeah, in this economy?

1160
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,860
So yeah, that's gonna be it.

1161
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,180
We're gonna hop back into the show.

1162
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:39,700
In case we don't say in the show, thank you to John Roderick in the long winters for the use of the theme song.

1163
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:42,740
It's the departure of the album, putting the days to bed.

1164
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:48,500
Go to theadventurezonecomic.com or just look at your local bookstores.

1165
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,460
What else, Griffin?

1166
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,740
Thanks to Maximum Fun.

1167
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,220
I'm pretty sure we cover all this in the live show.

1168
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,820
But just thank you all for supporting our stuff that we do.

1169
00:51:58,820 --> 00:51:59,700
It really means a lot.

1170
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:08,500
I always get very sentimental after a tour like we just got back from that we get to live these very, very weird, cool lives.

1171
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:15,700
And that's 100% because you all have supported us for, you know, like nine years, going on nine years now.

1172
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:21,540
So we really appreciate y'all and we'll be back next week with a regular episode.

1173
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,420
You know, Griffin, real quick, you mentioned Maximum Fun.

1174
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:29,300
I just want to say, I got to spend a lot of time with the cast of Bubble this week at San Diego Comic Con.

1175
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,420
And I'm all caught up on it.

1176
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,740
And it is so, so very good.

1177
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,660
You should check it out on MaximumFun.org.

1178
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,780
Bubble, it's great.

1179
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,620
But that's it.

1180
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:39,780
Here's the rest of the episode and we'll be back next week.

1181
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,280
Bye.

1182
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,300
Are stacks of unread books taking over your apartment?

1183
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,100
Do you constantly miss your train stop because you're caught up in reading?

1184
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,140
I'm Bria Grant.

1185
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,420
And I'm Mallory O'Mara.

1186
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,540
We party hard.

1187
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:54,020
And by party hard, we mean read books.

1188
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:59,460
So join us every Thursday on Reading Glasses, a Maximum Fun podcast about reading and book culture.

1189
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,980
Get more out of your reading life.

1190
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,140
We'll help you conquer your to-be-read pile.

1191
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,340
Get out of that book slump.

1192
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:07,380
And squeeze more reading time into your busy day.

1193
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,460
Learn how to read better.

1194
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,420
Wow, that was good.

1195
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,420
We're going to do audience questions now.

1196
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,420
Some ground rules.

1197
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:20,500
No, Bummer's is a good one.

1198
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,460
You guys lay it out for them.

1199
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:24,180
I just got to check my socks.

1200
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,380
Justin's going to the bathroom.

1201
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:26,740
Justin's using the restroom.

1202
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,260
Okay.

1203
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,460
There's one right off stage.

1204
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,420
It's so convenient.

1205
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,100
Hello.

1206
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,820
My name's EJ.

1207
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:34,100
Hi, EJ.

1208
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,820
She, her, hers.

1209
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,340
My question is, I work for a mattress company.

1210
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,740
We've gotten in trouble in the past.

1211
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,780
Don't say which one.

1212
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,980
We've had two different times where somebody emails us the day after a live show like,

1213
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,260
can you delete it?

1214
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:50,820
No, not that.

1215
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,940
We just don't want you to get fired if you're like, anyway, they all stink.

1216
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,340
No, no, no.

1217
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,940
All the mattresses are full of farts.

1218
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:56,980
Not at all.

1219
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:00,580
This is a question about my customers, actually.

1220
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,180
All my customers are full of farts.

1221
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,540
I'm sure that's not EJ.

1222
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:06,100
One second.

1223
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,580
I have to say, this is a beautiful sort of symphonic space.

1224
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,380
And we went down.

1225
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:13,780
The green room is on a level called Musicians.

1226
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:18,020
And when I went and sat down on the couch, Griffin said, hey, Justin, how many chillist farts

1227
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:21,620
do you think are in that thing?

1228
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,900
My brother's funny.

1229
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,220
All right.

1230
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:23,780
Sorry, EJ.

1231
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,260
What we got?

1232
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:31,380
So a lot of folks will ask me kind of casually.

1233
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,060
I think most of them are probably joking.

1234
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:34,340
Most of my customers are pretty chill.

1235
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:38,660
But they'll ask me what beds are the best to kind of like bone down on.

1236
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,580
Strangers ask you this?

1237
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,860
And I don't want to get fired.

1238
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,260
Yeah.

1239
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:48,740
But it's a super inappropriate question.

1240
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,100
But I want to find out what's a good way to answer that question.

1241
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:52,580
OK.

1242
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:56,580
For a second there, I thought you were going to say, and I've let them know.

1243
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,460
There is an answer.

1244
00:54:58,900 --> 00:54:59,700
OK.

1245
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,700
EJ, here's what I would do if I was you.

1246
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,380
Say, well, that all depends.

1247
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,100
Can you please stand on this bed and show me how you do it?

1248
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,820
And then you turn on a camera and leave the room.

1249
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:16,820
And it's Tom Brady who's come to have sex with that mattress.

1250
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,460
Travis, you've got to drop the Tom Brady.

1251
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,940
Tom Brady's going to have sex with that mattress.

1252
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,900
So here's what you do.

1253
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,860
The next time someone asks you that question, you say, what do you mean?

1254
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,980
And you just keep asking them to explain over and over again until they leave.

1255
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:31,780
So good.

1256
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,700
No, I'm sorry.

1257
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,060
I must be missing something.

1258
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,100
Bone down?

1259
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,820
What?

1260
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:37,860
Start from the beginning.

1261
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:39,620
OK.

1262
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,340
Here's your answer.

1263
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,380
You want a bed?

1264
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,660
Where you sleep?

1265
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:56,020
I think I think I think there is a correct answer.

1266
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:01,220
And I think to punish these fucking despicable people who would come in and ask a stranger

1267
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,580
this, you point them to the worst possible answer.

1268
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:06,100
Oh, you want the sex bed?

1269
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,540
It's the the nasty, rusty Springtron 2000.

1270
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,740
Why do we sell that one?

1271
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,220
They take that.

1272
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,100
Just for sex.

1273
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,860
They put that one on the box spring and they're like, all right, let's get busy.

1274
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,180
Spring shoots out.

1275
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,540
Stab, stab, stab.

1276
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:20,500
Oh, no.

1277
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,140
And you say, I guess you aren't doing it right now.

1278
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,340
You got to know how to handle it.

1279
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,820
If you weren't ready, high risk, high reward with the Springtron.

1280
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,340
You asked for the best.

1281
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:29,460
This is the best.

1282
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,100
Does that help?

1283
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:31,540
It helps a lot.

1284
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,580
Thank you so much.

1285
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:38,820
Hey, what's up?

1286
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,140
Hi, I'm Tom.

1287
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,100
They them.

1288
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:42,580
Hi, Tom.

1289
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,460
Hi, Tom.

1290
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,420
So thanks, Paul.

1291
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:48,980
Jesus.

1292
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:55,140
Do not touch me with that rag after his touch these two other boys.

1293
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,100
So I'm dating two people.

1294
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,180
Um, not in like a cheating way.

1295
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:02,740
Okay.

1296
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,420
We're in like a, hold on.

1297
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,740
You were pretty like, what would it have been funnier though if we've been like, oh, what?

1298
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,900
No, it would have been funnier if two people in this audience has stood up and it's been like, what?

1299
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:21,140
And they were sitting with an NPC between them.

1300
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,540
No, my girlfriend is here.

1301
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,020
Okay.

1302
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,580
Hello.

1303
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,140
Yeah.

1304
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,820
Um, so we're in like a polyamorous triad.

1305
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,300
Okay.

1306
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,820
Um, yeah.

1307
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,740
Um, so.

1308
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,180
Drawing on our expertise.

1309
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:34,660
Go ahead.

1310
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,460
Uh, so.

1311
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,700
Triad sounds so much fucking cooler than couple, by the way.

1312
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,260
Yeah.

1313
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,180
Yeah, that's the, that's the word for it.

1314
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,940
That's fucking dope.

1315
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:46,260
Yeah.

1316
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,060
Okay, sorry, go ahead.

1317
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,100
Um, so this is a healthy, happy relationship.

1318
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,260
I'm, I've been with my girlfriend for two years.

1319
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,980
She, I, and our boyfriend are going on two years as well.

1320
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,300
Okay.

1321
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:00,580
Um, my family's cool with me being gay and all that.

1322
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:06,980
But, um, how do I explain to people that I am dating two people and it's not like cheating?

1323
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,300
And also how do I explain it's not a sex thing?

1324
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:11,700
Yeah.

1325
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,700
I imagine the same people.

1326
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,820
I imagine the same people who would ask you about that are the same people who would walk

1327
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:25,060
into a fucking mattress store and ask for tons of sex mattresses.

1328
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:30,740
We need to start installing traps in the ground every 20 fucking feet.

1329
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,500
And anytime anybody says some bullshit, you're just like, hey, can you follow me over here

1330
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,460
for a second?

1331
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:40,260
If you're, if you're cool, you get an app on your phone and you press the button and

1332
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,260
one of the every 20 foot traps falls.

1333
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,780
And if you hear somebody say, say, which ones the sex mattresses are for sex, bam.

1334
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,900
And there's not spikes in the pip, it's hard to get out.

1335
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,180
And eventually they'll learn.

1336
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,140
There's not spikes in the pip, it's just like everyone that they respect at the bottom

1337
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,180
going, what did you say?

1338
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,220
What got you here?

1339
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,300
Man, shit's bad right now.

1340
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:03,940
Can I ask you a question?

1341
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,660
Serious question.

1342
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:10,420
When you, if you encounter a person that is like unfamiliar or like unexposed to people

1343
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,580
who are living a polyamorous lifestyle, are you the sort of person who like minds sort

1344
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,300
of taking the time to educate the people or are you like fucking over it?

1345
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
Um, I don't mind really.

1346
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,860
Like, um, I remember I started telling people when I was in like high school and honestly

1347
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:29,060
a lot of people there were just like, you're dating two people?

1348
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:29,700
That's sick.

1349
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,500
That's like the other response you don't want.

1350
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,540
Like, it's actually flattering because like the idea that like their minds are blown

1351
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,420
like, whoa, two of them?

1352
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,380
You can have two of them?

1353
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,260
That I get the same thing when I tell people I just ordered two dinners at a restaurant.

1354
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,940
He always does.

1355
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,820
Every day this tour.

1356
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,500
And by the way, it's not equating these things.

1357
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,700
No, it's not the same.

1358
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,220
I just get the same response.

1359
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:56,500
You got two?

1360
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:57,860
I did.

1361
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,460
Except usually it's a lot more concerned when they say it to me.

1362
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,220
You got two?

1363
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:04,020
You got two?

1364
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,060
Oh no.

1365
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,020
What's the split?

1366
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,580
If you do not mind me asking, what's the split like these days when you tell somebody like

1367
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,660
50-50 like, what?

1368
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,260
To like people who are like, oh, I get it.

1369
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:20,260
Well, I think it depends on who I'm talking to because when it's people my own age, a

1370
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,860
lot of the time they'll either get it or if they don't know, they'll just be like, oh,

1371
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:24,660
that's a thing.

1372
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:33,300
But compared to like, if I started to tell my 50-year-old Republican Christian mother.

1373
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,020
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1374
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:37,860
Then it doesn't, then it doesn't.

1375
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:40,820
You didn't finish the sentence, but it doesn't go good, I bet.

1376
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:45,860
But it's like, it really does depend on who I'm talking to.

1377
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:52,420
And so when I get the vibe from someone that like, maybe their views don't match with

1378
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,700
mine, I'll try to avoid it.

1379
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:00,820
Well, I'll tell you the kind of the same thing about the mattress question of like, if...

1380
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:04,020
So here's some other things Travis is going to compare your relationship to.

1381
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:04,500
No, no, no.

1382
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,500
Two dinners, Tom Brady having sex with a mattress.

1383
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,780
Oh, yeah, and I forgot to say my boyfriend is a body pillow.

1384
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:12,260
Oh, good.

1385
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,700
Okay, well, I mean, specifically, if someone makes like weird sex joke comments about it,

1386
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,700
that the impetus is then not on you to make that okay.

1387
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,260
Yes.

1388
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:23,060
That's that.

1389
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,780
So like, if somebody says something, I think you're in a position to go, what do you mean

1390
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:26,260
by that?

1391
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:28,900
They're putting you in a position where you have to explain yourself.

1392
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:29,460
No, no, no.

1393
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:30,660
You don't have to do that.

1394
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:31,860
Make them explain themselves.

1395
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,700
I have a position you can put them in though.

1396
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:41,700
I have a better position you can put them in, and it is 10 feet immediately below where

1397
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,900
they were just standing.

1398
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,100
I'm just saying, it doesn't have to be in every city.

1399
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,420
We can get these in San Francisco, Houston.

1400
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:56,580
You would only have to establish 100 trap doors across America, but no one knows where

1401
01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:57,060
they are.

1402
01:01:57,060 --> 01:01:57,540
Yes.

1403
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:58,900
And then the threat is there.

1404
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,620
The threat is there.

1405
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,620
All right, Tom, you understand how deep...

1406
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:06,580
Again, I've never had a challenge like this in my life, so we're kind of out of our lane

1407
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:07,780
right now, but I would say this.

1408
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,780
The fact that you're willing to take the time to explain your lifestyle, which is such a

1409
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:20,180
personal thing, is deeply unfair that you have to do that, but super cool of you because

1410
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:24,820
what I would keep in mind when you're doing that is that you're making it literally 100%

1411
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:28,180
easier for the next person behind you and over and over and over again.

1412
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,180
It's a shame, but I think it's so rad that you're doing it because you're making life

1413
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:33,460
better for everybody else.

1414
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:39,940
So thank you from me, a straight white dude that has to explain nothing other than his

1415
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:40,900
t-shirt choices.

1416
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,140
But thank you, Tom, for your work.

1417
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,580
Should I just...

1418
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:51,380
If they ask if it's a sex thing, should I just be like, what is sex?

1419
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:51,620
Yes.

1420
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:52,820
Yes, exactly.

1421
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:54,660
I think that's going to get us out of a lot of situations.

1422
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:55,620
A lot of jams.

1423
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,740
Explain to me, what is a sex?

1424
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,020
What is in detail?

1425
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,700
Birds, bees, what do those have to...

1426
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:06,580
Are these two things having sex with each other?

1427
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,860
Take it back to the beginning.

1428
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,820
What kind of horrible cross reads are we getting from birds and bees?

1429
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,460
Why are the birds and the bees...

1430
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,060
No wonder the bees are disappearing.

1431
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,300
They're getting crushed by the bird or a bee.

1432
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,620
Anyway, Tom, does that help?

1433
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,580
Did I switch those?

1434
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,620
I did, didn't I?

1435
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,220
Birds aren't disappearing, bees are.

1436
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,740
But have we checked on birds?

1437
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,140
Birds, everybody, bird count.

1438
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:26,740
Tom, does that help?

1439
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:27,940
Yes, it does.

1440
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:28,180
Thank you.

1441
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:28,740
Okay, cool.

1442
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,860
Imagine my surprise.

1443
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,340
Thank you.

1444
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:40,340
All right, we're going to do one more.

1445
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,780
I'm Lindsay.

1446
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,660
Hi, Lindsay.

1447
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,580
My question revolves around my dog.

1448
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,420
So my husband and I rescued a dog when we moved down to Houston.

1449
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,100
From like a burning building or like a...

1450
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:54,020
I mean, we moved and then pretty immediately adopted her.

1451
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,380
So I say it was pretty important part.

1452
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:55,940
Yeah, for sure.

1453
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,340
Or would you say maybe your dog rescued you?

1454
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,100
I like that, Travis.

1455
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,220
From a burning building?

1456
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:05,380
Yeah, I think that's fair to say.

1457
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:11,140
But I have a thing where I really, really like to buy toys for her

1458
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,340
because she very much appreciates them because she had a hard life before.

1459
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,140
The problem is she has probably over a hundred toys by now.

1460
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,980
Is that bad?

1461
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:27,140
So I guess my question is, what is a socially acceptable amount of toys for me to purchase for my dog?

1462
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:32,900
I have a very important follow-up question that I think will determine the long answer, the short answer.

1463
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,100
And it's very important.

1464
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,100
Is she a good girl?

1465
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,100
Of course she is.

1466
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:40,100
Yes, she is.

1467
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,620
She is the best.

1468
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,140
All right, we'll come back to that.

1469
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:45,140
Hey.

1470
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,140
Hi.

1471
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,140
I'm going to make this very clear up front because it's important to the story.

1472
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,140
My actual name is Joe.

1473
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:53,140
Okay.

1474
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,140
Now, I started working at a new job here in Houston about six months ago.

1475
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:01,140
And before I started working there and moved here, I got an email from my boss saying,

1476
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:05,140
hey, just want to let you know there's been two other Joes before you,

1477
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:21,140
and it's been kind of iffy with them when they left, so we're going to call you Max from now on.

1478
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:25,140
At first, this was okay.

1479
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,140
Until they got to the point...

1480
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,140
Was it?

1481
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:31,140
New city, new me, man.

1482
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:33,140
I had to start new.

1483
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:35,140
We're in a fugue state.

1484
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:41,140
This is how Tyler Durden spawns.

1485
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,140
It gets a little better.

1486
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,140
So I started working...

1487
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,140
They stopped.

1488
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:49,140
Bye.

1489
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,140
Anyways, I just wanted to brag about this cool thing that happened.

1490
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:57,140
I started working and like the paperwork started getting drawn up for like payroll and like healthcare and all that stuff.

1491
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,140
And I was walking with my boss and one of the people from HR and they were like, yeah, this is Max, blah, blah, blah.

1492
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:05,140
And they're like, oh, Max, we're going to start doing all your paperwork and your social security stuff.

1493
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,140
And I was like, no, that won't match up with the number that's on the card.

1494
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,140
But then it did. What's going on?

1495
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,140
What?

1496
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:19,140
It's even gotten to the point where the CEO didn't even know my real name at the Christmas party when he called me.

1497
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,140
Well, why would they?

1498
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,140
He knew me by Max.

1499
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,140
Yeah.

1500
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:29,140
Listen, hey, folks, if somebody tries to call you by a name that you don't want to be called, tell them no.

1501
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,140
I will be Joe.

1502
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,140
I will be Joe today and all other days for I am Joe.

1503
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,140
That's the thing.

1504
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:37,140
If they're like, hey, we had some bad experiences with Joe.

1505
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:39,140
You say, I can fix that.

1506
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:41,140
This is a new Joe.

1507
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,140
Another thing you could say.

1508
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:45,140
There's a new Joe in town.

1509
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:49,140
Another thing you could say is if they say, we don't want to call you Joe because we've had bad Joes before.

1510
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:53,140
You could say a very reasonable thing, which is what the fuck are you talking about?

1511
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,140
Well, wait, they told me.

1512
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,140
No, no, no.

1513
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,140
That's nothing.

1514
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:01,140
Yo, Joe Max, you're in way too deep.

1515
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:05,140
You're buying them bullshit now.

1516
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:07,140
This is fucking nothing.

1517
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:13,140
This, by the way, is a con this business is running on you where they have had a fake account set up in the name of Max whatever.

1518
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:15,140
You're taking the fall.

1519
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,140
Yeah, dude.

1520
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:19,140
No question.

1521
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:21,140
They're cooking the books under your name and they're like, we're going to call you Max from now on so they can pin it on you.

1522
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:23,140
You've got to Shawshank your way out of there.

1523
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,140
Take those books with you.

1524
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:29,140
If you walk in tomorrow, there's going to be a big sign up front that says Max's place.

1525
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,140
All legal inquiries, please, to Max.

1526
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:33,140
It's his place.

1527
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:35,140
Does that help?

1528
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,140
We didn't say anything.

1529
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,140
Quit that fucking job.

1530
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,140
But you know what?

1531
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,140
Max, you having the strange courage.

1532
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:45,140
Joe!

1533
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,140
You made it worse.

1534
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:49,140
Not like this.

1535
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:55,140
Joe, there's no excuse for what I've just done.

1536
01:07:55,140 --> 01:08:01,140
It's very hot up here and as you can see, I'm sorry, Joe.

1537
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,140
And isn't that what we're here for?

1538
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,140
You didn't say anything.

1539
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,140
Joe, does that help?

1540
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,140
Yes.

1541
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,140
Go in tomorrow and quit.

1542
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:15,140
No!

1543
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,140
It's been six months I just moved here from Virginia.

1544
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:21,140
I've got it.

1545
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:25,140
Next time someone calls you Max, say, oh, it's actually pronounced Joe.

1546
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,140
The M-A-X is silent.

1547
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,140
Yeah.

1548
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,140
Keep that going for a while.

1549
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,140
Joe's invisible.

1550
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,140
Does that help Joe set us free to say yes?

1551
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,140
Joe, tomorrow's Monday.

1552
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,140
Take your name back, Joe.

1553
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:49,140
100 toys for one extremely good dog sounds like the perfect number to me.

1554
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,140
Right.

1555
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,140
Are they small toys, big toys?

1556
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,140
Are you talking about little Tonka trucks?

1557
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,140
No, mostly stuffed animals like Tigger or Stitch.

1558
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:03,140
How do you get 100 continuously functioning toys in your house that don't get destroyed?

1559
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,140
She does not tear apart toys.

1560
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:07,140
Oh, she is a good girl.

1561
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,140
What does she do with them?

1562
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,140
She nibbles on them.

1563
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:13,140
She what?

1564
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:15,140
She nibbles on them.

1565
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:17,140
You got any pics?

1566
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:19,140
Yeah.

1567
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:21,140
Just tweet them at us later.

1568
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,140
Do you have room for one more toy?

1569
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,140
Say that again.

1570
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:27,140
Do you have room for one more toy?

1571
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,140
I don't have my wallet.

1572
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,140
I thought you were going to volunteer.

1573
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:33,140
No, it just sounds like a good dog.

1574
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,140
I want to do something nice.

1575
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:39,140
What you could do is take some of the older toys and give them to dogs that need them.

1576
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,140
The thing about that is what you like and I get it because I have a three-year-old.

1577
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,140
It is the same thing.

1578
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,140
No question.

1579
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:53,140
I get a new toy and she is so excited to see it and she is down for 15 minutes and it is on the next thing.

1580
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:59,140
Then you take that to Goodwill, give that toy to them and then you can get more toys and not feel guilty because you have plenty of space.

1581
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,140
That is a great idea.

1582
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,140
Whoa.

1583
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,140
We got one at the buzzer.

1584
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,140
Swish.

1585
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:09,140
Does that help?

1586
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,140
Very much so.

1587
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,140
All right.

1588
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:15,140
First, thank you, Jones Hall.

1589
01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:17,140
Yes.

1590
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,140
You are amazing.

1591
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,140
Thank you, Houston.

1592
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,140
Thank you, Bayou City.

1593
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:25,140
Thank you, Clutch City.

1594
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:27,140
Thank you, Space City.

1595
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:31,140
Thank you, Magnolia City, which is not used as much anymore, but it is a historical one.

1596
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:33,140
Look into it.

1597
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,140
Can we get a big thank you for Paul Sabourin?

1598
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,140
Thank you, Paul.

1599
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,140
How about a big thank you for...

1600
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,140
Well, hold on.

1601
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:43,140
Paul Sabourin has a band called Paul and Storm, which you should look up.

1602
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,140
Yes.

1603
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,140
Paulandstorm.livejournal.com.

1604
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:49,140
You can hear all of their tracks.

1605
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:51,140
Thank you to Schmanners for their opening act performance.

1606
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:53,140
Listen to that running gag.

1607
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,140
If you Google Paul and Storm, you will find their music.

1608
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,140
Here is what you got to understand.

1609
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:59,140
A running gag between live shows on a tour doesn't work.

1610
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,140
It is different people.

1611
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:05,140
I just thought they would laugh because it is so irreverent.

1612
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,140
Thank you to...

1613
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,140
I am assuming Paulandstorm.com. Paul, is that right?

1614
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,140
Yep.

1615
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,140
Thank you to Schmanners.

1616
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:15,140
Yes.

1617
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,140
Thank you to our daddy.

1618
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,140
Thank you, daddy.

1619
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:25,140
Thank you to John Roderick and the Long Winters for the use of our theme song as a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1620
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:27,140
Very good.

1621
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:31,140
Thank you to Max Fun for having us and thank you for donating to the Max Fun Drive.

1622
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,140
Thank you.

1623
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:39,140
Anything else before we wrap up this Texas-sized tour, which is to say three shows.

1624
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:45,140
Two cities, three shows, Texas style.

1625
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:47,140
Four different naps just for me.

1626
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:55,140
We thank you all for coming, but I do want to say, I am assuming there is at least a few people who decided to come just because we whined so much about people not coming to this show.

1627
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,140
Because you thought it would mean something to us and I just wanted to say you were right.

1628
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:01,140
Thank you.

1629
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:03,140
Thank you so much for doing that.

1630
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,140
It is very sweet of you.

1631
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:09,140
And to the folks who bought tickets on the minute that they became available.

1632
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,140
You are all very important to us.

1633
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,140
You are all important to us in God's eyes.

1634
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:19,140
What?

1635
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:21,140
Here is a final yahoo.

1636
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:23,140
It was sent in by Bill Morrison.

1637
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:25,140
It was sent in by Bill Morrison.

1638
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:27,140
Thank you Bill.

1639
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,140
It is from yahoo answers user.

1640
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:31,140
Jones Nate asks.

1641
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,140
What?

1642
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:35,140
Jones Nate?

1643
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:37,140
Jones Nate asks.

1644
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,140
It is their name.

1645
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:43,140
What was the name of the book about the giant hero dog?

1646
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:45,140
Not Clifford!

1647
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:49,140
My name is Justin McElroy.

1648
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,140
I am Travis McElroy.

1649
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:53,140
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1650
01:12:53,140 --> 01:13:21,140
Kiss your dad square on the lips.

1651
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:27,140
The news today is terrible.

1652
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:31,140
So why not forget about it while listening to Jonah Radio with Cash Hartzell.

1653
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,140
Hey everybody.

1654
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:35,140
Featuring Neil Mahoney.

1655
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,140
Also me.

1656
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,140
This is a podcast where we play music submitted by listeners.

1657
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:45,140
We hang out, we listen to new tunes and we take submissions at JonahRadio at gmail.com.

1658
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:47,140
Come and check us out.

1659
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:49,140
We are here anyway.

1660
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,140
We will be here.

1661
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,140
I hope this one goes.
