1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,660
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,220
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modren era

9
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:19,300
I'm laughing already just get excited about these these jokes

10
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,140
I'm Justin mackerel your oldest brother. I'm Travis the unappreciative I

11
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,380
Don't think you can say that. I am I'm feeling it Griffin

12
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,540
Yeah, but it does smack of like now appreciate. Do you know what I mean? Yeah?

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,780
Yeah, why do you think I would say Griffin if I wasn't saying like I wish my brothers appreciated the hardware. Oh, it's us

14
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,500
Okay, I yeah, I thought you were saying like the audience. No, I'm universally beloved, but

15
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,280
No, well, I don't know if you guys love me

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,960
I don't want to put though. I just know that you don't appreciate the hard work that I do for you

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,860
Okay, because these day in day out. I'm deep in there mining that good content on tik-tok

18
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:08,580
Curating a certain amount of like quality content for you. I texted you guys no response. Yeah

19
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,100
Yeah, like I get I send you like two to five tik-toks a day. Yeah, man. I mean I mean

20
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,700
Minimum I mean sometimes there are good days, you know where you go down the mines and you're like, oh

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,660
I was going for 16 tons, but I got 18 tons

22
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,780
you know what I mean, and then I send those tik-toks on to you and I thought this is a

23
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
baby who makes a funny face or

24
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
It looks like this dog is talking

25
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,660
This man has dropped a pizza down the sewer and my hand came out of the sewer to get the pizza

26
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
And now everybody's talking about pizza hand

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,060
Yes, and I'm like you guys love this and I send it to you and maybe they're not going through

28
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,220
Maybe there's some kind of data plan issue. No, they're going through there

29
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,740
I only get tik-toks on nights and weekends and you don't send them then. Yeah

30
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:59,260
I actually used all my tik-tok minutes

31
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,020
Oh well, and then you guys don't respond like haha good one or I really appreciate all the hard work you did finding

32
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,460
Oh wow, this tick-tock. Oh, wow. I mean honestly an emoji would be no that was me being surprised that that is something you expect

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,780
Like expect would yeah, I I nod

34
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,180
So I sometimes I even watch him which I think is is nice. Yeah, that's huge. That's a huge

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,560
Thank you bespoke tik-toks that I have. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I've dug through

36
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:35,900
Like the clearance aisle of tik-toks for you guys because I know that you have let's call it. What is very specific tastes

37
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:43,700
You like very specific. That makes us sound like perverts. Well, I'm not gonna say it right, but you guys have

38
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
particular

39
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,460
facilities when it comes to your comedy videos and so I go through I find them I dig to the bottom I find them and

40
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,240
I say although like this and I send it to you guys like I come to if you picture it in real life

41
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,780
I'm cradling these tik-toks in my hands like a baby bird like a baby bird and I'm handing them to you like here

42
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,260
No, this is like if the mama bird brought the baby bird like a Rubik's Cube and the baby bird would be like

43
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,220
I didn't ask for this. I didn't I don't know what to do with this

44
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,860
I don't know how to interface with this. Am I supposed to thank you mama?

45
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,380
Now when you entered into a relationship with me Griffin you though implicit in there

46
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,540
I hate the way that sounded implicit in there was when we began our

47
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,480
Connection our deep intimate

48
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,380
Connection you you had to understand that you would be getting these presents for me

49
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:47,940
Like if you befriend a presence is a fun way of saying what I'm the crow bringing you a shiny button, you know

50
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,780
And sometimes oh, it's a mint, you know, like 1916 coin

51
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,880
That's worth millions and sometimes it's a shiny button and you don't just thank the crow

52
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,120
When he brings you the mint coin you gotta thank him all the time, you know

53
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:07,960
Well, let me just go through the lot of the most recent tik-toks that you've sent me

54
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,660
Yeah, I'll watch them. I'll watch them on the air and we'll we'll know. Okay, so this is like

55
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
okay, so this is like

56
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
It's like a Willy Wonka joke

57
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,320
You sent one that's like a joke about Willy Wonka about how the girl and Willy Wonka asks for a bean feast and that's fun

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,840
Yeah, that is funny. So that's one that's one really good one. Thank you. I

59
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,940
Mean, here's my problem trash. I work really hard on my algorithm

60
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,900
Yeah, if there if there's if I am bored for a second half a second. Yeah a moment, right?

61
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,480
If I'm bored for half a second, I swipe what cuz I don't want I don't want I don't want I don't want

62
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,940
The algorithm to think oh he like this you want all wheat. No chaff. I get it. He look he like this. He like

63
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,380
So what if you send it to me and I watch it to the end because I'm like why the fuck when he said

64
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:07,100
You know, but the algorithm sees that and thinks oh he like it

65
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,500
My don't trust me Justin of all people like one of two brother one of your two favorite brothers. Yeah, like

66
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,300
Who do you trust the algorithm over me? You're trusting computers. My my algorithm is pretty much all

67
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,220
Hodor fan edits from Game of Thrones set to like cool anime theme songs

68
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,540
Yeah, so every time I turn on the app, there's there's just more Hodor and some of them is like here's there's some

69
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,740
Hodor's funniest moments and then some of them are quite sad. Yeah

70
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,660
Would you say more funny or more sad?

71
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,420
What sucks is sometimes it'll play like a funny song and Hodor will be like, you know

72
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,460
Picking up a big thing and you're like, I love that. Yeah, but then he dies. Oh, I don't like that

73
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,740
Oh, no, that's a bummer. You know, I have a secret account because I've used it to

74
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:07,140
My algorithm is so perfectly honed that I only get videos where people are picking up big hunks of ice

75
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,660
From the top of things and smashing them, but the ice also resembles

76
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,660
1990s kids TV stars. Wow, that's very specific

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,380
Well, there's only about four of them and then they just like loops through them over and over again, but god

78
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,860
I fucking love them. Yeah, I will watch I will watch Mark Paul Gosler's face get smashed on the ground

79
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:31,620
Well, all four all four out of context is bad. Well, he's made out of ice in ice work

80
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,980
They're just too long Travis if you sent me sick and maybe

81
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,540
If the time damn Griffin, they're at most three minutes

82
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
I'm not sending you war in peace

83
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:50,860
You understand that the idea of me sitting down to watch a three minute long video on my phone

84
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,060
Like when do I have that? That's the saddest thing I've ever heard Griffin

85
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,980
How long are your bathrooms that you don't have three minutes to watch a goddamn tick-tock?

86
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,580
How efficient are you in there? Pretty efficient man. I push it to the limit

87
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:11,420
Yeah, I go in and finish and I get back to work. You're doing a full-text Avery

88
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:18,340
I need six seconds. Do you realize that vines were perfect for me? Yeah, I know as I could go in there blast off

89
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:24,860
I could watch a couple vine on your reinforced toilet on 12 seconds. Yeah, I have a reinforced

90
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,180
I don't have some sort. I don't have like a special way of I do it the way most people use the bathroom

91
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,060
Thank you. Most people don't blast off in the toilet Griffin your words fucking read. Maybe you should

92
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,380
Read like habits of business successful business people my favorite book. Do they have it in a tick-tock form?

93
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
No

94
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:53,140
They have it in vine form and the vine just says push it to the limit and then blast off and then get back to work

95
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,900
That is that is shorter. I would guys believe Tommy Smurl fired me. I really it's still such a mystery

96
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,700
Yeah, I had the shortest bathroom breaks at that whole company now

97
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,620
I will say Tommy has told me many times about how you would announce time to blast off

98
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,780
Loudly every time you walked into the bathroom and he was a masturbation thing

99
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,940
The bigger problem is that I made my co-workers time me

100
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,780
Yeah, all of them at the same time to see if their watches sick

101
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,980
I wanted to make sure that there was no discrepancy in the timekeeping devices. Yeah, you can blame you

102
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,620
This is an advice show and we're going to help you

103
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,060
to start fresh this this spring to

104
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Step in and to

105
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,180
Really just you know, yeah get it. Okay

106
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,460
You know what fancy can't take flight if you're weighed down by the old

107
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,860
Interesting so get ready your grandpa. Yeah

108
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,620
I meant like the grievances of the sandbags on your fancy hot air balloon

109
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,940
But no one in Moana when her grandma beats it. She's like fucking finally

110
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,220
She's been keeping me here I couldn't have done this if

111
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,820
My old sack of grandma was still alive. He made me squish her bananas in just the way she liked them

112
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,580
I don't have to do it. Never again. Now. I'm lying on the back of her stingray spirit. Take me out of here

113
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,300
Hey, Maui here. Give me that rock. I gotta put it in this lava lady

114
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,300
I love that movie

115
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,940
so

116
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,740
Read me a tiny tale that we might answer Justin a tiny tale. Yes a story from a list

117
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,060
Entertain me Justin and let me dispense my wisdom

118
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm an aspiring judge for the Berkeley Springs International water tasting held annually in Berkeley Springs

119
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:53,660
West Virginia, I've heard of it West Virginia. I mean not the other part in order to prepare for the world's most prestigious

120
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,860
Water tasting competition. Can you please help me think of some adjectives or phrases?

121
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,860
I can use to describe the taste qualities of water and that's from your thirsty fan. Oh

122
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,920
excellent

123
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,940
Well, okay. Can you rate I feel like I feel like wetness is fixed

124
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,960
Wetness is fixed. You've never had a glass of water and been like

125
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,980
Wow

126
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,380
That wasn't that was not especially it. That was not a very wet experience. That was yes

127
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,640
I think for me, it would be about lingering wetness

128
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,480
We're like for me. I think it would all feel wet in the moment

129
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,900
Yeah, but I wanted to stay wet, right?

130
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,940
Is that if you stay wet the wet in if you stay wet, you don't have to get wet

131
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,900
Exactly. Thank you

132
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,940
Don't you wish you've been there the first time someone was talking about wine and they drink and drank it and the person's like

133
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,380
Mmm, very dry and their friends like what what?

134
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,580
What do you mean it's dry it's like it's a liquid it's can't be dry and they're like no

135
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:04,100
I just mean the flavor is dry and they're like, oh interesting. So the opposite of that would be yes, sweet

136
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
That is the opposite

137
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:11,540
There's too many letters in there my friends you're fucking up just like it's wet

138
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,580
Is it wetter like why would you choose dry to describe the flavor of a liquid? It's so confusing

139
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,420
Yeah, did you know I I'm trying to remember if it's one. Yes. I think it's in wine. There is a

140
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
taste quality of chewy

141
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,300
And

142
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,620
No, I don't think you can just say like somebody said that and then like quadruple down on it

143
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,980
So hard fun that everybody started to like question it right? Like somebody was like, oh, it's chewy

144
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,260
What? Okay. It's chewy. I've got Travis has led me to

145
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,380
a list of

146
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,180
Esoteric wine terms from wine mag or wine enthusiast as it's called now

147
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Umami could be a fun way to describe water

148
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,500
I think that actually right what is water but umami flavor because it ain't it ain't the typical old

149
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,500
Straight out the waterfall water typically isn't

150
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Sour, it can be salty, but I don't think you're drinking oceans water, but I mean sulfur in there

151
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,620
Oh, that's um, that's umami right there

152
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,240
Any water that comes out of the sink in Florida? That's umami right? That's umami

153
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,020
And I think also what we're finding here is a question asker if you start any observation with oh

154
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,860
That's blank right not to be questioned

155
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
because that ooh

156
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:39,060
Represents a my seasoned palette has made a right look like you can't just like bitter right? You gotta be like, ooh

157
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,700
That's a spicy one. You could say this is a this this water is a

158
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,580
Closed vintage it needs

159
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:54,140
This water is not ready for primetime. It needs to bud and bloom and blossom. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes

160
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,620
That's a bad bake. That's a bad. Bake is a one. That's a bad

161
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,060
you know, I actually said that and I think we all agreed that I

162
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,380
especially am like the girl from science where if a glass of water has been sitting out for longer than

163
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,940
Six hours it is it is an impotable. I drink water from a

164
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,500
Bottle, that's like at least a week old get out of here

165
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,980
Oh, yeah, you lose your water bottle and then you find it later. Like I lost my world's best dad water bottle

166
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,780
For like over a week on it this morning next to the paint next to the paint sink

167
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,740
Wait, had you drunk out of it previously or was it untouched? No

168
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,740
I

169
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Your bacterium we're just

170
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,540
Coming around and I'm just here enjoying it. And that was the last they ever heard of Justin. It's just water guys

171
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,900
How do you yeah, but your mouth bacteria goes into the water?

172
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,700
Changes in all kinds of terrible ways becomes a paramecium brain disease

173
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,500
There's there's a society setting up inside your body now. You've got if I can and I'll say it again

174
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,460
I've said before I'll say it again. You got an osmosis Jones situation happening Justin

175
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,340
I mean your osmosis Jones situation. It's like some it's like the thing inside it there like your eyes

176
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,660
It's not a fun little white blood cell who like teams up with David high medicine

177
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,660
Instead, it's just like a bunch of monsters that came out of your water. But if I don't I have the wonderful

178
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,980
combination of not wanting to drink old water, however, I see it and

179
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:33,340
ADHD so I'll fill a glass of water set it down and five minutes later

180
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:38,540
Can't remember which of like the glasses on the counter was the one like what was I drinking out of?

181
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,620
And so the only safe thing to do is assume they're all old. Yeah, cuz it's just why that's a good thing

182
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,380
But why you just dump it out or throw it in the toilet or whatever cuz it's just water and there's always more of it

183
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,220
On the planet the dinosaurs had where we need to we need to focus here

184
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,060
Must you yeah describing water muscular water must this is a strong water

185
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,900
That's a powerful virile water very muscular. Oh, that's here

186
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,820
You can also make it really really completely subject like oh, that's a water to write home about

187
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,980
Right and so like that's vague sounds positive sounds good

188
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,860
Right and no one's gonna say to you. That's not true. Hi guys. It's me. Justin. I

189
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:30,060
I thanks for opening my letter. I have to tell you about this guys. All right, I see God check out this water

190
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,820
I sent some of it along in the envelope

191
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,620
And enjoy some of the muscular

192
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:44,780
There's a I have to read this from from wine enthusiast one of the terms they use feminine

193
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,460
Then it says don't automatically bristle at this gendered wine term

194
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,260
You can't just

195
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,820
It perfectly describes wines that tend to be lower in alcohol and tannins. This is a quote from Ross Wheatley

196
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,020
Perfectly Ross Wheatley director of food and beverage at Lucy restaurant and bar in Yonville, California

197
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,060
Imagine a wine that has similar characteristics to a woman and her best qualities a wine that is light refined and delicate might be called

198
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,780
Feminine the polar opposite of those so-called masculine qualities and wine strong muscular larger and bigger, but don't

199
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,020
Don't bristle don't automatically bristle. Wait, can we explain it? So you can really really bristle

200
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,820
You're gonna fucking bristle, baby. However much you're bristling right now. It's not enough

201
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,340
Don't use up all your bristling now

202
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,460
Let us explain it don't burn out on the bristling now. There's so much more bristling so much more to come

203
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,500
This one really good

204
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,100
I think the only wine term I like is sweet because I

205
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,620
Understand that and it's what I want like if I'm being I would like a wine that tastes good, please like fruit tastes

206
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,780
I

207
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,620
Good fruit taste, please

208
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,660
Listen, if there's any professional Somalia's listening and I hope you're professional because I don't want to meet just like yeah

209
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,820
Please start I it would mean a lot to me personally if you guys would use gross

210
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:11,940
But use it like it's a good thing like chewy about a wine is like, oh, that's a gross wine

211
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,220
I love that. This yucky wine makes me want to barf. Oh, yeah. Oh, no, it's so rare to find a wine this yucky

212
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,100
That's great. Really? Oh, that's a man. Oh when I drink this it makes me want to die. This is nice straight-up piss

213
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,000
Love this. What is this? Oh, this is Magelmoor wine

214
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,980
Hey, should we go to the wizard? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah wizards got something helpful for us today. It was sent in by deli

215
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:45,260
Thank you. Deli. It's it's there's no name on it as wiki house staff. It was up. I wrote it. Oh great work trap

216
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,020
This one had 42 co-authors. So a lot of cooks in the kitchen. I was one of them. I was the third

217
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,680
Yeah, okay. So this one is how to flip someone off with style

218
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,740
Yeah flipping someone off is a classic nonverbal signal for showing anger and frustration toward a person

219
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,940
You might flip the bird to someone who has cut you off insulted you or otherwise provoked your ire

220
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,300
Yeah, I'm not gonna read the rest. You guys know what it is means

221
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Before we start can I ask just um?

222
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,660
Um, do you guys have a most memorable time that you were flipped the bird?

223
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,180
hmm

224
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,580
Cooper did it to me one time real good. Nice. Oh, yeah, she got you. She got me when she was like a

225
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Like her fine motor skills should not have allowed her to isolate a finger

226
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,280
Yeah, let alone her middle finger, which is not the easiest finger to isolate but she was you know

227
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,580
I want to say two months old and she gave me a cold one right to my shoulder blades. I

228
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,620
Still feel it when I was about 23 one time I was trying I was working in Charleston about an hour away from home

229
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,540
I was driving home and

230
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:55,020
This car I saw it out on my periphery pulled up next to me and then like on the highway

231
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,780
Stayed like side by side with me for a long time and I was like, I'm not gonna look I'm not gonna look

232
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,820
I turned finally and looked and this person is complete stranger

233
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,540
No idea who this is flipped me off in such an enthusiastic happy way

234
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,660
But like forcefully like I felt the impact in my chest

235
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, and then threw his head back and sped away. Yeah, and I still I remember it to this day

236
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,780
I still feel it in my heart

237
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,900
My friend steve-o who I worked with at Best Buy, uh-huh

238
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,340
when the customers would be

239
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,280
Really rude to him. He would wait until they'd turned around to walk away and then he would flip them off

240
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,700
And he used to call it a cold one right between the shoulder blades. That's where I got that term

241
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,500
Okay, I was wondering where that came from it popped out of my mouth and I was like, why did they call it that?

242
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah, yeah, Steve. Oh Steve. Oh Steve. Oh did it? Okay, let's get into it. Give someone the finger

243
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,620
This is straight simple straightforward into the classic flip-off

244
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,740
Turn the back of your fist towards someone as though you were shaking a fist at them then extend your middle finger

245
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:07,460
Yeah, hold the pose in this part. I don't ever do and look the person in the eye. Oh, oh you gotta do that

246
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,500
You don't do that. No, I look down at the finger. I want to make sure I'm doing it

247
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,020
Oh, I think my eyes dart from finger to eyes finger to eyes like see that get it

248
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:24,180
All right, yes other hand is an option. Oh, yeah, I'm doing with my left hand, but I'm pointing with my right hand

249
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,780
Don't miss this don't miss this somehow or thought you do the West Virginia or not. No, I don't know

250
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,780
Come on, cuz that could mean anything

251
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,280
Okay, so try using both hands. Yeah, whatever that's twice as good the double deuce

252
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:36,500
Yeah

253
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,820
It does say as sort of a subsection to this second tip do the X

254
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,340
Cross your middle fingers into an X and hold them against your chest facing the offense. That's cool. I'm trying that right now and that feels really

255
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,020
Oh, that has a Chris Angel energy to it for some reason. Yeah, I feel like that's how Chris would flip people

256
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,860
Yeah, he would definitely and he'd do it with both hands and then he'd be like, is there a third hand there?

257
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah, wow. Yeah, now it's more of an asterisk

258
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:07,900
Switch fingers this one. I don't understand and I'm even looking at a diagram for a somewhat more

259
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,940
dynamic insult flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession

260
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,780
Alternately keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis. Oh, I see you go like left right left, right?

261
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,860
Right, right, right, right. That's hard to do. I get cramped when I try to do that

262
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,420
But yeah

263
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,900
I feel like that leaves you open to really undercut the moment because then like what I'm like, I lost the hold on

264
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,900
I lost the pace

265
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,900
This is a good workout

266
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:41,500
If I saw someone do this to me I would be pretty impressed actually

267
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,820
Yeah, all right. So now we're getting into some discrete flip-off moves act like you're itching your nose

268
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,660
They talked about that on it, what was the fucking show with Tim Roth where it's all about microaggressions and like you see

269
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
Oh, yeah

270
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:03,460
What I don't think it was bull yeah

271
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,840
Okay, I don't think him Ross. I think it was watch. I think it was either bull or Bosch

272
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,740
I think it was beep

273
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,080
Beeper it was beeper Bosch or boop. I can't remember which show it was

274
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,320
Act like you're itching your nose. We did that one flip the person off behind their back. That's a good one

275
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,360
That's just that's some cold one real steve-o style the do the now

276
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,960
We're getting sort of theatrical and this is the opposite direction and these I've never heard of some of these and they made me

277
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,060
Fucking bust do the jack-in-the-box flip-off. Oh, that's a good one

278
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:41,140
But you're like doing the cranking it up and it's like getting bigger and bigger and it does say here make sure you have the person's

279
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,940
Undivided attention this move takes a bit of time to pull off

280
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,260
While driving cuz you need at least one hand on the wheel. Come on. Yeah

281
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,520
uh, yeah, well, you can put your elbows or your forearms sort of at ten and two and then yes

282
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,500
Or how and fucking funny would that be if somebody tried to do that?

283
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,780
This is the dent that I did it what check this out

284
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,820
This is how I feel about and then the other person was just like I'm gonna walk

285
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,140
I will leave before you can finish them by I'm on my way out the tool

286
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:17,180
Okay, I'm not gonna receive the bad part of this maneuver. You can't trick me into doing that

287
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,460
Practice the balloon hold your fist in front of your face and put the tip of your thumb in your mouth and act like you're

288
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,820
Blowing up a balloon blow into your thumb and slowly extend all your fingers as if your breath is inflating them

289
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,860
Then you hold the middle finger of the balloon hand with your other hand and you move the thumb away from your mouth slowly close

290
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,180
The other fingers on your balloon hand until you only your middle left finger is so much work

291
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,460
Yes, I I've always thought that that move makes you look like the silly one

292
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,220
Right like that is blowing up your hand like a balloon doesn't it makes you look like a silly person that doesn't embarrass the other

293
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,460
Person so much as it's like that's a lot of work. Yeah for what you've done to me

294
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,740
It's like the holding up three and saying read between the lines, which I'm betting is on this list. It's not that's funny though

295
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,380
Read between the lines you hold up all three fingers

296
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,460
I like that one a lot because you can do that at school and not get in trouble

297
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,380
This maneuver requires you to put your filthy hand in your mouth

298
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,220
Also like who's on the losing end of this one the person who you have done the balloon flip off to or the person who?

299
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,420
Has contracted the novel coronavirus you you are the one I?

300
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:25,220
Also, I'm imagining somebody having this article open following these directions step-by-step to do the balloon flip-off like

301
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Hold on

302
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,480
Pretend to find your middle finger like that's in your fuck. Yeah, that's good. Yeah

303
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,920
Yeah, but if you don't find it though, that's gonna be terrifying and what's really fun is you can do this

304
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,840
You could actually keep this going for a long time. Hey, have you seen it was right? No, I just had it

305
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,240
But can you look in that? Oh, I found it and then they're like blown backwards

306
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,520
Yeah, the longer you take the better if you can make it last a couple days. Yeah, I just had it

307
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,160
Pull it up, but it's your ring finger. You're like, oh, no, shoot

308
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,860
I thought this was it and what's great is you can do this one and it can be like a fun game for a baby

309
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:12,400
Too, you know, where's my middle thing? Can you help me find it? Where's my where's my daddy finger?

310
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,520
My favorite one and it's a little intricate

311
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,080
It's a lot like the balloon one, but or the dragon box really but you don't I think it's less embarrassing for you

312
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,720
And you hold up one finger you didn't make it kind of a show right and you go

313
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,560
Well, I don't know that's the index finger but an unknown. Yeah, and then you hold up another hand

314
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,000
It's empty, but and then you slam them together and that finger jumps over to the middle thing on the other

315
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,480
Yeah, and it's like a magic trick

316
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,040
Horrible that song for babies daddy finger daddy finger. Where are you here? I am here. I am. How do you do?

317
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,860
You know that one? Yeah, but I think I think the daddy finger is the thumb

318
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,440
Yeah, so but the middle finger is so much bit. The mommy finger is the index. Yes, brother finger

319
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,000
I think is the yeah, because it's immature, right?

320
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,760
That's that's the immature finger. It's bigger, right because sometimes dads are not as big as their son's

321
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:10,520
Sometimes it's bigger. That's fair. Yeah, but that that the thumb does so much more work, right? The thumb's got a job

322
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,520
What's the middle finger doing?

323
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:19,040
Right, like if you think about it your index finger and your thumb are the hardest working fingers on your hands, right?

324
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:24,720
That's why it's mommy and daddy that that doubt that middle finger. It's not really doing a lot, right?

325
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,920
Yeah, I like doing a lot. Hey brother fingers should have been what we called the this podcast

326
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,560
Fuck no, wait, we might have attracted a different audience. If we try on crowd, I think would be drawn to brother fingers

327
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,480
Hey try the trumpet

328
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,600
Blow on your thumb while pretending to play the trumpet and flow your fingers as though you're hitting the valves

329
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,720
Periodically hold up your middle finger add some musical effects for style. Pretty sure I did see Ace Ventura do this one

330
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,760
I think so, too, but also Griffin the way that you send the trumpet made me think you're going to go into Mambo number five

331
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,600
Thank you. Okay good. Okay, our brains are broken in a very similar voice. All you said was the trumpet

332
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,960
Yeah, I was like, oh, okay. Here we go. Monica. I said it that way all purpose

333
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,740
Yeah, you're you're playing with our Pavlovian response

334
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,380
Absolutely. I am this is honestly the reason why I included why I wanted to do this article because the last

335
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
Maneuver is one I've never seen before

336
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Try the double extreme

337
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,700
Extend the middle fingers of both hands then bring your arms behind your back and through your legs

338
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:36,580
You should have both middle fingers clearly presented note only people with long arms can pull this off

339
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,780
Okay, well through the leg. Wait, hold on around the back and through the legs. I see you trying to

340
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,980
Like work through the physics of this

341
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:53,420
It's like they're your middle fingers are basically going to be sort of pressed down against your inner eye

342
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,500
While you are in sort of almost a seed like a squat while you're your middle fingers are

343
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,660
Imagine if you were you squatted grab your thighs and tried to rip yourself in half

344
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:12,500
Why instead of doing that you just use your middle fingers? It's very unpower. It's a very

345
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,260
It's a very obsequious way to I think this one the double bird seems like you're inviting people to push you over at this point

346
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,380
Unless the thing is here like I'm flipping off and I made you look at my crotch at the same time. Yeah

347
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,800
Yeah, that's the oh, that's a good that's a that's a good actually I'm turning on this one. I like it

348
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,080
You like it now. Yeah, I'm gonna do this to a bag to a bad guy

349
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,460
I don't like another good one and it's one of my favorite also when magicians do it

350
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,540
They see it in front of like a background right and the cards just seem to keep coming in their hands

351
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,180
And they're like pulling them out of thin air

352
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,340
You could do that with middle fingers to where they're coming from all what there's so many

353
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
That's a good one, too

354
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:57,180
And once again, then you're distracted when your friend can pickpocket them if I ever did meet the Pissed Man

355
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,020
Theodore Cruz

356
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
and I

357
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,740
Realized that this would be my only opportunity to try the double extreme on him

358
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:11,460
Yeah, do you think that by the time I started this maneuver his like bodyguards or whatever would take me out?

359
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,980
Cuz they would think I was doing some like no, they'd love it. There's no way anyone who works for well

360
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,180
No

361
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:21,900
just imagine that imagines that the setup for the move of me like very quickly shoving my

362
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,240
Hands behind me and through my thighs like are they gonna think I'm about to go

363
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,400
You know, I'm saying they might they might think let's see how this plays out. Yeah, they might just roll a little bit

364
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,720
I would need a photo like a professional

365
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,080
Photographer like a senior pictures photographer on hand to me. You want to Jocelyn's there?

366
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,680
They would pull out their phone and be like, oh shit geoduck. Hold on one sec

367
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,520
We were busy laundering your pants for the fifth time today

368
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,660
Cuz you piss cuz you piss like the feeling of the warm when it runs down. Did you say geoduck?

369
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
The big clam

370
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,960
That's not a Pokemon. Is it? No, it's a big clam

371
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,700
Geodude geodude or perhaps Psyduck. Yeah, I kind of fused them together when those I've always wanted those two to

372
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,780
Fuck, you know to fuck. No, it's it's about more than sex with these two. There's romance

373
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
They have so much in common

374
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:27,960
Here's you see did you see the piss boy in interviewing the

375
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,560
Potential Supreme Court justice and he asked about a children's book about anti-racist baby. It's babies, right?

376
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,360
Hey, hey, I got one for him, but the scorching real bad as babies racist

377
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
God this fuck I can't talk about this

378
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,760
The basil is new governance. No

379
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,640
Does he do governance or does he literally just troll 24-7?

380
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,720
He I think literally just trolls 24-7 him. He recently missed a flight at an airport in Montana

381
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:01,720
And he got a little unruly and airport police had to help defuse the situation and then a day later

382
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,320
He was like, I don't think you have the temperament to be a Supreme Court justice

383
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,520
He's like shit and I I would love to just give him the double extreme

384
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:18,680
Yeah, this and his and his mom wishes he was dead. Okay Wow, so Wow, just

385
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,360
Okay, so here's some quick community Q&A question, can you suck your middle finger as an insult don't yeah

386
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,120
Yes, as it can indicate that you're telling someone to suck it suck

387
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,740
It is a rude sentence that may offend people. So try not to use it too often or around sensitive people

388
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Well, hold on now. Imagine this I flip someone off clear signal, but then I start sucking my own finger

389
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Yeah, my friend

390
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,740
That's the most mixed

391
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,260
Signal I've ever seen in my yeah

392
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,580
Well, I get in trouble if I flip off my pet hamster if a parent sees you maybe or if a sibling sees you and tells

393
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,100
A parent but a hamster doesn't know what human hand gestures mean

394
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,180
You don't fucking know that just because the hamster can't respond

395
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,460
The hamster can't tell your parent can't an arc on you doesn't mean that when you flip off

396
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,980
You know little Jerry the gerbil or whatever that he's not like, oh fuck man. Yeah, you're close

397
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,100
Bros

398
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,740
Mmm, I don't want to yuck a yum here potentially, but is it bad to have a flipping off fetish?

399
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,720
Is it bad I I would say that if I was ever able to give

400
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,280
Theodore Cruz the double extreme I would get pretty hard

401
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,440
What technique would be most appropriate when dealing with a difficult child behind their back will be the best approach

402
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
They wouldn't see you so they wouldn't snitch

403
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,000
Wait, how difficult and are they your own child because if it's a kid on the playground who's being a dick to my kid

404
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah, I want them to see there is a chance though that you flip off a kid and like who's you know

405
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,040
Who really like needs to be flipped off and then you have like, you know

406
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,920
Like good will hunting kind of thing where it's just like hey, I needed that man. Thank you for setting my life

407
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,720
Thank you on the right path. Yeah, you're right

408
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,280
I am a dirtbag and I did trample your child on my never thought about that how I moved through space without

409
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,320
Considering the fact that there might be other children who might in fact be smaller than me around and I've never thought that maybe I'm the

410
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,480
Problem, but you flipped me off man, and you really changed

411
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,560
It's like you were pointing up which was the only direction I had to go

412
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:34,360
Right, you really turned my life around me and the parents come up the parents come up and they're like, thank you

413
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,600
Thank you. Yeah, and now I'm a doctor and I'm gonna save your life

414
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,920
That's you were in a car accident and I having to be driving by and the Lord works the mysterious ways man

415
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,840
And you flipped me off and you were my angel and now I'll be yours

416
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,560
I bumped you up the heart transplant list because 30 years ago

417
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,400
You gave me a cold one right between the shoulder blades right when I needed it. Yeah

418
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,360
And I turned around and saw it and you nodded and you pointed at it and I felt it in my heart

419
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,440
And it turned me around that day and now in the president and I'm president doctor and I'm gonna save your life

420
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,400
I'm gonna give you my own heart while I do the transplant. That's right. Watch I'm cutting it open right now

421
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,720
And I have enough time to finish and go fast. Go fast. Go fast. Go fast

422
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,520
Up. All right. I didn't you're gonna have to do the sewing up part yourself if you can handle that

423
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,360
And now I die

424
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,580
It's a beautiful story we just told doesn't and it was a true story I saw it on my Facebook

425
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:42,620
And then the liberal college professor fell down an open manhole and died

426
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:44,620
Oh

427
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,580
You know when God wanted to teach everybody a bunch of new languages he did it with the Tower of Babel and now you don't

428
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,580
I don't think that was the point of that story

429
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,380
Yeah, that's how God invented languages, but now they're all out there and they're all done

430
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:18,140
Babel is the name of the service b a b b e l it lets you to learn a different language

431
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,140
You'll be traveling abroad. You want to connect a deeper with family. She's got some free time

432
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,880
You want to expand the brain keep the neurotransmitters?

433
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:30,540
Pumping, you know today this day and age we're more connected than ever

434
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,420
You can have friends all across this great globe of yours who share her, you know

435
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:39,540
Whatever weird things you're into and you can talk to him about it using Babel

436
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,380
Babel has 15 minute lessons that make it the perfect way to learn a new language on the go

437
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,840
They got 14 different ones. Not just the boring ones that everybody knows but some like off the beat

438
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,280
They don't got Esperanto, but they do got Spanish French Italian German many others

439
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,780
Obviously, there's ten more than that. Yeah, I just did the math the speech recognition technology that the app uses

440
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,680
Will actually listen to you talking and be like, hey, that was wrong. No

441
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680

450
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
short-sleeve button-up kind of person

451
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:56,880
Yeah, I used to think that I was only a long sleeve button-up and then roll up the sleeves when it was hot

452
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,460
Yeah, and it took it

453
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,800
Took my friends at stitch fix to help me realize that the problem wasn't me

454
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,760
it was that I wasn't finding the right shirts and

455
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,300
Now I look at my wardrobe and I see these beautiful

456
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,280
like short sleeve button-ups that are really gonna show off my muscles and I think thank God for stitch fix they saved me and

You

497
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Have another question. Yes, please. Okay, I

498
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,820
Recently pulled the trigger on something I've wanted to do for months and dyed my hair green nice

499
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,980
Well, I love the result and I'm very happy with how it looks

500
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,660
I'm having some annoying comments made about strangers and friends

501
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,940
The two that are most repeatedly said to me are did you diet for st. Patrick's Day and much worse?

502
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,300
Did you want to look like the Joker? Is that really worse?

503
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:11,900
Yeah, it's a little it's a lot worse Travis, okay, it's definitely worse I

504
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,020
Usually meet these questions with a chuckle and an excuse about liking the color

505
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:23,340
But they are really wearing me thin do I embrace this new persona thrust on me or is there a way I can dis

506
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,900
Dissuade these questions remember being asked that's from not so serious in the Northwest

507
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:34,440
I would say there's the third I should just you know, you don't have to embrace the Joker persona and please don't please for the good

508
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:41,060
Sucks. Yeah, at least one of the tasteful joke. Yes, what about a lesser threatening one Caesar Romero?

509
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,980
Yes, that guy was just kind of silly with big weird bombs

510
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Big weird weird bombs

511
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:54,980
Bongs bongs. Yeah, probably and I think he painted over his mustache if I remember correctly. That's fun. That's great

512
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Let's crank some cotton on that

513
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,980
I'll rip it

514
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:06,740
But I think that you don't have to accept it and I want to know how I got these nugs I

515
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,800
Don't think you can also dissuade it unless you like wear a sign or a shirt or something

516
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,100
But I think people can ask these questions. You just like no

517
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:23,340
Yeah, but no, but I mean here's the problem and and question asker you I'm so proud of you for going for it

518
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:30,500
And dying dying your hair green go for it. But here's what the the sort of thing that you gotta you gotta

519
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
accept is that

520
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:41,900
People see things that are different and they are curious about it and they want to say something and I mean like it's an external

521
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:49,340
Thing, right? It's not like you've privately started some sort of meditation practice or something. This is a public expression of yourself

522
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:55,540
So you got to figure out why and it's if it's another person's business and you say like, I don't know. I just felt like it

523
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:01,860
I did that stuff perfectly valid response, but you are gonna get people commenting on it because it's like

524
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,900
That's just humans. That's how humans are and you know what?

525
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,660
I think it's maybe not the work, especially if it's strangers doing it

526
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,060
I think that's great because it's like a good opportunity to like I don't know

527
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:15,020
You got the what's it as they say in the communication?

528
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:21,700
World like you got the what's it just they they they start the conversation and you can continue it meet meet new people now

529
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:28,120
It happens. It happens to me a lot that people will see my purple hair and clearly they feel like because I've done it

530
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,060
I want people to comment on it

531
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,540
And they can't think of something to say and people will just go purple

532
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:40,380
Yeah, and then that's the extent of this thing five-year-olds trap

533
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:47,300
I said, hey Griffin when it comes to social interaction. Everybody will often like devolve into that. Yeah, sure

534
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,540
Another option is you could if they say did you get that? Is that Joker hair and you say no, it's actually

535
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,020
Insert anime character here. Oh, yeah

536
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,540
We'll stop the conversation in its tracks depending on where you are and who you're talking to

537
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:13,140
That's fair because maybe you just started a new friendship. Yes. Um, it looks like the main boy in My Hero Academia

538
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,900
Has green hair. So that's one for you. Just say I did it based on the the main boy

539
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:25,740
Does Bulma have green hair? I can't remember. I thought Bulma was bald. It makes me really sad because I dyed my hair purple

540
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,900
Because I thought at the time I remember I went in and I said

541
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:36,100
I said purple like the Joker's and no one corrected me. I thought the Joker had purple hair and then no one

542
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,220
Commented on it, but I was already committed to the purple hair thing. You got your hair dyed purple to look like

543
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:45,980
I thought he was the last green. I thought Justin. I didn't look it up before

544
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,860
Stop and let us talk. You've said enough you said it just I blew it

545
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,540
No, you stop and let us talk when you went in to get your hair dyed purple

546
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:01,660
You wanted it to look like the Joker who has green hair. Well, I didn't know I didn't know I didn't look it up

547
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,660
I remember. You didn't know the color of it. Well cuz I but it's you're sure enough

548
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:10,260
You're sure enough to dye your hair. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you had the purple suit but not

549
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,180
I think that's what threw it, Justin. That's what threw it. Travis, I have I'm gonna give you one chance

550
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,540
Tell me that you're this is a joke for show. Yeah, I need to know that it's a joke for show. Now Justin

551
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:28,580
What does it say about your opinion of me that I have told you that I your 38 year old brother who has had his

552
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,100
Hair dyed purple for like five or six years now

553
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:35,780
Did it to look like the Joker, but I didn't look up a picture of the Joker beforehand

554
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,780
And you're like, I can't tell if this is real or not

555
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,380
What's that say? It's making me

556
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:47,620
Re-evaluate a lot about my life. Honestly, that's true. That's true. Actually Travis. That seems like a new problem and not a

557
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:51,260
Does it but yeah, no, okay, but this is a

558
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,380
It's like a Halloween costume Joker and it there's nothing better for your

559
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:09,300
Than just googling people dressed up as the Joker. Oh, I

560
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,540
incorrect

561
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,540
Googling community theater Shrek

562
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Theater Shrek is great community theater Shrek is if you don't have that saved as a Google image search. I would highly

563
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:26,940
Highly recommend Google Google image searching community theater Shrek because they're all oh boy

564
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,340
Basically the best there every single one is a fucking purple

565
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,580
This one's a purple Shrek with a green nose and green ears

566
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,100
Guy wait Shrek not purple. God damn it

567
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,620
Oh, no, every image from community theater Shrek Google image search is funnier than anything

568
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:48,180
Every single one you just can't get him

569
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:52,500
Right. He just isn't gonna look right ever. Yeah

570
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:58,700
It just all looks wrong. It all looks if he's not rich. It's just him being realized and it's not the community theater

571
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,260
He looks weird in the musical too. Yeah, it's just you it's just weird to have a Shrek in real life

572
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,340
Well, it's the it's the uncanny valley Justin where if you actually got too close to Shrek

573
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,820
It's upset it right if he's bad if it's a bad or that doesn't look like Shrek. It's funny

574
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:17,960
But if you're like that, oh my god, that's fuckin mighty. I wish this was a video podcast

575
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,460
Can I just say Justin that donkey ain't great either

576
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,980
No, they're all it's all it's all we should do a video

577
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,620
one day of like community theater Shrek's because they're all

578
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,440
Really? Yeah, we should Justin. All right. Here's what I want. Oh my lord

579
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,040
Justin

580
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:44,120
The next live show we do I want you to put up pictures and we have to guess which level of theater

581
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,000
That is being performed at. That could be a fun game. If it's professional community

582
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,960
Alternate idea is we just at the next live show all show up dressed up as Shrek

583
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,960
Oh, I love the Kansas City is just around the corner

584
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,340
We as Shrek country as they call it Shrek country. It's time to put our show to the test Justin

585
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,880
Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna build an hour-long slideshow of different Shrek costume pictures

586
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,780
And we are not going to reference that it's gonna play in the background as we try to do our show

587
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:21,680
Which one is funnier, right? Well, like I we would lose that every time every show. We're going to go amp to amp

588
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,120
Amp versus amp

589
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:29,840

He must be bringing more cheese for us to enjoy at our party that he is not invited to Richard

705
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:39,140
I want you to know you might not know this our show is

708
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,820
I can solve this problem Richard

709
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:55,420
No, this is a quarter great relief for me. I'm what you're gonna need and I saw this once

710
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,820
when I was taking a tour of the underground bunker at the the Greenbrier in

711
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,820
I'm talking to my friends!

712
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,820
Okay, Richard don't you're gonna need to build yourself

713
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,820
I'm talking to my friends for a podcast!

714
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,820
Richard don't yell, please. You're gonna need to build yourself. It's Sarah man

715
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:15,340
She wants to be come walk on the beach. Oh, that sounds nice. Actually, that sounds better

716
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:22,060
You're gonna build an airlock kind of thing, right? So you can enter the house, right?

717
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:26,540
Remove your clothing change into non perfumed clothing after I've already removed

718
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:33,380
I don't wear clothing usually unless I'm going to like a funeral. It's basically just underwear and a gold chain

719
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,140
Okay, you're gonna have some vegetables that you praise. I get it

720
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:43,260
You're gonna like fully shower off before you enter the home. You're gonna be scent free, but only at home Richard

721
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,940
Yeah, it'll be like the Andromeda strain, Richard

722
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,460
You're gonna sort of completely distinct before you enter into the domicile

723
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,180
And then you can reapply you can have a shed outside

724
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:59,300
Of your sprays. Yes, just like a spray down sink room

725
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:04,940
Yeah, you could get like a like a spray tanning booth, but just fill it with your you know, your stings

726
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,940
Yeah, and then stink up on your way out cuz here's the thing

727
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
Justin likes

728
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,260
perfumes

729
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,260
Justin despises what he calls raw cheese

730
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:22,220
Which is to say any cheese that hasn't been melted in sort of queso nacho form or sandwich form

731
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,100
or

732
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,980
Thank you, Justin doesn't know anything about perfume

733
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:35,000
But I believe he is actually garnered a lot. He's Jennifer garnered a lot of just through osmosis. Yeah

734
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,020
Ah, right. Okay. Yeah, because you do leave a lot of it around the studio my ectoplasm

735
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:48,320
Travis wait, don't just jump over that. You're what?

736
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:54,360
Excuse me, Richard. Are you a ghost? Oh

We have one time I was walking through a dark alley in crime alley and some thugs came and try to steal my pearls boom

808
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:50,460
There's Montaigne dressed like Batman. This is a punch. She lied. She didn't kill but she didn't

809
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:55,580
Know this absolutely it happened 100% It was the Dark Knight in Gotham

810
01:07:55,580 --> 01:08:00,340
The Joker was there, but he it was just he and I hanging out quick impression

811
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,660
No

812
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,540
Right now I want to hear your Joker we've been talking about the Joker a lot this episode

813
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:13,980
So, can you just do a quick joke? Do you want my Mark Hamill Joker or I would love to hear your Jared Leto?

814
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:19,820
Really good. I have a really good Mark Hamill took her. Okay. Okay. Well, let's hear that. Yeah

815
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:23,900
What's something that the Joker would say? He's like Mark Hamill Joker

816
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:28,380
Oh, hey, Batman. Give me all your money. I don't think he robs Batman

817
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,060
He was super rich I guess that's true

818
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,140
You know the difference between you and me? I'm not wearing hockey pads

819
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,700
That's what he said, but that's what Batman says Joker doesn't say that

820
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:45,880
But Joker says it to him in a funny way where it's like it's he's written the Joker is dressed up like Batman

821
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:52,660
So maybe it's just real for him the show's okay. So just just Joker ribbing Batman. Yeah, just giving him a hard time

822
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:54,660
But with buds do that's

823
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:57,980
You got some dead parents much

824
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,860
Wow, that's actually pretty

825
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:06,420
Good but really dark Joker really he's are very good

826
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:09,780
But I think even Batman would be like, whoa, that's fuck shit

827
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:12,860
It's kind of spoiler to say that Batman has said yeah, how does it wait?

828
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:17,340
How does Joker know that Batman's parents are dead cuz he killed him. All right

829

I'm Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm the choker. Oh, too scary. You're my brother
