1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:48,880
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Me, an advice show for the modern

6
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,320
era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,200
I'm your baby, Griffin McElroy. Candle nights, 20 Flirt.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,920
And I'm Charlie Dickens, aren't I? Now listen, why would you think Charles

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
Dickens would be a child? Charles Dickens is like a grown-ass man.

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm Charlie Dickens. I have yet to write any of the books you might recognize.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,720
No, right now I mostly just look at girls and get boners.

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm an established author, loved her on the Christmas time holiday, don't I?

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
I am tremendously sorry that we started out the episode with Travis saying the word boners. Like,

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,160
we warned you there's not going to be any curse words, just challenging ideas,

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,680
challenging material. Sort of like an Oliver Twist when you have

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,160
to learn about orphans, don't you? The challenging topic of orphans.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,640
It is challenging. Deal with it.

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Fagin's sort of vaguely anti-Semitic, isn't he? I'm so sorry about that, Fagin.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,200
It was a different time. And none of that has anything to do with

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Christmas. Like, he wrote a book about Christmas.

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
I wrote Christmas Songs, the book. It's about Freakos, isn't it?

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,000
Should we paint the picture of what we're doing? Because I'm looking at the levels.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,600
I'm four feet tall and I've got a tear-stove pipette and I'm on Justin's lap.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,840
I wasn't looking for, like, an ASL situation.

25
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
This is what Charlie did. I want you to do the vision.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
There's three of us jammed around the same microphone.

27
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,720
Three of us? So did Justin leave?

28
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,240
Justin became embarrassed. He stepped out to give me my paraffin wax

29
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,040
so I could roll my cigarettes. Oh, God bless.

30
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,160
You are way too young to be getting into it. Because, like, cigarettes back in the day were,

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,240
like, heavy doge. Well, everybody died sooner, didn't they? So we started smoking at 7 or 8.

32
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,840
We're in the meat space together. The physical presence of each other.

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,880
I don't think we've done this since God's spaghettageddon, and that was a...

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,000
In my defense, I'm a ghost. That was a disaster.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,320
You are not taking up much corporeal space. I'm very tiny, except for my hat.

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,120
The hat is real. The body is not. It's like AI, but weirder.

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,600
You're listening to 20 Flirt Christmas. I don't even know what that word was.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,600
It just left my lips. Candle Nights is the episode you're looking for.

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,360
Share it with friends. Share it with family. No swears. No curses. No fouls.

40
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,120
No wordy-derds. No cussing.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
I mean, there will be, and we will try to edit them.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
It's going to be hard because we're all on the same mix,

43
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,480
and that is, as you editors out there know, kind of a tough pie.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah, but we will do our very best. We've got a lot of holiday-themed fun questions for you.

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,120
You know what's so strange is we are actual brothers. A lot of people ask us that.

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,520
We are actually brothers, but I find, when making this show,

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,000
I find your guys' physical presence here highly distracting.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,480
Yeah, it's weird because now you guys are going to know how little

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,880
I actually pay attention when I'm not speaking.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,920
Uh, that's not, no, I think we're pretty plugged in on that.

51
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah, on that end.

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,600
I watched, very recently, the Pee Wee's Playhouse Christmas special,

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,760
and I was wondering if it would be possible for us to match it

54
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
for, like, having the weirdest guest stars on this.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,480
I watched that last year for the first time in forever, and it is weird. It's got, who all?

56
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,920
Grace Jones shows up, does what she does, which is to say, creeps me out to the extreme.

57
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
The Andrew Sisters are on it, or some sort of set of triplets, some triplet set.

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,600
Not the Andrew Sisters, they'd be long dead. Some sort of set of triplets is there.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Little Richard shows up, if we recall.

60
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Little Richard is definitely in the mix. There's a chair that talks!

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,840
Well, I mean, Cherry's a permanent fixture there.

62
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,520
Cherry shows up, surprise!

63
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,000
How hard would it be for us to get Grace Jones just, like, on the set?

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,680
Who is Grace Jones?

65
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,400
Grace Jones was in, well, she was in Mad Max, and I think a James Bond movie.

66
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,280
Oh, gotcha.

67
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,760
Yeah, you know?

68
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,160
Gotcha.

69
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
Um, so, uh, let's actually get into some questions so we can help.

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,320
Now, I do want to apologize in advance. Again, just want to repeat,

71
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Travis and I are sharing a microphone.

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,800
Uh, kissing, kissing between every sentence.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
Yeah, uh, don't say that.

74
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
Kissing, brothers.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
Just real quick, I need you two to look at this picture Grace Jones just found.

76
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,320
Sweet, perfect.

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,280
And we can move on.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,600
Moving on.

79
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,640
We're all in a good headspace.

80
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Alright, uh, here's a question.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,520
Hey, brothers, my boyfriend comes from a country where Christmas isn't really celebrated,

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,400
and we're spending our first holiday together outside of America.

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
How can I help him understand all the magical feelings surrounding the holidays?

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,040
Should I plan some activities or just have him binge watch Christmas movies?

85
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,840
Please help.

86
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
That's from Santa in South Korea.

87
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
The binge watching only works if you put him in a chair that has, like,

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,680
metal clamps that hold his eyes open.

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,480
And you're just screaming, like, jingle, jingle!

90
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,760
Now, when they say that Christmas isn't really celebrated in South Korea,

91
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,040
do they actually mean that it is celebrated but for, like,

92
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,000
only the last two weeks of December and not for three and a half months?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Like, it isn't the same?

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
No, everyone just does it very lackadaisically.

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,600
They're just like, oh, merry Christmas, I guess.

96
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,480
I guess, whatever.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
Oh, eggnog.

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,720
The obvious answer is to just jump that gap, the Christmas gap.

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Jump right over that land, right in Candle Nights.

100
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
Obviously, the superior territory to be.

101
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,000
But if you're committed to the Christian version of Candle Nights,

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,360
I think you could get somewhere by showing him some holiday films that are more sort of

103
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:15,680
humanist rather than they are, like, the magic of Santa showing up at the last minute,

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
like he always does in sitcoms.

105
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,480
Like, if you were to show him...

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,000
I mean, I don't think there's a human being alive who could not be touched by,

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,840
for instance, It's a Wonderful Life.

108
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,560
You watch that, and I think the magic of the holiday season, what everybody's on about,

109
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,920
you know, which is really, at its core, about generosity and kindness and human warmth.

110
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,000
I think something like that could help.

111
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,560
Or what you could do was lie to him.

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Because this is your opportunity to create a bunch of Christmas traditions that do not

113
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,520
really exist.

114
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Or just make it an extremely Krampus-oriented affair.

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,560
Well, that's the thing.

116
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
It's just occurred to me that what you can do is pick and choose.

117
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,400
Because throughout the world, every different country and society has different, like,

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Christmas traditions.

119
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
December 23rd, you have to give your girlfriend foot rubs.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
That's an old, or Santa will come down and eat your back.

121
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,320
And there's stuff like...

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,880
Well, I heard a tale that every Christmas, whoever hasn't taken out the garbage every

123
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,240
week for the history of time will have his balls cut off.

124
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,120
Well, that's not accurate.

125
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,000
That's not true at all.

126
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,800
The back-eating thing, that's lore.

127
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
That's Welsh, I believe, in origin.

128
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,640
What's the one where you have to put eggs in your shoes and stomp on them?

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,680
Have you noticed how Welsh holidays almost always involve the figure for that holiday

130
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,680
coming down to consume some non-vital part of your body for strength?

131
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,200
You gotta keep it...

132
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,000
There you go.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,320
All right.

134
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Well, Travis lowered my chair.

135
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,600
And now it's broken, which is great.

136
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,720
You broke my chair!

137
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
This is a pretty good scene.

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,320
The chair is broken.

139
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,680
It's not a setting.

140
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,120
It's just broken.

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,720
It was actually a setting.

142
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,520
I faked it.

143
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
Okay, so...

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,600
So, I mean, the other thing is, I don't know if his tastes are acclimated.

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,880
If he comes from another country, I'm not sure if he's gonna be ready for the amount

146
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,400
of sugar and butter we're about to jam down his gullet.

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,560
You may wanna start with something a little more savory, maybe a mincemeat pie or something

148
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,280
like that.

149
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
Can you make a Christmas kimchi?

150
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,080
Is that possible?

151
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,960
That would be nice.

152
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,360
You know what?

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,000
What about a blending of you replace imagery from the holidays with...

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,920
And, like, basically Photoshop in, but really, not fake.

155
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,080
Like, actually insert some South Korean imagery.

156
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,680
Like, you have a picture of Santa, but behind him, there's a dead girl crawling on the ceiling.

157
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,200
I am not very inundated in that culture.

158
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,040
Yeah, dog, that's not great.

159
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,160
That's not ideal.

160
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,800
That was bad.

161
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,280
Can you see?

162
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,480
You know, that kind of idea.

163
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
We're talking about an entire country.

164
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,160
You can't think of a thing?

165
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
They're not the bad one.

166
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,040
I know that.

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,360
Yeah.

168
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,160
Oh, jeez.

169
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,440
You know what, though?

170
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,440
I could probably come up with more North Korean imagery.

171
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, let's just assume that, then.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,960
Okay, well...

173
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,480
It's really a shame that the Northern Korea gets all the credit for being the bad girl.

174
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,120
You know what I mean?

175
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,240
It's like the girl in The Bachelorette that he keeps around for ratings, and he doesn't

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
realize that the right answer is right in front of him.

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,520
Ben, what are you doing?

178
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,080
You made the worst call of your entire life.

179
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,580
Yeah.

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Griffin, how about a Yahoo?

181
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,640
How's that sound?

182
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,200
Sure.

183
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,000
A Christmas-y, sort of holiday, caramelized Yahoo.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Let me close all these naked pictures of Grace Jones that popped up on my Google.

185
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,640
Don't show me naked pictures of Grace Jones.

186
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,440
I didn't want to.

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
It's just what came up.

188
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,280
You're really upsetting.

189
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm a married man.

190
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,960
How about this?

191
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
This one was sent in by Drew Davenport.

192
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Thanks, Drew Davenport.

193
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,600
It's by Yahoo Answers user thistumblr0 who asks,

194
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Thanks, I always have a hard time falling asleep on Christmas Eve because I'm excited.

195
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Any tips on how I can fall asleep faster or relax or something?

196
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,060
Okay.

197
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
I had this problem a lot growing up.

198
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,800
I can think of one where I thought that I didn't fall asleep at all.

199
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,280
I think I had one Christmas Eve where I feel like I didn't sleep.

200
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,080
You just rocked the mic from dusk till dawn.

201
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,580
Yeah.

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,000
No sleep till Santa.

203
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,720
If there was one year I remember Griffin and I had bunk beds, it was last year.

204
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,880
Griffin and I had bunk beds and I was laying in the bottom bunk thinking,

205
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
if I raised up fast enough, I bet I could bash my head on the top bunk hard enough to

206
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,400
knock myself unconscious till Christmas morning.

207
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,000
What is good is to think about all the children in developing nations that aren't going to have

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,360
a Christmas this year because that really helps to counterbalance.

209
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,520
You know the song, Do They Know It's Christmas Time At All?

210
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,760
If you meditate on that song.

211
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,400
I think it'll counterbalance your excitement to get you to an even keel.

212
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,440
Or maybe just pop a couple zannies and have a nice big glass of scotch.

213
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, maybe just crunch down some zanny bars.

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,280
Maybe leave a couple for ho-ho and have a couple for yourself.

215
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,320
You know, just because it's Christmas Eve doesn't mean you can't party like it's Christmas.

216
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:02,960
You know what I mean?

217
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
Nice ambient trip.

218
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
You want to see Santa?

219
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,120
You can see Santa.

220
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,680
You can see Santa.

221
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,120
You'll see some sugar plums.

222
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,000
And you can see Santa.

223
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,480
And what's that?

224
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh no, he's turning into a lizard.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,200
Oh, and he's angry.

226
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,680
Run away.

227
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,480
Come here, Jim Jim.

228
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,080
I made you these edibles.

229
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
Come here, Jim.

230
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,080
It's Christmas Eve.

231
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
You got sugar plums on your head.

232
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,680
You can't sleep.

233
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,400
Eat these brownies daddy made.

234
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,760
I actually had one year where I had to deliver newspapers.

235
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,080
So I had to stay up till the middle of the night because they put them out earlier for the paper

236
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,800
boys who would be asleep for some part of Santa's visit.

237
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,160
And I remember watching Beavis and Butthead in my room waiting for the papers to arrive.

238
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
There's not a joke here.

239
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
It's just a sad, treasured holiday memory that I remember.

240
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,360
You guys ever had to work on Christmas?

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,840
Sometimes you have to work on Christmas sometimes.

242
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,320
I worked at Blockbuster.

243
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,840
Oh my god, why would they?

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,320
Who would?

245
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,360
Everyone.

246
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560
The answer is everyone.

247
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,040
The question that you're asking is who?

248
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,320
And the answer, as it turns out, is everyone.

249
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,040
Everyone.

250
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
It's the second busiest day.

251
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,480
You are kidding me.

252
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,920
No, because this is my theory.

253
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
Let me paint a picture.

254
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,920
You wake up, all the presents are open, and it's like 12-30 in the afternoon, and you

255
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,080
realize, oh no, now I just have to deal with these people for the rest of the day.

256
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,880
That's exactly it.

257
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,960
I gotta go get a Spongebob movie or something.

258
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,320
Do you know what the busiest day of the year is?

259
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,440
And this was shocking.

260
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,640
Is it gonna bum me out too?

261
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,680
No, it's...

262
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
My birthday?

263
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
My birthday.

264
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,280
No, New Year's Eve was the busiest video rental day.

265
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,240
Well, because you gotta get videos for the kids to watch while the parents party downstairs.

266
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,440
I think that's exactly it.

267
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,840
Third is Thanksgiving.

268
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,880
Thanksgiving's huge too.

269
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
One time on New Year's Eve, we were open till midnight.

270
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,520
So wait, you closed right as you counted?

271
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,120
They couldn't let you go five minutes early, so maybe you could hop on the bike and scoot

272
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,280
home?

273
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,640
No dice there.

274
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:04,800
Did watch on a little TV with rabbit ears with my co-workers Carl and Jimmy, who farted

275
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,360
on me once.

276
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,320
Oh, was that his full name?

277
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,640
Jimmy, uh...

278
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:10,960
Was he...

279
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,400
Wait, was he Native American?

280
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,540
Jimmy...

281
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,120
Jimmy walks and toots.

282
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,840
No, Jimmy would drop things behind him and ask me to pick them up.

283
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,320
And then when I would bend over to pick them up, he would fart on my head.

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,040
Like on your...

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
Like on your head?

286
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah, he would fart on my head.

287
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
And Jimmy got fired because he...

288
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
Not for head farting?

289
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
There was a second thing he did?

290
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
He also embezzled.

291
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,600
No, he embezzled.

292
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,000
HR started riding his jock for all the toots.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,800
And they caught...

294
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,840
There was some other...

295
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,400
There was some other stuff in that lint trap.

296
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,680
What actually happened is he inhaled half of a helium tank from the back room and knocked

297
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,240
himself out.

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,280
His farts were so high pitched the next day.

299
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,720
We actually...

300
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
No, when I closed New Year's Eve that one night, we were there till midnight ringing

301
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
in the New Year with my other employees.

302
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,680
And yes, don't worry, there was one sad woman browsing romantic comedies at the stroke of

303
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,280
midnight was just ringing in the New Year.

304
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,560
What did she rent?

305
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
With Dylan McDermott.

306
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
Was there a moment where she looked down at her watch and was just like, oh.

307
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,400
Well, my New Year's resolution, more of the same.

308
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,440
I think she ended up bringing my best friend's wedding, which is ironic because both the ideas

309
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
expressed in that title would be completely foreign to her.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,240
How about another question?

311
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,760
Candle Nights.

312
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,120
Do we curse in there?

313
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,680
I don't know.

314
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,800
I don't know either.

315
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
I don't think so.

316
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
Candle Nights question.

317
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,200
For the past two years, I have worked in a small business with my boss and his wife.

318
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,880
We're all fairly close and I've always exchanged...

319
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,560
Can you drop the radio emcee like...

320
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,120
Because it's like...

321
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,880
Hello, welcome to Christmas Radio.

322
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,600
Right, that's what I'm saying.

323
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:53,920
This is like...

324
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,200
It's something about the leaning over to get to the microphone.

325
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,080
Right, but it's the three of us and we're brothers and we're like all together.

326
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
People like these apps because it's like we're...

327
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Stop kissing me.

328
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,720
Brother kisses.

329
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,360
Kiss each other.

330
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,560
Let's do one cheek at the same time.

331
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,960
Okay, you're right.

332
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,760
Come in here.

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't like it.

334
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,560
I don't like it, daddy.

335
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,240
For the past two years, I've worked in a small business with my boss and his wife.

336
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,440
We're all fairly close.

337
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,280
I've always exchanged Candle Nights gifts.

338
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
Always is kind of...

339
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
First of all, this is a relatively new event.

340
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,600
We are not going to say that people were celebrating this stuff in 300 AD.

341
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,840
This is a modern, this is a fresh holiday.

342
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
So you didn't always exchange it.

343
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,960
And it's copywritten, so...

344
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
Ten months ago, we hired someone new.

345
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
And I'm worried there's going to be some awkwardness.

346
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Should I explain him that we always exchange gifts so he doesn't feel left out?

347
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,400
If so, what can I get my employers that is nice while also not trumping his present?

348
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,920
And that says Happy.

349
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,080
Candle Nights from Stumped in Sydney.

350
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,240
Well, I mean, the real answer is you've got to do a gift exchange.

351
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
And it sounds like there's four people here and everybody gets a present for somebody else.

352
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,480
And that way everybody gets a present and no one's competing with anyone else.

353
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,760
But the real answer is you're competing with his new employee.

354
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,880
And you've got to trump him because the alternative is he trumps you.

355
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,360
Listen, in this economy, one of you is going to get fired in 2014.

356
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
And you want it to be 10 month Johnny.

357
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,480
We've been pretty bullish on 2013.

358
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
But let's not like, let's not kid ourselves.

359
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,080
2014 is going to be like, we're going to get through this one by a thread.

360
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,080
We're all going to be hanging.

361
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,640
You guys might end up having to eat 10 months, Johnny.

362
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,160
And you want to make sure maybe get him some some foods going to fatten him up.

363
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,120
Maybe some muscle milk.

364
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,840
Yeah, blow it out, blow out his lats.

365
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,760
Can we come up with the Candle Nights stipulation in the bylaws?

366
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:44,960
Stating that every present exchange that happens under the Candle Nights umbrella must be somehow

367
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,280
contractually agreed upon by all parties involved in the exchange.

368
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,640
Vis-a-vis price points, maybe supplied receipts.

369
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah, we want it to be as clinical as possible.

370
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,320
It has to be because nothing is worse than like, me and our, I feel like all of us and our

371
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,480
step siblings have this issue of getting each other presents on every other year.

372
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,160
And with this odd tango where we will get them stuff and then they'll get,

373
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,360
they won't get us something.

374
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,840
Which is like, cool, which is like, not making a big deal out of it.

375
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,000
I honestly don't care about getting stuff anymore.

376
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,720
It's the dance.

377
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,440
It's the dance of like, well, you didn't get me stuff last year.

378
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,760
And they're thinking like, well, they did get us stuff last year.

379
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,000
Switchy swap, quantum leap into each other's bodies.

380
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,680
Like, we got you this nice bottle of wine.

381
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,760
Like, I should have left, damn it.

382
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,760
If you had signed something, if you had signed something, we could have gotten this together.

383
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
Everybody gets an empty box with another box inside of it.

384
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,680
And then the next year you give that box back to somebody else and that's Candle Nights.

385
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,040
I will be pro bono, au gratis.

386
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,360
I will be the third party arbitrator for all of these contracts if that's what you want.

387
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,640
Because like, I am really good at making sure that people don't like,

388
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,520
I got you this scarf I knit, cool.

389
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
Here's a new iPad retina mini.

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,360
Booyah, like that sucks.

391
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
We do a gift exchange at CSC every year.

392
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,000
And like, it wasn't, it wasn't bad this year.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
In fact, it was pretty great this year.

394
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,360
But in the past, what's always happened is there's always one new person that no one's

395
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,320
gotten to know very well and they get their name and it's like,

396
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,800
I got you some Cincinnati Shakespeare t-shirts.

397
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,920
It's like, oh, thanks.

398
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,560
I work here.

399
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,920
I just saw them and thought of you.

400
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,280
Here's three t-shirts from the place you work at.

401
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
Well, if you get upset about that, then you're a child.

402
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,680
Is there?

403
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,480
I was not upset.

404
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,080
But it's just like, it's a great upon everybody.

405
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,360
You gotta talk into the mic.

406
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
Everybody gets a gift card to Fandango.

407
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,120
Is there, is there a market for an app that you put,

408
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,080
maybe it connects to Facebook and it says, I'm buying gifts for these people.

409
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,880
Public Santa.

410
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,320
Public Santa is the name of the app.

411
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,640
Okay.

412
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,600
And they, and Public Santa, you say, I'm buying gifts for these people.

413
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,440
Did they get me anything?

414
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,200
And Public Santa tells you yes or no.

415
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,880
And then it gives you an approximate dollar value.

416
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,440
It's like that app where you put down whether or not you want to have

417
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,960
a intercourse with one of your friends.

418
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
And then if they want to have intercourse with you,

419
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,120
they have tagged you and it will tell you if you have both.

420
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
Exactly.

421
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,160
It's exactly like that.

422
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
Why don't I just make that the same app?

423
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Did I get them a gift and do I have a shot?

424
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,240
You're just one button press away from the worst holiday season of your life.

425
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,240
And what's great is it only says yes or no, but it doesn't say which one.

426
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,360
I got you, Daryl, I got you some delightful artisanal jelly.

427
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,320
Daryl, okay, I'm going to leave.

428
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,200
I got to go.

429
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,320
I will be, I got the wrong, I have to change my underwear.

430
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,520
I have to be right back.

431
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,560
I was wearing my special sexual underwear that was going to be your gift.

432
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,920
It was going to have a picture of a bow on it.

433
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,440
I have made some mistakes here.

434
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
There has to be some crossover too.

435
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,440
Cause you can say like, I did get Daryl a present, Public Santa.

436
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,800
And Public Santa is like, don't worry.

437
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,840
He's not getting you a present.

438
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,480
But he would entertain the notion.

439
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,200
Well, I think that you get Public Santa and then it's one letter off for the sexual one.

440
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,840
Maybe Public Santa tells you if the person would accept sexual intercourse with you as

441
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,600
a last resort if you can't think of any other gifts.

442
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,960
So eventually you get hard up enough.

443
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,920
You've looked at everywhere.

444
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,280
You've been to TJ and TK Maxx for our UK friends and you can't find anything.

445
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,760
And you're like, well, fine, be kind sexual intercourse.

446
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,600
Here's the best thing about Public Santa.

447
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,840
Because you have fed in the receipt for the gift that you have bought whenever you upload

448
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,560
that you have bought this person a present via QR code because of technology.

449
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
Maybe there's an NFC scan that goes on.

450
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,560
This is all technology.

451
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,920
And you don't plan on getting them a gift.

452
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
You know that you can just give them like 52 bucks, 30 cents.

453
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,760
And then you have just bought something from them as a secondhand vendor.

454
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
Right, a gone consignment.

455
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,560
It is gone consignment.

456
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,600
And the gesture, yes, is nullified.

457
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,440
But so is the potential awkwardness.

458
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,520
Public Santa, 2013, grab it on the app store.

459
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,800
It's $9.99.

460
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Don't like gift it to a friend because then you're just being kind of a jerk about it.

461
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,680
And don't steal it just because we were too lazy to make it.

462
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,640
Please cut us in on it when you actually do make this app.

463
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,140
Please.

464
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,260
It could work for other holidays, too, I guess.

465
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,380
Maybe.

466
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,900
Can we get a more easily trademarkable name like gift-o?

467
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,400
Gift-o.

468
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,820
Public gift-o.

469
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,860
Why do you want to put public in there?

470
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,900
Because it's not secret.

471
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,620
It's public.

472
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,740
It's out there.

473
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,780
It's 20 dirt.

474
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,700
We got it out.

475
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,820
Sorry for burping, everyone.

476
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,260
That's going to be tough to edit that one out.

477
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,980
Oh, I got another question here.

478
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,340
Happy camel nights, brothers.

479
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,220
Hey, happy camel nights.

480
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,460
How naked is too naked around?

481
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,140
I like Griffin for some reason.

482
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,020
We're on the drive time radio show because we're always like, hey, Christmas time is

483
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,140
a special time of year.

484
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:33,940
Caller, go ahead.

485
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,340
Sometimes it's pretty rough.

486
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,700
And here's a song for you.

487
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,020
It's Do They Know It's Christmas Around the Clock.

488
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,420
Because that's the only song I know how to play.

489
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:45,060
I put that CD in and then I broke off the CD.

490
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,420
Happy camel nights, brothers.

491
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,260
How naked is too naked around, family?

492
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm invited to a friend's for the holidays.

493
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,580
I have no family here.

494
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,340
And well, last time I was there, his father opened the door wearing only his briefs.

495
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,900
His sister came out of the shower with a towel around her waist.

496
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,460
Nothing else.

497
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,380
And his brother walked out of his room naked and said, hey, and held a short convo.

498
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,900
You got to go.

499
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,340
You got to go.

500
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,620
Hop in the tourist and go.

501
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:14,820
That's right.

502
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,540
It's a Christmas song.

503
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,820
Hop in the tourist and go.

504
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,100
Your holidays are over now.

505
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,740
Maybe if you swing by Golden Corral, there'll still be a few people there that you can

506
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,620
exchange gifts with.

507
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,380
I hope they want a pepper mill because that's what you bought.

508
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,740
This is completely untenable.

509
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,820
There is no question in my mind, if you're looking for some sort of societal reinforcement,

510
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,780
nervous about nudity, that this is not normal.

511
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,740
It's not normal.

512
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,380
It's not right.

513
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,300
Jesus, I've just figured it out.

514
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,820
OK, here's my theory.

515
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,580
Before you showed up to the house, their family got together and said, I can't believe that

516
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,180
Susan is bringing her friend from college.

517
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,940
We were just going to have a family Christmas.

518
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,380
Well, how do we get him out of here?

519
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,780
I know.

520
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,420
I'll show him.

521
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,940
I'll answer the door and adjust my briefs.

522
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,020
And then the dad did it and you didn't leave.

523
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,900
And he was like, I tried.

524
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,260
And the daughter was like, OK, great.

525
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,780
I'm going to go full bore.

526
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,660
Just do the towel and have my boobs out and everything.

527
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,780
And still didn't leave.

528
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,940
And older brother was like, OK, I'm going to I'll take it to the next level.

529
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,140
And then you still didn't leave.

530
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,260
And they're like, well, we're stuck with her.

531
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,420
This is like the adult version of pretending your house is haunted so your parents can't

532
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,940
sell it, basically.

533
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,300
And so God knows what they're going to do this year.

534
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,140
When you show up, you show up and they've just sacrificed a goat in the living room

535
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,540
and slather yourself with blood.

536
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,460
Where are you going?

537
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,060
You can eat the pancreas.

538
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,580
And you're like, well, I guess when in Rome, when in Rome, not when in Rome, even in Rome,

539
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,780
they put on some clothes.

540
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,820
I'll be like, come on, put it away.

541
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,500
Do we need all three?

542
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,900
This is now here's the thing, though.

543
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,620
You can not you can not try to meet them on this.

544
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,780
You can not try to do more.

545
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,860
Go toe to toe, literally.

546
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,540
Or maybe you do because if they're trying to spook you, you need to be vigilant.

547
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,060
You need to start peeling off layers.

548
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,820
You need to you need to start humming the baseline with the most stone faced look.

549
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,700
Just what?

550
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,180
Say something.

551
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,580
I want you to hum the baseline of three elevens, Amber, because that's a very erotically charged

552
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,080
song.

553
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,580
Maybe you can call the parents ahead of time and just say, like, just so I know, like,

554
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,340
what is the deal over there this year?

555
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,820
Did you guys get past that weird thing you were doing for a while?

556
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,940
What are you into now?

557
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,780
Maybe it's maybe it wasn't malicious, though.

558
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
Maybe this was just a perfect storm.

559
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,980
Now, the brother talking is like, it's like, no, you got to pose awkwardly against the

560
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,660
doorframe when you guys are alone.

561
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,460
Let me ask you a question.

562
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
Was the conversation about how it's a little cold in here?

563
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,420
When you guys are alone and this is going to get rippled.

564
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,740
So like and we're not going to swear, but again, challenging thoughts.

565
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,580
When you guys are nude, are you capable of doing anything except like the three or four

566
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,100
things that you have to do to not be nude?

567
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,140
Like for me, I couldn't hold a conversation with somebody.

568
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:02,980
I couldn't like I couldn't I can't brush my own hair until I'm not nude anymore.

569
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,780
It's like this animal instinct of like, I'm defenseless.

570
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,420
I need to put up my chitin of sweaters.

571
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,220
Do you know what I mean?

572
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,700
If I could, I would set up a contraption right outside the shower that would allow me to

573
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,940
spring directly into being fully clothed.

574
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,500
If my clothes could be shot onto me with some sort of clothes gun.

575
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,020
Griffin and his wife Rachel are staying with us for the holidays.

576
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,420
I woke up at four in the morning to go use the bathroom and I put on a robe for that.

577
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,300
Do you realize the statistical unlikelihood that I'd be seen even in my boxers?

578
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,820
No, I'm putting on a robe.

579
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,900
That's how demure we are in the memory house.

580
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,940
I hope it was 4 a.m.

581
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,420
You said.

582
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,940
Yeah, I hope you were in earmuffs, too.

583
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,380
Because it was cold outside.

584
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,820
Candle nights, Christmas special, very, very family friendly episode.

585
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,900
We would never talk about the thing you thought we talked about.

586
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,180
How about another Yahoo, Griffin?

587
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,300
How about another Yahoo?

588
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,140
This Yahoo was sent in by Nick Key or K. Thank you, Nick.

589
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,140
Sorry, it's hard to read the screen.

590
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:00,340
Thank you, Nick.

591
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,940
It's by Yahoo answers user who asks, What are you getting your horse in there?

592
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,740
This is S. So either your singular horse or your single horse.

593
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,380
Either your singular horse or plural horses.

594
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,220
What are you getting your singularity horse?

595
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,420
OK, guys, I don't want to embarrass you all, but I would swear to God,

596
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,420
we talked about what you get a horse as a present.

597
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Then we talk about what you got a horse for a Secret Santa.

598
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,220
OK.

599
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,020
Oh, did we really?

600
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,340
We did.

601
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,060
What did you get your horse?

602
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,340
But this is for your own horse.

603
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,420
You know this horse backward and forward.

604
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:30,740
Yeah.

605
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,060
Well, it also says in your other animals, too.

606
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,700
So for dogs, they've gotten bones in a toy.

607
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:35,940
Wow.

608
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,540
Really thought outside the box on that one.

609
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,460
Show the dog you know him.

610
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,060
I got you this Bill Bryson book.

611
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,700
My three fish.

612
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,780
Well, one needs more buddies because he's a schooling fish.

613
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,500
The other two need buddies also and plants, too, to make them happy.

614
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,180
I might also get a couple of decorations.

615
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,220
They're fish.

616
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:49,860
They're fish.

617
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,300
Can I also throw this out?

618
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,620
If your fish needs these things to be happy, why are you waiting till Christmas?

619
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,260
It doesn't understand that you're waiting till Christmas.

620
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,940
It's just sitting like, I'm so lonely.

621
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,700
It doesn't understand being deprived.

622
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,260
Yeah.

623
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,180
Oh, I guess I'm just waiting for Christmas.

624
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,540
A concept I fully grasp.

625
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,380
Lastly, my horse.

626
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,660
I need new saddle pads.

627
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,020
I want a new halter.

628
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,540
That is not a present for the horse.

629
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,500
You're buying yourself horse accoutrement.

630
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,380
Don't kid yourself.

631
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:20,980
To protect your gins while you're doing this thing that the horse definitely hates.

632
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,940
That's like saying, Darla, I buy you a new backpack so you can carry my stuff around.

633
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,740
Merry Christmas.

634
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,260
If your mailman stabbed you every time you dropped off your mail, you'd be like,

635
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,300
Merry Christmas, mailman.

636
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,940
I got you a bigger knife to stab me with.

637
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,460
Travis, it would be like getting someone a backpack to carry your stuff around, except

638
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,300
by your stuff, you mean you.

639
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,220
Darla, I got you a bigger backpack to put me in.

640
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,460
I got you an adult Bjorn for me.

641
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,820
Let me just hop up in there.

642
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,820
You know what I noticed this year?

643
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,060
You were too unladen with my girth.

644
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,700
You're walking a little too tall.

645
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm going to break you.

646
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,060
2014.

647
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,380
Any recommendations for my barn friends?

648
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,060
Last year I got them all gifts, but $25 for five people is too much to spend.

649
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,780
What do you recommend?

650
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,740
Thanks for the help.

651
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,460
Are barn friends people they've murdered in the barn?

652
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,660
Are these the ghosts of barn deaths?

653
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:16,340
Or are barn friends the friends they've created in said barn from murdering other people?

654
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,340
Out of pieces of animals, no.

655
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,980
This is my barn friend, Ow Pig.

656
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,220
You know what I did here?

657
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,420
The proportions are all off.

658
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,420
These two animals are very differently sized.

659
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,460
I think I got them a gun and the courage to do what's right.

660
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,060
I think these are actually terrible human-animal hybrids, Dr. Moreau style.

661
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,300
They've created and now live in the rafters.

662
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,900
From the creators of Pound Puppies, it's Barn Friend.

663
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,020
Oh, we're closed.

664
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,140
Our business is closed.

665
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,580
Merry Christmas, Barn Friend.

666
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,460
Kill us.

667
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,060
Please, I'm a Donkey Man.

668
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,580
Please call my children.

669
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,860
Tell them where I am.

670
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,900
Kill Donkey Man.

671
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,340
Okay, Merry Christmas, Donkey Man.

672
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:54,420
I know where you should get Donkey Man for Christmas.

673
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,300
Kill Donkey Man.

674
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,100
Kill Donkey Man.

675
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,340
Also oats maybe would be nice.

676
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,900
Some artisanal stone-cut oats.

677
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
Here's the thing, I'm gluten intolerant.

678
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,060
Kill Donkey Man.

679
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,220
I'm allergic to donkeys, ironically.

680
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,580
Should we go to the Money Zone?

681
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,420
It feels kind of crass to do that in Candle Nights.

682
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,900
Not to me.

683
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,020
I gotta pay for these presents.

684
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:14,980
I got you guys somehow.

685
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,900
Your family's in town.

686
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,020
You don't know what to do with them.

687
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,500
It's okay.

688
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,100
We can relate.

689
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,780
I don't know what to do with these guys.

690
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,740
We'll just sit around chatting for a while, then I'll wait it out.

691
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,460
This is our fourth podcast recorded just to kill time.

692
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,900
We threw the other three away.

693
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
But here's the good news for you.

694
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,580
You don't have to be like us.

695
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,620
You try to Hulu.com.

696
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,180
That's fine.

697
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,820
But why don't you elevate your game to Hulu Plus.

698
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,500
You can watch your favorite shows anytime, anywhere.

699
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,940
SNL, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Shark Tank, Scandal, Backdated.

700
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,060
Like you can binge on Lawn Mower SVU, Lost, Doctor Who, Community.

701
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,500
And they've got an original series, too.

702
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,340
Like The Wrong Man and Behind the Mask, which is the docuseries about what, Travis?

703
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,980
It's about mascots, Justin, and the people inside of them.

704
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,420
The people inside the mascots.

705
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,660
The barn friends.

706
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,140
The barn friends.

707
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:13,860
Sports world.

708
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,140
This is basically an insane amount of entertainment for $8 a month.

709
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,860
Uh-oh.

710
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,140
Binge on old favorites or catch a movie.

711
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,900
And here's the best part about it.

712
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,980
For our Christmas gift to you, we're going to give you two weeks free.

713
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,460
You're welcome.

714
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,500
Go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother and get an extended two week free trial.

715
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,460
That's HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

716
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,100
Go get into Hulu Plus now and entertain your family.

717
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,540
And you may be like me and sit there and think, oh, I've done Hulu before.

718
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,580
But trust me, man, the amount of back catalog they've got now, it's incredible.

719
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,740
So you're watching TV, HuluPlus.com.

720
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,660
You're watching this stuff streamed on your Xbox 360 or what have you.

721
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,460
But you get a little snack attack.

722
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,340
Get a little peckish.

723
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,380
Snack attack.

724
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,300
Reaching my drawer butt junk.

725
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,580
I have an insane amount of nature box snacks, and I'm ready for the holidays.

726
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:13,300
They basically delivered French toast granola I have, salted caramel pretzel pops I had.

727
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
Should I just go downstairs and get some nature box?

728
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,860
Yeah, let's stop doing this stupid show.

729
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,140
Nature doesn't sound tasty.

730
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:21,220
I want to eat my big bag of cheesy crackling.

731
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,140
You're stupid, Griffin.

732
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,420
You're stupid for Christmas.

733
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,500
It's the new cheese snack from Shia LaBeouf.

734
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,300
Don't be an idiot.

735
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
This isn't rabbit food, you idiot.

736
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,740
You stupid butt face.

737
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,060
There's just no trans fats or high fructose corn syrup.

738
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,780
It's not artificial.

739
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,700
It's just real natural snacks that you can enjoy.

740
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,140
And it ships to you for free monthly like a subscription service.

741
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,980
You can switch up your snacks whenever you want.

742
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,780
H1 comes in like a nice stay fresh pouch.

743
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,620
You can reseal when you're done eating.

744
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,780
And then you can use the box afterwards for, I don't know, dioramas or whatever you want.

745
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,340
Diarrhea.

746
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,780
You can use it for diarrhea.

747
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,860
You won't get diarrhea from these snacks, guaranteed.

748
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,220
But you might get them from your Buff Puffs.

749
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,660
Buff Puffs, actually that's like their guarantee is that they will give you diarrhea.

750
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,980
They're like the joke candy from Harry Potter that you eat to get diarrhea to get out of school.

751
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,180
Your first order of nature box is going to be 50% off thanks to us.

752
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,100
You're going to use the promo code MYBROTHER, that's the one word, at naturebox.com.

753
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,820
You're going to get your first order 50% off.

754
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,100
Keep your hand out of the vending machine because they'll get stuck and you'll lose it.

755
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:18,740
And it'll pull over.

756
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,660
A lot of people die from vending machines every year.

757
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,780
That's actually what happened in that movie 128 hours.

758
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,060
Is that the right number of hours?

759
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:25,940
That was extra hours.

760
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,380
That was the sequel.

761
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:33,700
We got a personal message here from Hamish.

762
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,660
Hamish.

763
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,700
It's going out to Richard.

764
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,500
Dear Hamish.

765
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,540
Travis, will you read this one for me?

766
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,180
Because I feel like you do.

767
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,620
There's messages for Hamish.

768
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,260
I mean, I said that stuff already.

769
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,740
But I'm trying to set up a certain feeling in the air.

770
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,300
Get a vibe.

771
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,100
Get a rhythm.

772
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,220
Let me start over.

773
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,100
This message is for Hamish from Richard.

774
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,660
Dear, dear, AKA Hamish, AKA USC heavy boy, AKA weeaboo dad.

775
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,340
If you guys are secretly making us say racist stuff, we'll never forgive you.

776
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,060
Wishing you a very, oh goodness.

777
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,380
Heavy boys keep taking all my jobs.

778
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,580
A very GVCCI birth-iversary.

779
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,860
I think it's supposed to be Gucci.

780
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,780
Okay, a very Gucci birth-iversary.

781
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,620
And a custom prime 24th year.

782
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,900
Real proud of you for getting over that unemployment thing you are doing.

783
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:25,940
And calm cats in the cradle-ulations on your dad ending his tours.

784
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,420
Expecting big things from you in 14.

785
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,420
Lots of love from your boy, Rich Dog.

786
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,860
Okay, listen.

787
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Listen, Richard.

788
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,660
If we just gave a secret order to assassinate the president, we will never forgive you.

789
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,860
We cannot be party to that.

790
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,460
Did he say Gucci birth-iversary or GVCCI birth-iversary?

791
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,980
We just activated a very, very racist splinter cell somewhere.

792
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,340
This is completely untenable.

793
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,700
We gotta kill all the heavy boys.

794
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,460
Oh no.

795
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,020
Not again.

796
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,140
Not that language, please.

797
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,340
I have to go into hiding now.

798
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,220
It's candle lights.

799
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,380
Happy birthday, Richard.

800
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,060
Happy birthday, Hamish.

801
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,260
Happy birthday, Hamish.

802
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,140
And happy losing your money to us, Richard.

803
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,380
And happy assassination of a public figure, Richard.

804
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,300
Got another message, Griffin.

805
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,660
Who's it for and from?

806
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:19,140
This one is for Andrew Considine and Hannah Beckman.

807
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,820
And it's from Hannah Beckman.

808
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,060
And Andrew Considine.

809
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,660
Did we just get conned a bit?

810
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,380
Rabbit hole.

811
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,460
Happy birthday to Hannah from Andrew and Andrew from Hannah.

812
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,740
And to all the other November babies out there, missed it by that much.

813
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,180
We are almost in the next month that we almost missed it by.

814
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,900
Hannah is a historic preservationist out of Buffalo, NY.

815
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,100
She protects buffaloes.

816
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,060
And Andrew is a graphic designer in Erie, PA.

817
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,580
And what is that?

818
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,860
Is that Pennsylvania?

819
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:50,820
Yeah.

820
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,140
Is it?

821
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,620
Yeah.

822
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,420
No, it's pop.

823
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,060
It's pomaine.

824
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
And although they live apart, their favorite thing to do

825
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,780
is listen to my bim bam together.

826
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,020
Thanks for the laughs.

827
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,500
Even though I know how very far apart we are,

828
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,140
it helps to think we might be listening to the same great show.

829
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:08,900
Griffin.

830
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,980
Thanks for the laughs.

831
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,420
Sometimes.

832
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,220
And happy birthday to us.

833
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,060
Also, you both owe us $50.

834
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,820
You both owe us $50,000 if we're gonna pay for the rights.

835
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,860
That was not fair use.

836
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,940
It was not parodic because it was not funny.

837
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,500
Do you think it's okay to finish someone else's food?

838
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,820
Do you have a fight with your friend over whether or not

839
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,020
he should wear his Philly's garb to a Colorado Rockies game?

840
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,900
Does your wife want to keep a chamber pot in her art studio?

841
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,340
If so, please do not write in to Judge John Hodgman.

842
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,860
I heard all those cases already.

843
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,540
Judge John Hodgman is the show where I, John Hodgman,

844
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,020
adjudicate disputes between real people calling in over the internet.

845
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,780
And I tell them who is right and who is wrong over such important issues

846
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,580
as is a machine gun a robot and is it okay to go through the garbage

847
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
at the Canadian House of Pizza and Garbage?

848
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,140
Bailiff Jesse Thorne rounds out the cast for a fun-filled podcast

849
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,340
of Judgment and Justice.

850
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,420
Kind of two of the same thing, actually.

851
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,940
Judge John Hodgman, take a listen if you do not mind.

852
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,980
I order it.

853
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,180
Come visit the courtroom.

854
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,660
It is open to all and located at MaximumFun.org.

855
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,020
Uh, here's another question from, uh, let's see.

856
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,300
Here we go.

857
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,580
Dear my brothers, what is the history genesis, if you will, of candle lights?

858
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,260
Would you say it's the next step of the natural evolution,

859
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,780
the so-called war on Christmas?

860
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,820
Or rather, does it represent the satirical and ironic sentiment

861
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,180
that has saturated popular culture for the last couple of decades?

862
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,220
There is nothing.

863
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,820
Oh, I'm, I'm kind of angry now.

864
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,820
So you've just made me angry on my favorite holiday.

865
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,140
There's nothing satirical or ironic about candle lights at all.

866
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,700
Hey Scrooge.

867
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,460
How's your, how's your candle lights, Scrooge?

868
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,300
Jeremy, I hate to come at you like this.

869
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,140
Here's what candle lights is all about.

870
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,620
I'll sum it up for you in, in direct terms.

871
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,260
Candle lights is about stripping away the, the religious boundaries

872
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,140
that have, have defined this holiday season.

873
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,700
And instead saying, hey, we all just want to be happy together for a couple weeks.

874
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,220
Can we just have a nice candle light?

875
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,340
It is, it is, it's the end of the war on Christmas is what it is.

876
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,780
Because like, it's kind of like when-

877
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,180
It's the Geneva convention of the war on Christmas.

878
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,060
When rebel and union soldiers got together and they did that, the Treaty of Versailles,

879
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,660
and they like patched things up and they're like, it's time for a new America

880
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,940
where the two of us can work together.

881
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,700
Maybe we'll have a little bit of slavery.

882
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,780
Maybe we could have just like a little bit of slavery on the side.

883
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,700
And Winston Churchill negotiated the deal.

884
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,420
Give us just South Carolina to just still run rampant and go crazy, crazy.

885
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:48,740
Give us Florida to just like do some experimentation with like how a state can possibly work.

886
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,220
Give us those two states and then like, we'll do the rest.

887
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,740
Yes, we will abolish slavery in the other like 14 states that we had, we had peace.

888
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,980
We're going to keep a light amount of tasteful slavery.

889
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,020
We're going to keep a light amount of slavery in South Carolina, Florida.

890
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
We are just going to make it the wasteland.

891
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,060
They can do what they want.

892
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,500
They're going to get super hot crimes.

893
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,940
Good news, they can have Disney.

894
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,220
They can have Disney.

895
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,100
Give us just a place where just like, give us a George Zimmerman wonderland is all that we want.

896
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,340
And if we do that, then we'll do the rest of the other stuff.

897
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,500
And then they came together, they agreed on it, they shook hands.

898
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,140
And then they had a new, arguably not as great, but definitely more stable America.

899
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,260
That's what Candle Nights is.

900
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,980
It's not as good as any of the holidays, but it's better than no holiday.

901
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,780
But you know what it is?

902
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,420
It's not going to, I'm not going to see people on Facebook saying like,

903
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,140
oh, I don't see why we have to say Merry Candle Nights.

904
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,740
Candle Nights isn't for another two weeks.

905
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,660
Christmas is two days closer than Candle Nights.

906
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,860
So maybe we should just.

907
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,900
Or someone saying like, I can't believe you said Merry Candle Nights to me.

908
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,220
Say, it's like, no, it's all encompassed.

909
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,300
It begins exactly when you want it to.

910
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,660
It ends when you tire of it.

911
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,860
It's the most wonderful holiday because it's like a choose your own adventure holiday.

912
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,820
Who is the Brazilian governor dude that was like, guess what?

913
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,340
Christmas holiday kicks off like middle of November officially

914
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,940
because we want people to be happy.

915
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,300
We want you to have like a super, super long Christmas time.

916
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,900
Like that guy is the Pope of Candle Nights.

917
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,540
You know the weird thing about, it pops off in the UK early.

918
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,940
Like we were there in the mid to late November, pre Thanksgiving.

919
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,900
And it was already.

920
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,700
They don't have Thanksgiving.

921
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,500
I know, I know.

922
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,380
There's no wall.

923
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,100
There's no barrier.

924
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,900
There's no barrier to it.

925
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:24,740
They go into pre-pro on the Doctor Who Christmas special in like late July.

926
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,820
And then they have to start doing it then.

927
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,460
They have to.

928
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,660
So that is where Candle Nights comes from.

929
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,220
Griffin, do you have a hot Yahoo popping off or should I read another question?

930
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,260
I have a hot and ready Yahoo to pop off for you guys.

931
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:38,100
It's a $5 hot and ready Yahoo.

932
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Sent in by Nick Key also.

933
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,580
It is Jermaine.

934
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,220
Hear me out.

935
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,180
You're going to get angry.

936
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,780
Thank you, Nick Key.

937
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,860
It's by Yahoo Answers User Sooners83.

938
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,580
You hear that, Trav?

939
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,460
Yeah, boomer.

940
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,260
Dr. Up, a Little Caesars hot and ready, he asks.

941
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,140
Now, I know a lot of you are wondering, how does this fit in?

942
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,660
Same as like you watch Hulu to like get through the holidays, to get through like the boring times.

943
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,180
We need to do something.

944
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,180
If you need to, if there's hungry times on the holidays, maybe you're not much of a chef.

945
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,620
Maybe you can't make a Christmas moose.

946
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:08,740
What do you do?

947
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,020
You roll down to the Little Caesars.

948
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,220
You get $5 hot and ready.

949
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,700
Nobody is going to be impressed though, if you have a plain Jane.

950
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:22,180
Pepperoni or cheese or do they even do sausage at the hot and ready?

951
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,620
They'll do pretty much anything you want to.

952
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:27,060
What I love about the hot and ready and no questions asked.

953
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,980
Rachel and I were doing a party the other month and we got two pizzas and it wasn't enough to feed our guests.

954
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,220
And we live literally across the street from Little Caesars.

955
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,500
So we walked in there and they're like, hot and ready, you want it?

956
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,620
And I was like, yeah, I'll have a cheese.

957
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,580
They're like, we only have pepperoni because that's the only pizza we make here.

958
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,940
It's the only one anyone asks for.

959
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,260
Like, how much do we have to wait for the cheese?

960
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,540
And they said five minutes.

961
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,860
And we said, okay, we can wait five.

962
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,140
It's against the slogan.

963
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,660
So it's a hot and almost ready.

964
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:56,180
We will wait five minutes to get the type of hot and ready pizza we want.

965
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,620
So we sat down in the only two chairs because like, nobody sit.

966
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,500
Longest five minutes of your entire life.

967
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,660
The staff is staring at you going, I think I'll leave.

968
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,740
In this five minute period, we were waiting.

969
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:13,140
Two different people came into the Little Caesars, said, I would like a cheese or a sausage.

970
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,060
They said, we only have pepperoni.

971
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,260
It'll take five minutes.

972
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,020
And they said, I guess I'll just take the pepperoni then.

973
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,060
Like, you are eating a Little Caesars pepperoni pizza at, it was like 9.30 at night.

974
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,900
How tight did they time out their evening?

975
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,220
Oh, I gotta go.

976
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,780
I gotta get to the governor's mansion at 9.45.

977
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,020
I got that ball starting at 9.45.

978
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,820
Can't be late.

979
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,060
Both people were willing to compromise and it wasn't, the most shocking thing is that

980
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,460
they compromised in front of me or Rachel, who were sitting there like, mm, tut, tut.

981
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,700
Like, mm, couldn't kick it for five to get the, I guess you could just take the stuff

982
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,500
off and it'll still have the, the, the leavings of pepperoni on it.

983
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,140
Oh, cotillion starts in 20 minutes, I gotta go.

984
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,980
Oh, it was such a bummer.

985
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:59,220
But listen, you can, you gotta take these pizzas, and this is something that not many

986
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,820
people do, but you gotta take it and chop and screw it.

987
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,620
What about this?

988
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,180
Get two hot and ready, stuck them together, chop them together.

989
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,820
Calzones.

990
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,460
Calzones.

991
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,020
I got it.

992
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:11,140
Everybody loves the Papa John's thin crust, because when you get a Papa John's thin crust,

993
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:15,860
you get this special packet of seasoning, but I'm here to tell you, as a special candle

994
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,180
night's gift from me to you, you can just fake that.

995
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,300
Here's what you're gonna do.

996
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:23,460
You're taking this off a website, you looked up and it has three out of five stars, so

997
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,540
like, already its accuracy is suspect.

998
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:29,380
Two tablespoons paprika, two tablespoons salt, two tablespoons garlic powder, one tablespoon

999
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,420
black pepper, one tablespoon onion powder, one tablespoon cayenne pepper, one tablespoon

1000
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,580
dried oregano, one tablespoon dried thyme.

1001
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,380
Now mix that all up.

1002
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,660
I don't want to put you on blast, Justin.

1003
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:40,820
I don't want to put you on blast, Justin, but it's two and a half tablespoons of paprika.

1004
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,020
Somebody just made that.

1005
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,340
They finished it after you started saying dried thyme.

1006
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,220
They're like, let's make this up, and they taste it, and they said, I've been lied to

1007
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,460
by them.

1008
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,220
I also want to throw out, on this website, it lists the prep time as five minutes.

1009
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,540
Five minutes.

1010
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,660
Which one's oregano again?

1011
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,860
There's a lot of measuring going on, but you get that, make that into a container.

1012
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,180
I had a container of that for a long time, and I'm out now, but now I'm gonna make more.

1013
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,620
I know what somebody's getting for candle night.

1014
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,780
Why did you put that, fess up thyme.

1015
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,140
Here comes taxicab confessions.

1016
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,100
To the McElroy brothers, tell me exactly the kinds of foods you would put this homemade

1017
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,580
Papa John seasoning on.

1018
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,620
Your father Johnny's off-brand seasoning.

1019
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,180
Okay.

1020
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:18,900
Pizza.

1021
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,140
Yeah.

1022
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,260
Pizza.

1023
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,180
Centric Hot Pockets.

1024
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,820
Italian meatball Hot Pockets, because those are basically pizza Hot Pockets.

1025
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:30,260
You just went down the oubliette of sadness.

1026
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,900
Let them finish.

1027
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,020
Chicken.

1028
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,700
That could actually be all right.

1029
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,100
Beef.

1030
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,180
Beef, chicken and beef pizza, and pizza.

1031
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,220
That's it.

1032
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,020
You didn't make a pasta once, and you didn't try and experiment.

1033
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:44,900
You didn't put it on pizza doughnuts.

1034
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,620
It's good and everything.

1035
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,780
Did you make quesadillas once, and you're like, let me just...

1036
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,420
Pizzadillas.

1037
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,660
No, it's like a pizza seasoning.

1038
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,940
I put it in a jar that I wrote pizza seasoning on the top of it, and there, that's it.

1039
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,980
That's the whole thing.

1040
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:57,940
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

1041
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,540
Go make that seasoning, and you'll be like, wow, this is a very convincing replication.

1042
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,100
Here's my seasoning.

1043
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,660
Ready?

1044
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Put some veggie oil on hot.

1045
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,700
Get it hot.

1046
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,300
Get it to where you put a chopstick in it.

1047
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,100
You get a steady stream of bubbles, but it doesn't go crazy.

1048
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,500
Then you've got to bread some artichoke hearts.

1049
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,220
Throw those in there.

1050
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,500
Slap that on your pizza.

1051
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,460
Merry Candle Nights.

1052
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,340
Hello, and happy Candle Nights to the three wise brothers.

1053
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:22,660
I seek advice regarding how to handle tiny holiday celebrations.

1054
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,820
Each year, our extended family Candle Nights party has five to eight people,

1055
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,940
but due to a perfect storm of scheduling conflicts,

1056
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,340
I'll be the only person traveling to my parents' place.

1057
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:39,220
Do you have any advice as to how to celebrate the most joys of times with only your parents?

1058
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,060
That's from Jim in Jersey City.

1059
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,100
P.S. There will be a limit of two games to take it to ride.

1060
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,020
You have to open everyone's presents that aren't there and claim them as your own.

1061
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,580
Oh, Susan missed it this year?

1062
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,540
This is mine.

1063
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,300
These are mine.

1064
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,060
Now I have a foot massager.

1065
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:59,700
I have three foot massagers because our parents aren't creative with the gift giving.

1066
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,980
I, how do you, broader question.

1067
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,900
How do you do anything with only a party of three people?

1068
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,500
Oh, let me throw this out.

1069
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,340
Excuse yourself to the bedroom several times with several costume changes.

1070
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,820
Come back as your brothers and sisters routinely.

1071
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,180
I will throw that out as well.

1072
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,860
But out in the trash.

1073
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,420
What's that?

1074
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,100
I think Susan needs me in the bedroom.

1075
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:24,340
Hello, mother.

1076
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,460
Are your parents senile?

1077
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,740
Because you could pull this off.

1078
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,740
You could say, hey, good news.

1079
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,460
Everybody showed up.

1080
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,580
But they're waiting in the bedroom.

1081
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,220
They're very shy.

1082
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,660
They don't want to come out all together.

1083
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:38,500
Gaslight your parents and maybe you could do like a Groundhog Day ass thing and keep

1084
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,340
waking up in the morning and reset it back to Christmas.

1085
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,620
Rate yourself one to ten.

1086
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,140
How good are you at puppetry?

1087
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,580
And ventriloquism.

1088
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,020
Darlene, she's in the kitchen.

1089
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,300
I'm doing fine, mom.

1090
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,380
I'm making your favorite cookies.

1091
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,620
I'm making your favorite sweet potatoes.

1092
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,420
Are we talking about a weekend or are we talking about a night?

1093
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,900
Because we need to figure this out hour by hour.

1094
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,100
Because two games of Ticket to Ride, if they're contentious games, may be an hour and a half

1095
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,340
each.

1096
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,100
Can you even do Ticket to Ride with three players?

1097
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,380
And then you're going to a drinking game.

1098
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,340
So that's three hours.

1099
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,860
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.

1100
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,140
That'll be the last four hours.

1101
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,460
So we have seven hours of the day spoken for so far.

1102
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,660
That's finished.

1103
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:18,580
We are assuming if you go to bed at eight o'clock, which you're going to have to do

1104
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,780
because there's not going to be any stuff and you're going to be super daylight drunk

1105
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:23,220
by eight o'clock.

1106
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,340
I would suggest that you guys maybe don't stay at a house.

1107
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,620
Like don't be.

1108
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:28,420
Oh, that's good.

1109
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:32,500
I think don't be at the place where you've had big family thanksgivings together.

1110
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,060
I think maybe why don't you go to a movie together?

1111
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,500
A lot of people go to Christmas Day movies.

1112
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,300
I did not realize this until I was working at the paper on Christmas Day once.

1113
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,700
What's up?

1114
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,620
I also worked at the paper on Christmas Day.

1115
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,380
And they said, go to the movies.

1116
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,660
There's people there all the time.

1117
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,900
And I was like, wow, this sounds like a friggin' hot lead.

1118
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,620
I got to get out there.

1119
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,180
And you're right.

1120
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,940
Bust this story wide open.

1121
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,260
So I went and walked up to the line of people.

1122
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:57,540
And apparently, I think they were as surprised as I was that their movie going was newsworthy.

1123
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,700
But I did ask each of them like, so what'd you see?

1124
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,500
Or you could do something very similar and do what I like to call real holiday TV, which

1125
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,860
is you and your family wander around the neighborhood and look into people's houses

1126
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,620
and watch them experience Christmas.

1127
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,580
See how many people they have.

1128
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,580
See if there'd be room for three more.

1129
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:12,820
Yeah.

1130
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,780
And then just duck in there.

1131
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,100
I couldn't help but notice your table wasn't quite full yet.

1132
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,860
Could you seat two, maybe three?

1133
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,100
That is a big bowl of dip for just four people.

1134
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,140
Looks like it could easily feed seven.

1135
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,500
You always have leftovers, you know?

1136
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,540
Always have leftovers.

1137
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,100
Man.

1138
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:32,500
Can you recreate that scene in Home Alone where he tries to make it look like a rocking

1139
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,620
house party is going on to keep the burglars away, but you do that.

1140
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,620
And maybe the other people that you're handling are your family members.

1141
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,460
And also, right when you finish getting that set up, do like a bunch of mescaline.

1142
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,500
And then maybe the illusion will be complete.

1143
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,580
You could send them to our house, Jim.

1144
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,660
Come on over.

1145
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,700
Yeah, leave two parents.

1146
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,220
And then they look and go, what do we do?

1147
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,140
They can come over, too.

1148
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:55,380
Yeah.

1149
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,380
Guys, I'm so happy to be here with you two.

1150
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,900
I'm happy to be here, too.

1151
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,260
Well, I'm going to leave tomorrow.

1152
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,220
You are leaving tomorrow.

1153
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,700
That's true.

1154
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,740
Candle Knight's question.

1155
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:10,740
I'm 25 and just moved to Wisconsin to start my first full-time job.

1156
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,620
Because of this, I won't be able to head home for Christmas this year.

1157
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,460
First time I won't be able to make it.

1158
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:18,500
My parents and older sister live in Southern California where I grew up.

1159
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,780
SoCal, babe.

1160
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,420
Wow, that sucked.

1161
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,620
Redondo, what's up?

1162
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,780
Well, I'm really sad that I won't be able to spend Christmas with them this year.

1163
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,340
I'm heading to a friend's place in Chicago, which is awesome.

1164
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,580
But it just won't be the same.

1165
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,540
What are some awesome things for me to do this Christmas season to stop being sad that

1166
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,180
I won't be able to see my family for the holiday this year?

1167
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,100
You could cry a bunch.

1168
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:38,820
You could cry.

1169
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,940
Don't talk to your parents because they're just going to make you feel guilty about it.

1170
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:42,980
Well, OK.

1171
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:43,540
You could.

1172
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,220
I don't know what your technology setup is.

1173
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,100
But you could just FaceTime the whole day and feel like you're there.

1174
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,180
Travis, how are you handling not being able to see your family on holiday this year?

1175
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,860
Oh, I'm going to have to tell you guys I'm dead.

1176
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,980
Like, there's been a nuclear strike here in West Virginia and y'all dead to me.

1177
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,380
No, I mean, probably phone calls and drinking.

1178
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,660
Yeah, I might scream that one.

1179
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,340
Ow.

1180
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,780
I'm just saying, like, can Teresa hear us?

1181
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,820
I mean, eventually, yes.

1182
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,660
We are clearly the way better family to kick it with.

1183
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,940
Listen, don't I know?

1184
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,380
I would say-

1185
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:13,860
Just kidding.

1186
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,940
No, I'm just saying I love my in-laws.

1187
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,900
They're really terrific.

1188
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,180
I think I've met them once.

1189
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:18,900
Yeah, they're great.

1190
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,420
Wait, I mean, here's the thing.

1191
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,860
What you got to do is this is your opportunity to make some new holiday traditions for yourself.

1192
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,540
So maybe your friends decorate cookies and watch Die Hard.

1193
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,660
And that's like your Christmas thing.

1194
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,820
What you don't want to do is spend the day trying to recreate traditions that you and

1195
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:35,540
your family did.

1196
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,580
Well, it would be worse than that.

1197
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,420
Like, you know guys in my house, we don't-

1198
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:38,980
Stop it.

1199
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,500
We always watch them up at Christmas, Carol.

1200
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:41,620
And then we sing songs for the neighbors.

1201
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,860
The governor's cat is a crazy cat.

1202
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,020
What are you doing?

1203
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,660
Start your own thing and make it like really based around the fact that you're young and

1204
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,860
you could do whatever you want.

1205
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,300
So make it like a drinking game set up around Charlie Brown Christmas.

1206
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,020
You know what I mean?

1207
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,540
Make it a fun thing that you would never feel comfortable doing with your family.

1208
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:07,060
If you don't set bars for yourself as to what connotates Christmas, and that's something

1209
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:11,620
that I think we've had to sort of make our peace with as you get older.

1210
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:19,060
Like, from the time I was born until, God, until I was probably like 21 or 22, we would

1211
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,140
sit at the top of the stairs each Christmas morning.

1212
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,660
Sometimes my parents would put a string actually across the top of the stairs, the note on

1213
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:27,940
it says, don't go downstairs, even though we all knew the rules pretty well.

1214
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,820
And we would, you know, wait for them to say, come on down.

1215
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,580
Our parents get a cup of tea or whatever.

1216
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,380
And then we would rush downstairs and open our presents.

1217
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,380
And like, that was our baseline of Christmas.

1218
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:37,940
And I think that-

1219
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,340
Like 22, 19, and like 60.

1220
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,580
We thought that was like fully Normie, Norm Macdonald behavior.

1221
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,220
And that was our, but that was like what we thought of as Christmas.

1222
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,660
And like, the further I get away from that, the happier I am just to like, you know, be

1223
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,340
with people that I like and do fun stuff and, you know.

1224
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,940
Well, with Justin going to the Smurls too, now it started like, instead of waking up

1225
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,180
at like 7 a.m. and tearing into stuff, like we get together at like noon, one o'clock

1226
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,660
and, you know, very casually, like go to town.

1227
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,820
And it's, you know, that's the thing is traditions are what you make them.

1228
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,940
And every year, you know, it's your own setup.

1229
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,740
And I think you can stress yourself out and make yourself really sad by saying like, oh,

1230
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,180
I can't recreate these things.

1231
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,180
But like, maybe this is the year that it's your Christmas.

1232
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:24,420
Yeah.

1233
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,060
You know?

1234
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,380
Yeah.

1235
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:28,580
Do, when in Rome, follow their suggestions.

1236
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,060
Yeah, man.

1237
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,180
Chicago's an awesome town.

1238
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,420
I bet you could find some awesome Christmas stuff.

1239
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,820
Not from November to March it ain't.

1240
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,500
Here's a fun thing to do in Chicago.

1241
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,780
Try not to die.

1242
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:43,220
Try not to die from either the hailstorm of actual hail or bullets from guns.

1243
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,660
Merry Christmas, Chicago.

1244
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,500
You were great in the 80s when they made all those movies about you that were all set in

1245
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:56,420
Chicago and then global warming and global gunning happened because of global gunning.

1246
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,860
There was that one.

1247
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:03,220
There was that the El Nino came, the El Nino of guns, and then everyone had one.

1248
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,500
Merry Christmas, Chicago.

1249
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,460
Please stay safe.

1250
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,660
Stay indoors.

1251
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,700
Griffin, do you have any more Yahoos?

1252
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:13,380
I want to be done because I just want to get back to spending time with our whole family.

1253
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,700
And I think we've given people the greatest gift of all, which is 50 minutes of our time.

1254
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:17,940
Yeah.

1255
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,900
This one was sent in by Ira Ray.

1256
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,500
Are you Ira Ray?

1257
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,220
Who wants to know?

1258
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,180
I caught you by surprise.

1259
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,220
I actually saw you.

1260
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,260
Like, I got to get it.

1261
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,300
Woof, woof, woof.

1262
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:27,940
Thank you, Ira Ray.

1263
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,220
He peed a little when that happened.

1264
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,460
This one's by Yahoo Answers user Racy Lady, who asks,

1265
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,260
alternative to Kris Kringle, has anyone any ideas on Christmas presents other than personal?

1266
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,260
Or Kris Kringle would like to use something new for the family.

1267
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,700
From President Obama.

1268
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,060
That might be good.

1269
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,780
You're talking about different sources from which presents could have come.

1270
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,700
Oh, you could do like alternate person.

1271
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,260
So like to Travis from evil Travis from other dimension.

1272
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,180
You're going to have to build a lot of fiction around that, though.

1273
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,940
I think there's got to be an easier solution.

1274
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:05,940
Okay, to Travis from the ghost that watches you while you sleep.

1275
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,180
Do you guys know that if you space out while Griffin's reading the question

1276
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,860
and then jump back into it, you can turn it into a game.

1277
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:17,060
So like you use context clues to try to walk backwards to the-

1278
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,940
Like in Paycheck, where he like has to go back and put the machine together.

1279
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,860
Travis, without giving him any more clues, Justin, what do you think the Yahoo answer is about?

1280
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:28,820
Griffin, if you put a pistol in my mouth, I could not tell you.

1281
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:30,260
Well, no, because you'd have a mouthful of pistol.

1282
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:30,980
You'd still have a good pistol.

1283
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,700
Look at me in the eyes.

1284
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,660
Look at me in the eyes.

1285
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,140
Presence.

1286
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,940
Different present sources other than yourself or Ho-Ho.

1287
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,380
What can they be?

1288
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,140
For friends, family, children, neighbors, policemen.

1289
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:46,820
You're saying like-

1290
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,780
You're going to write something on that from tag.

1291
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,500
Okay.

1292
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,300
What are you going to write?

1293
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,540
Not yourself, not Santa, not Chris Kringle.

1294
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,900
Why can't I write those?

1295
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,140
Because they're looking for fun, extra sources.

1296
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,180
Justin, it's Yahoo answers.

1297
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,700
Why does anyone do anything for anything?

1298
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,420
What you're setting up is this weird contest where it's like,

1299
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,460
what did Santa get you?

1300
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,060
And what did SpongeBob give you?

1301
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:10,020
And it's like next year, it's like, do you want to go sit on Santa's lap?

1302
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:10,660
No.

1303
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,340
Santa gave me a stupid sweater.

1304
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,020
SpongeBob gave me a tasty baked oven.

1305
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,900
I'm losing my mind over here.

1306
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,500
What about the spirit of generosity?

1307
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:17,460
Could you put that on there?

1308
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,540
How about you give them an empty box.

1309
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,220
So when they open it up, there's nothing in there.

1310
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,900
You say, we donated your presents to poor kids.

1311
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,660
And this is from life lessons.

1312
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,940
If you want to antagonize your child towards somebody else

1313
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,300
for some arbitrary reason, like you get them a box

1314
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,900
and they open the box and it's full of broken glass.

1315
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,180
And then the kid's like, what?

1316
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,620
Let me check that from tag.

1317
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,700
It's from former MTV VJ Sway.

1318
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,020
Man, I hate this.

1319
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:44,980
I'm only eight years old.

1320
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,220
I've never seen Sway and I don't know Sway from Joe.

1321
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:48,820
But man, I hate this guy.

1322
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,660
They open the box and there's just a head in there.

1323
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,700
It's from Kevin Spacey.

1324
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,740
It's from Kevin Spacey.

1325
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,100
Oh, see, but that was a goof.

1326
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,540
What?

1327
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,340
No, Kevin Spacey's a serial killer in real life.

1328
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,700
That movie's based on him.

1329
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,860
I'm saying maybe your parents want you to hate Sway.

1330
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,380
Maybe they have some sort of beef.

1331
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,780
Maybe they liked who's another VJ.

1332
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,740
You're saying they had a child so they could find someone

1333
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,420
to take the fall for killing Sway.

1334
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,820
Or-

1335
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,980
And then someday buy an ad on a podcast

1336
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,380
that activates that child to kill Sway.

1337
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,700
Happy Christmas, everyone.

1338
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,900
We killed Sway.

1339
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,340
We finally took him out.

1340
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,820
He was number two on the list right after Osama.

1341
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,940
You know what's sad is Sway thought this would be the episode

1342
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,980
he played for his family.

1343
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,140
I'm sorry.

1344
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:30,820
I don't know what these guys are talking about.

1345
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,460
I don't know what happened here.

1346
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,860
We found him in a cave underneath Carson Daly.

1347
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:36,740
Here's the weirdest part when Griffin could pick any random celebrity.

1348
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,260
Sway is like one of the 0.05% of celebrities

1349
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,020
that Griffin actually has had some interaction with

1350
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:42,900
and kind of likes.

1351
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,460
That's what I'm saying.

1352
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,020
As weird as I can say.

1353
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,780
I have communed with Sway.

1354
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,980
Sway and I have lunched-

1355
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,380
Well, we all commune with Sway every day, Griffin,

1356
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,500
when we look inside ourselves.

1357
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,820
When I kneel towards Sway's house.

1358
00:55:54,820 --> 00:56:03,300
Sway planted the seed in the fertile loins of my journalistic endeavors

1359
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,300
and my career at large.

1360
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,060
He is a lovely human being.

1361
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,540
There's nobody on earth that hates Sway except for these two people.

1362
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,140
That's how they found each other.

1363
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,900
They were having a really hard time.

1364
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,860
They met on the message board of which they were both moderators.

1365
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,580
They were having a hard time living in a world

1366
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:22,660
where there were only two people that hated Sway,

1367
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,060
so they had to give birth to this third person

1368
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,500
that wasn't so crazy about their customs.

1369
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,620
That's how religions begin.

1370
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,220
And that's the story of how Mr. Kurt Loader met his wife.

1371
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,820
Mrs. Kurt Loader.

1372
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:33,780
Mrs. Kurt Loader.

1373
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:39,220

1380
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:55,620
Blame the person who thought you would enjoy it

1381
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:59,140
even though you obviously didn't and we're sorry about that.

1382
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,260

1393
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,940
I want to thank John Roderick in the long winters

1394
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,900
for the use of our theme song.

1395
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:35,860
It's a departure, which is you can find it on the album

1396
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,740
Putting the Days to Bed.

1397
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:39,140
I believe it is track 10, if I'm not mistaken.

1398
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:42,980
I believe it is track 10 on that LP, that long play album.

1399
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,100
I also want to give a shout out to all of our listeners

1400
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,940
who are also retail employees.

1401
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:51,220
And I'm sorry about the 26th when you get flooded with gifts

1402
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,460
that people returned because they did not like them.

1403
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,540
It is the saddest day of the year.

1404
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:55,940
Yeah.

1405
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,140
Boxing day, they call it.

1406
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:01,140
People punch each other in the box to try and,

1407
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,820
oh, the Macy's is going to run out of money.

1408
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:03,940
I got to get in the front of that line.

1409
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,820
Punch, punch, punch, punch, punch.

1410
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,940
And that's going to do it for us.

1411
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,740
I think I'd like-

1412
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:09,700
What?

1413
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,620
I feel like we should have like a warmer send off.

1414
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,060
Well, I was thinking we should do,

1415
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:16,260
I'll get my guitar and we can do a song.

1416
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,140
That sounds terrible.

1417
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,940
Can we just say like, happy holidays and we love you all

1418
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,220
and we can't wait to see you in 2014.

1419
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,420
And stick around after the outro music

1420
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:25,460
and maybe there'll be a song.

1421
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,660
I'm going to try to talk them into it.

1422
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,300
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

1423
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,100
Just listen through.

1424
00:58:28,100 --> 00:58:30,420
We love you and thank you for listening to us.

1425
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,820
I don't know if we're going to do another episode in 2014.

1426
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,500
If we do, it's a surprise.

1427
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:35,300
If not, we'll see you in 2014.

1428
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:38,180
I don't want it to be like the end of Thor 2,

1429
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:39,540
when people stuck around for the end of Thor 2,

1430
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,460
like can't wait to see what secret Marvel secrets.

1431
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:44,020
And it's like, I'm Benicio del Toro in a spaceship

1432
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,940
and you have no idea what I'm talking about.

1433
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,820
Spoiler.

1434
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,100
Thanks for hanging around.

1435
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,380
Thanks.

1436
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,660
Thank you for hanging around.

1437
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,020
We got one final question.

1438
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,060
We will have Benicio del Toro singing the Christmas classics

1439
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:55,860
after the credits.

1440
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:56,900
If you want to stick around.

1441
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,900
Big props to the best boy, Key Grip.

1442
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,420
You definitely want to shout out him.

1443
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,540
You definitely want to see him.

1444
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,660
This final Yahoo was sent in by Ian Steed.

1445
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,700
Thank you, Ian.

1446
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,340
It's by Yahoo answers user Aman Abot.

1447
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,940
Oh, I get it.

1448
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:14,420
Who asks, if Pat, oh.

1449
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:18,740
Oh, if Batman parents are died, then how was he born?

1450
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,460
I'm Justin McRoy.

1451
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,660
I'm Travis McRoy.

1452
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:23,460
I'm Griffin McRoy.

1453
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,660
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1454
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,540
Kiss your dad.

1455
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,420
Square on the lips.

1456
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,380
Happy candle nights.

1457
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,780
Stay tuned for that song.

1458
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:30,260
Don't.

1459
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:47,700
It's not maximum fun.org.

1460
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,900
Comedy and culture artist owned listener supported.

1461
00:59:50,900 --> 01:00:01,140
I really can't stay.

1462
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,300
Baby, it's cold outside.

1463
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,140
I got to go away.

1464
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:07,380
Baby, it's cold outside.

1465
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,740
This evening has been.

1466
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,340
Been hoping that you'd come back.

1467
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,100
So very nice.

1468
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,460
I'll hold your hands there just like nice.

1469
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,700
My mother will start to worry.

1470
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,460
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1471
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,700
My father will be pacing the floor.

1472
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,540
Listen to the fireplace roar.

1473
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,700
Really, I better scurry.

1474
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,620
Beautiful, all these don't hurt.

1475
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,700
Maybe just to have a drink more.

1476
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,700
This is really terrible.

1477
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,220
The neighbors might think.

1478
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,220
Maybe it's cold out there.

1479
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,060
Say, what's in this drink?

1480
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:39,540
No caps to be had out there.

1481
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,220
I wish I knew how.

1482
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,500
Your eyes are like starlings.

1483
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,500
To break this spell.

1484
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,420
I'll take your hat.

1485
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:47,700
Your hair looks so.

1486
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,260
I ought to say no, no, no, sir.

1487
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,780
Mind if I move in closer?

1488
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,940
At least I'm going to say that I tried.

1489
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,780
What's the sense in hurting my pride?

1490
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,540
I really can't stay.

1491
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:58,980
Baby, it's cold outside.

1492
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:07,060
Cold, but it's cold outside.

1493
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:12,900
Baby, it's cold outside.

1494
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:15,460
Cold.

1495
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,260
Boo.

1496
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,100
Boo earns.
