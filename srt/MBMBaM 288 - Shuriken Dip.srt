1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:31,840
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:45,920
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother and my brother,

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,200
me and advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,360
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy. I'm that sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,160
Everybody's talking about him. I had an idea, and this is not a thing we normally do,

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,000
but I thought that with the big game coming up, we could offer a service to our listeners,

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,840
and that is we will provide for them some things to toss into maybe a conversation at a big game

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,440
watch party for people who have no idea what's going on and know nothing about football. So say

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,040
a loved one has tracked you along, or maybe a brother has insisted that you come to the party

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
and you're surrounded by football fans and you have no idea what to say. We'll give you

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,600
some sentences to sprinkle into the conversation. I tell you one good one, and this is a good catch

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,040
all. Just look at any player on the field and then say their name, and then say,

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,560
I just disagree with the way that he carries himself off the field.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,720
I like that. Because 80% of the time, you're probably on point.

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,360
Yes, or you're just echoing some controversy that probably doesn't exist. When they ask you

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,720
to clarify, just be like, I like it when players just do it for the love of the game.

20
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,040
Nice.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,080
Anytime anyone does anything, literally anything, just shake your head and say, too showy.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,480
Yeah.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,520
Too showy, I think. I liked it better when they just did it for the love of the game.

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,400
You can also just say, oh, that was clearly defensive pass interference.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Just literally every play, because it usually is most of the time.

26
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,960
Oh, if-

27
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,640
You can also just say DPI.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,640
If Cam fumbles, you can say more like Old Town.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
Now, who is that?

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,960
Cam Newton.

31
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,680
What is his-

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,480
He is the quarterback for the Carolina Panthers.

33
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
You could say more like Old Town, and then high five a bunch of people.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,600
Now that he's actually pretty young, and Peyton Manning is the old one.

35
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,640
Yeah, so that one's probably not going to get you many points with your friends.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,600
Let me suggest one. When you first show up and everyone's making chit chat before the game while

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,440
they're eating the canapes, you-

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,240
The what now?

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,400
The canapes that are served pre-game.

40
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,120
Why are we making pre-game chit chat?

41
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,040
I don't know what fucking words you're saying.

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
Canapes, they're-

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,400
I can't-

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,920
Tiny party food, come on.

45
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,960
Thank you, Travis. When you're eating canapes in the pre-game ritual, loudly announced to anybody

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,720
that'll listen, every year, I only watch for the commercials.

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,040
And then the first time someone gets a touchdown, say, that's a commercial.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,760
Nice.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,640
That's a good-

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,440
I like that.

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,800
Where in this whole time, you thought touchdowns were called commercials.

52
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,680
Yeah, that's fun.

53
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,040
What if you created a fiction where you had like super-

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,640
Your whole financial life was riding on how many field goals were kicked in the entire game?

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,120
Okay, more field goals. Let's have them.

56
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
As soon as the first field goal-

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:43,680
The breaks.

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,880
The breaks. Upon the completion of the first field goal, just barf right there.

60
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
And people are like, what's wrong with you?

61
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,400
And you say, I had 15K, there wouldn't be any field goals the whole game.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
No, no, no.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,640
I never bet. I've never bet. This is my first bet in my whole life.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
I'll never see my kids after this.

65
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
And make it up to me and say, I bet there'll be some field goals.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
And you said, bullshit, 15,000 on the table.

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,320
I need to go sell my kidney.

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,960
I bet it's going to be zero, zero at the end of it for a Super Bowl tie.

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,200
I put 45,000 on zero, zero.

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,560
Can you just have a quiver of things that you can shout whenever everybody else shouts?

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
Because that's the real secret.

72
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,440
You don't have to like lead the charge in talking about how good the sporting has been so far.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,280
But you do need to participate when other people get super psyched

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,480
whenever like a good pass or run is done to completion.

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,480
And so just like, whenever you see everybody like stand up or be like,

76
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,760
oh, just be like, slam a jam a ding dong.

77
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,280
Pass the hummus.

78
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
Well, no.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,560
Well, that's great because it works on both levels.

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
You get to participate in the yelling and also you get some of that hummus.

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
Yeah, pass that fucking hummus, Cam.

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
And then you also get dip out of that.

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,360
You also get the hummus.

84
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Yeah, but you could do what I do every Super Bowl, which is leave the room,

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
re-enter every 15 minutes and say, how you boys doing on snacks?

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
And then leave the room again.

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,960
Can I freshen up anyone's drink?

88
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
Can I freshen up anybody's drinks?

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,000
How you boys doing on snacks?

90
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
Funyuns running a little low.

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Let me top those off.

92
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,880
All right, boys, have fun.

93
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,240
Those are your fucking snacks?

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,200
What?

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,880
Those are your snacks?

96
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,240
That doesn't seem like a very-

97
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
Those are my canapes.

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:24,960
I still don't understand what that word means.

99
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,200
He does Funyuns with like a fried egg on top.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,720
No, okay, I'll be honest.

101
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,520
My go-to for that sort of vignette would have normally been pizza rolls,

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
but they didn't pay to be on here.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,120
So I'm gonna keep the name out of my mouth.

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
You gotta pay the canapé.

105
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,920
Gotta pay the canapé.

106
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Sorry, T blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, apostrophe, S.

107
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,400
I think I put too many blanks in there.

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
I think it was Totino, no, no, no.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,640
I think it was not enough.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
What is the halftime show?

111
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I think it is Rihanna.

112
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,760
No, it's, wait, is it Rihanna or is it-

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
Is Rihanna with the Moody Blues?

114
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,180
No.

115
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,160
All right, is it not?

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,600
Is it Coldplay?

117
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,040
I think it's Rihanna and Coldplay,

118
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
and that guy that did Don't Believe Me, Just Watch.

119
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,920
And then I think on top of that-

120
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,640
Bruno Mars?

121
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,560
The Red Hot Chili Peppers are gonna come down

122
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
and just gently lower their balls onto the halftime show

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
just to ruin it a little bit.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,800
Wow, it is a big one.

125
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
It is Coldplay and Beyonce and Bruno Mars.

126
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,800
You're right.

127
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,080
Oh wow, really?

128
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,320
Yeah.

129
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,000
Bruno Mars like just did it.

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,240
Yeah.

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,400
He like power lined it up all over the place.

132
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,960
We're reflecting on all the classic moments of Super Bowl halftime shows in the past.

133
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,080
I really get Prince.

134
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,800
Prince is the best halftime show that's ever been.

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,520
I think you could-

136
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,160
Do you remember when he had a guitar boner?

137
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
Oh god, it was the best.

138
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,680
Which time?

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
You can't just say that about Prince.

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,720
Do you remember when he had a guitar boner?

141
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Are you talking about in like-

142
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,800
His guitar was a penis in 1985.

143
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
I guess it's probably better to say,

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,840
do you remember when he didn't have a guitar boner?

145
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Can we start with a decade in which that happened?

146
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
Here's the thing.

147
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,640
Go in and be absolutely 100% ignorant of sport and all rules of sport.

148
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,880
And then as soon as Coldplay takes the stage,

149
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,200
just start hammering Coldplay trivia and all the Coldplay-

150
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Just like the performance lights come up,

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
you turn to the person next to you and say,

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
hey, you know Chris Martin's father is an accountant.

153
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
And just wait, just wait, pace it every 15 minutes.

154
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,200
Just try it out like 15 seconds.

155
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Like, hey, did you know their first song is called Ode to Deodorant?

156
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,080
And it was written as a joke.

157
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
Hey, can you guys name anybody else in Coldplay other than Chris Martin?

158
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
Steve Coldplay.

159
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
I don't think he's one of them.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,120
He formed it like in Van Halen.

161
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
There's Doug Hotwork, which is weird.

162
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,800
I work hot so I can play cold.

163
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
You know, Chris Martin, while he was writing Yellow,

164
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
noticed the phone book, the Yellow Pages,

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
and decided that the word yellow fit nicely in his song.

166
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,840
That's why it's there.

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,240
Where are you going?

168
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,080
Please, there's still so much more.

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,200
Please sit back down.

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Please sit back down.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,960
I have so many more facts.

172
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,920
I thought Doug Hotwork was the creative lead behind Yellow.

173
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,560
Can we create a three person,

174
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
just Coldplay slam band called Hotwork?

175
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,080
And just like all of our songs are just like,

176
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
get it together Coldplay.

177
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,960
It's all songs about Coldplay?

178
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,040
Yeah, and how bad they stink.

179
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,600
Cause we're Hotwork, the evil Coldplay.

180
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,560
Oh, I see.

181
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,560
We're the Riverbottom Nightmare band.

182
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,960
Yeah, and we'll just like show up to all their shows

183
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,040
and play smaller concerts in the crowd.

184
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,040
And try and just distract.

185
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
Amp versus Amp Coldplay.

186
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Bring it on, Christopher Martin.

187
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,360
We're the misfits to their Joe the Holograms.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,240
That's a weird thing to call your cartoon band.

189
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,280
Cause that's a thing.

190
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,880
Cause that was like a real ass band.

191
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,760
For real, yeah.

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
So that's, let's talk about advice for people.

193
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,040
Yeah, oh, that seems pretty good.

194
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,400
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

195
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Stop.

196
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,760
Next question.

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,440
You don't deserve to have this.

198
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,840
You read, just read the fucking thing.

199
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm gonna mute my Skype call for a while.

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
My fear is that by like, that it's like,

201
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
we have influence and by putting these ideas

202
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
that are about to be in this email out into the world,

203
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
we may influence even a single person

204
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,440
to adopt this monstrous behavior.

205
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,640
Like, I'm not sure I want that in my conscience.

206
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,560
Unless we just tear this person a new person.

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,160
A new person.

208
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,760
We tear this person a new person.

209
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,800
Read the fucking question.

210
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,920
To become a different person.

211
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,400
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

212
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
My wife thinks I'm a total monster,

213
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,520
but for me, there's no,

214
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,280
I'm not making this person sound defensive enough.

215
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,160
Hold on, let me try again.

216
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,880
I like to sleep in my blue jeans.

217
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
My wife thinks I'm a total monster,

218
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,880
but there's no greater comfort than the feeling of denim

219
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,680
rubbing against my shit.

220
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,160
There's a billion, billion, billion greater comforts.

221
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,960
There's a million, millions of greater comforts.

222
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,680
There is a Sagan of greater comforts.

223
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,360
I work in a cube all day,

224
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
so it's not like my jeans are dirty.

225
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,640
Why does the geometric shape in which you do your biz

226
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,640
influence their smell and dirt level?

227
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
Sometimes I get a fresh pair from the closet to sleep in.

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,480
My sleep jeans.

229
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,920
Please vindicator vilify me,

230
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,480
and that's from stylish slumber in the south.

231
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,080
I have news for this person.

232
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,400
They have taken like cork,

233
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,800
and they dropped a brick on the gas pedal,

234
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
they ramped over the ravine,

235
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,680
they pressed the nitrous button,

236
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,400
and they ended up in fetish chasm.

237
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
Sorry, this is a fetish.

238
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
You do not have a comfort,

239
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
like comfort is not the issue

240
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
when talking about jeans and sleep.

241
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,480
You have a denim fetish, and that's cool, but own it.

242
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
But you gotta own it.

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,560
You gotta lean into it.

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
John Mellencamp had a denim fetish,

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,080
and he fucking turned it into a successful musical career.

246
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,480
He rebuilt America's economy with that denim fetish.

247
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,120
He did.

248
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
He was the Hamilton of denim.

249
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,440
Okay, question asker.

250
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,960
There are sleep pants.

251
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
I'm worried that maybe you didn't know,

252
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
and this is the first you're hearing about it.

253
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,320
There are really nice sleep pants from Beyond East.

254
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,280
You can go to Target and get like $10 sleep pants,

255
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,640
and I think maybe you've only ever slept in jeans,

256
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,600
and if you put on even like the shittiest pair of sleep pants,

257
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,040
and you get in bed, you're gonna be like,

258
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,000
oh my God, do other people know about this?

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
I just like, it's unthinkable.

260
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,080
I can't get my jeans off me fast enough

261
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,760
when the workday's done, and I work from home,

262
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
so that's an entirely arbitrary distinction.

263
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,440
Jeans just bend in such weird ways,

264
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,840
like at the knee and everywhere.

265
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,280
Like they just don't, they're not a comfort pant.

266
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,240
They're not, they're like the Chevy,

267
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
old-timey Chevy truck of pant.

268
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
It's not like a sleek like,

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,680
look at me fly around these curves.

270
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,640
It's like, I gotta get a load of lumber to the mill.

271
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,840
That's what jeans are.

272
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,760
Denim was invented so that like cows,

273
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
when they bit you, it didn't hurt very bad, or like-

274
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah, that used to be the tagline underneath like Levi's,

275
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
so it doesn't hurt so bad when cows bite you.

276
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,320
Or like if you and Stevie are having a pitchfork fight,

277
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,960
you got basically a little bit of armor down there.

278
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
I put jeans on, like even on the weekends,

279
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
like when we have to do this show,

280
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
I put jeans on before we start,

281
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,120
and I take them off immediately afterwards,

282
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,120
but I need them to feel like I'm at work.

283
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,080
Like I need them to feel like I'm not relaxing,

284
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,920
and I need jeans to keep me awake.

285
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,360
I'm like the polar opposite of your jean situation.

286
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,400
Unless-

287
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,920
No, there's no, not, no, I'm drawing a fucking line.

288
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,480
There's no unless, no sleep jeans.

289
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,320
He said unless, I have to say it.

290
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,040
Say it.

291
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,600
Unless.

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,040
This guy is a wizard of denim.

293
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,320
No, stop it, that's nothing.

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
No, hear me out, hear me out.

295
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,440
What if he's found a care regimen for his denim

296
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
that if he just revealed it to the world,

297
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,520
would change the jean game forever?

298
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,320
And he's like, oh, do you guys not like soak them

299
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,280
in lard first and then put them in microwave for 30 seconds?

300
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,240
And it's like, what?

301
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,200
And when you do that, it makes them feel like satin.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,560
Then just wear satin.

303
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,720
Guess what, pimp jeans wizard?

304
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,640
I can, I'm one step ahead of the game,

305
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
and I save lard money.

306
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
I just buy satin.

307
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,280
You gotta save that lard money.

308
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,480
It's expensive.

309
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,560
2016, you gotta send kids to college.

310
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
This makes me so angry.

311
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
This makes me so angry.

312
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,960
Maybe if you got like, if your pre-bedtime regimen

313
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
was just like you did like 20 whippets,

314
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,080
and it was just like you fell into bed

315
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
and forgot to take your pants off every night.

316
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,480
That sucks, but I'm willing to give that person more, more-

317
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
I would be less irritated by somebody who said,

318
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,120
listen, every night before I need to go to sleep,

319
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,400
I have to do 20 whippets.

320
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,480
And then I just crash into bed

321
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,560
and just like whatever I'm wearing, that's my sleep stuff.

322
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,480
You purposefully, you have jeans specifically for this thing.

323
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,880
There's criminal intent.

324
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,440
Can I tell you one thing that would be really,

325
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,280
really nice though is travel.

326
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,240
For travel, you wouldn't need to pack,

327
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,280
you know, your sleepy time shorts for that.

328
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,520
Hotel lounge, when you get a hotel lounge.

329
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,040
Now, okay, okay, here's a question.

330
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,240
When you got, when the workday is done for y'all

331
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
and it's time to like unwind,

332
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
maybe make a blue apron and sit down,

333
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,960
watch some television.

334
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,880
Drink some Club W.

335
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
Yeah, whatever, whatever one of your-

336
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,640
Eat some Nature Box.

337
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,720
Do your fucking job applications with Ziprecruiter.

338
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
Put three dildos up your butt

339
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,520
like you're a toothbrush cup on a sink.

340
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,760
That you bought from Extreme Strengths.

341
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Actually, no, you actually bought them from Squarespace.

342
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
Weird twist.

343
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,360
Do you guys like get out of jeans

344
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
and get into like something more comfortable?

345
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,360
Like you get some sweatpants going or something?

346
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,160
Justin, I might as well have a Wallace and Gromit machine

347
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,920
that does it for me.

348
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,680
Okay, so this is my question.

349
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,000
Does this person who sleeps in jeans,

350
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,680
do you think that they're spending

351
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,640
the entirety of their evening in jeans?

352
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,360
Or like, does that not spell comfort to them?

353
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,000
Like how do they even want-

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
Do you mean like maybe they work in sleep pants?

355
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
I can't wait to get these off.

356
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,120
Yeah, exactly.

357
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,400
24, 7, 365, it's opposite day.

358
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,480
Let's get silly.

359
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
You can't wear sweatpants to the office.

360
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,520
You cannot do it.

361
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,040
You fucking low-rate Alice in Wonderland character.

362
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,360
Like you gotta get the right pants for the right time of day.

363
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,440
I'm the silly pants boy.

364
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,880
Stop, you're not.

365
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,080
You have a fetish.

366
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,400
That's fine, just don't air it out here.

367
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,640
Or do, like this is a good venue for airing out your fetish.

368
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,800
But just say like, I've got a denim fetish.

369
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
Don't tell me that it's a sleep thing.

370
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,920
But don't say it now.

371
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,800
You're on the clock at Barnes and Noble.

372
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,960
You can't just go around saying that,

373
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
parading it around in front of all of us.

374
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,480
Cause we're jealous.

375
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:03,920
We are jealous.

376
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,000
Cause we all wish we had something that made us feel

377
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,160
as alive as your jeans make you feel.

378
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,640
Do you guys want a Yahoo?

379
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,120
Please.

380
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,680
Got a bunch of real good ones.

381
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Thank you everybody.

382
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,760
This was sent in by game recognized game Rachel Rosen.

383
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
Thank you, Rachel.

384
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,760
It's by Yahoo Answers user.

385
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,800
Oops, they're anonymous.

386
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,960
Oops, all berries.

387
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,080
Uh, it was asked by Captain, uh, Captain Munch.

388
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,720
Captain C.

389
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,760
CC asks, am I too powerful?

390
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,840
My mum, me mum, just recently signed me up

391
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
for Krav Maga lessons.

392
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,840
My instructor says I'm in,

393
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
my instructor says I'm accelerating

394
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,680
at an unimaginable rate.

395
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,880
What I'm trying to say is what if I become a human weapon

396
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
and I'm not allowed out in public?

397
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,560
Oh God, I get that, man.

398
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,320
This is that con air fear.

399
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,120
Like you, you accidentally kill a guy in a bar fight

400
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,360
and the judge is like, well, we all know

401
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,280
that he's a Krav Maga weapon

402
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,680
and his hands are deadly weapons

403
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
and he shouldn't be allowed in public anymore.

404
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,520
And we got to lock him away in a prison

405
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,880
filled with the worst scum

406
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,320
and then fly him across the country.

407
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,120
But then the plane crashes in the desert, I think.

408
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,560
And Steve Buscemi is there

409
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,000
and he has tea with the little girl.

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
I don't want to give away the ending,

411
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
but you should check out Con Air.

412
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
But the plane crashes.

413
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,480
Yeah, and they all die.

414
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,360
It's pretty sick.

415
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,160
I think every Krav Maga instructor,

416
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
which is the deadliest martial art, right?

417
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
Have we officially said actually,

418
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,480
I feel like maybe at some point

419
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,360
during the history of the show,

420
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,200
we've said what the most deadly martial art is.

421
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
It's the one that Don't Mess With The Zohan uses.

422
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,680
So that's enough for me, thank you.

423
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,520
Good, exactly.

424
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
Every Krav Maga instructor

425
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
has to have a contingency plan

426
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,200
for this exact scenario

427
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,960
where they have some sort of biotoxin

428
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,080
in a syringe underneath the cash register

429
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,160
that they use to take payments for the lessons.

430
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,800
And then like, oh yeah, you're doing really good.

431
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,480
You're just about to earn your green belt.

432
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,320
You can just come over here.

433
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,120
It's time to cash out.

434
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,280
Stab him in the neck with the biotoxin.

435
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
I'm so sorry, you're too dangerous.

436
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,200
You try to stab him with the biotoxin

437
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
and they stop your hand and like,

438
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,520
damn it, I waited too long.

439
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,880
Yeah, he's already ascended.

440
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,800
How was I supposed to know

441
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,640
that they only needed 35 seconds

442
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,080
to become a Krav Maga master?

443
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,200
This is unimaginable.

444
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,320
Unimaginable.

445
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,520
It's unimaginable.

446
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
It's unimaginable.

447
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,200
In my days as a Krav Maga instructor,

448
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,960
I've seen a lot of students come through here

449
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,320
and I've watched them progress.

450
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,240
And in my wildest fantasy,

451
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,400
sometimes I dream of a student

452
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,160
who is progressing at an even faster rate.

453
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,480
And then I saw you,

454
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,920
and I've tested the bounds of my imagination

455
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,960
to conceive of how you could be progressing at this rate.

456
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,040
And I cannot conceive of it.

457
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,720
Here are the keys to my dojo.

458
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,800
I have to step down and go in a cave

459
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
and think about this for a while.

460
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,360
Just as a fun thought experiment.

461
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
How fast can someone get good at kicking?

462
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,560
Enough that somebody has their mind blown by it.

463
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,880
Exactly this fast and no faster, most certainly.

464
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,080
Oh God.

465
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,040
No, no, no.

466
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,720
Oh God, Zachary.

467
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,680
Oh my goodness.

468
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,120
I have to check the scrolls.

469
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,480
Yeah, just kick this.

470
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,920
This is a first test that we do here

471
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
at Tim McGraw's Krav Maga.

472
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,680
And the thing we do is we just like,

473
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,440
I hold this up and you just kick it

474
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,000
and I see how...

475
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,000
How could this be?

476
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,520
How could this be?

477
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,200
My concept of reality is dissolving around me.

478
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,040
Everyone get out.

479
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,600
I have to go pray to the patron spirit

480
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,400
of Tim McGraw's Krav Maga and find out.

481
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,440
You got Tim.

482
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,800
Tim, you'll never believe.

483
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,440
Tim, it's me.

484
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,400
Try to imagine how good someone could progress.

485
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,280
You can't.

486
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,640
Tim, you can't.

487
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,680
It's Tim McGraw.

488
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,760
Listen, I told you you could use my name,

489
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,120
but I was also real clear.

490
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,200
I don't know anything about Krav Maga.

491
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
So I'm gonna have to trust your judgment on this.

492
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,920
Just tell me what to do, Tim, please.

493
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,040
Listen, I've informed you repeatedly.

494
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm not even familiar with Krav Maga as any fighting style.

495
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,360
That kid's so good, Tim.

496
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,680
Just give me some guidance.

497
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,280
Trust me with your wisdom.

498
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,080
My only fighting technique is smashing a beer bottle

499
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,200
and cutting a fool.

500
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,240
I'll try it.

501
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay, click.

502
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,400
I gotta be honest, when you told me

503
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,760
you were opening a Krav Maga place,

504
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,840
I thought it was a Mediterranean restaurant.

505
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Which I would love.

506
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,760
That's on me, I guess.

507
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,640
I love that shit.

508
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,000
You got naan, tzatziki?

509
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm all about it.

510
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
Listen, I sent you a picture of myself

511
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,640
dipping some pita into hummus to use for the logo,

512
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,360
and you did not send that photo back to me.

513
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
So I thought that was for me to keep, Tim.

514
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm so sorry.

515
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
You used it for like the logo of your dojo,

516
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
your dojo logo.

517
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
Which I thought was weird,

518
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,160
because who's gonna sign that?

519
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,480
Like, well, there's country music superstar Tim McGraw

520
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,360
enjoying some Mediterranean bean dips.

521
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,960
But on your logo, you have photoshopped out the pita bread

522
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,480
and changed it to a shuriken,

523
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
which seems weird to me

524
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,840
since I don't even think that's a Krav Maga place.

525
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Yeah, I just said-

526
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
I heard that you were still dipping it in hummus.

527
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
Is that not good enough?

528
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,360
I did a cursory Google search,

529
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,560
and almost certainly they do not use shurikens in Krav Maga,

530
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,400
and they definitely do not dip them in hummus

531
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,240
before throwing them sunbeaches.

532
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,360
And listen, it seems like you photoshopped the hummus out

533
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,120
and put in the brains of my enemy.

534
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:41,840
How do I know?

535
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,960
Because you've put a speech bubble above my head that said,

536
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,520
this is the brains of my enemy, not hummus.

537
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,960
Hey Tim, I gotta go.

538
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,760
I've got this person kicking real good in the dojo.

539
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm gonna need to see your Bonifides, my man,

540
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,360
because I do not think that you are excellent at photoshop

541
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,600
and I think bad at Krav Maga, I have to imagine.

542
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,320
Oh man.

543
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,480
How about another question?

544
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
My cube mate whispers to herself constantly.

545
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,160
Sometimes she's reading out loud to herself.

546
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,680
Sometimes she's talking to herself.

547
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,520
Sometimes I can't even tell what she's saying,

548
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
but I hear the whispers.

549
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh my God.

550
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,440
This is hella distracting.

551
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Why there hasn't been a cube mate there in over 40 years.

552
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,000
This is hella distracting because I'm pretty down with ASMR

553
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,880
and I can't get any work done.

554
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,600
Oh shit.

555
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,880
Oh fuck, this took a turn.

556
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,000
This took a twist.

557
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,160
Any ideas on how to address this?

558
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,920
That's from, huh, in Houston.

559
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,000
See I thought we were going with like,

560
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,280
it's annoying because what always kills,

561
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,040
I tell you why people like that drive me crazy

562
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,560
and it's not an ASMR thing.

563
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't stand when you're the only person

564
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,640
in a room with someone else who starts talking

565
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,560
and of course you're like, what, are you, sorry?

566
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,280
Are you talking to me?

567
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay, it's like, no, I'm just reading

568
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,560
a really funny Ziggy cartoon.

569
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,920
Sorry, I'll try to keep it down.

570
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,840
But how many times does that have to happen

571
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,280
before the person is like, I need to stop talking to myself

572
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
because like 30 times a day,

573
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
Debra's leaning around going, excuse me, what?

574
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Did you, what did you say?

575
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,760
Eventually you would think that the cube mate would be like,

576
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
I need to shut it.

577
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
Trev, I don't know if you've worked in a lot of offices,

578
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,760
but there are always people who like, no, they don't.

579
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,280
Like they don't have any,

580
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,480
like you think that they would get better at this,

581
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,120
this scenario that everyone is in

582
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,920
and they don't, like they belligerently don't

583
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,680
ever grow as people.

584
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,000
What if you just quietly start whispering back?

585
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,960
If they're like, I gotta staple this

586
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,000
and you're like, yeah, you do.

587
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,280
Where do you see my wiener?

588
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:47,760
Your what?

589
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,440
My wiener, yeah.

590
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah, it's me, it's me, the ding dong buddies.

591
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,560
I'm both of them, I am both of the ding dong buddies

592
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,240
and this is my new song,

593
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
Wait Till My Wiener Makes It's Debut.

594
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,000
I think that the ASMR thing actually gives you a leg up

595
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
because one surefire way to get this person to stop

596
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
is to explain what is happening to you.

597
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,000
I think that would get me to stop right quick.

598
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,400
Excuse me, when you whisper,

599
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,600
it gives me a denim boner,

600
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,720
a denim style tingling in the back of my head.

601
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
You know denim?

602
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,560
You know the feel of denim on sheets?

603
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,200
It's like that.

604
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
When are we gonna do an ASMR episode?

605
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,440
Oh fuck, we definitely should do an ASMR episode.

606
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,640
I feel like the ASMR episode is like there.

607
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,880
It's waiting for us to pluck some of it.

608
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Already somebody's done a super cut

609
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,800
of like our 288 episodes every time we whisper

610
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,560
and it's like four hours long.

611
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,880
Yeah, I just gave us a good like 20 seconds of material

612
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,400
right there with my ding dong buddies run.

613
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,080
That was somebody's trigger.

614
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,160
Yeah, that's going straight on the greatest hit CD.

615
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
Or the quietest, it would be the quietest hits.

616
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,960
This is the second question in a row

617
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
where somebody's mentioned working in a cube.

618
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,800
Is that what we're calling cubicles right now?

619
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,880
Because right now it just kind of sounds like you're floating around

620
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,560
in like some sort of geometry void

621
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,840
and that like a wizard trapped you in.

622
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,160
Right.

623
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
And I guess what I find-

624
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,840
Sometimes that's what it feels like.

625
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,040
Am I right Mondays?

626
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,520
Dilbert.

627
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,040
Dilbert from downtown.

628
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,480
Maybe you could like sound insulate your cubicle.

629
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,760
Maybe put some baffling up, maybe some fiberglass,

630
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,280
some Navajo rugs, just something

631
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
to try to deaden the sound a little bit

632
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
or like shove something in your ears.

633
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,040
You can put your mattress foam on their cubicle too

634
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,480
just to absorb some of the noise.

635
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,680
Don't mind me.

636
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
Oh, it's six foot by three foot.

637
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,080
Oh, I got a great piece for this.

638
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,480
Okay.

639
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,440
This is great.

640
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,240
Can you just play music on your computer

641
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,560
that drowns out the noise of the whispers

642
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,800
like just a bunch of trombones going?

643
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,280
No, you know what?

644
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,760
I just thought about it and literally any music will do.

645
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,640
It doesn't have to be trombones.

646
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,000
Yeah, it doesn't have to be.

647
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,960
It doesn't have to be trombones.

648
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,600
It came to my mind.

649
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,280
It was like, hey Griffin, think of something

650
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,560
to say on the podcast right now

651
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,000
that would be like loud music.

652
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,760
I was like, oh, I know trombones.

653
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,320
Not like any EDM or any rock music with guitars in it.

654
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,720
You could, I mean like any music.

655
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,040
Just like any music you turn it up loud enough.

656
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,320
Doesn't have to be trombones.

657
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
My point is it doesn't just have to be trombones.

658
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,320
A lot of people think it has to be trombones.

659
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Is trombones the opposite of ASMR?

660
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,680
Because if we do an ASMR episode,

661
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,440
we got to do a trombone episode.

662
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,920
I think it's like the palette cleanser of ASMR.

663
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,960
You're starting to get tingles.

664
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,120
And you're like, oh, thank God.

665
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,160
I was so close.

666
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,800
Thank you for ASMR edging me.

667
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,960
I got to say, gross.

668
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,760
I also got to say that movie Trumbo

669
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,040
that got nominated for Oscar

670
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,800
that I've literally never heard of before.

671
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,080
Is that about trombones?

672
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,040
Yeah, but it's like the slang.

673
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,120
It's a street slang term for it.

674
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,920
Sling me that Trumbo, said Dizzy Gillespie.

675
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, what's funny is it's also a slang term.

676
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,360
His body tries handing a new instrument.

677
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,520
It's also a slang term for like the groupies

678
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,840
that follow trombonists around.

679
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,280
Like, oh, they're a real Trumbo.

680
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,080
You know what I mean?

681
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,320
Okay.

682
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
But it can get confusing when you say pass me that Trumbo

683
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,680
and you're like, wait, do you mean the instrument

684
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,560
or the groupie?

685
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,280
And by that point, you've used more words and letters

686
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,080
than you would have by just saying the full word

687
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
like Trumbo, groupie or Trumbo.

688
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
Just Trumbo, yeah.

689
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,120
I got to see Trumbo.

690
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,920
It sounds hilarious.

691
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,760
It's pretty great.

692
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,520
And you should also check out Trumbo Drop.

693
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,560
You mean Operation Trumbo Drop?

694
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,240
Yeah.

695
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,640
Oh, with a setup and an alley-oop.

696
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Oh, that's another thing you can say during the football game.

697
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,520
Yeah.

698
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,960
Give it to me again, Travis.

699
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,760
And Griffin will just edit it in to like,

700
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
pretend that you just come up with it

701
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,640
and you're just saying it.

702
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,360
Just like full title Operation Trumbo Drop.

703
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,200
Yeah, but like isolate it.

704
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,920
Okay, let me see it.

705
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,680
Oh, like Operation Trumbo Drop with a steal,

706
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,920
with a fucking swooped in.

707
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,200
You just got dunked on.

708
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,600
Dunkarooskies.

709
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
That's another thing you can say during the football game.

710
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,120
Let's go to the money zone.

711
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,240
We're there.

712
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,640
Look around you.

713
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,360
Look around you.

714
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,440
You've been in the money zone the whole time.

715
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,280
The whole show's the money zone.

716
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,640
The money zone is us.

717
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,680
I want to talk about Nature Box.

718
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,720
Can I talk about Nature Box?

719
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,880
Yes, please do.

720
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,080
I love snacking,

721
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,640
and I'm worried that I have a snack obsession

722
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,800
because I just snack every day.

723
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,000
And I can't go to sleep without eating snacks in my mouth,

724
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,040
which is dangerous.

725
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Fortunately, there's a snack provider out there

726
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,920
that can change your life,

727
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,520
and it's called Nature Box.

728
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,680
Nature Box has over 100 tasty options

729
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,640
for you to choose from.

730
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
Snack options like sriracha roasted cashews

731
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,560
and french toast granola.

732
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
You can fill out your snack profile,

733
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,680
get personalized recommendations

734
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,880
based on your preferences,

735
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,320
and get matched up to go on dates

736
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,800
with people who like the same snacks that you like.

737
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,760
Well, not yet.

738
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,960
I also like granola.

739
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,520
Let's kiss.

740
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,600
Let's have a granola kiss.

741
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,480
What's that?

742
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,080
Well, we both put granola in our mouths,

743
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
and then what happens next is up to us.

744
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,920
There's a new...

745
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
I got a new Nature Box.

746
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,600
I'm like, you can set up your own Nature Box snacks

747
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,080
to get the specific things that you want.

748
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,720
I like to just go crazy.

749
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Whatever you guys want to toss at me,

750
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
I'm sure I'll get into it.

751
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,000
There's a new one called crispy coconut squares

752
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,760
that I tried this time.

753
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,800
Oh my gosh.

754
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,400
They're like a crunchy...

755
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,440
God, they're impossible to describe,

756
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,040
but they're absolutely delicious,

757
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,280
and I cannot recommend them enough.

758
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,400
There's so many really, really good snacks

759
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,760
that they do.

760
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,880
I got one peanut...

761
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,280
Who was talking about peanut butter graham jams?

762
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,000
That was me.

763
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,280
Oh man, those are good traps.

764
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,040
You were right about those.

765
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,320
And you can check out all of this

766
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
and get your first box at naturebox.com.

767
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,640
Just head to Nature Box, right?

768
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,520
Stick the landing here,

769
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,600
because this is the best line in marketing ever.

770
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
Head to naturebox.com right now

771
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,480
to unbox a world of taste and possibility.

772
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
I like to imagine there should be a door.

773
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,640
You go to naturebox.com

774
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,960
and there's a little gif of a door,

775
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,560
and when you click on it,

776
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,560
like there's just like you see the universe.

777
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,960
Everything is edible as long as it's in a nature box.

778
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,360
Yeah, and like there's a million, million butterflies.

779
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,520
I want to tell you guys about Bowling Branch.

780
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,080
Can I do that?

781
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,080
Oh, please do.

782
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,760
Actually, Justin, you tell me about Bowling Branch

783
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,360
because you're sleeping on these shits.

784
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,560
Oh, I'm constantly, constantly sleeping on these sheets

785
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,280
when I'm asleep.

786
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,200
How do they interact with denim?

787
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,640
They are perfect match for denim,

788
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,880
provided you take the denim off before you get into bed.

789
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,840
Nothing reminds you of how bad denim feels

790
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,880
like the soft comfort of Bowling Branch sheets.

791
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,280
Bowling Branch, that's B-O-L-L and Branch.com

792
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,480
make great sheets.

793
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,920
If you've ever slept on like a bed,

794
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,520
I use the hotel comparison a lot

795
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,720
when I'm talking about Bowling Branch.

796
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,400
Like you sleep on sheets sometimes in a hotel

797
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,400
and you're like, where are they buying these?

798
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,000
And not like a shitty hotel.

799
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
Not like a hotel that was only $43.

800
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,680
This is like that, you know what?

801
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,040
We're going to splurge $175 a night kind of hotel.

802
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,400
Yeah, like a nice place.

803
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,760
And you think, where do you guys get these sheets?

804
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,840
Because I've bought a lot of sheets

805
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
trying to find something that matched the quality of these

806
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,320
that give me that hotel luxury experience.

807
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,400
I haven't found them until I started sleeping on Bowling Branch.

808
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,240
They come in this beautiful decorative box.

809
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,400
You feel like a real fancy prince

810
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,520
and when you're unwrapping them

811
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,560
and then you feel less fancy

812
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,240
when you got to put your own sheets on your own bed.

813
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,840
I bet princes never have to do that.

814
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,120
But then when you get into bed,

815
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,560
you feel like a prince again.

816
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,840
So you like feel like a prince.

817
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,520
And then you have a good tar boner

818
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,720
and you feel like prince.

819
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,800
Yeah, it's a real prince of the pauper scenario.

820
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,640
Here's the best thing.

821
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,160
Maybe you're a little bit hesitant

822
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,680
because you're like, I don't know, buy them online.

823
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,840
I don't get to like, you know, check them out first.

824
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,880
Well, good news.

825
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,680
They're going to let you try them risk-free for 30 nights.

826
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,760
And you're going to love it though, trust me.

827
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,280
I've been sleeping on them as well.

828
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,160
They are amazing

829
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,880
and they seem to just get more and more comfortable over time

830
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
because they use like super high quality cotton.

831
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,120
And it's really, it's really princely.

832
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,000
As a special my bim bam bonus,

833
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,880

Our own individual unique sleep musks.

836
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,640
Do not mix them together.

837
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,280
Do not to mix them together.

838
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
You can get right now 20% off your first order

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,840
That's bowlandbranch, B-O-L-L and branch.com.

841
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,520
Boy, they must've been so embarrassed

842
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,160
when they realized they didn't spell it B-O-W-L.

843
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,640
B-O-L-L and branch.com, promo code, MYBROTHER.

844
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,680
Don't punish them because they don't know how to spell bowl.

845
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,960
Go buy their sheets.

846
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,800
All right, we got a Jumbotron message.

847
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,240
This is for Andrew.

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,440
It's from Matt.

849
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,360
Let's see it right to it.

850
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,440
Happy birthday, little bro.

851
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
And happy future birthdays

852
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,360
because this present is worth a few birthdays.

853
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,080
Nice. I agree.

854
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,840
Hopefully this got in on time.

855
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,400
What with your birthday being November 20th and all.

856
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,080
Yeah, you got it, split the uprights.

857
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,200
Slamma jamma ding dong.

858
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,840
Pass the hummus.

859
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Between his birthday and some other day.

860
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,280
Pass the fucking hummus, Andrew.

861
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:35,920
You crushed it.

862
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,120
Anyway, thanks for introducing me to NB and BAM

863
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,880
and making my life that much funnier.

864
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,320
I agree with this being worth a few birthdays

865
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,040
because here's the thing,

866
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,680
you can listen to this episode of this podcast any time.

867
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,200
It's a great thing about podcasts, they're eternal.

868
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,000
The weird thing is it's not consecutive birthdays.

869
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,920
This is gonna be good for his 24th, his 28th and his 33rd.

870
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah, but you know what birthday it won't be good for?

871
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,600
The intended birthday,

872
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,520
because that was fucking four months ago.

873
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,440
Oh, well, po buddy's nerfect.

874
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,520
This message is for Jesse and it's from Also Jesse.

875
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,920
And Jesse says to themselves,

876
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,440
hey man, I am communicating to you across the void

877
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
through telepathy, kind of.

878
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,400
If I did my math correctly,

879
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,480
the brothers should be reading this on your birthday.

880
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,680
Almost certainly not.

881
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,400
Happy 31st from three to four months ago.

882
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,480
I truly hope you are keeping it tight

883
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,560
and if you need me, I'm on my mobile.

884
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,160
So good, so, so good.

885
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,240
Do you think this is from Jesse to Jesse themselves?

886
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,320
Or do you think that it's just like

887
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,640
there happened to be two Jesses in the world?

888
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,600
I think there's definitely more than two Jesses in the world.

889
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,720
Well, I've never seen them in a room together.

890
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,640
Shit, that's right.

891
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,840
Wait a minute, Jesse is Jesse.

892
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,200
The perfect disguise.

893
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,360
But who's Jesse's girl?

894
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,640
Oh, stop it.

895
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,720
I wanted to mention something.

896
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,440
We alluded there to the best personal message

897
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,680
we've ever read on the show for Elliot from Matt Hall.

898
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,120
I went back and looked at it just now

899
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,480
because it'd been a while.

900
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,320
And there's something I've never noticed before.

901
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,560
The and, the message is of course,

902
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,880
thanks for vibing it and keeping it tight.

903
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,720
If you need me, I'm on my mobile.

904
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,120
First off, I don't think we said vibing it.

905
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,440
I think we just said vibing, right?

906
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,160
And the and is all caps.

907
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,320
So the message is actually like

908
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,640
the main thing that they wanna communicate

909
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,680
is that they've somehow managed to both vibe it

910
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,720
and keep it tight.

911
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
That's really the impressive thing.

912
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,000
How could they, it's unimaginable

913
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,040
that they were able to both vibe it and keep it tight.

914
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,080
Yeah, cause vibing it, the very act of vibing it

915
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
usually just loosens that thing up.

916
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,200
Kept it very, very tight.

917
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,000
And that's impressive.

918
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,200
Very tight.

919
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:57,920
Let's be honest.

920
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,280
We live in a world with too much media.

921
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
You need a podcast on the front lines

922
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,800
figuring out what's great.

923
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,760
We're here for you.

924
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,720
We're Pop Rocket.

925
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,840
I am Guy Branham.

926
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,040
I'm a comedian.

927
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm Wynton Mitchell.

928
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,840
I call myself a digital strategist.

929
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,720
I'm Oliver Wang, academic and disc junkie.

930
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,960
Margaret Wappler, je suis as journalist.

931
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,280
And we watch, listen to, and read everything

932
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
so that you don't have to.

933
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,840
And then we tell you about all the things

934
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,200
that you'll love to love.

935
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,320
Find us in iTunes or wherever you download podcasts.

936
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,800
Pop Rocket, every Wednesday from MaximumFun.org.

937
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
You wanna have the Yahoo question?

938
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
Yeah, I'd love a Yahoo question, Griffin.

939
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
I got a bunch here.

940
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,560
Do the best one.

941
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,760
Well, fuck, that's tough to...

942
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,200
I know.

943
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
I got three Drew Davenports.

944
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,760
Can I, you want me to just...

945
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,200
You can trade those in for one mega port.

946
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm gonna fire these Drew Davenports at you guys.

947
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,800
Just rapid fire it and you tell me

948
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
which one you wanna really explore

949
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,600
because I honestly can't choose.

950
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
It's level 9000.

951
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,200
Yeah, Drew, Drew Davenport, of course.

952
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,760
Thank you, Drew.

953
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,120
This one is from Devin who asks,

954
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,760
if you put Mountain Dew in a purifier,

955
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,760
would you get water or Mountain Dew?

956
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,360
I think there's something to talk about there.

957
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,120
This one is from Sal who asks,

958
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
every time I go to lick a stamp,

959
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,440
I really want to gently kiss it instead.

960
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,080
Is this okay?

961
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,400
And then this one is from something's gone wrong.

962
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,920
Column Bernard asks, big hands?

963
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
When do I start getting big hands?

964
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,680
I'm 18 years old.

965
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,360
When do I start getting bigger hands?

966
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
I think it's going to be big hands.

967
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,960
Yeah, although I am curious

968
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,360
if you put Mountain Dew in a purifier,

969
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:44,000
you just get like that crisp Mountain Dew.

970
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
I think it just turns into vodka.

971
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,240
Why is this so crisp?

972
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,720
Is this pure Mountain Dew?

973
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
I think that's how Dewshine is made.

974
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,560
All right, let's close that.

975
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,040
Get out of here.

976
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,160
Close that one out.

977
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,440
Okay, so somebody watched the video forever long

978
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,960
and they're like, wait a minute,

979
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
the Foo Fighters managed to get big hands.

980
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,160
When do I get big hands?

981
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,000
Do I need to do some intricate steamrolling?

982
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,760
Because that usually happens in cartoons.

983
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,120
We've made a huge mistake.

984
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,880
Big hands aren't as funny as I thought they would be.

985
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,160
Get out of your big hands.

986
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,520
Every time I know the stamp,

987
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,440
I really want to gently kiss it instead.

988
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,080
Is this okay?

989
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,400
I think it just depends on what the stamp is.

990
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
Are we talking like American presidents?

991
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Are we talking like hippie symbols through the years?

992
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,280
Are we talking like, I don't know,

993
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,480
World War II pilots?

994
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,680
I'm never stopping.

995
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah, just keep naming things.

996
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,560
Maybe Woodstock performers.

997
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,480
Maybe Woodstock.

998
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,320
Maybe Woodstock.

999
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,440
It might be a Snoopy situation, a peanut situation.

1000
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,520
It could be famous circus elephants.

1001
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,240
It could be inventors of the 1820s.

1002
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,720
It could be the many faces of Elvis.

1003
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,560
I mean, there's lots of different stamps out there.

1004
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
The different finger bones that there are.

1005
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,720
How many finger bones are there?

1006
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
Look at these stamps to find out.

1007
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,480
You'll never believe how many finger bones

1008
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,480
there are. Number 23 blew me away.

1009
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,440
Fun stamp facts.

1010
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,520
Which is ironic because it's on stamps.

1011
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
There are stamps that have pictures of other stamps on them.

1012
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Those are very rare.

1013
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,080
If you find those, hold on to them for dear life,

1014
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,320
Charlie Bucket, and run home.

1015
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,200
Run home, Charlie.

1016
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,880
Don't show anyone your stamp stamps.

1017
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,720
There's Jeff Probst dick pic stamps that I made.

1018
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
They're not legal, Tinder.

1019
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,000
Not legal.

1020
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,880
No, please don't use those.

1021
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,800
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if stamps were edible?

1022
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
What if every time you got mail,

1023
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,160
after they did their job as postage,

1024
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,600
every time you got mail,

1025
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,560
you saw, oh man, I got like five candy treats

1026
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,360
just waiting for me.

1027
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:52,880
Like little dissolvable candy treats waiting for me.

1028
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,080
Stuck to the, because they're just going to go

1029
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,000
in the garbage otherwise.

1030
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,440
Like why couldn't they be edible?

1031
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,400
Like if you peel them off-

1032
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,760
Fuck that's good, Justin.

1033
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,480
Yeah.

1034
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,800
The only problem you do is you have to make one third

1035
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,680
of them edible, but you don't have any kind of sign

1036
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,440
as to which ones are and which ones aren't.

1037
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
You just have to try it.

1038
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,920
And then think of how exciting it is

1039
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,160
when you get one that is and you're like, no.

1040
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,400
Okay, one third edible.

1041
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,320
I don't think, let me say this.

1042
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,280
If one third of stamps are candy edibles,

1043
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,160
I do not think you're going to sit and eat a pile of stamps.

1044
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,800
If one third are edible.

1045
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,200
There is, however, a number between all stamps being edible

1046
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,960
and one third stamps being edible

1047
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,520
in which you would try to eat every stamp you got.

1048
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,280
Right?

1049
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,080
You're saying-

1050
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,520
I thought you were going to say the number.

1051
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,200
You're saying we don't know what that science

1052
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,560
has not found that number yet.

1053
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
I don't know if it was 50-50.

1054
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,160
I think I would probably find better ways of spending my time

1055
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,640
if 80% of stamps were candy edibles.

1056
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:48,880
Yeah.

1057
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,680
I might sit-

1058
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,320
You would stop.

1059
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,480
I get what Justin's saying.

1060
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,680
He would stop differentiating because he would assume,

1061
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
well, this here, this is male candy.

1062
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,600
But I think the problem with 80-20

1063
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,720
is now the 20 has become a disappointment

1064
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,120
rather than the 80 being a pleasant surprise.

1065
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,760
Yeah.

1066
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,160
Can I just-

1067
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,560
Now you're getting punished for getting one of the 20%.

1068
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
Let's put a pin in this because I've realized

1069
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,360
just sort of one problem with the candy stamps idea,

1070
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,960
and Justin, it's a great idea.

1071
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,360
Terrific idea.

1072
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:17,920
Thank you, Griffin.

1073
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,480
Thank you, Griffin.

1074
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,280
Easy to produce, too.

1075
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,160
Just cut out little pieces of fruit.

1076
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,360
Copyright, TM, TM.

1077
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,880
Cut out little pieces of fruit roll-ups

1078
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,640
and then there, Bob's your uncle.

1079
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,280
The only problem with this idea, Justin,

1080
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,800
is by the time that the letter gets to you,

1081
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,080
it has been touched by 200 of the dirtiest hands imaginable.

1082
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,200
200 of these hands, unimaginable how dirty they are.

1083
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,600
Maybe it's sealed in its own wrapper.

1084
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,200
Okay, perfect.

1085
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,200
I got a good idea then.

1086
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,800
50% of stamps are candy edibles, 50% are antibiotics.

1087
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,680
So you eat-

1088
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,080
Nice.

1089
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,480
So you eat the candy ones and you also eat the antibiotic ones.

1090
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,080
But you have to do it like a tequila shot.

1091
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,200
You eat the candy stamp and you immediately chase it

1092
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
by drinking antibiotics?

1093
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,400
Mm-hmm.

1094
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,360
But you don't-

1095
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,560
Out of someone's navel.

1096
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,880
You don't know which are which.

1097
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,960
So it's like, oh, I just ate five antibiotic stamps in a row.

1098
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,320
I'm really grossed out.

1099
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,040
But super healthy.

1100
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,240
I really hope I get some candy.

1101
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,240
Or all the stamps you get that day are candy.

1102
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,320
Like, well, somebody's getting a head cold.

1103
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,560
Okay.

1104
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,520
I like all of this.

1105
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,240
This is great.

1106
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,720
For me, it's less worried about the contagion of it

1107
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,920
and more like just knowing, oh my,

1108
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,360
so many dirty hands have touched this.

1109
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,240
I've passed this around.

1110
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,840
I'm not a fan.

1111
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,320
Maybe they just work around the like,

1112
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,800
just like it becomes a postal thing,

1113
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,920
like a superstition if you want to,

1114
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,080
if you want to just like a rule,

1115
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,680
like don't touch the stamp.

1116
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,880
Well, you wouldn't want to because you get those sticky hands.

1117
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,200
You don't want that.

1118
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,920
Oh, yeah.

1119
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,400
Well, they wouldn't touch it because you're self-fulfilling prophecy.

1120
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,240
They wouldn't touch the stamp because they don't want their hands-

1121
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,360
They don't want sticky hands.

1122
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,840
Yeah, shit.

1123
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,320
This is good.

1124
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,920
This is all good.

1125
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,480
Full proof.

1126
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,760
Now, here is the question.

1127
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,240
Oh, boy.

1128
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,760
If the person who is sending the stamp has to lick it,

1129
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,160
wouldn't it be better if they were kissing it?

1130
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,840
Because that would be-

1131
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,040
You kiss anybody.

1132
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,320
You kiss anybody and everybody.

1133
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,600
And so I think that would be better.

1134
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,120
Just gonna charge right through that statement.

1135
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,560
Just like bully it.

1136
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,320
Just bully it onto our podcast.

1137
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,600
I don't understand, Justin.

1138
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:23,920
Please repeat.

1139
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm saying, okay, if through space and time,

1140
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,480
this candy stamp is bringing you the physical greeting of affection

1141
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,240
from another person or maybe somebody who works at the IRS

1142
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,000
or somebody who has sent you a catalog,

1143
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,440
I think that you would prefer the thought that they kissed the stamp

1144
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,600
and sent it off to you and you're eating a kiss.

1145
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,080
Okay, then they lick the stamp and it's like

1146
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,080
they're licking the inside of your mouth.

1147
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,560
Okay.

1148
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,200
It's all, Justin, if I may, both are pretty bad.

1149
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,920
It's all bad.

1150
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,280
It's all very bad.

1151
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,840
It's bad all the way down.

1152
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:06,560
The reason, by the way, I want to just take this

1153
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,080
into a quick sidebar.

1154
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
The reason-

1155
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah, please get me the fuck out of this bar.

1156
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,760
I hate this regular bar we're in right now.

1157
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,000
The reason I got distracted is when I said

1158
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,600
you kiss everyone and everything.

1159
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,320
Yeah. I remembered a true life story

1160
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,440
that I wanted to share.

1161
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,680
I sold my home this week, my former home that I lived in,

1162
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,600
and I was the only one on the deed for some reason,

1163
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,040
not me and Sid, so it would just be-

1164
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,440
Weird.

1165
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,520
At the closing and I was very excited.

1166
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,160
Hi, Patrick.

1167
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,040
Patrick bought our house.

1168
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,880
Patrick, dear friend, Patrick Stanley.

1169
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,880
I hope you guys are enjoying the home, but anyway-

1170
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,080
Good luck finding where I took all my secret shits.

1171
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,040
Signed the paperwork.

1172
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,360
My realtor was there. Her name was Lori.

1173
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,200
My realtor was there.

1174
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,720
We had finished signing the paperwork,

1175
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:56,480
and she gave me sort of like one of those Christian side hugs

1176
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,880
to celebrate as we were leaving,

1177
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,400
because I guess she felt bad for me

1178
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,800
because I was there by myself during this momentous occasion.

1179
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,200
Yeah.

1180
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,120
As we were leaving, she gave me a side hug,

1181
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,400
and I turned towards her to turn it into a full hug,

1182
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,840
to do the full hug conversion, because I don't like the side hug.

1183
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,400
Oh, boy.

1184
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,320
And out of nowhere, before I realized what I was doing,

1185
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,760
as I hugged her, I kissed her cheek.

1186
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,040
Yes, man.

1187
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,120
And then you had to burn the house to the ground

1188
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,320
because it had seemed too much.

1189
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,600
It should have been one of the happiest days of my life.

1190
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,040
I ruined it.

1191
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,960
I walked back to my car thinking,

1192
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,040
what the fuck did you just do?

1193
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,840
Who are you?

1194
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,800
You just kissed her cheek.

1195
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,400
Give me a fucking, give me the,

1196
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,880
I need to know the trajectory, the angle.

1197
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,120
Like, did you just like plant it on there

1198
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,320
like you would do to a grandma?

1199
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,840
Or was it like, did you do it in like the French style?

1200
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,600
It was a grandma trajectory.

1201
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,400
And I have to say, even though I'm,

1202
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
listen, we all have a lot of fun here.

1203
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,560
I have to say, I think I sold it pretty confidently.

1204
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,080
I think she walked away from that thinking like-

1205
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:11,280
And walked me through it beat by beat.

1206
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,000
I think I gave you a pretty, a fucking zap,

1207
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,320
rudery breakdown of how it happened, Travis.

1208
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,320
But I need to know, okay, this will clarify it for me.

1209
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,960
Let's imagine we are in the 0.0001 second

1210
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
right after you have kissed her on the cheek.

1211
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:29,760
I don't want to be here.

1212
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,800
Describe to me the face that you made right after doing that.

1213
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,080
It probably would have been something like this.

1214
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,020
Like that.

1215
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,660
Probably something like that.

1216
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,180
I think you sold it.

1217
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,060
Did she seem like, what the fuck?

1218
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:45,940
No, it was like a really, you know what Griffin?

1219
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,300
I felt like I had dominated the situation socially

1220
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,380
because I think she walked away from it thinking,

1221
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,700
man, that must be pretty cool where he comes from.

1222
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,100
Like from his point of view.

1223
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,940
Oh, she thought you were so just a-

1224
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,580
Continental.

1225
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,380
Metropolitan.

1226
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,460
Exactly, exactly, very metropolitan.

1227
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,380
Ooh, big city man kissing cheeks.

1228
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,820
She knows where you live, Justin.

1229
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,820
She literally just sold your house.

1230
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,380
Literally.

1231
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,540
That must be really cool in his new house.

1232
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,740
She didn't know where my new house is.

1233
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,060
Listen, before we get a bunch of emails,

1234
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,580
I know that some people kiss cheeks.

1235
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,780
I know that this would not be a momentous occasion for everybody.

1236
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,620
This is not how I comport myself in the universe.

1237
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,500
It was very out of character.

1238
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,700
We keep our list of people whose cheeks we kiss very, very narrow.

1239
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,900
It's either our wives or our daddy, and that's it.

1240
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,620
That's it?

1241
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:34,580
That's it.

1242
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,660
It's a sacred bond that we have.

1243
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,300
We don't kiss each other on the cheeks.

1244
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,020
I give my baby little baby kisses, aren't cheek?

1245
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:42,500
Gross.

1246
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,460
And then I whisper to give her those ASMRs that babies love ASMR.

1247
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,060
Holy shit, no.

1248
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,500
Read another question.

1249
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,460
I've got an ASMR video of a woman giving her baby a massage.

1250
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,860
It's an infant massage ASMR video.

1251
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,940
Charlie loves it because it's got a baby in it.

1252
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,540
I love it because it's ASMR.

1253
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,700
It's a video we can all agree on.

1254
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,900
The whole family can like it.

1255
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey, why don't you go ahead and airplay that from your phone to the Apple TV,

1256
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,140
dad, because the whole family is enjoying this ASMR video.

1257
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,100
I'm going to go throw you in jail, Justin.

1258
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:17,700
I'm calling the cops right now, and they're going to toss you in the pokey.

1259
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,260
They're going to try to toss me in the pokey.

1260
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,780
I'm going to be like, hey cops, thank you so much for putting the handcuffs on.

1261
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,180
Save it for the ASMR episode.

1262
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,820
They're going to get tangles, and they're not going to be able to arrest me.

1263
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,100
What a weird superpower.

1264
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,700
How about another question?

1265
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,300
Please.

1266
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:38,660
I live with my fiance, and although I have my own laptop, we share his desktop for gaming.

1267
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,700
He's a bit messy in real life, but that I can deal with.

1268
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,420
His computer is an issue though, because he saves his porn to the desktop.

1269
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,660
Oh, oh no.

1270
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:52,580
Oh no.

1271
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,940
Playing TF2 in Windows mode.

1272
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,180
To the desktop?

1273
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:59,140
I need instant access to Butt Slammers 21.

1274
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,020
I need it at the ready.

1275
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,340
I got it in my holster, my Butt Slammers holster.

1276
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,260
You never know when the moment's going to strike you.

1277
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:09,380
Hold on, let me finish the question.

1278
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,540
Playing TF2 in Windows mode with some asses staring right back is unsettling, I assure you.

1279
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,500
I've asked him to sort it, and he just laughs.

1280
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,140
It's not a deal breaker, it's just weird.

1281
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,540
Do I learn to live with it, or do I sort it myself for his upcoming birthday?

1282
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,420
Okay, that's from, there's no poor pun I can make about Eugene, Oregon.

1283
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,220
No, you can't.

1284
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,940
It's the un-porniest town in the world.

1285
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:40,740
I love the idea of, hey honey, could you sort the porn you've saved on your laptop?

1286
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,660
Okay, bye.

1287
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:44,180
Good joke, honey.

1288
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,900
Catch you later.

1289
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,660
From a, chase your bliss, stand your truth, whatever.

1290
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,420
From a taxonomy standpoint, sort your shit.

1291
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,460
I'm with this person.

1292
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,140
Sort your shit.

1293
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:56,420
Put your shit in a folder.

1294
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,100
Sort it.

1295
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,220
And name that folder, please don't look at this, this is my secret.

1296
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,140
Or just call it porn.

1297
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,540
But they'll just put it on the desktop.

1298
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,540
That's a cluttered desktop.

1299
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:08,820
It's obscuring your background.

1300
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:11,540
I don't save my audio files to my desktop.

1301
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,660
Why is your porn there?

1302
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:20,740
Yeah, and do you think it is large, okay, do you think it is large files he has downloaded

1303
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,580
and does not want to go through the time and trouble of downloading again?

1304
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,300
Or do you think we're talking about like hyperlinks?

1305
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,260
Like hyperlink files that get him right to the sites he craves?

1306
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,540
This is his go-to like never fail porn.

1307
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:40,260
Like even if he's having the worst day and maybe he's got like a cold and is running a fever,

1308
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,020
this is the porn that he knows is gonna work all the time, every time.

1309
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,340
And he doesn't want to lose those links.

1310
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:49,780
Or why is he downloading this stuff?

1311
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:56,500
Did he just like get kaza and was like, this is it, the pinnacle of technological achievement.

1312
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,420
It's just kaza.

1313
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,180
What is stream-iming?

1314
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,140
You mean streaming?

1315
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,140
If you are no longer available to access porn on the internet,

1316
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,940
everything else in society has collapsed around you.

1317
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:12,900
It will be, I guarantee you, the least of your worries.

1318
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,180
I can't keep reading.

1319
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,980
I keep, this person will put it in all caps.

1320
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,540
And for good reason, because that's how I am also reading it, which is screaming inside my own head.

1321
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,460
This shit, desktop.

1322
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,420
I would have been offended if it was any file.

1323
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,660
If he saved any file, like he saves this whole music library to his desktop, bad.

1324
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:34,900
He saves individual photos to his desktop, stop it.

1325
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,980
He saves GIFs of monkeys wearing hats.

1326
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,300
Nothing belongs on the desktop.

1327
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,620
I gotta say, actually, I'm being pretty hypocritical right now.

1328
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:45,060
I'd like to screen share my screen with the two of you boys right now.

1329
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,140
Just to enjoy sort of the screaming hellscape.

1330
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,060
Big bosom seven.

1331
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,220
No, stop, that doesn't, that's not out there.

1332
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,940
You have butt-slammers two, three, and-

1333
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:56,820
They didn't make a-

1334
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:01,060
Okay, well, we know your line because they didn't even make a butt-slammers three.

1335
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,780
They skipped it.

1336
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:07,140
This one's called thugs and jugs, which seems like almost kind of offensive, Griffin.

1337
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,980
Wait, did you say thugs in jugs?

1338
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,100
Thugs in jugs.

1339
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:10,660
No, it says-

1340
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,300
This is called-

1341
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:11,940
Please let them out.

1342
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,820
You're misreading that.

1343
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,420
It says jugs in jugs, it's about women who put their boobs into jugs?

1344
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,180
No, it says dugs in jugs.

1345
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,300
This one just says jugs in jugs.

1346
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,580
No, that's a bug's life.

1347
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,340
I got on Kazaa and I downloaded a rip of a bug's life, okay?

1348
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,660
There's some, it's kind of, okay, I wish I had the confidence

1349
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:41,140
and the self-assuredness and just the openness that this gentleman clearly has

1350
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,460
that they're like, I don't care, look at it.

1351
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,500
I don't care who knows.

1352
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,220
Everybody, everybody, come look what I masturbate to.

1353
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,620
It's not about that, Travis, it's about taxonomy.

1354
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:50,980
It's just-

1355
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,020
What if you did a two monitor set up and one monitor was just all porn,

1356
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,980
but the other one you kept suit, you had three icons in the whole thing.

1357
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:05,780
It was just Kazaa, Firefox, and I don't know, like chat, maroon, AIM.

1358
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,740
It's inconceivable.

1359
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,740
It's unimaginable.

1360
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,940
It's unimaginable.

1361
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,700
This computer's done.

1362
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,860
This is, no tea, no shade, no pink lemonade.

1363
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,900
Do your thing.

1364
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,580
It's just unthinkable to me.

1365
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:27,700
The storage solution that he has landed on.

1366
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,300
It's not a solution, it's anarchy.

1367
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,380
This is how jungle animals would save pornography on their desktop.

1368
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,620
Do you think they would use Safari?

1369
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:44,340
Travis, you piece of shit.

1370
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,820
How could you?

1371
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,820
I have one job on this podcast.

1372
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:49,460
No, it's good.

1373
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:53,540
I needed that because I was getting lost a little bit.

1374
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:54,340
Hey, I want to say-

1375
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:56,500
You should use Navigator.

1376
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,060
I want to say-

1377
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,180
You dick fish.

1378
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,580
I'm trying to, sorry, I didn't understand the last thing that you said.

1379
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,260
I feel like we're not communicating very well.

1380
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,780
I got another.

1381
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,300
Netscape communicator was another.

1382
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,300
Anyway, it's not as good as Navigator.

1383
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,940
Anyway, I want to say a big thank you to Nature Box.

1384
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,620
You can order hundreds of great tasting snacks.

1385
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,660
Go to naturebox.com for your first box of handpicked snacks.

1386
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,860
Send the rest to your doorstop.

1387
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:25,620
We got a lot of-

1388
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,860
After you go on a Safari, you're a real explorer.

1389
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,900
You're forcing it at this point.

1390
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,340
Okay, I'm going to double back on that one.

1391
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,060
Okay, that's good.

1392
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:36,900
That one, do over.

1393
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,700
Podcast do over.

1394
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,340
We got a lot of new shows that we're-

1395
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,460
Holy shit, so many new shows, so many new programs.

1396
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,580
I want to give a personal plug to two shows.

1397
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,020
One is called Still Buffering.

1398
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,540
It's a show about teenage life from my wife, Sydney, and her teenage sister, Riley.

1399
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,580
Much like Sawbones, it is appropriate for kids and parents.

1400
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,020
There's no bad words.

1401
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,220
And if you're looking for a show to listen to with your kids,

1402
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,540
I think it's a great one.

1403
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,060
I've listened to their second episode.

1404
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,700
It's about technology.

1405
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,860
And if you are an adult that wants to have a full-blown panic attack-

1406
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,340
Oh, boy.

1407
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:19,620
Please, please hear how Riley reacts to technological solutions

1408
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,540
that I still think of as fairly current.

1409
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:27,220
You'll also enjoy her horror at the description of what a chat room is and was.

1410
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,020
Oh, yeah.

1411
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,180
Yeah, because it's like not even a thing.

1412
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,540
But anyway, that's called Still Buffering.

1413
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,260
It's on iTunes.

1414
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,940
I also want to give a plug to a new show from Griffin.

1415
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,300
It's about video games.

1416
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,860
It's called Cool Games, Inc. that he does with Nick Robinson,

1417
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:43,860
who is another staffer at Polygon, the video game website that we make.

1418
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:48,580
And it is about Griffin and Nick coming up with video game ideas

1419
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,860
and then pitching them to someone.

1420
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,340
And it is uproariously funny.

1421
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:52,980
I can't recommend it.

1422
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,780
We have one episode.

1423
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,820
You can find it on iTunes.

1424
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,340
That's Cool Games, Inc.

1425
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,540
Cool Games, one word, Inc.

1426
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:03,380
And our first episode, we take tweets from people

1427
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,940
and we polish them into full game pitches.

1428
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,060
And our first episode is about a single tweet that we got

1429
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,700
from Ben Esposito from Arcane Kids,

1430
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:14,580
who made the amazing Sonic Dreams collection,

1431
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:16,180
which probably explains the tone of his tweet,

1432
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:18,260
which was grandma once hit al dente,

1433
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,420
which we then turned into a fucking goatee contender 2016.

1434
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,900
And did it let me also say that I really enjoy Rosebuddies,

1435
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,900
which is a show that Griffin and his wife

1436
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,180
do about The Bachelor.

1437
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,820
I've never watched an episode of Bachelor in my life

1438
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,900
and I thoroughly enjoy your Bachelor fan.

1439
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,140
Thank you.

1440
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,340
We get a lot of tweets from people saying,

1441
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:37,860
well, I enjoy this if I don't watch the show.

1442
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,860
And I literally, I love you.

1443
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,300
I have no idea how to answer that.

1444
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,620
That's like between you and your God.

1445
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,020
I also want to tell everybody,

1446
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,300
if you haven't checked it out yet,

1447
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,940
my wife and I just launched a podcast called Schmaners.

1448
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,940
It's all about etiquette in the modern age

1449
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,540
and whether or not it's still applicable

1450
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,940
and learn about stuff that you might not have known about.

1451
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,060
We've in our first week, we put up two episodes.

1452
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,140
So we have episode one, thank you notes,

1453
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,100
episode two table manners and episode three,

1454
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:06,420
which is gonna be coming up this Friday

1455
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,020
is conversational etiquette.

1456
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,380
So check it out.

1457
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,820
You can find it on iTunes and on maximumfund.org

1458
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,220
and you can follow us at Schmaners cast.

1459
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,700
If you have any things, any questions or ideas

1460
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,220
for future episodes, tweet at us.

1461
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,500
It is the most delightful show.

1462
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,980
And I'm so glad that Teresa has a vehicle

1463
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,300
because as many people have commented,

1464
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,420
just a delightful voice.

1465
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:30,740
Just a wonderful, delightful voice.

1466
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:32,580
And just a delightful human being

1467
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,620
who really makes me seem personable and relatable.

1468
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,140
She makes you seem like fucking Shrek.

1469
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:38,900
That's fair.

1470
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,740
But people like Shrek, he's done like eight movies.

1471
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,780
That is true.

1472
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,140
He has a Broadway show.

1473
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,180
Do you have that?

1474
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:46,660
No, go listen to the other shows on Max Fun as well.

1475
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,500
There's a lot of very, very, very good ones.

1476
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:51,860
I'm talking about shows like stop podcasting yourself.

1477
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,060
I'm talking about shows like well, saw bones.

1478
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,020
We've already mentioned.

1479
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:57,780
I'm talking about like, can I pet your dog?

1480
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,140
I'm talking about one bad mother.

1481
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,740
You can find them all, maximumfund.org.

1482
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,380
Go check it out.

1483
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,900
You can also, we've mentioned a lot of projects

1484
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,700
that we're working on.

1485
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,980
If you wanna see all the projects

1486
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,980
we're associated with, including like stuff

1487
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,460
like the monster factory, Gervin's Amiibo Corner,

1488
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,580
all of our Facebook groups, all of our Twitter accounts,

1489
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,500
just go to mcroyshows.com.

1490
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,260
I also wanna say a very personal thank you

1491
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,060
to Jeremy Baker who hooked me up

1492
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:22,740
with some Disneyland passes.

1493
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,740
So I was able to take my friend.

1494
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,660
Yeah, I was able to take my friend Bradberry

1495
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,900
and my wife, Teresa, to Disneyland

1496
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,620
and we had just the most epic time.

1497
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:32,900
So thank you, Jeremy, for that.

1498
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,940
Oh, I also wanna say, just cause I'm trying to get the word

1499
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:38,580
out as often as possible so I can switch them over.

1500
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:41,860
I've got the new PO box set up, PO box 909,

1501
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,900
Van Nuys, California, 91408.

1502
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,100
The old one is still active

1503
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,180
but I probably won't keep it active forever.

1504
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,820
So if you're worried that you sent some stuff

1505
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,700
and it might not have got,

1506
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,220
we're still using that one for now.

1507
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,940
But if you have anything to send in the future,

1508
00:58:57,940 --> 00:58:58,740
use the new one.

1509
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,100
And thanks, John Roderick and the Long Winters

1510
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,300
for the use of our theme song.

1511
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,940
It's a departure off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1512
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,740
Please go listen.

1513
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,860
It's like the best album.

1514
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,340
It's a fucking great album.

1515
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,500
We listen to it once a month and it's so, so good.

1516
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,220
Finally, Yahoo.

1517
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,220
Yes.

1518
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,580
Justin, are you ready?

1519
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,940
I'm so ready.

1520
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,780
This was sent in by Brooks Oglesby.

1521
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,420
Thank you, Brooks.

1522
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:22,980
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Raleigh H, who asks.

1523
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,940
Fuck, it's so good.

1524
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:30,180
Feminists, are you impressed that David Blaine

1525
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,580
held his breath for 17 minutes on Oprah?

1526
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:34,900
What?

1527
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,220
What?

1528
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,660
I'm Justin McElroy.

1529
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,860
I'm Travis McElroy.

1530
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,500
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1531
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,740
This has been my brother, my brother and me.

1532
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,460
Kiss your dad.

1533
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:53,860
Square on the lips.

1534
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:03,780
Maximumfun.org.

1535
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:04,820
Comedy and culture.

1536
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,940
Artist owned.

1537
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:06,980
Listener supported.

1538
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,620
Hi, I'm Sydney McElroy.

1539
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,900
And I'm Ryleigh Smurl.

1540
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,620
And we co-host a podcast called Still Buffering,

1541
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:16,100
a sister's guide to teens through the ages.

1542
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:19,540
On our show, we tackle all of the hot teen topics

1543
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,540
that kids have on their minds today.

1544
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,300
Hot teen topics?

1545
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:27,380
Well, you know, the questions that are plaguing teenagers

1546
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,100
through their tumultuous growing years.

1547
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,500
Questions like, how do I party?

1548
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,380
Or what do I do with all this hair everywhere?

1549
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,780
The same questions that people like Sydney

1550
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,100
had during their years as teenagers.

1551
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,340
Many, many, many.

1552
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,300
Okay, not that many.

1553
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,140
So, so long ago.

1554
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,740
Yeah, okay, I think they get the idea.

1555
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,900
So search for Still Buffering on iTunes or Maximumfun.org

1556
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:53,060
for new episodes every Tuesday.

1557
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:54,100
Still Buffering.

1558
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,220
I am a teenager.

1559
01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:10,420
And I was too.
