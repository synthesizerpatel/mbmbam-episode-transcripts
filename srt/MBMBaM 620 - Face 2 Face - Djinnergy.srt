1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:17,380
Travis insists he's a sexpert but if there's a degree on his wall I haven't

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,880
seen it. Also this show isn't for kids which I

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,640
mention only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,360
listening. What's up you cool baby?

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:25,280
You guys hear about this? I hear I see iron mics back in the headlines.

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,720
Jesus Christ. You heard about this? This is just how my mind works.

8
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:40,120
Should we go? No no keep it on hit. We don't need more light. Justin does.

9
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,560
He clearly needs this. And listen I don't want to tell the people who

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,040
work here how to do their jobs but what he's doing is more important than what

11
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,920
me and Travis are doing right now. We're a glorified audience. Can you turn the lights off

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,240
of me and Travis. And if you want to mute our mics. It's just always such a joy to

13
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,540
be back in the in the Lost Cruises funny bone. Y'all are always the best audience.

14
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:24,280
So iron mics back in the headlines. I've had I've had some they they don't

15
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:32,520
mention that in the safety. That's great. He he hit someone in an airplane several

16
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,680
times. If you didn't. They don't mention.

17
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,860
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show

18
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:58,720
for the modren era. Wait a minute. I'm your oldest brother Justin

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,520
McElroy and I'm guessing we have not been here before. Is that accurate?

20
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,060
Cuz this the second time you all will see it's much deluded from this. So I'm

21
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,000
loving this. Getting it raw. The second time it's a lot more like oh yeah it's

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,160
amusing not funny but amusing. I'm your middle brother Travis McElroy and I'm

23
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,440
your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy.

24
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:41,160
If if you say so man. I am just so thrilled to be here in the Paris of the

25
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:51,800
Plains as I call it the city the city of fountains soccer capital of America. We

26
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,520
want the World Cup. Am I right? Yeah. And it's also called the center of America

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,600
mainly cuz it's the center of America. I mean draw an X. We're here babe. This is

28
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,400
the heartland right here. We're here. I call it the cool Kansas City. Am I

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,640
right?

30
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,480
Fuck the other Kansas. Fuck that other Kansas City for real. Hey there's a lot of you

31
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:28,120
here. If we all teamed up we could beat bad Kansas City's ass. They'd never see it

32
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,000
coming. This is an advice show. We took a don't be jealous but we took a bus to

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,080
get here. Now Justin was it a fancy tour bus like Garth Brooks might have? Um no.

34
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,600
It was just a regular bus with cupholders. Just like with some cupholders. There

35
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,080
was a there was a turlet in the back. No no TP which I see you. Thank you. I get it.

36
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:01,840
No TP no sink. So it's really just a wet bus hole. The sink the sink had a paper

37
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,680
sign in it that said do not use. So several of us did use the bathroom so

38
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,840
we all kind of exchanged this glance like we'll never speak of this right? I didn't

39
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,560
you didn't right? Did you bring hand sanitizer? Okay. But they did have one

40
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,400
DVD on the bus and the one one a single DVD and the bus driver found it and was

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,280
like let me see if we have any other DVDs but we told him to stop because the

42
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,240
DVD was Space Jam and we said that stop looking. I want to talk about and I'm so

43
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,160
sorry it's a beloved classic. Here he goes. There's a huge plot hole in this. He

44
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,300
hasn't already lost you enough now he's gonna attack Space Jam. But it bothered the shit out of me

45
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,960
today watching it. Right at the beginning Michael Jordan is crushed into a

46
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,400
basketball by the Monstars and then later he's surprised that his body can

47
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,720
contour into different shapes. Excuse me Michael you already done did it once. I'm

48
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,320
just saying some inconsistencies in Space Jam. She's Andrew Dice Clay over here tonight.

49
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,920
I don't mean to be. It did get it did inspire my oldest son to once again just

50
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,320
check with me that Michael Jordan's a real person and not a creation of the

51
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,000
Warner Brothers entertainment conglomerate. Our dad as far as I know

52
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,320
did not read a book or look at a screen other than the movie Space Jam. He watched

53
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,680
the entirety of it wrapped and I know that because every few minutes he would

54
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,960
announce the name of the person on the screen. Jim Rome look at him. Muggsy Bogues

55
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:52,200
look at him. Five foot three Muggsy Bogues is. You can be anything you want to be.

56
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Thank you that's the message of tonight's tonight's evening is you can

57
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,360
live your dreams. You can be anything you want to be. What a beautiful venue by the

58
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,560
way. No kidding. We were blown away this is you are so fortunate to have this is a

59
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,480
lovely place. I asked who made the chandelier and nobody would tell me. What?

60
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,080
Yeah I asked around I was like did you make it? They're afraid you copy it. Yeah

61
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I guess. This is as you've certainly guessed by now an advice show and we're

62
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
you sent us your questions and we are gonna do our very best to answer them.

63
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,600
Which isn't very good. No it's not good. There will also be skits if you've

64
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,760
never listened before. What? There'll be skits and sketches and bits. There'll be

65
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:42,600
bits. Okay here's the first question. For my job one of the things I've always had

66
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,120
to do is stock the work fridge full of snacks. What a weird part of

67
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,920
someone's adult job to have. Someone's got to do it. I'm the CEO of Apple.

68
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:02,640
I live in Kansas City. Once kind of as a joke I got gogurts. Much to my surprise

69
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,280
they were almost immediately gone. So I restocked them and have been doing so

70
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,680
for the last two and a half years. That's a lot of gogurt. That's a lot of gogurt.

71
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,240
Mama Mia. Recently the grocery store I go to stopped stocking them so I stopped

72
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,960
buying them for work. That'll teach them. Yesterday my boss's boss came up to my

73
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,920
desk, mind you this is the first time I've ever formally met this person, and

74
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:44,640
asked if there's anything I can do to get the gogurts back. Brothers, how do we

75
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,160
get more gogurt? Then that's from hurtin' for a gurtin'.

76
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:06,400
It's good. It's very good. In case they hurtin' for a gurtin'. It's excellent. Are you, are you here? Yeah. Okay, got it.

77
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,920
Okay, that sounds like someone who doesn't know how to source gogurt. Hey,

78
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,120
real quick, just by a round of applause, if you live in this region and could buy

79
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,000
gogurt tomorrow, please applaud. Okay, thank you. This was my suspicion. Just

80
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,640
tell the truth, you didn't want to buy gogurt anymore. I get it, they're pricey.

81
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,040
I do understand if you go to the place closest to your house and they have

82
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,000
everything but gogurt, the idea of being like, time to make a second stop for the

83
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,020
gogurt. Gross. But like, what is this store that's like, I don't know, we sell

84
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,240
through all this gogurt all the time, but it's just one person. Maybe we should

85
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,480
stop selling it. I'm worried about them. We have to stop selling it, but they're

86
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,600
eating eight gogurts a day. Maybe you've maximized efficiency so much that word

87
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,720
has spread that gogurt is the new work fuel. Oh, because it's so quick.

88
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,600
No spoons, no bowls to wash. I could blast down a gogurt in... Can we get a

89
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,560
gogurt to try it out? If we can have a... Yeah, Paul, gogurt? No, we don't have any gogurt.

90
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,920
If I need gut bacteria in the next 11 seconds... There is no way. I would swear

91
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,960
on a sack of Bibles that there is no bacteria in gogurt whatsoever. I mean,

92
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,560
not the good kind. It's not probiotic. I was gonna say it's antibiotic, but that

93
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,000
we probably would have heard about that. Why are both of those things good?

94
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
Where's the middle ground? Where's just biotic? Antibiotic is good. Probiotic's

95
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,320
good. It's when they get out of... It's like midichlorians.

96
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,520
That's why Jamie Lee Curtis can move things with her mind. Gogurt is like the

97
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,400
new Soylent for people that like to have a good time. Gogurt is a

98
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,240
complete meal. It's got go, it's got gurt, it's everything you need for the day.

99
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,440
It's got cream, it's got flavor, it's got cold. And sometimes there's SpongeBob on

100
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,080
the package. If your company is only given 25 second breaks, that's perfect time to

101
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,160
just slurp it down. You can do that as you walk to your one bathroom break for

102
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,400
the day. No problem. You remember the commercials for like Yoplait fruit at

103
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,560
the bottom where they mix it up a little bit and then... And it's like I've got

104
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,320
reports to file. I've got clients I need to interface with. With the fruit at the top,

105
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,760
in the middle, in the bottom. I'm busy. No fruit, just cream. Fast, fast cream.

106
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,160
If I could crush it into my face. What about gogurt? Yes! They should call it

107
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,720
fast cream for business. Sometimes when I'm on my way to do brain surgery and I

108
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,160
only have a little bit of time between brains, I need a quick gogurt.

109
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,000
I need a very fast... I'm an adult doctor with responsibilities. And a hunger for cream.

110
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Get me a gogurt with Anna on it. They do need to have like... It can still be the

111
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,640
same stuff in the thing, but do have it be say fast, fast cream for business on

112
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:15,960
the label. Yeah. And have like someone with... They should have a line of gogurt that's just like black and white with like a business man in a suit like, huh, time to go.

113
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:25,360
This tastes like tobacco. Mmm, good. Is this resin? I love this. I don't know how good of a job you do.

114
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,960
At your job. But if you've ever watched Survivor, you know that you want to be

115
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,800
the one person that knows how to fish, because they're not gonna vote you off

116
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,560
right away, because they'll get hungry. Unless you're a big person, in which case

117
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,840
they are gonna cut you loose as soon as you hit the merge. Yeah, it's a big strong person, they'll

118
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:50,560
get you get rid of you at the merge. But the point is, I... You can't be sure that you

119
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,560
are not hanging on by a gogurt. Yeah. The one person that knows how to get gogurt, because

120
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,880
apparently the boss's boss can't get their own gogurt. They have to come to

121
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,280
you, their dealer. If another human being... The Gurt Smith. If another human being who is in charge of

122
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,000
people, who are in charge of people, has to lower themselves to ask you, another

123
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,640
human being, what can we do to get more gogurt? Yeah, that was not it. That person had to

124
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,200
psych themselves up for that conversation for days. Like, no, I'm just gonna ask him.

125
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,160
I'm gonna ask him today, honey. I'm gonna... You can't. I have to. I don't know where to get it.

126
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,720
My productivity's down some. I can't do it without gogurt. It's also an optics

127
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,360
thing, though, because if you're somebody's boss's boss, you can't roll up to the

128
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,760
Kroger and be like, hmm, 12 packages of gogurt for me, please. I'm going to the

129
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,840
opera later. So you're saying the employees at this Kroger are like, wait a

130
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:56,160
minute. You're a boss. You can't be buying gogurt. No, no, no. Not just a boss. A super boss.

131
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,480
You're one of the super bosses. You have bosses that answer you. Fantastic. I hope that helps.

132
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,180
Go to another store. I had you right early. Yeah, I have a... I've got a gogurt guy in

133
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,720
Kansas City I can hook you up with. He's got the special swamp berry flavor

134
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,280
from... That was a promotion for Shrek Forever After. It's gonna cost you extra,

135
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:26,480
but your co-workers will taste the difference. It's a finely aged... You can

136
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,440
tell from the... It's gogurt cheese. You can tell from the rind on the outside. It's

137
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,760
perfect. It's ready. Oh, this is... This is funky. Can I say that? This is funky.

138
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,400
This is a funky gogurt, and I love it. Is this frozen? No, it's just solid. No, yeah.

139
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm sorry, by the way. I'll pack up my things and go. I work at a college, and my

140
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,480
co-workers and I... Yeah, okay. Yeah, college is good, if you want. I work at a college, and my

141
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,920
co-workers and I volunteered to help some nursing students with a disaster

142
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,600
simulation. I was giving closed head... Sorry, I think that should be... I was given.

143
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,440
Given. Although I do like... You're giving closed head wound. You're giving massive

144
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,260
trauma. Category is closed head wound. I was given closed head wound, which

145
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,720
basically means a concussion. My co-workers were given more intense

146
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,560
injuries, and some even used moulage. I don't know what that means. We all know

147
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:42,080
moulage is the art. I do know what it is. What is it? No, you go. Makeup, you say.

148
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:48,200
Is it like decoupage? No, but I can listen to you say that word all day. Is it

149
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:55,160
like decoupage? You say it like a spy in like a 1940s movie delivering a secret.

150
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,360
Ah, my friends. Is it makeup? Is it like blood makeup? It's like a cast. Okay,

151
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,040
that's fine. So fucking funny. I've been asked to participate again, and while I

152
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,000
know it's important to have people with minor injuries, brothers, I want to know

153
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,160
how I can beef up my performance. That's from It's Only a Flesh Wound. Are you

154
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,400
here? All right. All right, good. Now the first thing I do have to say before we

155
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,360
move on is that there are no small injuries. Yeah, they can get terribly

156
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,360
infected and kill you. Travis or Griffin, one of them once got a pine tree needle

157
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,480
stuck in their foot, had to go in for surgery. Anything can spiral out of

158
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,160
control at any time. I got a kidney stone, little old thing stuck in my pee-pee

159
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,960
works, took G-Man out of commission for the better part of a month. So they had

160
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,840
to send Dennis Quaid in there in a tiny submarine to get it out. True, had to blast it.

161
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:02,160
Anything could happen. I got a boner and crushed a man inside of me. Unrelated,

162
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,960
those two things. And that's what happened to Randy Quaid. If you're

163
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,680
curious, he's still mad at Griffin. You killed my brother! You killed my tiny brother

164
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:19,600
with your boner! Again! Again! That's how I lost Ralph Quaid. He was the best of us!

165
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:29,280
How did Randy Quaid get inside my wiener? No, Randy didn't. In this picture, Dennis

166
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,640
did, was killed by your boner, and it made Randy so mad. Oh, I thought you were

167
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,960
saying Randy Quaid was shrunk down in a urinal and like shot up my pee stream the other way.

168
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:46,480
So here's what you could do. Screaming, hey boys, I'm back! Okay, so hey, so here's one thing you

169
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:53,920
could do. Because my wiener kidnapped Randy Quaid in the 90s. One thing you could do, you do the

170
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,400
concussion, that's child's play, anybody could do that, but you also add on

171
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,280
another injury, just sort of on the side, just sort of along the way. Hey, while

172
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,760
you're looking at this, is this normal? And then you pull aside your tuxedo

173
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,480
jacket and you get a knife wound in there. Yeah, it's got to be good, too. It

174
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,920
can't just like, I got a hurt elbow or whatever, like a piece of rebar through.

175
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,040
You have like, you know, it's like one of those arrows through the head, but it's

176
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,680
rebar. One they do on an old Sweeps Week episode of Grey's Anatomy. Oh, there's a

177
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,720
bomb in my tummy! Something like that. The other students are like, hey, she's doing it again, she's

178
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,080
adding other injuries that we're not supposed to do. What? No, I'm not! Be cool! Be cool! Be cool!

179
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,040
I gotta follow my blitz. They said that they have an alien in their head, and that's why

180
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:48,120
the injuries. I did not! I did not. It's in my tummy. Where aliens belong. You could draw

181
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,680
like a, with black marker, like a crack on your head, and it'd be like, this is a

182
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,960
this is a real humdinger of a concussion I got over here. It could be the story

183
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:06,360
behind the concussion. It's not related to the hurricane that happened. No, it's

184
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,440
just like, here's what happened. Like, I got a concussion from a long time ago. It's a long

185
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,120
time concussion I've been meaning to see somebody about, and maybe you could help

186
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,120
me with that. It always acts up during hurricanes. I got a concussion so bad. Oh, there's a hurricane coming.

187
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,720
Oh, my concussion! Oh, what if the concussion gave you psychic powers, and now they have to deal with that.

188
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,320
Hey, I got phenomenon, and now I can, I have psychic powers. I got a concussion so

189
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,120
bad I fell on this knife, so I need you to do both of them for me. The knife hit

190
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,280
me real hard, and then bounced into my tummy. A phenomenon on me. I did get telekinesis,

191
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,640
but I do not know how to use it. Exhibit A, the knife. Trying to cut a steak,

192
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:54,120
instead I cut a me. Well, maybe you will get a better injury next time. That's

193
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,520
always possible. Or trade with somebody lazy. Yeah, somebody would love a

194
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:03,480
concussion. Yeah. That way you don't, you can just show up tired. Nobody would be

195
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,480
bad enough. I'm gonna go to sleep. Wait, no! No, stop! Or you could show up with rebar

196
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,560
through your body, and just be like, you can't give me something else. I'm, you got

197
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,640
to dress for the wound you want, you know? Yes, yes. Also, how good are you all at

198
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,560
fixing stuff? Because I do actually need... This is not makeup. This is, I need medical

199
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,800
attention right now. But please be careful. I'm just borrowing the rebar. I

200
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,080
do have to take it back. My dad's gonna be so pissed if I don't get his rebar

201
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:46,700
back to him. He's a foreman. The office I work in in downtown KC, that's Kansas

202
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,440
City, has big open staircases down the middle of the building, and I get the

203
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,120
pleasure of sitting directly in front of them on the second floor. Every time

204
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,000
someone walks down the stairs, I have severe anxiety that I will look up, make

205
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,960
eye contact, and cause someone to trip. And then we will have locked eye contact

206
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,160
for the duration of their fall. Are you a gyroscope? Yeah, I don't think that, that

207
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:21,520
part I don't think will happen, to be clear. How do I ensure that I'm not the

208
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,200
cause of these falls? Should I avoid eye contact at all times, or will that make

209
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,680
me seem unfriendly and standoffish? That's from Stressed Stair Watcher in

210
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,880
Kansas City, Missouri. Are you here? All right. Way back there, because you know

211
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,360
you can't make eye contact with us. With your incredible hypnotic eye contact,

212
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,280
sends people to their doom. I'm pretty sure this is the plot of While You Were

213
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,960
Sleeping. Is it? I don't think that's right. And it's so old that it doesn't

214
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,160
matter?

215
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,840
That's my new persona, by the way. Yeah, guy who doesn't like While You Were

216
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,640
Sleeping. What a, what a shithead. Who likes that guy? That movie's great. Nobody

217
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,640
is going to look, like after they fall, and the police arrive, presumably. No one

218
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,480
is going to say, it was, it was her! She did it! She locked me with eye contact and

219
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,280
then I beefed it! It was all her fault! Because it could be just as

220
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,000
likely that they really wanted to make eye contact with you, and were terribly

221
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,160
distracted by the fact that you would not look at their eyeballs. That's true.

222
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,840
I, okay, but here's the problem, Justin. You're right. The first time. But after it

223
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,920
happens five or six times. Never happened. It's never, I want to be clear. It's never happened.

224
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,560
This is because they're being careful now. Super clear. Love it. Has not happened.

225
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,040
This is fun, because you guys are like the good, like the angel and the devil of

226
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:02,200
anxiety on my shoulders. That's like, if you look at someone, they will trip. And

227
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,160
Justin's like, nah dog, don't worry about it. But Travis's anxiety, like, yeah man,

228
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,040
it's definitely for sure, for sure, for sure, for sure. I'm just saying there's a

229
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,920
middle ground between the fifth or sixth time. It's the third time. The third time.

230
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,880
But if you're saying it hasn't happened or it's happened six times, the middle

231
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,680
ground is three. No, the middle time is one time, because it will never happen.

232
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,440
It could happen. Okay, listen. Listen. Advice. The whole time you ever see

233
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
anyone walking down the stairs, just go, don't trip. Don't trip. Do not trip. Don't

234
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,640
look at me. Don't look at me. Look at the stairs. Right foot, left foot, right foot,

235
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,160
left foot. Grab the rail. Grab the rail. I will say, you know what, point of order,

236
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,080
anytime that I've ever made eye contact with someone I don't know, it did prompt

237
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,080
me to immediately focus extremely hard on what I was doing at that exact second.

238
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,040
If I even fleetingly saw, was looking at someone, they look at back at me, I'm

239
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,480
immediately like fascinated by the art of walking down stairs. I've never done

240
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,360
anything so compelling in my entire life. Yeah, if I know someone's watching me

241
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,080
navigate stairs, I'm gonna want to do the best damn job I can going down those

242
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:21,280
stairs. Really? I'm not even doing a funky little step. That's how you fall down. It's not your fault at all. It's hubris.

243
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:32,080
You like this shit? Whoa! I deserve that! It's not on you, it's on me! It's on me. I tried to see you walk down the stairs.

244
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,520
Oh, hello there. Didn't see you come in. I'm Travis McElroy. You might know me as

245
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,440
the middlest brother from My Brother, My Brother, and Me, a podcast that you're

246
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,920
currently listening to. But I'm also a language enthusiast. Yes, that's correct.

247
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:05,240
Language. I love it. But how does it work, you ask? Well, it's easy. You learn the

248
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,560
you learn the words and you learn what they mean and then you can say them to

249
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,960
people so then they understand. You get it, right? Well, if you

250
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,040
don't get it, and I'm starting to think that perhaps I don't, you could check out

335
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,320
mysterious lady this one she will always change her name and voice her story has

336
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:24,160
yet to be consistent she often says the name Lauren so I'm going with that shit

337
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,760
Lauren likes to just have fun with you you'll hear her skipping whistling with

338
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:36,680
what body you'll hear her skippling whistling falling down the some stairs

339
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,560
rolling only if you make eye contact with her she also likes to show shadows

340
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,240
Lauren is very bubbly and wait it's wait a second yeah that's the that's the way

341
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,160

always happy for reasons that honestly escape me she is a fun spirit to have in

344
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,160

345
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,560
Paul Lauren is very bubbly and always happy she's a fun spirit to have in a

346
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:31,080
home no returns how did she die though she didn't this is a living person's

347
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:38,080
face adhered to an old picture frame you ever seen dr. who yeah if you choose to

348
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,560
adopt her into your life please understand something of great

349
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,920
importance you got ripped off spirits do not always reveal themselves immediately

350
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:53,560
they do not perform on command you need to give them time and space sometimes

351
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:58,600
it happens right away but it's quite rare more often than not a spirit needs

352
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:05,040
months to feel comfortable well past the return window right to feel comfortable

353
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,600
enough to begin showing activity by then you won't even remember where you got it

354
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:16,040
yeah and I'll have canceled this account it also depends on your own experience

355
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,200
with the paranormal at times I have had experiences right away but usually I'll

356
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,280
hear from them a month or even up to six months later when things are happening

357
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:35,720
finally I cannot stress it enough give spirits time give them space remain

358
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,600
open-minded and you will be amazed God it's still there it's still there Paul

for as it cannot be reversed it's like hiring Dan Aykroyd and Gertz point-blank

401
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:27,240
it cannot be reversed it is not if it will work or not but do you really want

402
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,760
what you're asking for one more time it is not if it will work or not but do you

403
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,840
really want what you're asking for the sad truth is most people spend their

404
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,000
lives not knowing what they really want in life oh you have provided several

00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,120
so Michael your sentence that you sent us was brothers should I keep digging

443
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:34,000
this big hole under my house I might take an early guess at no but I'm gonna

444
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,480
need more context okay so my wife and I recently got a new house or it's a very

445
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:45,000
old house and well we started doing some renovating and dug under some concrete

446
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,880
yeah yeah and we found like a brick archway oh shit and so we started

447
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,120
digging are there any runes this season on a course of Oak Island I haven't

448
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:59,760
checked yet but we're about you didn't check for runes Michael they'd be

449
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,480
glowing I've looked but all right we're seven feet in at this point I can stand

450
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,600
I'm pretty tall gentleman yeah and I can stand completely in this hole and just

451
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,640
just vanish yeah sure have you okay we haven't hit the bottom yet of the archway

452
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:22,160
no well it's a completely flat wall it's like plastered in okay holy so why don't

453
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,200
you worry about hitting pipes what have you hit pipe or demons at a certain

454
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:33,480
point I either have to keep going or have to stop yeah yeah if you dig if you

455
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,480
dig half a hole that's really not anything is it so you haven't you have

456
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:43,160
not exhumed the entire archway is what you're saying not completely I mean you

457
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,800
have to get the archway out Michael what do I what else can I do you can film it

458
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,320
for tick-tock yeah yeah you should have been filming this whole time no how much

459
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,760
of an archaeological background do you have to that qualifies you to this

460
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,480
exhumation also did you call fucking 4-1-1 to make sure you're not gonna zap

461
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,560
yourself you goofball we did check that there's no electrical going through it

462
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:13,840
they asked like out of curiosity why are you digging a big hole in your house

463
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,200
did you ask about lay lines between archways what if you punch through the

464
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:25,320
archway there's more house and let him talk there's a big hole under my house

465
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,920
yeah okay that's not new information my fucking time Michael I'm drinking

466
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,360
go-kart I have places to be you get another go-kart I wanted to know if the

467
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:42,960
banana one was good or not not as good a strawberry not Michael I'm scared that I

468
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,440
will yes your house will fall on you no no okay

469
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,520
because it's like a hundred and ten year old house yeah so it's down yeah no way

470
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:55,960
it would fall on you I'm scared that I'm either gonna unleash something yes or

hey Michael I heard you hit me you struck gold um can I say there's a third

474
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,680
option you should be afraid of which is you do a lot of work and find nothing

475
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,220
yeah but like I already found a kick-ass archways I found a cool archway Michael

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,400
and watch Wheel of Fortune like that's nothing nothing you have to finish you

00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:43,440
a day of it yeah you know many hands make light

482

00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,720
a demon shows up you got a little maybe a little meat between you and them yeah

484
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:00,760
yeah don't invite your best friends yeah you know your strong bad friends if

485
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,440
the moon is full maybe throw a tarp over that shit yeah if you hear whispers from

486
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:12,360
inside that sound like long-lost loved ones don't know tarp it's so hard if the

487
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:16,400
as bad as you want to know the truth the archway wants you even more yeah yeah

488
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,480
you have to know that does that help Michael that helps thank you thank you

489
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:36,640
next please oh thank you Amanda with our debonair cape okay and she's gone thank

490
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:43,320
you tuxedo mask hello hello hello hi hey are you a fancy moth person or is that

491
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,640
just what I'm gathering from the antennae they're horns they're horns

492
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,840
obviously Travis Monroe you said can I bring my unicycle into places I've

493
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:57,200
ridden to and set it in a corner while I go about my business and I mean my

494
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,960
immediate answer is only if you want to walk home but go on more details so my

495
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,880
car broke down this week and my only way to get around is with my unicycle yeah

496
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:15,080
so I'm wondering if I can bring it in places and like ask do you have a

497
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,400
unicycle parking section I don't and I don't have a bike lock because I didn't

498
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,240
have one before and I'd have to go out of my way there's no way to secure a

499
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:30,520
unicycle yeah it's so streamlined and steely no ha let them finish because the

500
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,840
rest of that was ask the cashier to what to watch it well you know that's

501
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:43,560
unacceptable right Monroe you could just you should just carry it cuz what keep

502
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,800
riding it what if there's a long hallway you want to be ready for that you'll be

503
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,840
so mad if you see a long hallway and you're like god damn it if only I had my

504
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:57,200
unicycle I could breeze through this you can also oh here's the move right you

505
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,160
take it in you look at the cashier and you go where do you usually keep this

506
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,760
at this point like unicycle I have a unicycle where where's your unicycle oh

507
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:13,520
I thought this was a high-class establishment can you give me what so

508
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,160
are you talking about like grocery shopping is that the kind of thing I

509
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:19,320
experienced you're talking about that you ride your unicycle to yeah or can I

510
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:24,360
like take the class and put it in the corner no you can't do that unless it's

511
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:30,400
clown college unless I would say if you go to the grocery store it's okay if

512
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,760
you buy three round objects of similar weight and size see but I can't do

513
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,440
anything with those I mean you could as long as you have like a big stick and

514
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,880
equally weighted things on either end you could do that I'd watch that all day

515
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,840
here's what I would say oh no this point I immediately poked a hole in my own

516
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,720
point but I'll say it anyway who's gonna steal a unicycle because very few people

517
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,360
know how to ride those home but I could just pick that shit up yeah I've had one

518
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:04,800
stolen from me before yeah really yeah I want to know that story my parents left

519
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,400
the garage open and it disappeared Wow what you think would be easily

520
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,760
identified later as the only other unicycle in town yeah if you see someone

521
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,440
riding it that's yours yeah unless you take two of them together and you're

522
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,640
like oh that could be a bicycle time for a little frontier justice get it back

523
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,840
does Casey have like a very active unicycle scene holy shit are you

524
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:37,360
fucking kidding me that was I thought a goof but okay then yeah apparently it's

525
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,280
pretty competitive don't ever let that shit out of your sight it's trying to

526
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,920
sound like you could just take someone else's home with you yeah does that does

527
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,520
that help sounds like the answer is no just use it with your legs and become

528
00:50:51,520 --> 00:51:00,440
gizmo duck yes we can't keep giving that answer thank you thank you thank you

529
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,360
thank you Sam the person that asked the go-kart question initially asked if they

530
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,960
could have a go-kart if they have one saw just leave one just you did you have

531
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,120
one did you eat one yet I'm actually like savoring it I'm kind of having a

532
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,040
good time just an eating goat in fact you know what actually Sam never mind

533
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:22,720
these are our go-karts I'm really sorry yeah Gabriella hello hi you sent many

534
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:28,040
sentences which we frown upon and now we will shame you publicly no they were

535
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:32,060
good sentences though basically there's a fish tank pickup you're looking to

536
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:41,800
make with baggage yes go on so I grew up with fish and I really want to in the

537
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:47,960
scene this is like a raise my wool scenario or you don't reverse limp it

538
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:55,160
okay we gotta remember tonight we got to make a good impression so I really want

539
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,240
a fish tank but I'm kind of lazy and cheap so I'm not gonna put in the money

540
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,360
or the effort to actually do it myself yeah it's a lot of fucking work sounds

541
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:11,920
like another amazing is in the works listen I would take great care of them

542
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,320
yeah I'm sure no doubt so my brother is giving his away the only issue is I have

543
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,440
to take the fish that he is giving away as well and I really don't want them and

544
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,920
I don't know what to do with them I would rather just pick my own cool fish

545
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,160
yeah yeah fish his fish suck they suck and I don't know like they're real

546
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,240
they're real betas

547
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,280
proud of you is the problem that they are not good kinds of fish or that the

548
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,640
fish themselves have bad attitudes bad attitude isn't it yeah what are we

549
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:56,240
talking about what kind of fish they are sucker fish sucker fish wait hold on

550
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,000
there those are those are nice to keep the tank clean but we don't like we're

551
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,040
not here to critique real faces and fish right what kind of fish are you looking

552

569
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,600

570
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,400
doing it in the first part of the show but then when we saw you send it in for

571
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,360
this part of the show we're like there's that's details we gotta fucking say the

572
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:48,960
sentence how do I get my boss to stop yelling frog bar at me okay so there's a

573
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,640
bit of history to this fucking of course there is Tanner so I'm in a design

574
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,880
course in which one of our projects was to create a hypothetical business yes we

575
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,500
were gonna designs like advertisements and social media for right so we

576
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,880
initially thought about cat cafe but someone mentioned something about frogs

577
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:17,840
and we decided to make a frog bar okay my design teacher is married to my boss

578
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,840
we presented the project she loved it so much she kept telling my boss about it

579
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:31,440
okay and now every time my boss sees me he'll be like hey frog bar yeah also

580
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,400
your boss has forgotten your name but remembers the kick-ass frog bar idea

581
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,960
because I'll remember frog bar for the route I'll be on my deathbed like frog

582
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:45,760
bar right but what does it mean hey what's a frog bar Tanner no wait don't

584
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,760
could be yeah obviously is there a frog theme bar yeah better answer we had like

585
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:59,880
their senior frogs there's frog land USA and Ironton Ohio those are the two right

586
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:06,720
so other answer is it's a place where you can go and really be a frog sorry how

587
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:10,760
do you figure well you know how you're looking around you're like frogs got it

588
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,800
good you know they just sit around all day it's like a it's like a fart it's like a

589
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:23,400
frog action roleplay yes it could be a fart uh it could be a bar where they

590
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,760
serve different kinds of delicious frogs in different preparing different no

591
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,760
Tanner saying no to that one not that okay I know that's the listen in princess

592
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,440
and the frog the animated feature film I think we can all agree the curves you

593
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:45,680
they gave those frogs are this world and I don't have a follow-up to that it's

594
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:52,240
just something I wanted to say out loud in front of an audience of friends those

595
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:59,240
were those were some filth absolutely not

596
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,120
Tanner free us what's a frog bar so mostly it's just a frog themed bar but

597
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,720
we did hypothetically create like a side room where you could play with frogs if

598
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:19,920
you were several tears of interactivity if you've got the money we've got the

599
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,920
frogs baby the more you pay the more stuff they'll do

600
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:42,120
you're not a cop right okay you're to tell us if you're a cop what

601
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:47,560
Tanner what what you had to come up with a better bar idea than frog bar this

602
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:52,640
obviously that's not the the quality of frog bar is not the fucking problem no

603
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,560
I'm saying if Tanner has a better something that is stickier than frog

604
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:05,560
bar for the boss which it sounds like very little would be yeah I got nothing

605
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:10,760
you got an open frog bar Tanner yeah Tanner your dream come true yeah if you

606
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,960
make frog bar then you don't have to see your boss sitting oh there's good yeah

607
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:20,020
open frog bar and then you have a new boss it's you and you can hang a sign

608
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:25,000
you can hang a sign on the outside of frog bar with a picture of your boss on

609
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,320
it that says like this boss is not allowed inside of this guy's a real

610
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:36,000
frog you don't go to frog bar right oh Tanner there's a huge audience for frog

611
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:43,000
bar does that help sure yeah sure yeah we just changed your life is all golly

612
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:50,920
god it's like Tony Robbins is up here all of a sudden he said not shitty Jenny

613
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:57,880
last last audience question hello Jenny hi Jenny the question you sent in is I'm

614
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,800
living in someone's attic and don't know the etiquette of bringing home a suitor

615
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:08,880
teehee the teehee really sold it by the way now right off the bat I have one

616
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:14,040
question the person knows you're living in the attic right yeah this isn't like

617
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:20,880
a parasite situation no fantastic not quite okay so not quite

618
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:28,400
no she knows I live there okay her rent okay she owns the home okay it's an old

619
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,480
home I don't know I feel like you can hear everything there she has a child

620
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,520
when you enter no hold on can you say that last part again but louder for the

621
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:43,200
audience at home she has an eight-year-old child eight years old okay

622
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,760
they're so they know these kids they have the Internet okay now is it the

623
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,720
kind of thing where in order to get to your attic abode you have to go through

624
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:57,440
the house yes okay so there's no way there's not like a ladder that you slam

625
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,840
up through the window like Sam from Clarissa explains it all Jenny hate to

626
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:03,680
bring down the mood but you really should have a fire ladder if you're

627
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,120
living in the ad yeah in case of emergency do you have an egress in case

628
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:17,920
Swift egress some way to get out I know that you love sex and stuff but this is

629
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:23,480
really I don't want it if you're lighting candles or sitting the moon in

630
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,440
any way like down like putting some silk over a lamp or something that's so

631
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,040
dangerous fire escape ladder huge something that unrolls in preferably

632
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,520
seconds would be probably talk to your friend that owns the place about your

633
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,240
escape plan and the numbers that you would and where the meeting places and

634
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:43,520
if you want to establish a code word a code word would be great okay that's

635
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:48,280
also good to set up a code word with suitors yes don't make it the same code

636
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:56,920
word has is this it has your has the homeowner said something about this

637
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:01,480
before is this a problem that has been brought to you no I have only lived in

638
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:08,280

639
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,080
period of time to live in Kansas City

640
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:19,720

642
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,280

643
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:35,040

648
