1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,060
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Better it's better

8
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,480
Hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother me an advice show for the modren era. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,960
I'm Travis the middlest

10
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,760
Wow, and I'm Griffin Mack. Are you okay? Trav? I've watched the trailer at least six times. I lost count in there

11
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,680
It's it has over 11 million views on

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Wild for this fucking thing. It's not just our people

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,600
It could possibly be just our people watching it 10,000 times. Do we even need to say what it is?

14
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,020
Like what project we're talking VB. It's just MVB MVB. Yeah, no matter who wins we lose

15
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,360
Well, it's my tagline for it whether man wins or beam wins

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,300
We we win actually because we're gonna have a fucking great time watching this flick

17
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,000
Yeah, might if I just play the trailer in its entirety and I'll kind of just oh this is good

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,080
Actually, what's happening? This is good. Hey, I'm not plugged in on Twitter

19
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,540
It's it is impossible that there are people out there listening to this who are over this bit, right?

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:16,300
No, everyone is still deeply. Okay. Okay trailer roughly 180 times. Okay, cool

21
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,980
Okay, so I'll just walk you guys through it and I'll pause where necessary. Okay, okay

22
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,700
All right

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
Okay, we see

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Bean is in

25
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,220
court

26
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,940
smashing glass

27
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
He's burning down buildings

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
And he's in a lot of trouble

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,140
There was this be okay, so now we're rewinding to the beginning of it. He's a house sitter

30
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,540
Now pot could you I I need everybody

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,860
To listen to this line delivery when he I guess is leaving like a voicemail for his daughter

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,060
It is

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,980
the worst

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:21,820
Delivery of a line if you're negative about this, but I don't want to do it. We're not gonna do it Now, okay there he's knocked over a statue because he's trying to swat a bee that is staring him dead in his fucking face. And can we just address like

35
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,180
It's pause can we just address that I feel like the big spoiler has happened just in this trailer and that we know that he is the

36
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
first aggressor

37
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,740
He shoots across the bow first and like and we're supposed to sympathize with this being man

38
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't think I don't I actually I would pause it we are not there is one

39
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,960
Shot a very close-up detailed HD shot of the bee

40
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,760
Very early on in which I would say the bee is

41
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,720
CGI'd very sympathetically very good. Yeah, I look at that face and that's a face that's just like hey

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
I just wanted to say I'm a huge fan

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Rowan if I could get just like

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,720
Fucking in to you. This part is not the most comfortable for me

45
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,560
I have my hand like on the soundboard and on the play button and everything

46
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,280
So if I could just go ahead and make through the next 50 seconds of this bit. Sure. Sure. Sure. Thank you. All right

47
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,140
Okay, now I do have to stop there because he's hit himself in the knee

48
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,560
He's hit himself in the knee with what crowbar trying to kill the bee now

49
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,440
I don't know how mad you have to be to hit yourself in the knee with a crowbar

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,640
But it's very bad. It's if you're using if you're picking a bee killing weapon

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,000
You don't need something that heavy bees aren't that big

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
It's good to go sort of like wide and light like a like a racket of some sort

53
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,120
And how and I would have to assume he's intoxicated in order to make the play of like I'm just cuz because even if he had

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,320
Struck the bee. Yeah, he's still gonna hit his knee underneath right gonna hurt him

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,740
So it's not like the bee moved and that caused the injury pain, right?

56
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,600
The bee would not have absorbed

57
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,600
He might have just lived with the pain if it meant ending that bee and and like rubbing it so deeply into him that he becomes

58
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
All right, everybody shut up

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,320
He's trying to get the bee out he's throwing a pillow at the bee

60
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
There's a dog that's destroying stuff and there's a pan on fire and now he's now

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,640
Okay. Now we do have to talk about the shower sequence. Yes, we do. We do

62
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,240
And like I was really hoping really to Christ's in heaven that I would be able to watch this with my kids

63
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,520
But if I'm gonna see mr. Beans fucking dick

64
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,120
While I'm trying to watch him in the bug life

65
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,640
I don't think that that's something that I'm not ready for my kids to see a

66
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,800
British dick, do you know what I mean or a dick of a dick of any stripe or

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,960
Convex ass or he's ass an asshole

68
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,400
Convex ass and the way he reacts to the bee is like the bee is perving on him

69
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,840
Like always just want to see some dick. Yeah

70
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,520
Okay, so he's naked in there and there's a pretty good chance that in the full show you're gonna see some dick yeah

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's trying to kill with a racket now he's using explosives

72
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,440
It looks like the bee died, but I can't imagine that's right

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,080
And the bees flying up his pants and making him dance to a police officer. He's trying a plunger

74
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,320
That has not worked. I'm

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,320
Going to make that a sound for my soundboard when he says where are you a counterpoint Justin?

76
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,480
Pothole small pothole here. Hi Travis pothole to get in it does work

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,240
He traps it underneath the plunger. Yeah, and then for some reason

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Releases it he can't finish it. He can't all you would have to do is jab the plunger downward

79
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,680
Or simply leave it you can murder the bee through inaction once you have trapped the bee underneath the plunger the air supply is limited

80
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,600
It's not gonna be able to eat the honey. It needs to eat to live

81
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,040
fucking the

82
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,360
Absolute best if one episode was like like he gets it under the plunger, right?

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,840
And then it episode like cut to black credits

84
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,160
The next episode is him with the plunger over the bee in one shot

85
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh waiting for it

86
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,020
Begins to like converse with the bee, right?

87
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,980
Yeah, you brought this on yourself and like I I don't want to listen. I'm going through some stuff

88
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,580
I lost my job, but I haven't been able to take my daughter on holiday for six years. Yes

89
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,380
Check this though. He lets the bee die

90
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,260
Through just through wasting away inside of the plunger and he's like finally

91
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,140
I'm free and he goes to leave the house and the door is locked from the outside

92
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
Oh

93
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:01,180
My god, it tunneled out. No, I'm no Rowan Atkinson then died then dies

94
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,460
Inside he's trapped. There's a lot of air inside a house though. Probably food too. Yeah, it takes a while. Okay

95
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,880
Yeah, now it is time for some fan theories

96
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,980
Fan theory. Yes already has fans you think my fan theory. I got two

97
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,180
Okay, I watched the trailer six times one. There's no bee. That's great

98
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,020
We don't see anyone else like interact with the bee

99
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Right. The bee is all in his head

100
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,420
So he invented the bee well, I wouldn't say

101
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,100
Echoing makes it sound like he's just in your house like a separate room. Yeah, it does sound like you're being visited by

102
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,600
famous famous British comic Rowan Atkinson

103
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
He's hunting you

104
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,800
Yeah, uh, he's he's after me. Um, I

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,080
Would also posit this so the bees are real. That's yes. This is where we're at. That's a fan theory

106
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Very number one, right? This is a moonlight situation. He is the bee and the bee is him and all that stuff

107
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,960
But also number two right there at the beginning right off the bat

108
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:16,100
We see in the trailer the judge is like 14 counts of like vehicular, you know

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
misconduct or whatever and

110
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,720
like arson and all these things and he's like

111
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,160
Well, there was this bee and I think right the way that traditional writing goes we are to be like, yeah

112
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,000
He's not an inventor

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
What now you're the X?

114
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,560
Well, I mean I'm just saying I've seen movies and TV shows is that he has to convince the judge that it's not his fault

115
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,840
It was a bee but I'm sitting here a citizen of the real world thinking even if the judge was like, okay

116
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,300
There was a bee sure you're still up on charges of 14 counts

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Yeah, they're not gonna like

118
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,340
Found innocent because of oh, there was a bee cool. Cool. Cool. I guess I'll let you off this arson charge

119
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,020
That would be an amazing. It was like well, there was a bee

120
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,380
I mean, he's you can't find him a guilt was a bee the bee defense. Of course. Damn it

121
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,380
It's fucked up that this is not interactive

122
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,380
Do you not like?

123
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,580
I think it should be because I just drives you crazy watching and do all this stuff in the trailer and I'm thinking the whole

124
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,460
Time like that's not how I would do it

125
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,460
Do you know like I see him try to hit it with a crowbar and it's like that's not the weapon

126
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,680
I would have chosen give me the option to control

127
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,380
You hit a bee with a pillow a pillow would fuck it up not kill it

128
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,500
But it would definitely damage its membranous wings. Yeah

129
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:44,300
um, where how are we sort of balancing in our head the

130
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:52,340
How much we want to watch man versus be the most amount? That's the most amount nothing

131
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,580
That's the most yeah, that's what's versus. Yeah be

132
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,020
No, just Netflix's propensity for elevating some ungrateful voices. Yeah. No, absolutely

133
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:05,740
Are we balancing this? I'm gonna torrent it. Oh

134
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,020
My god, you you think that there's gonna be enough of us

135
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,220
There's fucking 11 million views on the trailer just that's great. That's great

136
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,300
If our audience alone seeds this thing then it's going to split we need

137
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:26,740
You can't stop the signal fucking Ricky Gervais. You fucking ding-dong

138
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,460
It uh, yeah, I guess this is a good. I mean we have actually been in the this and past

139
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,420
We've been in the room with Netflix a couple times

140
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,140
To ask him if they wanted to give us large sums of money to make art

141
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,300
They pass think that wait that they passed so this is not punitive

142
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,820
But I do think that that particular stream has run dry. That's fine

143
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,820
I can't imagine we're gonna be in any more rooms than Netflix

144
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,680
Which is fine cuz I'd give them a piece of my mind right now. Yeah. Yeah only ten episodes of man versus me

145
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,380
That's the worst thing

146
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:06,380
As a platform that's the worst Justin. I'm glad you brought that up because one of the things I assumed a trailer would reveal is

147
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,220
the deep story twists and turns

148
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,260
That a ten episode series could play with right?

149
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,820
I and I don't want to Apple storage just but Moon I had six episodes and there was a fuck ton of story in there

150
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:27,260
Right. I'm watching this trailer and I'm thinking okay, so he okay. He hits his knee with a crowbar. Got it

151
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,660
He takes a shower

152
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:35,300
Okay, he drives his car bad. He knocks over a statue. Okay. He has a court case. Where's the way?

153
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,580
What's filling up these ten episodes of plot?

154
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,540
It's still that is Travis. I'm so glad you said it because I'll be damned if I can figure out how this is

155
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,500
No, I don't know still can no clue

156
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:57,100
This is ten episodes if you told me they were ten minute long episodes. I still like okay, but still I had a fun

157
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,640
Idea and I don't know the legality of it

158
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,180
But I have also famously endorsed shoplifting in a major way. So this does feel kind of on brand for me

159
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,940
What if we opened up a?

160
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,300
Single Netflix account, uh-huh

161
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:22,640
Upon which one could stream man versus B or I suppose any of the other programs on the Netflix

162
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,520
Channel, I guess it depends on how restrictive you can get with parental controls

163
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,180
My child Jim Murphy to only watch man versus be everything else is far too secular

164
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,720
So we have this we have this one

165
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,080
I didn't notice the deep religious undertones in the movie

166
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,960
We have this one Netflix account and the three of us can share it just to watch man versus B

167
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:55,280
But also we could give it the login information out on the podcast so that anybody could watch man versus B

168
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,560
Whenever they want to how does that? How does that got millions of views on the show?

169
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,080
But here's the weird thing guys. Yeah from one account. Yeah, god. Damn it. What?

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah, I'm just I know what we have to do and it sucks

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,120
I feel like I'm at the Garden of Gethsemane

172
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,680
Gethsemane. Yeah, I'm asking the Lord to take it away from me. Like don't don't make me do it dad

173
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't make me don't make me get up on the cross pops. Please don't make me do

174
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,600
What do we have because I know what we I know we have to do and I don't want to do it

175
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,080
And once I say it

176
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:35,400
I can't unsay a shot for shot remake where a shot for shot remake of the first episode of man versus B star

177
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,080
yeah, it's a shot for shot sweated remake of of

178
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Man versus B's first episode starring us and we actually have to we have to so hard it is so hard

179
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,760
For the three of us to get together. Yeah to create

180
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
an

181
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,400
sort of

182
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,620
licensed

183
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,240
Intellectual property things that will be in any way

184
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,640
Lucrative and at the very least won't lose us money in a court battle with Netflix and also let's just use the word watchable

185
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,760
What watch it? Yeah, it pleasurable. Yeah, I

186
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,800
But we have to write we have to do it

187
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:19,280
I think because I'm worried about giving Netflix the like boy kind of see how bad it is views. Well, don't worry

188
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,180
Have we got we're the mr. Pibb to their dr. Pepper. I

189
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Feel like you guys know

190
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You guys are not appreciating

191
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,040
The unity the great sense of unity that could come out of the world sharing one Netflix account

192
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
just to watch man versus B

193
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,840
I feel like we jumped over that idea and I thought it was a really really good one. No, no, no

194
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,680
It's that's extremely powerful. I'm saying that has to be step one because you're not gonna get anything out of our remake

195
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:55,280
Mm-hmm, if you're not, you know, like if you haven't seen the array gotta compare it. Yeah, we gotta compare now

196
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,040
Let me add this joke Griffin just to sweet the pot what everybody can use it

197
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,280
But you can only add one thing to the list just because I really want to see what

198
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
You know a couple hundred

199
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,520
No way fuck that honor system on our system gang only man versus be on our system

200
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,380
I don't want to get in there and see if people are watching too hot to handle season two. Yeah

201
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,980
No, no, you're not watching anything else, but I want to see what the algorithms do

202
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:27,360
With so many different people's ad adding one thing each to the list and the algorithms like I don't know man

203
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,560
Um, yes, we're gonna have to pay for it with some sort of fucking

204
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,300
Like best buy gift cards, so we don't get our shit

205
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,960
completely ripped off

206
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Hi, my name is Justin I'm calling for some personal information

207
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,720
But I think there's I think this idea has got legs until of course

208
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,880
Amanda

209
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,560
Sends us on slack immediately after hearing this saying you can't do that. She won't even let us spin

210
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Oh, she probably will actually

211
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,600
Amanda doesn't exactly work the way like real bosses do she'll probably force us to make the man. This is true

212
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,040
Cop she is that prevents us from doing things

213
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,040
She is the one that forces us to follow through on our dumb shit like smoking an entire card

214
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because sometimes like you mentioned goger in a show and a man is like

215
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,240
Okay, send the runner to go get a box as a go-kart or whatever

216
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,560
Go-kart on stage and that's why we hired her really we want the image

217
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,200
We we basically we're like 13 year olds being babysat by a 14 year old. There's

218
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,280
Illusion of

219
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,700
Responsibility, but if an idea is good enough the 14 year olds like I mean, yeah, we can go but yeah

220
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,480
What your friend has fireworks, I guess as long as they do it outside, right? That's what we that's what we're going for here

221
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm loving this. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'm also okay with posting it to tick-tock 30 seconds at a time

222
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Yeah, that'd be a hard to parse

223
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,880
Popped up in your algo. Well what happens there because I don't know if you guys have ever seen this

224
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,320
You can do that and it just says like part, you know, 18 or 400 and that you just have to have occasionally

225
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,980
Like the the tick-tock voiceover bought pop in and be like the man hates the be

226
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,720
Yeah, man, I'm sorry the statue trying to kill the be for some reason

227
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm betting there's a lot of scenes with no dialogue in it

228
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:40,240
So I think we'll be cool sure as long as we do the dialogue ourselves and that is something we that's a remake we could

229
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,180
We're gonna need a big costume

230
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:49,000
Early. Yeah, or we could just make one out of like, you know the pipe cleaners and like pom-poms, right?

231
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,040
And it's we just or you know what?

232
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,720
We'll save money. We'll do it on a tennis ball right and paint it green and then we'll put the VFX in later, right?

233
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,560
We take a tennis ball we paint black stripes on it. Oh, that's a be now that is now a be

234
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,480
I guess it does depend on how much because we do have that one really emotive scene of the be

235
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,920
Yeah, so I'll have to see once we watch the first episode now

236
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,640
Listen, I got to tell everyone at home the turnaround time on this is not going to be fun

237
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,840
right, it's gonna take us probably with the first episode comes out like three weeks and so then it will be

238
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,560
Probably 2023 before we're able to release our we're gonna have to get it up within 24 hours

239
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,800
I mean like Jesus. Yeah, it's got to be a quick if we teamed up

240
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,380
With every animator we've ever worked. How long are these fucking episodes?

241
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
16 hours. It's wild

242
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,860
Alright shit. Okay. All right. It's gonna be tough

243
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:02,580
Now but to be fair Griffin, it's 30 minutes of episode and then 15 and a half hours of black with just the question

244
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,580
What do you think?

245
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,900
I think that will be easy to handle

246
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,340
14 hours will like to sign up for draft games

247
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,260
Place your bets on man or be

248
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,180
It is it is wild that they've decided to do each episode

249
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:29,260
After the previous episode goes up and people vote for who they're rooting for and then they'll shoot the next episode

250
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,220
But I do appreciate that that's a revolution in filmmaking. It can't be

251
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,140
Can I change the subject? It can't be 10 episodes, right? It can't be

252
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,180
Can't be how okay, so episode 10

253
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:49,560
Can be like a reunion style like talking dead where they sit down with the B and with bean

254
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm betting episode 6 is like one of those like clip show episodes where it's him like remember

255
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,580
Yeah from the first five episodes of like the times he almost got to be it's like a friend comes over and goes so wait

256
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:07,420
Tell me again what happened and then we're just seeing that's what happens at the end of season episode 5

257
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,180
Somebody's like coming what's been going on?

258
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:15,220
So then the next five episodes are just a repeat of the first episodes with him occasionally reading

259
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:21,940
So then I decided to it needs to be like walking dead is where if you leave the room to go get popcorn

260
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,260
You come back and you're like, what the fuck is all this now? Who's that guy? Who's this guy with the bat?

261
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
What's going on? Why is he so angry?

262
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,940
We're the zombie angry. Why are there any zombies anymore? Who's pregnant with what now?

263
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,660
Now we're talking I've reached the I've reached the limit. Okay

264
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,080
We have to respect it. It's the closest we've got to a safe word

265
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
We got to respect it

266
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,980
Were you about to talk more about me versus be after I just established we do have to respect it

267
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,460
I know but I okay. No Travis. You're right. You're right. You're right. We're done. Let's play the outro. Where are you?

268
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,900
We need another clip of him just saying oh, there you are. That is that is the most primal it's amazing

269
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,700
Okay, how is it ten episodes long?

270
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,100
How is that not the last that has to be the last like?

271
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,140
Okay, as long as Justin broke it. He has demonstrated. He should not take a child on holiday

272
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,300
He is irresponsible. He is not he should not be allowed around other human beings. Let alone

273
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,500
Okay, it's the B limit B limit

274
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,460
My husband and I recently moved out of his grandmother's house where we've been living for the last two years without her knowledge

275
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:39,140
She's a bit of a pack rat. So during our time there were we worked on cleaning out her basement a few months ago

276
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,780
She mentioned trying to find some plastic wine glasses with grapes on them

277
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,460
But they used to be in her basement

278
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,020
The problem is we definitely threw those wine glasses out while we were cleaning

279
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,540
She has since mentioned these glasses at least five times and said she wants to give them to us for use by our new pool

280
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,780
Brothers, what do we do?

281
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,020
Do we fess up to having tossed the glasses every time she asked about them?

282
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:05,460
We say hmm number seeing them maybe they're in the attic. She searched the basement multiple times looking for them. Help us brothers

283
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:12,380
Oh, well, it's from spring cleaning in South Jersey. How old is she? She's looking around the basement looking for the glasses like

284
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,020
Oh, we're gonna get a lot of mileage out of that one, huh?

285
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,940
How old is grandma I might not be a problem

286
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,660
Patrick mackerel

287
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,780
Talk like that. We don't talk like that

288
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,100
Could you come up with the promise is plastic?

289
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:36,460
But if you could come up with an undeniable reason for what like oh they were covered in mold, right?

290
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,220
That's always the leak and that's not gonna work. It's plastic, right?

291
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,500
What if you can come up with a reason of like, oh, yeah

292
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:49,220
I saw those they're cursed or whatever like I don't know what works with plastic. You can't the problem is

293
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,500
You I was on board with you Trav and trying to have a little bit of harmless fun. Uh-huh until I read the line

294
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,900
She searched the basement multiple times. Oh, yeah. No, it's too late now

295
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,380
It's too late now to do anything where you have had any knowledge that you did not share with your old grandmother

296
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,540
Correct, because it's mean. Yeah, it's mean now to not share to cut to reveal it

297
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,260
Later would be to especially since it's a very specific

298
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:23,900
Ask like yeah plastic wine glasses with grapes on them. That's not like oh the plastic wine glasses with grapes

299
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,020
You can't do the fake realization later. That was so specific

300
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,180
now if you ever if anyone at home ever runs in this to into this again, it's too late for them, but

301
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,500
Say they were broken and you threw them away or that you broke them and threw them away

302
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,260
Because the thing being broken that's accidental and they're gonna be upset about it, but they're gonna be upset that it happened

303
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,380
But if you're like, oh I looked at those perfectly good plastic wine glasses with grapes on them

304
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,100
And I said this is garbage now. Yeah, that's a choice you made and I hit you all with another idea

305
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,080
Okay, she comes to you. She says where's those wine glasses with grapes on them?

306
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,180
I it was going to be a very special gift

307
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,980
it was a special gift for me and I want to make it a special gift for you for the pool times and

308
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,620
You look down and you look really guilty and say nothing and then grandma's gonna be like

309
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,340
You need to tell me now what has happened and you just look up and you say we

310
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,220
We antiques road showed it and oh you did what and be like I took it

311
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,380
I antiques road show cuz I thought it'd be worth a lot of money and they took it and I sold it and they only

312
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,380
Do five dollars and then you give your grandma five dollars

313
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,020
Now Griffin, have you watched your antiques road show because that's not how that works

314
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,660
You don't hand it to them and they say okay. Let me see what I can get for it. I'll be right back

315
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,740
They're like this is worthless, but I do want I'm so I'll give you five bucks for right now you walk away

316
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,380
One half of the convention center that's for the shit and the other half for people looking to buy shit

317
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:55,980
They're like, okay. Hold on one second. What's this? It's a tiny porcelain unicorn one second. Okay, I got a tiny porcelain unicorn here

318
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:02,780
For me you give me 15 bucks great. Hey, it's worth 15 bucks. It's worth whatever someone's willing to pay for

319
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,620
I thought you're gonna go with our grandma bad news. I sold the pool to buy you these new glasses

320
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,300
But then you don't have the glasses

321
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,140
No, I sold the glasses so we can have enough money to move out right there that deck you're standing on that's the glasses

322
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,820
That's that door you opened. That's the glasses the couch. That's the glasses. It's every search up

323
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:31,540
You know if you go I'm looking right now on on on Etsy at four plastic wine glasses with great detail

324
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,300
How much girl they're 40 bucks and that's probably I mean, that's not great, but you fuck living there

325
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,380
That's the panel fucked up. You've been living there rent-free. I'm not saying you try to replace them

326
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:50,620
I'm saying you say I think it's very sad. You can't find these glasses that you want not a lie. That's accurate

327
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah, you know to try to cheer you up. We bought some new

328
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,100
Some new ones to replace them. Yes. Oh damn, but she's gonna give them to you. Okay, okay

329
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,420
That doesn't even make sense what I just here. Let me try this. Let me try this

330
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,300
Hey, I really appreciate the thoughtfulness and looking for the glasses

331
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,940
But the time spent looking for those glasses could be time

332
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,740
We're spending together and that's way more worthwhile to me need to let the glasses go

333
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,420
Thank you so much grandma for working on the glasses, but you know what?

334
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,780
I'd rather just spend that time with you while we have it left because grandma you're getting old travel. Okay. No way

335
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,700
Yeah, sorry. Sorry. No, she doesn't need that stress. Oh, she doesn't need the stress. Hey, can we said can we heal the wizard?

336
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:44,280
Okay starting it this is a cool one it was sent in by Adrian Cowles back in the fucking game Adrian welcome back

337
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,880
I haven't heard their name

338
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:57,360
Asian cows been dead long on for a year. You haven't been around the cows, please. Have you I wouldn't

339
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Listen

340
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,360
By the side of the road you say

341
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,840
When the moon she was fully oh, no, I wouldn't stop for nothing

342
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,920
All right, so they're not lonely stretch a road out behind the podcast

343
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,920
No, no, no ever. No one ever goes back there. Can we it's an old saloon where we make the podcast and we be serious now

344
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Sure, that's my favorite line from the movie. Sully starring Tom Hanks. Hey, can we stop farting around man?

345
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,360
You hate those words and I gotta fix it. I could quote it. What's your favorite Sully?

346
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:41,280
The one where it's like they're like doing the trial for Sully this movie beats ass and then they're like

347
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,720
and so you should have known you could have made it to the runway and

348
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,960
They give him a real hard time in the whole time. So he's just sitting there like mm-hmm

349
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,800
Mm-hmm, and then after they finish giving him a shit time

350
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,920
He looks up and he's like can we be serious now? It's like oh you took my breath away

351
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,360
Tom Hanks Sully Sully for a second

352
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,720
I thought you we're gonna say that the quote was this movie beats ass and just in the middle of Sully Tom Hanks breaks character

353
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,080
It looks at the camera. It's just like this movie beats race your asses. I'm about to drop a dope one

354
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,880
this is a dual engine loss at 2800 feet followed by immediate water landing with

355
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,880
155 souls on board. Yeah, you can't

356
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,840
One so dope anyway

357
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Yeah, okay, so that's my favorite

358
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,920
156 and here is a question or a wiki house ended by a drink house. Thank you

359
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,360
It is how to build a memory palace. Thank you. He really does say can we get serious now? Yeah, I know

360
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
How many times have you seen Sully?

361
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,200
It's amazing. I've never seen it. Is it good? Are you kidding me?

362
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,160
Podcast over movie. Sorry guys. I'm busy Travis Travis

363
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,120
155 souls no one's ever prepared for anything like that

364
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,200
155 souls like 30 geese. I saw him get a shuttle back to earth. I don't care about a plane

365
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,280
Okay. All right. So anyway, just a man. It's just he's just a man doing his job Sully. Yeah

366
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,920
People do their jobs all the time. I'm gonna tell I'm gonna tell Griffin David. You haven't seen Sully

367
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,560
They're gonna fucking flip out. There's a lot of movies. I haven't seen that they like. Yeah, but this one's Sully

368
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:22,000
This is Sully. It's a big Sully. I'm not saying I'm unsullied Travis. Can we be serious now? Yes

369
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,160
Okay, one of the most useful memories one of the most useful memory aids was created thousands of years ago by the ancient Greeks and the

370
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,760
Memory palace and the memory palace a place in your mind where you can store information that you need to remember is still relevant today

371
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,100
It's not it's used not only by world record-holding memory champions

372
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,360
But also by famous detective Sherlock Holmes with a little pan and Patrick Jane on the mentalist by the way, and the mentalist

373
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,360
Yes

374
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,440
I can bring up the mentalist for a reason and not just

375
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,480
Great references to it. I'm halfway through season five guys

376
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,160
It fucking kicks ass with a little planning and practice you can build a memory palace, too

377
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,880
So Justin has a memory palace. Did you juice?

378
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,640
Yeah, what's it like? Hey, don't be humble man. This is a skill that you have. I want to hear about it

379
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,120
What kind of let's okay. Why don't we go through the steps and you tell me like how you did your little sick fucking?

380
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,720
Twisted spin on it. Okay

381
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,240
So method one planning your palace choose a place that can be easily

382
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,800
Visualized as the blueprint for your palace a memory palace must be a place or route that you are incredibly familiar with like your childhood

383
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:31,680
Home or even your daily commute to work it can be as small as your closet or as large as your entire neighborhood the important things

384
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,180
That you're able to visualize the place in your head without actually seeing it in real life. What'd you go with juice?

385
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:43,020
I did the Marshall University Theatre because I spent so much time there in college and growing up that I thought that it would be

386
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
good

387
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,660
That's good. That's good

388
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,900
J-man

389
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:55,580
You can be serious. Can we be serious now? You can't be serious serious now Travis. Don't you fucking come here and quote?

390
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:04,020
Well, now I feel like I've seen it. Here's the problem guys. It's like I already know what happened. So like spoilers. Yeah, I would say

391
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,100
Using this metric place that can be easily visualized and I'm like incredibly familiar. I would have to say the gym like the weights

392
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:18,100
The weight bench lifting area of the gym. See for me, I think it's it's probably you don't let me finish

393
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,740
Oh good. Go ahead. I'm just saying the grit of the bar. Yeah, the gym. Yeah the feel

394
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,160
Okay, this is the way on your fingers wet on the leather. Yeah, I can put a lot of memories into that

395
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,940
Yeah, mine's gonna be probably the Jimmy John's I worked out at six months

396
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,740
Probably like just the condiment bar just the topping bar. Yeah

397
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,820
So now to be fair, I never made a single sandwich in the entire six months

398
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,360
I was there

399
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,140
Yeah, because I just kept saying I don't know how to do it and they would say like well, there's no time to train you

400
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:50,140
So go work the register. What's this in the lettuce? It's all the state capitals, right?

401
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:56,880
Excellent. Excellent. Let me get a sandwich with all the state capitals and the lyrics to every Bruno Mars song. Thank you delicious

402
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Walk through your palace to define a route

403
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Decide how you'll travel through the palace in your mind rather than just picturing a fixed place for example

404
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,620
Instead of just imagining your house imagine how you'd walk through it. Do you enter through the front door?

405
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,300
What hallway do you walk down?

406
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:13,420
Begin to practice your route now will make it easier to later memorize later on too. Okay

407
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,980
Between all the different weight benches the turbo flex

408
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:23,020
The super flex there's not a lot of great ways to name I'm gonna use a bow flex

409
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
No, they don't do those anymore

410
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,260
Not after the accident

411
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,140
Little sorry at the gym I go to little boy came in try to do the bow flex

412
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
But then it shot him through the ceiling

413
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Beautiful arrow. Can I tell you the catch-22 the problem here the irony?

414
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,460
Yeah, I want to create a memory palace, but I can't remember any location well enough to do it

415
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,700
Well, that's yeah, I mean that's can you gosh?

416
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:54,180
Can you do a place you kind of remember to create a better memory for your prime?

417
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,820
Location, you know, maybe if I do a small location like a bathroom, right? My favorite bathroom

418
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,840
Yeah, I choose to use whenever possible and that is the memory palace for creating my memory

419
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,900
timeshare for your main place

420
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:15,980
Yeah, that can be cool. I used I used the theater department to learn all to remember all Shakespeare's place and

421
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,500
And you'd be shocked at how rarely that skill is really that that useful

422
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,280
Can you name them now just use that skill now?

423
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,880
So I would you I would close your eyes

424
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,660
You know when you walk in on the dock the loading dock

425
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,780
Yeah, the loading dock right after his entrance the crew entrance

426
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,380
Yes, either go through the crew entrance and there's two guys that are holding up flags greeting you as you go up the ramp

427
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,260
There's the two gentlemen front. Okay, because it flags up easy

428
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:48,660
Okay, and then you go up and you're scared when you're on the ramp because there's a little mouse there

429
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,660
Mmm, and I'm like, oh that's a mouse hunt

430
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,300
That's taming the show. So it's a little mouse there. I'm not a shrew

431
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,860
Okay, go on now and then that also only works for you because you're afraid of mice and sons

432
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:06,020
I'd see that mouse and be like what a great day. Oh mouse on us. And then there's three of Griffin's sons. They're greeting

433
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,020
That's my three sons have of

434
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,460
six on their shirt

435
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,460
Cuz that's Henry the sixth

436
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,100
Part two three. This isn't as funny as I thought it would be and then who's that greeting you on the deck?

437
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
It's well, it's Titus Burgess

438
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,680
He's he's welcoming me in

439
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,480
That one doesn't that one doesn't feel specific to the theater because I don't think Titus Burgess ever spent time

440
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,000
It's it also well, it's just it doesn't it doesn't have to be specific to the theater

441
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Yeah, so like you open the door and there's Al Pacino playing Richard the third and he's and he's behind that

442
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,520
So I'm gonna here's me walking up the ramp to your theater department and I look at the dock

443
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,300
That the loading dock here entrance and there's just like

444
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,600
There's just like 30 dudes. Yeah

445
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,920
And some are holding flags and some look like my children Titus Burgess is there which is exciting

446
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,160
There's just like a bunch of dudes here and you look at that and be like, ah, yes

447
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,760
All my favorite Shakespeare guys here Justin

448
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,680
Can I can I make a small addendum that I think might make this easier?

449
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,640
It might be way too late to adjust Justin's college. Well, you walk into the building, right?

450
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:21,360
And there's a guy holding 38 books and each of the books is one of Shakespeare's plays and you can read the title on the spine

451
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,640
Juice you haven't I imagine use this information a while and maybe you haven't visited the memory palace

452
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,780
Is it all covered in cobwebs and skeletons now?

453
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,320
Somebody else move in and they're like, oh, sorry. I thought I thought you'd like I know

454
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,560
I sometimes it does get a little sticky because I know Titus Burgess is in there somewhere

455
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,160
But sometimes I can't I can't finally find him. I'm like

456
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,560
Hey guys, did we forget to go to the money zone how far past oh shit Griffin, I'm sorry memory palace. We gotta keep yeah, right

457
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,320
Identify specific that we had advertorial

458
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,320
I

459
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,960
Promoting

460
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,000
Ripping off Netflix en masse on such a like a grand scale could be hey guys

461
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:20,840
We did have a couple complaints from advertisers specifically Netflix. Um, let me see here who has not advertised

462
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,640
They called just to say they never ever would

463
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,320
Never yeah, so identify specific locations in the palace to store your information

464
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,720
Think about exactly what you're gonna be putting in your memory palace whether it's a number name or important dates

465
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,800
You need to remember for an exam. You'll story arcade games

466
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,080
You why would you ever need that? Well, I'm imagining it. I've always wanted arcade games in my house

467
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,240
Okay, you'll store each piece of data in a separate location

468
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,000
So you need to identify as many locations as you have data each storage spot needs to be unique so that you don't accidentally mistake

469
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,440
One spot for another Justin. I can't tell if this is an extended bit or not you having a memory palace

470
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,920
It's real. No, it's not a bit

471
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,320
Travis brought it up. That would be a while. Yeah, that's a cold shot

472
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,480
So do you like walk into that you turn to the right as you walk into the theater department?

473
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,480
there's that little kitchen green room chill spot you open up the silverware drawer and then there's

474
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,800
You know and there's just like a you know

475
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,040
Well, I can't think of a single. I can't think of us

476
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,160
There's a big plate of ham when you go into the green room. Yeah, there's a bunch of people falling all over themselves

477
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,760
And like spilling things and it's just a huge mess comedy of air

478
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,380
That's calm. Thank you, and I shut the door right away cuz it's like whoa, I'm silly that yeah

479
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,580
Okay, and then you then you eat a big piece of ham, right? I just Beth did this article was a lot sillier to me

480
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,360
Before I knew that it was a thing Justin actually did now you feel bad

481
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,560
I mean, this is it's hard is this is a technique. This is a real you're stumbled on is the first might I say?

482
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
useful wizard of the cloud useful in so much as

483
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,920
It is useful to remember all the plays that will shake your or state capitals

484
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,680
I assume I haven't done that right but like imagine if I had that one's easy

485
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,640
You just imagine yourself walking on to America in Maine

486
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Yeah, and then you just go kind of zigzag around there and I'm like, okay main that's and then I would say whatever it is

487
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
but you have to explore your

488
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
contiguous United States

489
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,160
Memory palace in real time. So people be like, so what's the what's the capital of Vermont?

490
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,320
You like fucking hold on Montpelier. There's it. Well, hold on. I gotta get on a train

491
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,400
It's gonna take me like three and a half hours to tell you what the capital of Vermont is

492
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Ask me again tomorrow

493
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,000
Practice vision. I'll have three or four of them by that. Definitely. Uh, yeah, I don't want to do the rest of this

494
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,800
I don't think

495
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Let's go the money zone

496
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,880
You got a food. Okay, you look at yeah yummy

497
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,560
But wait before you ate it. Did you look and say whoa, this is a little bit imperfect

498
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,800
I would never say that I'm not allowed look

499
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,640
Then you look at the hand holding it and you see some small lines of a and you're the cousin and a stray hairs

500
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,040
And then it's like, you know what? Maybe I'm imperfect too. You know what I mean?

501
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,040
I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect

502
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,040
I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect. I'm not perfect

503
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,780
You know what? I mean? Like aren't we all imperfect and shouldn't we be seeking that out? Not me

504
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,160
You want to reduce food waste you want to save time on grocery shopping and eat more fresh and delicious food

507
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,280
Crunchy if they're supposed to be you know, or sweet if they're supposed to be what if that's the imperfection?

508
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,440

Do you guys ever think about like in the grand scheme of things if there's a multiverse and every decision in action?

520
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,800
We've ever taken branches into you know different possibilities that

521
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,160
Somewhere that there is like a perfect version of yourself and maybe it's not that you've made every decision perfectly

522
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,720
But rather that the decisions you've made and the choices you've made have led to what is the ideal version of yourself?

523
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,920
And then you think I think that's me. I think I've done it

524
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,080
Well, whether you'll be traveling abroad connecting in a deeper way with family or just have some free time

525

Battle teaches bite-sized language lessons that you'll actually use in the real world, which is really exciting. It's always better

526
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:39,040
What did the first thing? Why what did the first thing have to do? Oh, it's not connected at all

527
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,720
It's just a thought that I had in my brain about myself that I really wanted to share because Justin mentioned being imperfect

528
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,540
I don't think I am so babble is great because it's like, you know

529
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,280
We all need to be able to like try out new things and you know

530
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,920
The world is getting bigger and bigger every day, right?

531
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,960
But I'm also smaller and smaller of the planet is swelling with mood slime

532
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,920
I mean that is how oh, you know, the the ever-expanding universe works

533
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,160
We are getting bigger in real time

534
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,240
But also we're all connecting more and more making the world smaller smaller

535
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,560

Hi, I'm Dan McCoy, I'm Stuart Wellington and I'm Elliot Kalin and the three of us host the flop house

545
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:10,900
It's a podcast where we watch a new bad movie and then we talk about it

546
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,540
Dan you say it's hosted by the three of us

547
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,860
We've had a lot of great guest co-hosts like Gillian Flynn Jamel Bowie

548
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,420
John Hodgman, Jessica Williams, Wyatt Sinak, Joe Bob Briggs, Josh Gondelman, Roman Mars

549
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:25,180
Yeah, and you said new movies, but what about the time we didn't meatballs too? Okay. Okay

550
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,340
Yeah, sometimes we do older movies and sometimes we have guests

551
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:33,460
But mostly it's about us talking about like recent bad movies and don't forget about the ones where I made you do a role-playing game

552
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:39,040
Where you played cartoon dogs? All right. Yeah, shouldn't a promo be a really simple explanation about what our show is about

553
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,860
So what's the show about Dan? What's it about? What's it about? It's about friendship. All right

554
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,640
It's about our friendship and how we love each other the flop house

555
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,620
It's a podcast mostly about bad movies on maximum fun

556
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,340
Do you sometimes wonder whatever happened to the kids at your school who really loved Star Trek

557
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,720
You might remember a kid like me the one who read the Star Trek novels and built starship models

558
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,340
I also took music classes to avoid taking gym classes that required showering after but I don't see what that really has to do with

559
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:13,980
Or a kid like me. I introduced myself to kids at my summer camp one year as Wesley

560
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,020
But when the school year started and some of those kids were in my new class

561
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,740
I actually had to explain to my friends that I had tried to take on the identity of my favorite Star Trek character

562
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,140
The shame haunts me to this day. I'm sure some of those Star Trek fans from your childhood grew up to have interesting and productive

563
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,920
Lives, but we ended up being podcasters on the greatest discovery

564
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,620
You'll hear what happens to to lifelong Star Trek fans who didn't grow up to be great people

565
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,780
It just grew up to be people who have jokes as much as they love Trek

566
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:49,180
So listen to our new episodes every week on maximum fun. Org or wherever you get your podcasts

567
00:45:53,260 --> 00:46:00,560
Diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy diggy. Sorry diggy diggy diggy. I want a munch

568
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,560
I want a munch.

569
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Buh buh buh buh buh.

570
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
Bebebibebebe.

571
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,860
I want a munch.

572
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,860
BAD!

573
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,500
Buh buh buh buh buh.

574
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,660
Bah bah bah ba bah bah bah bah.

575
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,660
Bieber.

576
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,660
Yes?

577
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,660
What?

578
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,660
He's back.

579
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,660
Bieber's back?

580
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,660
Where'd he go?

581
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,100
Bieber's back in Big Way.

582
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:20,600
With a new Tim Hortons collab.

583
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:26,240
Wait, is, is it- I thought there was still a Tim Hortons Bieber collab going on?

584
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,840
It's back, baby.

585
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,360
It was a limited time offer.

586
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,120
Tim Biebs are gone.

587
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,160
They're a thing of the past.

588
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,480
You know how you've been missing them

589
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,720
and can't find them lately?

590
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,600
That's because they're gone.

591
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,720
When did they go away?

592
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,640
I feel like we just talked about it like three weeks ago.

593
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:43,000
The first part of the Tim's X Justin Bieber collab

594
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,360
was focused on Justin putting his own spin

595
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,120
on his favorite treats at Tim Horton's

596
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,000
Bite Size Tim Bits Donuts.

597
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,520
For the second collab,

598
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,080
Justin and Tim's decided to develop a new twist

599
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,540
on what the iconic brand is best known for,

600
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,660
brewing the perfect cup of coffee.

601
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,100
Can I tell you guys something?

602
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,340
I'm starting to suspect,

603
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:06,340
and I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theory person

604
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,140
here, but I'm starting to suspect

605
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,820
that this is actually not born out of a shared love

606
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,580
and respect between Justin Bieber and Tim Horton's,

607
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,580
but rather some kind of money-making scheme.

608
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,340
You sound, can I say, Travis,

609
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,940
I'm gonna try to put this kindly,

610
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,660
you sound so fucking stupid right now.

611
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:25,780
You haven't even heard what he's done.

612
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,620
And you're immediately, you are shitting on it.

613
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,180
I'm just saying that it's possible money changed hands.

614
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,140
Okay, I'm gonna take you, Travis, into the process.

615
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,060
Okay.

616
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,420
That's what I'm gonna do.

617
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,820
Yeah, open my, please, I would love to be proven wrong.

618
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,740
In product brainstorms,

619
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,540
that's what you do when you're working,

620
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,820
with the Tim's team, Justin shared

621
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,300
that he prefers his coffee on ice,

622
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:52,220
which led to working on a new flavor

623
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,780
of Tim Horton's cold brew.

624
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:57,340
Also inspired by a slight sweet tooth

625
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,820
and his love for hints of delicious flavoring.

626
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,940
Nothing crazy, nothing crazy.

627
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:04,220
A slight sweet tooth and his love

628
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:07,620
for hints of delicious vanilla flavoring in his coffee.

629
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,460
This is very specific, I mean, I'll give you this.

630
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,740
It's very specific.

631
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,900
Don't put too much vanilla on fucking peach.

632
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,420
No, I just wanted you to feel

633
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,580
like the coffee walked by a vanilla factory.

634
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,180
I have always liked vanilla.

635
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,660
We couldn't stop at Tim Biebs.

636
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,300
We needed a Biebs brew too.

637
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:27,740
This is my, this is my Biebs voice, by the way.

638
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,660
We couldn't stop at Tim Biebs.

639
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,940
We needed a Biebs brew too.

640
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,700
And we're bringing both to Tim's next month.

641
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,340
What, both?

642
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,180
This is a long way down.

643
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,500
Doing a Tim Horton's collab has always been a dream of mine.

644
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,380
Now I do have to say, you said that last time

645
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,020
and that dream has been realized.

646
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,860
Maybe leave a little dream fruit on the tree

647
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,700
for the rest of the Biebs.

648
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,340
No, Justin, here's the problem, right?

649
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,300
He got that and he was like,

650
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,420
why don't I feel anything inside?

651
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,260
Maybe it's because I need more collab.

652
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,620
I would say fucking Tim, watch the throne.

653
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:00,020
I think Biebs is like slowly taking over from the inside.

654
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,340
This whole Tim Biebs thing is a fucking Trojan horse.

655
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,460
And eventually he's going to be like,

656
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,180
for my next collab, we're changing it to Bieb Hortons

657
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:08,020
or whatever.

658
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,860
And then pretty soon it's just called Bieber.

659
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,060
This is just like Shaq. Shaq is Papa John's.

660
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,580
Yes. Yes.

661
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:16,460
Pretty soon Justin Bieber is going to plant a phone call

662
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,740
where Tim Horton said the N word.

663
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,580
I don't think that's gonna happen.

664
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:26,540
Do you remember when Shaq ran a disinformation campaign

665
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,580
against Papa John?

666
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,500
What are you on about?

667
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,180
You absolute maniac.

668
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,940
You can't impugn the character of Shaq

669
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:37,460
while un-impugning the character of Papa John.

670
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,420
It's the only thing that makes sense.

671
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,260
No, it's not.

672
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,740
Have you seen his giant eagle statue

673
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,900
of the eagles committing coitus in midair?

674
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,900
How could someone with a giant eagle statue

675
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,260
be a racist man?

676
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,260
I can't believe Shaq did that.

677
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,940
He didn't do it.

678
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,500
I want to be clear.

679
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,420
All three Tim Bieb's flavors,

680
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:04,980
chocolate white fudge, sour cream chocolate chip

681
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,860
and birthday cake.

682
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,860
You know them already.

683
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,820
You don't need me to do that.

684
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:09,100
Birthday cake waffle.

685
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,380
You've got them tattooed on your arm.

686
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,220
We get it.

687
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,820
They're all returning to Tim's restaurants in Canada

688
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,820
and the United States along with Bieb's brew

689
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,940
on June 6th.

690
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,780
Hell yeah.

691
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:20,620
You can get it.

692
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,820
If you're in the US,

693
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:25,060
guests can get a $5 Bieb's bundle,

694
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,140
which is a large Bieb's brew

695
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,820
and a Tim pack of Tim Bieb's for $5.

696
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,260
This has gotten a little distinct.

697
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,580
There could have been more Bieb's in there.

698
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,140
Like you're filling up your car

699
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,340
and it's like, I'm gonna need 10 gallons of Bieb's juices

700
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,180
for my car.

701
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,340
Is that Bieb's or un-Bieb'd?

702
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,460
You want it un-Bieb'd?

703
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,180
Is that un-Bieb'd?

704
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,780
You want it un-Bieb'd or un-Bieb'd?

705
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,500
If you put some Bieb's into the radiator too,

706
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,940
wait, sorry, I'm so fucking confused.

707
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,540
We have Beebium, but it's gonna run you a few bucks more.

708
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,580
Un-Bieb'd or un-Bieb'd?

709
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,940
Are we talking Bieb's bucks or cryptocurrency?

710
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:03,780
Those are the only two things left.

711
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:04,620
He doesn't have an NFT,

712
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,740
he just has the USD is replaced by-

713
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,540
Yeah, that's the only thing we have left.

714
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:09,380
Okay.

715
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,300
It's the year 2020 Bieb's.

716
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,340
They have merchandise and I need all of it.

717
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,940
There's a beanie, a fanny pack, a tote bag

718
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,420
that were developed in collaboration with Justin,

719
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,020
which means they held up a picture of it

720
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:21,980
and he said, yeah, fine.

721
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,860
No, he tested, he took that tote bag to the farmer's market

722
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,180
and he's like, this isn't holding all my rutabagas.

723
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,900
I said 18 rutabagas, Tim.

724
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,020
When guests buy any Tim's X Justin Bieber merch,

725
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,300
they get 50% off a second item.

726
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,940
How's your markup doing?

727
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:39,900
It seems pretty good.

728
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,660
They're doing it at a loss, man.

729
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,100
Bieb's is paying out of pocket.

730
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,820
Tim Bieb's was a huge success,

731
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,100
truly beyond all our expectations.

732
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,660
And what makes it so great

733
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,380
was the authenticity of the partnership track.

734
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,340
That's according to Hope Bugazzi,

735
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:59,820
the chief marketing officer for Tim Hortons.

736
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,380
Even before the Tim Bieb's collaboration,

737
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,620
which they're still sounding very defensive about this,

738
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,180
Justin had often shared with his fans

739
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,620
how he'd grown up on Tim Hortons,

740
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,060
was obsessed with the brand.

741
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,620
That does explain his hit song, I Love Tiny Donuts.

742
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,340
His commitment to working with us

743
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,460
to develop a natural and authentic twist

744
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,940
on the Tim's experience is what made Tim Bieb's a hit.

745
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,140
And we know guests are gonna love Bieb's Brew

746
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:26,580
and his take on Tim's cold brew.

747
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,900
Now, Travis, you're about to be even more embarrassed.

748
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,860
That's not possible, Justin.

749
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,220
Because I'm gonna play for you the commercial

750
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:37,180
for Bieb's Brew, where Bieb's is the last one in the office

751
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:39,860
just staring at a tank of cold brew.

752
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,540
Hello, Pam?

753
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,980
Justin, what are you still doing here?

754
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,020
Job's not done yet.

755
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,460
What do you mean your job's not done yet?

756
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,060
I haven't tried the final product.

757
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,060
Oh, no, that takes 16 hours for it to steep

758
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:53,180
before it's ready, so we can just, you know,

759
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,860
call you back in 15 hours.

760
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,060
Yeah, not a chance I let someone put their lips

761
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,260
on the Bieb's Brew before this guy.

762
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,940
I'm a stay-in.

763
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:01,780
Okay.

764
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,220
Let's put your neck pillow on.

765
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:05,820
Good night, Justin.

766
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:06,980
Don't forget to lock up.

767
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:09,460
Okay.

768
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,020
Dream about Timmy's.

769
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,500
I will.

770
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,340
Love you.

771
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,780
I love you, too.

772
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,140
Okay.

773
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:18,540
I'm glad you said it first.

774
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:21,180
Night.

775
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,100
Manny really loves his Tim's.

776
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,260
Try my French Vanilla Bieb's Brew for a limited time.

777
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,100
Only at Tim's.

778
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,660
It's worth the wait.

779
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:37,620
The fact that they added-

780
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,460
What the fuck?

781
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,500
The last good thing is-

782
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,220
The fact they added that postscript

783
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,740
is an act of cowardice.

784
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,780
Yeah, shouldn't have just left it there.

785
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,940
A truly brave marketing campaign

786
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,900
would have ended it with him

787
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,460
saying I love you to this woman

788
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,540
and then just cut to black,

789
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,980
and it's up to you to figure out what's going on.

790
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:54,820
What do you think happened here?

791
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,340
Can I also just say, bold,

792
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,500
to be like, oh, we're in an office.

793
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,380
What's like a name of a woman who would be in an office?

794
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,220
Pam.

795
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,060
Great.

796
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:03,900
Nailed it.

797
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,820
Pam was the one from the last commercial, Travis.

798
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,460
It's a recurring character.

799
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,020
We're invested in their relationship.

800
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,500
I ship these two.

801
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,340
Pam Biebs.

802
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,300
Okay, small rewrite though.

803
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,380
How great would the commercial have been

804
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,940
if he had been like, I love you,

805
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,300
and she'd be like, what the fuck?

806
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,140
The fuck is wrong with you?

807
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,260
What are you talking about?

808
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,540
Are you okay?

809
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,300
How's your power imbalance doing, Justin?

810
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,620
I don't know what's happening anymore.

811
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:27,540
Shouldn't you be in a studio or going on tour?

812
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,220
What are you doing here?

813
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:30,380
I can't go home.

814
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:31,220
I can't go home, Pam.

815
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,740
This does seem like how these things begin

816
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,740
where it's like, yeah, we did a couple of collaborations

817
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,980
and then all I cared about was doing good at donuts

818
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,980
and now I don't do music anymore.

819
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,860
So that's what happened to Kenny Rogers with Roasters.

820
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,140
That's what's happened to me.

821
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,180
And here we are.

822
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:47,980
Thank you so much for listening to our podcast.

823
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,100
We hope you've enjoyed yourself.

824
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:51,940
I sure had fun with y'all.

825
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:53,540
We're in the month of Man Vs. B,

826
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,900
so we're closer than ever.

827
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,100
Hang in there.

828
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:56,940
Hang in there.

829
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:01,820
We got so much stuff in our fucking merch store.

830
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,140
You're gonna puke when you see all that.

831
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,420
Count Donut Pen.

832
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,220
Got a Count Donut Pen that was designed by Kevin Budnick.

833
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,020
That is so choice.

834
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,380
We got a Taz sticker sheet that's in the same style

835
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,900
as the temporary tattoo sheet already in the shop.

836
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,900
You can't tattoo your laptop,

837
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,180
but you can put a sticker on it.

838
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,780
Those are made by Lynn Doyle.

839
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:21,620
Thanks, Lynn.

840
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,620
And 10% of all the merch proceeds this month

841
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,220
goes to Fairness WV.

842
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,940
That stands for West Virginia.

843
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,540
It's the statewide civil rights advocacy organization

844
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,360
dedicated to fair treatment and civil rights

845
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,580
for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender West Virginians.

846
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,500
It's a legitimately good group

847
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,220
that has done legitimately a lot of really good stuff.

848
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,060
Well, I'd like to assume

849
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,180
that of all the people we've supported, Justin.

850
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,700
No, no, no, no, no.

851
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,660
But this one's really good.

852
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:45,500
Oh, okay.

853
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,180

Not too long now, folks.

866
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,380
We're gonna be in Boston June 17th.

867

That's an Adventure Zone show.

868
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,980
We're also going to be doing a My Brother, My Brother and Me

869
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,140
in Boston on June 18th.

00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:29,540
Then we're heading down to Foxwoods June 19th

871
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,900
for My Brother, My Brother and Me,

872
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,860
maybe some slot action.

873
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:36,580
I mean, we're also going to be in Salt Lake City,

874
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:40,420
Portland, San Diego, Washington, Detroit, and Cincinnati.

875
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,540
So get all those tickets,

876
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,780
mask and proof of full vaccination or negative COVID test

877
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,700
within 72 hours of event start is required.

878
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,780
I also just wanted to say I went and did a Phoenix Fan Fusion,

879
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,140
what, when this comes out, what, like a week ago.

880
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,100
And I just wanna say thank you to everybody who stopped by.

881
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,700
It was great seeing you.

882
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,100
All right, Phoenix, I did not care for like the 104 degree

883
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,460
temperatures, that's obscene,

884
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,460
but I was glad to see everybody there.

885
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,340
I'm sure they've never gotten that before.

886
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,060
It was so hot, guys.

887
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:11,700
And would somebody have the audacity to say to me,

888
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:14,560
well, be glad you're here before it gets hot?

889
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,300
Well, they're- How dare you?

890
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,220
They're different.

891
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:19,020
They have- They're built different.

892
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,540
They're built different. They're built different.

893
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,620
Thanks to Montaigne for the use of a theme song,

894
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,500
My Life Is Better With You.

895
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,080
Check that totally out.

896
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,980
And have a good time with your friends too.

897
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,420
Just like roll down the windows of the car

898
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,860
and like put your arms and legs out the windows

899
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,980
and drive super fast while you listen to it.

900
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,780
Griff, I'm gonna need you to take me out

901
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,580
with a celebrity impression of Justin Bieber.

902
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,940
Trying, no, no, listen.

903
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:42,940
Justin Bieber trying a cold brew

904
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:44,860
that he does not approve of,

905
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,300
and they have to start over. Oh, yes, too sweet.

906
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:50,220
Okay, let me, I'll use my coffee here to.

907
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:55,220
Pfft. Sacre bleu.

908
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:05,500
My name is Justin-

909
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,740
I'm Travis. That's how he really does.

910
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:07,580
That's how he really does.

911
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,900
Watch the documentary.

912
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,940
Yeah. It's been my brother, my brother,

913
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:13,940
me kissing dad's grown lips.

914
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:21,200
My life is better with you

915
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,740
My life It's better,

916
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,700
it's better with you

917
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:31,820
My life It's better,

918
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,820
it's better with you

919
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,940
Is it true?

920
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:39,940
It's better, it's better with two

921
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:51,300
It's better with you.
