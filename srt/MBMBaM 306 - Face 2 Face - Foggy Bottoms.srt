1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,080
Like Chilean miners emerging from the depths to a triumphant round of applause to my brother

2
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,680
my brother me and invite you for the modern era I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:36,080
I'm your middle is brother Travis McElroy I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

4
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,800
they probably they probably applauded like a lot when those miners got out

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,480
yeah I'm not sure you guys Christ sack up to that which if you're in that audience how do

6
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:55,720
you know like when to stop applauding like do you think by like the 33rd one how many were there

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,000
that's an excellent question Griffin because there is like there's a moment where everybody's

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,840
like losing it right because they're like oh the first guy is the first guy is like yes and then

9
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,920
probably about a minor 20 they're like okay but then like 21 comes up holding a puppy and you're

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,600
like yeah and then 29 is like I think we're almost done guys let's bring this one home but

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,600
then after they were all out there had to be a moment at the end of the chair one for everybody

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:33,320
yeah for us we are some snacks where they were like well bye bye I guess go now do something

13
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,320
else like honestly I mean you're still miners you gotta go back to work in the mines like you

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,360
don't have another tomorrow tomorrow I guess not that we're still milking the miners back

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:56,120
yeah and the miners I am already the most sweaty that's comedy ain't easy wash it what I love

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Washington DC I love it I love being in the D anytime I get a chance all this government

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,240
anytime I get to visit the DS I'm psyched about it you guys have an invisible barrier of just a

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:16,640
rich invisible fog of humidity that exists here it's like at this off the sea level and it's just

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:29,680
perfectly my underwear height and now I'm sitting it's face high time about your foggy bottoms it's

20
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,160
a local reverence I saw it on one of the subway platforms I'm saying it's something of a comfort

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,400
to me cuz like I watch TV and I see politicians on TV I think they're so powerful I see like

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,720
Mitch McConnell up there like women shouldn't have library cards and it's like and like everybody's

23
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,480
losing their minds like yeah yeah yeah but then like he walks off stage he's like my gooch is

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
ruined like I know as soon as they go in the back room it's like you're not so powerful anymore

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,240
cuz you're like oh my grindle is soupy like so much baby powder Kevin Spacey mommy Kevin Spacey

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,640

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:25,800
so bad bring me some more of my acting trunks and I don't know well can Kevin Spacey pretending to

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,040
be I don't know why he's still in character when he's not playing Frank Drebben or whatever because

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,760
he is a method method he is method Justin whether he's hot or not he's got a soupy goose and that

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:47,920
is just true we do now we talk more about Kevin Spacey's taint before we get into the questions

31
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,600
and we got we got a lot of fun stuff playing for you this is the usual stuff but it'll be fun we

32

were leaving our names yeah we did that part we did that part who this is still the charming

33
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,480
intro there by license before the question okay we were we were leaving a restaurant last night

34
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,240
after eating dinner I was not here for this and I still do not think it happened Travis has

35
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,000
photographic evidence we leave you a place called Asia 54 I don't know if you've been but highly

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,120
a hundred percent Rob Reiner was zero percent Rob Reiner it was not one of his failed clones

39
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:45,520
okay it was not club Reiner you mean Carl Reiner nobody's nobody's quite sure so we're leaving a

40
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,480
lot of clones have the Jack disease or we're leaving the restaurant and as we are leaving

41

62
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,200
his adulthood to begin going by his middle name while I have no problem with this choice in his

63
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,160
personal and professional life I am torn as to how I should now address him he insists that he

64
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,160
does not care one way or the other should I continue to use his first name or attempt to

65
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,720
break 29 years of conditioning to use the new moniker that's from doubtful designator in DC

66
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:45,560
that would be are you here wait you here like eight different people right yeah how many y'all

got younger brothers who just changed their name is this a rampant okay I need everybody to be

68
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,520
quiet because I don't want to muddy the result I need to know the first name in the middle name

69
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,760
his name okay okay and what's that wait oh I was about to ask last name it was gonna incriminate

76
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,640
room that we don't get once again just the question asker yes or no question was this done

77

111
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,440
don't know their secret handshake I think the answer is like definitely yes like if I was a

112
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:17,440
cop and like I saw like if I saw some of this iconography I would be like I think I'd like to

113
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,120
see what's inside your car maybe this is a reasonable search and seizure because I really

114
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,680
would like to see what's in there maybe they just want to see what it's like from their point of

115
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,000
view like I just want to live in your shoes for a minute how's it going it's like a hieroglyphic

116
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:42,760
the hatchet man is but and it translates to roughly I love drugs and murder and murder drugs

117
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:55,640
I love murder drugs drugs that get me like crazy to murder do you mind if I just in your car to

118
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,240
see how things go over there what I love about this is the other side of this is that there's

119
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,000
definitely an orientation day where some chief of police says people that goes if you see this

120
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,440
hatchet man you will ask to search the car if they say whoop whoop in any form or fashion we

121
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,920
don't know the pronunciation you will ask to see their trunk now if it's just a bumper sticker with

122
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:28,020
Sideshow Bob in it you fucked up you lose your badge for that shit whoop whoop how about how

123
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,480
about another question just yeah hold on activate the iPad oh lock screen should have turned that

124
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,720
off he had a screen saver up our friend believes she has a life-threatening nut allergy but has

125
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:49,520
never been tested everywhere she goes she refuses to eat anything that may have any type of nut in

126
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,680
it however all of her friends think it's just in her head how do we get her tested so we think

127
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:02,000
we all know for sure if she's allergic or not Jesus that's from going nuts for sure and Gabby

128
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,520
hold on y'all here what is your day-to-day relationship with this friend where you're

129
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:22,600
like hey this done they're like no and you're like I'll get you one of these days she doesn't

130
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,880
want to eat nuts it's cool yeah your options are get her to eat a nut or like put up like

131
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,960
a put her in a big bag and like carry her to the hospital where they do the nut test like

132
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:43,400
those are the that's it I'm gonna I'm gonna lean away from the get her to eat a nut one I'm gonna

133
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:51,040
lean away from the big bad one they're both shitty they're like one of these days you're

134
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,720
gonna keep pushing it and pushing it and she she's just gonna say god damn it I don't like nuts okay

135
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,360
and that's shorter to just say I'm allergic because I don't know because then everybody's

136
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,040
gonna be like what about macadamia yeah I don't like those either I don't like any nuts I don't

137
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,920
like the concept of nuts I don't like any nuts I'm not a fan it's only nuts nut allergies are no

138
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:16,080
joke well they're not they're super not unless I think maybe it's fake and then I think we can

139
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,600
make jokes out of it but maybe it's not fake if you don't want us to make jokes about it get

140
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:26,240
the test that's the thing then we owe you an apology what is your friend basing it off of if

141
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,080
not a test I'm just like I look at a nut and I just get a bad feeling okay but flip side what's

142
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,600
everybody else basing it off of where they're like I saw her eat a Snickers one time I was swears

143
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:44,120
so rapper was gone she said it was a Milky Way I don't fucking believe it she threw the rapper

144
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,840
away she's just eating a big log I saw Snickers it could have been a Mounds but I'm pretty sure it was an Almond Joy

145
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:57,840
is your friend here oh shit

146
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:19,400
hey hey wait did you just call us here for nut allergy intervention we love you so much Debbie

147
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:32,320
eat a fucking peanut hey but listen no don't no wait no wait we're on a high-energy show here and

148
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:41,680
there's probably nuts in the lobby and oh tonight's the night tonight's the night time to dance with

149
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:50,920
don't eat that nut it's two to one majority rules I can't go to jail I don't eat the nut

150
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:00,360
let's talk about email composition to a podcast show what are you talking about your friends

151
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:07,800
imaginary nut allergy potentially imaginary because the phrase who will also be in attendance

152
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:24,080
would be fucking rad sadly absent it's too late for this one but if you're coming to if you're

153
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,840
coming to New York tomorrow you're like this guy does he's not gluten intolerant he'll be there

154
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:40,200
though put that second part in cuz like the material party with the most information here

155
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,280
it's a person who thinks they'll eat a nut and die they probably know more about this situation

156
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:57,960
than you do so sorry do what we're doing our best up here okay as long as we're sharing things so

157
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,840
we're recording here live at the we're recording live at the Lincoln Theatre here in Washington DC

158
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:18,680
and it's been alright RIP what RIP somebody asked didn't somebody one of our Lyft drivers

159
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,880
and it wasn't ours ours was cool ours was it Dwight's Dwight your Lyft driver hey everybody

160
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:32,840
it's my friend Dwight Slappy sitting exactly where Lincoln was sitting yeah yeah co-hosting

161
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,520
things about sheets Dwight real quick when you told your Lyft driver you want to go to

162
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:45,960
the Lincoln Theatre what'd your Lyft driver say no no he was not shot here that would have been

163
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:56,480
ironic I think oh man in my own dang theater beans our Lyft driver I'm we're telling Lyft

164
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,040
driver stories now to keep Travis from telling his fucking sad lip I will our Lyft driver was

165
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,480
awesome he was so so great but at some point him and Travis got in this like really deep

166
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,680
conversation about like homeless populations in urban centers and it was like no it was great

167
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,320
is you know it was cool idea I was like I was trying to break it up and he was going having

168
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,920
a really nice conversation one thing though his GPS the voice for his GPS it was T-Pain

169
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:37,240
so try to be like oh man skid row like it was horrible like there's just no respect for I wish

170
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,200
every time that happened trust is like but then the dude would have been like they would just go

171
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:50,560
into the woods and get up it was bad it was a bad juxtaposition hi everybody thanks for

172
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,840
listening to our Washington DC live episode and thank you Washington DC for coming out and making

173
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,680
us feel just just so wet and wild and thank you vice president Joe Biden for standing back in the

174
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,160
shadows and vice president Joe Biden I appreciate the fact you realized this was our night not your

175
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,400
night and if you'd like made some big grand triumphant entrance and you would have overshadowed

176
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,320
us with your giant shadow it would have become your night as you recorded your podcast cup of

177
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,480
Joe we're gonna get through the money down here very fast because I'm sick as fuck y'all got me

178
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,960
sick way to go I'm just kidding probably wouldn't you it's probably you know sky germs up in the

179
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,520
airplane time and I'll see you were licking the subway in New York I was licking the polls but

180
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,440
that's that's how I do it I just was just not fucking here I don't even know where that I

181
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:44,160
believe is talking to the mayor of West Virginia well as we announced that our New York show we're

182
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:52,080
doing a show with see so TV yes and we're gonna be filming it in Huntington so I assume Justin

183
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,120
way to talk to the mayor about that just give my heads up like there's gonna be some camera crews

184
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,280
it's getting a fucking crazy in here yeah we I guess this is our formal announcement on the

185
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,680
podcast proper we're doing a TV show with see so which is a new streaming app with comedy content

00:37:50,160 --> 00:38:02,160
they're also offering brand-new deep dish spaghetti pies it looks exactly how you think it would like

320

a big piece of angel fruit cake made out of spaghetti and frosting cheese so listen and

321
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,800
frosting cheese last summer America fell in love with the breadstick sandwiches when they

322
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:23,120
were debuted at Olive Garden restaurants and on food trucks touring the country we gotta

323
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,720

331
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,320
taking the words of the experts who create food and getting their opinions about scooping

346
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,640
a ramekin of minestrone and a jam it like a shooter so when they asked him who I was

347
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,520
supposed to be working with I said uh the line shifts and that's how I got hired as

348
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,480

445
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,920
the problem is that it is a painting of me um it was done by my my brother-in-law I know

446
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,160
it's great it's great to have a painting I was like four years old just a super cute

447
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:26,340
you know just a painting of my head region um you know so it's just this like painting

448
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:30,860
this like you know bust painting of four year old and I was like super cute oh you're four

449
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:35,440
I am currently four I'm no in the painting you were four yes yes I think we've established

450
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:42,840
there's a painting of you yeah and and I kind of don't know what to do with it yeah for

451
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:50,880
sure no totally right there with you dog super yes because like I feel like if I were living

452
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:54,400
you know I'm living on my own for the first time I feel like if I was living with like

453
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,040
you know husband and kids it could be like up there with the family portraits or whatever

454
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:03,360
but I'm just in an apartment no yes by myself I don't know that I'm gonna have any advice

455
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:10,240
you I'm just like yeah dog that's rough like what you've got is what we call a showpiece

456
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,440
ah and what that means is when someone visits you the first time you have to take them into

457
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,080
a room that's completely empty except for a painting on the wall where you just stand

458
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,680
in front of it and go one day I'll get back there I think you're overestimating my my

459
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:35,880
rent budget where I can just have spare room sleep in your bathroom ah that's the solution

460
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,680
can you put the painting in the bathroom oh like on the toilet like I have to confront

461
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:47,000
it before they little speech balloon it just isn't nice I feel like that's that's disrespectful

462
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,060
to the painting like my brother-in-law did it it's a nice painting he did it was nice

463
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:57,360
of him it was a oh my god is he alive see so yes okay he's get him to well I don't want

464
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:03,360
because I got you okay preemptive get him to paint another one on the same picture of

465
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:12,080
you behind you like today looking on like so proud you're like oh look I did it recursive

466
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:19,520
paintings of myself forever I think you have to have a party where you unveil it to everybody

467
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,920
and then who first of all whoever sticks around that's your real friends but I'm thinking

468
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,920
about it now and like fuck dude if I had something like this in like my first place where I was

469
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,440
living by myself and it was like let's go over to Griffin's place and hang out with

470
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:41,360
this weird painting that's fun like that you could if you can own it's a hard needle holy

471
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:47,280
shit cuz like if it goes if you miss the needle hole then you're fucking Kathy Bates in misery

472
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,400
or something but if you can get it right in there then you've got like the dopest prop

473
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:59,880
comedy like literally ever here's the phrase you have to practice oh that get the delivery

474
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,960
of those two words down and you're gonna miss but then you have like a holiday party at

475
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:08,000
your place you have like a holiday party and you put like a little Santa hat cut out on

476
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,280

490
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:07,840

518
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,640
this hallway okay and it's a old apartment building lots of policies we're not allowed

519
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:21,200
to have pets okay my neighbor has a secret dog oh shit I've heard it I've seen it I've

how big is the dog it's a little it's a small dog this could be anything give me the it's

522
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:46,760

523
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:53,540
night yes during the day especially when I'm coming in and out for work not really how

524
01:00:53,540 --> 01:01:08,240
absolute is your sense of justice judge dread

because it sounds like it might be pretty absolute maybe wait hold on to Emma's credit

526
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,040
I felt like she was asking how do I let them know that I'm cool with it they don't have

527
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:25,800
to how do you get some of that juice on the side like some of that money on Saturdays

a picture of people at home literally every person in this theater was like yes that's

531
