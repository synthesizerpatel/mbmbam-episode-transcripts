1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,720
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:47,760
Hello and welcome, my brother, my brother, and me in the advice show for the modern era.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
I am your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your sweet, innocent, virginal baby, Griffin McElroy.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,080
Griffin, it sounds like you've been having kind of a rough morning in our pre-show.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I don't really want to talk about it.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,480
No, no, say it. What's wrong? What's wrong?

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,880
I just want to see what's wrong. I just want to check on you.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
It's concern. This is the sound of concern. This isn't for the show.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,040
We'll cut this out. We'll definitely cut this out.

14
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,400
As long as you're speaking in confidence, I mean, I do edit the show, so I do have final

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
agency, I guess, over the content of the show. But if you boys must know, I'm feeling a little bit of

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:31,360
the old nip of the gypsy hooch. Your substance abuse is tearing our show apart.

17
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,840
It's not substance. It's not substance. Here's my problem. Here's my problem.

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,160
You're seeing a pattern develop, really. It's just two Saturday recordings in a row.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,120
It is Sunday. It's Sunday. Not like super good, Griffin.

20
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Two Sunday recordings in a row, where it was two birthday parties,

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
day after birthday parties. My problem is when I get in a birthday party atmosphere.

22
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,080
You eat all the cake.

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,320
That's it. You're kidding. But once I have three or four Bud Light Limes in me,

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,600
it's like cake patrol.

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,360
I have a quote for you, Griffin. It seems like there's a birthday party every weekend.

26
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Jimi Hendrix. Okay? That's all. Motherfucker love cake. Think about it.

27
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,880
That's my problem. I eat, and I eat, and I eat, because I don't have that part of my brain that's

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,640
like, you already had a dinner. You don't need to have a second dinner, I don't think. Anyway,

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,120
I'm glad this isn't going in the show, because I don't want that to be my character hook.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,720
The guy who wakes up hungover with terrible diarrhea.

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,320
It's not terrible. It's not terrible. It's not great.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Quantify your diarrhea. It's not ideal.

33
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,080
Welcome to our new podcast, Quantify Your Diarrhea.

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,920
Not ideal. Not the ideal diarrhea.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,880
Not the utopian ideal of diarrhea. Not the tasteful amount of diarrhea.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Conceptually, I don't want to get blue right at the top, but conceptually,

37
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,920
I don't have anything wrong with the idea of diarrhea. In fact, when painted in the right

38
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
light, I think it could be seen as a very efficient way to void your bowels.

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
All right, we're done here. I am a short lady.

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm just saying I'm a busy, busy man, and so-

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
It'd be nice to just be able to hit the power button.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
Spend time, more time with the kids. Less time in the facilities.

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm a short lady, about five feet tall. I photograph a lot of conventions.

44
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm about to start working at a comic slash gaming convention.

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,440
My nose is at armpit level, always. What is your advice for dealing with the gross,

46
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,200
gross assault on my senses that result of very poor hygiene on behalf of thousands of

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,000
wonderful, smelly nerds? That's from Gmail.

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
This is a thing. If you don't-

49
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,360
If you've never been a part of this atmosphere, it is-

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,080
It is a thing. Oh, man.

51
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,800
There, but for the grace of like 10 inches, go I.

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,640
Because if I had to be down in that particular zone, that particular strato layer,

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,920
God damn, though.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,960
I have found, interestingly enough, that individual people at these things don't smell bad.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
I think there's some sort of-

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
It's a miasma.

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
Pharma. It's a miasma. That's exactly right, Trav.

58
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
There are certain notes from everyone's palate that are-

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,080
And as the orchestra of stink comes together, it forms Peter and the Wolf.

60
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,560
There's an-

61
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,240
You just hear the piccolo. This person over here has a timpani.

62
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,360
This person over here hasn't ever worn deodorant in their whole life.

63
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
Do, do, do, do, do, do.

64
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,960
Wash your fucking armpits.

65
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,680
They smell bad. So, so bad. So very bad.

66
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,800
I didn't know there were lyrics.

67
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,120
I guess I learned something on today's podcast.

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,520
I feel like it's not everybody at these conventions.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,560
I don't want to paint with a broad brush.

70
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,800
Just say everybody who goes to shows stinks, because I go to these shows.

71
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,840
Let me say this, though.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,040
It's not everybody, but it's also not always somebody else.

73
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
It might be you.

74
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,120
Interesting.

75
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
Not you, Griffin. I mean, like the you.

76
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,520
If you smell around the poker table and you don't smell the bad smell, you are the bad smell.

77
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,120
You are this bad smell.

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,920
You run into bad smells all day, you are the bad smell.

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,280
If you keep find yourself wondering what is that and you're alone, it's you.

80
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
It's always been you.

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Here's the thing. I don't think anybody should be personally offended by this question.

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,080
I can understand all these guys. These guys are just being so mean about it.

83
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,840
Listen, if you don't smell bad, we got no beef.

84
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,440
You're great.

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
If you do smell bad, get your stink right.

86
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
Get your stink right.

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,680
I mean, I get it.

88
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Like at a convention, you're on your feet all day running around.

89
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,480
It's close quarters.

90
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,320
Sometimes it gets hot up in that piece, depending on what piece you're in.

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, God.

92
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
On the show floor, those things.

93
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
The worst, that would be my first, like, we're offering practical advice.

94
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,680
I know, like, for example, if you're doing PAX East, there's a sky bridge where-

95
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
You gotta avoid those bottlenecks at all costs.

96
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
Oh, yeah. Avoid the bottlenecks.

97
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Get on the sky bridge and take shots of the show floor from there.

98
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
They're gonna look very dramatic.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,560
And if you get a zoom lens, you'll never have to go down there.

100
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,480
It is not an atmosphere that is conducive to good smelling.

101
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,200
Like, I think fucking Herbal Essences could have a convention at the LA Convention Center,

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,120
and you would still get down there and be like,

103
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,680
what fucking stinks so much?

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,920
Who is doing that with their body?

105
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
Herbal Essences is still a company that's around, right?

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,840
As far as I know, yes.

107
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,340
Yeah.

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,400
I don't know that-

109
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,440
I guess you could wear one of those SARS masks.

110
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,880
Could you wear an oversized, like, novelty clothes pin on your nose?

111
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,640
And carry around a printed out, like, speech bubble on a stick that just says PU.

112
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,960
Yeah, and maybe, like, some stink line stickers

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
that you could stick on people who are smelly.

114
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
And maybe you carry around a big jar of flies and you throw that on a person.

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,320
Don't stick-

116
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,520
Those really stink, Shamel.

117
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
They probably don't have any control over it.

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,600
Yeah, maybe you could walk around with, like, one of those giant, like,

119
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,080
remember how Rick the Model Martel had a big-

120
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,760
had his own cologne called Arrogance that he would spray on people?

121
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,760
Maybe you could do that.

122
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't do that.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,040
That sucks.

124
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,760
That's a bad-

125
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,640
That's a bad look.

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,160
I don't think it's a bad look as much as it is a look you could try and see if it fits you.

127
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,560
The Rick the Model Martel classic.

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,520
Just spray people down.

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
Yeah.

130
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,560
Get a six pack of BOD.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,760
So wear them across your chest like a bandolier.

132
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,960
Yeah, like a bandolier.

133
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,440
There we go.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
And then just, like, fast draw a BOD.

135
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,200
Because what's great about BOD is it came in repurposed Windex bottles.

136
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,200
And that nozzle, you can twist it and get a really long spray going on that.

137
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,840
You can go with a cone of spray or you can go with a straight shot like a-

138
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,720
Distinct.

139
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,840
No scope.

140
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,680
No scope. Distinct. BOD shot.

141
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,480
Hold on.

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,600
I just had a great idea.

143
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,600
You want to do some BOD shots?

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:37,840
Yes.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,240
What?

146
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,520
Convention organizers have a complimentary Febreeze booth.

147
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
How about a mandatory Febreeze booth?

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
You have to perform-

149
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,920
As they're walking in, you do, like, a security check and then a Febreeze check

150
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
and then they get to enter the convention.

151
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,600
You can only enter the convention center through the Febreeze way.

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,520
It's like you have those misters at, like, amusement parks where it gets real hot

153
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,480
and the kids play in it.

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
You just have that, but it's Febreeze and BOD.

155
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:20,880
On the twist, put this on the twist and decide that you enjoy or can find pleasurable

156
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,240
the smell of body odor.

157
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,600
Like a connoisseur?

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,880
Maybe you remind yourself, like, this is human. This is distinctly human.

159
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,720
This is it. This is the real shit.

160
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
This is what humanity is supposed to smell like.

161
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,880
This is what we smell like for ages.

162
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,440
Get out of your ivory tower and come smell these bits.

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
This is what we smelled like when we built the ivory tower initially

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,960
and the Tower of Babel and shit.

165
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,560
This is what Jesus smelled like.

166
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,160
Probably.

167
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,880
Basically.

168
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,000
Homeboy didn't have BOD.

169
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,600
No, though I would watch that commercial.

170
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,880
He's probably like, hey, dad, like, can you invent BOD super early

171
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,080
just so I can just sort of purge the scents a little bit?

172
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,600
Have you smelled these 12 dudes?

173
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,160
It's just me and 12 dudes rolling around the desert.

174
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
We smell like dookie.

175
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
We smell like total dookie, dad.

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,240
How about some BOD?

177
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,320
How about some BOD, God?

178
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
God, invent BOD.

179
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,520
God, BOD me.

180
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,240
BOD me, God.

181
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,480
I'm Boston Jesus.

182
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,720
Boston J.

183
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
Yo, it's your boy, Boston J.

184
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
How about some BOD, God?

185
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,120
Dad, damn.

186
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,640
Scholars can't prove that Jesus was not from Boston.

187
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,120
In fact, I believe the Dead Sea Scrolls,

188
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,960
which had been ruled apocryphal and non-canonical,

189
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,440
there's some pretty damning evidence in there.

190
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,680
It says here Jesus spake,

191
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
yo, Judas, I'm wicked disappointed in you.

192
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,720
I'm wicked disappointed, brah.

193
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm gonna turn this water into chowder.

194
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,580
Nomah.

195
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,760
Y'all want a yahoo?

196
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,960
Yeah, please.

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,840
How about a yahoo?

198
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
Sorry, Jesus.

199
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Sorry, Jesus.

200
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
This yahoo was sent in by our close friend, Evan Minsker.

201
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,040
Thanks, Evan.

202
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,840
Getting married real soon.

203
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,640
Very exciting time of his life.

204
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
Everything's coming up, Evan.

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,840
Evan wrote a great piece on Pitchfork,

206
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,520
if you haven't read it recently,

207
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,680
that is great about Mac DeMarco.

208
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
Is that that cat's name?

209
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm old, so I don't really know what anybody's called,

210
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
but I like the story.

211
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
He's a great dude.

212
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,280
Thank you, Evan.

213
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,480
It's by yahooanswersuserjackf who asks,

214
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,240
how do you get rid of an Arby's manager?

215
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,560
Recently they moved around some of the managers

216
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,960
and the one we got is mean and sloppy.

217
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
She blames employees for things she did

218
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,760
and treats us extremely memely bad.

219
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,400
I saw-

220
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,160
I was gonna say that word one more time.

221
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
Extremely memely bad.

222
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,040
I saw two of them about to cry today

223
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
and she cuts ours.

224
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
I hate to see my coworker upset

225
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,440
and I would do anything to get her gone

226
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,520
within the law preferably.

227
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,920
Oh, and she cusses on the job,

228
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
which is never allowed, especially by management.

229
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,440
I'm glad that this person felt the need

230
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
to specify within the law preferably.

231
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
Yeah, preferably.

232
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,160
I would prefer not to murder this lady.

233
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,280
But I understand that that's my only recourse.

234
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,360
Listen, if I had my druthers,

235
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,800
I would not murder this woman.

236
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,760
I think you are perfectly positioned right now

237
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,880
for a broad conspiracy that will position

238
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
not only the downfall of this manager,

239
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,440
but you to rise up and take their place.

240
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,160
You're jilted.

241
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,080
That job should have been yours.

242
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,320
So you need to start machinations,

243
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,800
moving pieces around the board,

244
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,200
lining up opponents, preparing them

245
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
for a catastrophe to befall them,

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,280
a political catastrophe, if you will,

247
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
in the Arby's politics

248
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,960
and preparing yourself to be the new district manager.

249
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
That's right, gentlemen.

250
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I am suggesting the House of Carby's.

251
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
It is very hard to make a house

252
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,200
out of thinly sliced beefs.

253
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,080
Let me throw this out.

254
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,680
Let me throw this out as like a move,

255
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
as one of your moves.

256
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,080
You have the district management come down

257
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,640
because you suspect something shady.

258
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,040
You pop open her trunk and what's that?

259
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,320
You've planted a bunch of raw beef in her trunk

260
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
that she's been stealing.

261
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,520
Beef thief, the classic beef thief.

262
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,200
The classic beef thief gambit.

263
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,000
And then maybe you have a sexy affair

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
with an attractive aspiring journalist.

265
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,680
Maybe.

266
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240
How does that help?

267
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,480
How does it hurt?

268
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
How does it hurt?

269
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
Fair enough.

270
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:50,720
She's gonna-

271
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,680
And then you blow the lid off

272
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,880
the curly fry conspiracy.

273
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
She's gonna think she's using you

274
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,320
to get Arby's connections,

275
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
but really you're using her for Arby's leverage.

276
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,160
And when you are,

277
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,600
listen, in the game of Arby's,

278
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
you win or you die.

279
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,400
Or you eat curly fries.

280
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,280
Or you eat curly fries.

281
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,960
Well, you're gonna do that either way.

282
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,520
Okay, so you either win and eat curly fries

283
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,360
or eat curly fries and then die.

284
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,600
Right.

285
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Well, you couldn't die and then eat curly fries, Griffin.

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,040
That's fucking ridiculous.

287
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,840
That's a good point.

288
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,000
How would you chew your dad

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
unless we're looking at a weekend

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,400
at Bernie's two situation?

291
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,120
I'm saying that curly fries

292
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,920
possess an ambrosial quantity

293
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,280
that can restore life to the dead.

294
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,400
Well, that's just science.

295
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,360
They're that fucking good.

296
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,080
I'm mixing my Game of Thrones

297
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,360
and my House of Cards metaphors.

298
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,720
They're basically the same show.

299
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
Give Kevin Spacey a sword and a beard

300
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,400
and it's basically Game of Thrones.

301
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,720
It's gonna be a tough-

302
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,200
Could you trick her into saying she quits?

303
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,880
Because once she says it,

304
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,760
that's like she's locked into it.

305
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,280
So you just need to get her to be like,

306
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,960
what would you say instead of like,

307
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I hire her to be like, I quit?

308
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,920
Bam!

309
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,040
Bam, got it.

310
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,280
The golden contract appears from there.

311
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,640
A levitating ink-dipped quill signs.

312
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,960
Maybe you could get her to admit

313
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,520
that she doesn't really like Arby's food.

314
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,240
Oh my God.

315
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
Like you go to her and you're like,

316
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,240
this is good,

317
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
but wouldn't you rather be like

318
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,760
eating a porterhouse steak or like corn chowder?

319
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
Do you think this is better?

320
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
She's not gonna fall for that.

321
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,560
She's gonna be like, take that filet mignon

322
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,680
and then slice it really thin

323
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,800
and put it on some shitty bread

324
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,760
and maybe we'll talk.

325
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,720
Like, God damn it.

326
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,600
If you can though,

327
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,520
what if RJ Arby's is like hiding around the corner

328
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,040
and he comes out and he's like,

329
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
I knew it, Susan.

330
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,200
I never trusted you.

331
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,120
You betrayed me, Susan.

332
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,040
And you broke my heart.

333
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,880
You broke my heart, Susan.

334
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,240
You're the one, Susan.

335
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,800
I was gonna call it Susan's.

336
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
I swear to God.

337
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
The next burger was gonna be called the Big Susan.

338
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,760
We've never had burgers.

339
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,560
I was gonna start making burgers apparently.

340
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,800
For you, for you, Susan.

341
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,120
Because I knew you loved them, Susan.

342
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,680
I was gonna make-

343
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
I can see it in your employee review

344
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,280
that you thought we could start making burgers

345
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
and I said for you or anything.

346
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,520
I was gonna make you the forbidden sandwich.

347
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,460
I was gonna-

348
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
Roast beef on top,

349
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,480
roast beef on bottom,

350
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
and bread in the middle.

351
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,920
I was gonna do that for you, Susan.

352
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,840
You broke my heart, Susan.

353
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,000
And you're the whole reason I made the potato wedges

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,960
in the first place.

355
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,120
And that was the day RJ Arby's shut down all the Arby's.

356
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,160
No one goes in, no one goes out.

357
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,560
But somehow you can still buy the sandwiches.

358
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,040
Someone's still making the sandwiches.

359
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
The smell is impossible.

360
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,160
Do you think RJ Arby's lives in fear of the moment

361
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,640
that Subway figures out like,

362
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
what if we just made our roast beef?

363
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,080
Oh, thin beef, okay.

364
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,800
Yeah, we did that.

365
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Oops, Arby's is gone.

366
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,520
That easy.

367
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Arby's used to have a sandwich

368
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,640
that was a croissant sandwich with roast beef on it.

369
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,120
Oh boy.

370
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,960
And they haven't had it for probably 25 years

371
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,040
and I think about it three times a day.

372
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,480
If you're looking for some insight

373
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,240
into like Justin McElroy, the man,

374
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,280
that's why I'm at where I'm at.

375
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,200
That's what I'm usually thinking about.

376
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,080
Justin either thinks about the forbidden Arby's sandwich

377
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,000
or how good Tastations were.

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,880
That's basically-

379
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,800
Tastations were good, Griffin.

380
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
It's funny you say that because they were delicious.

381
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,360
Also, my favorite cereal ever was Crunch Berries.

382
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,760
Those Papa Smurf Berries.

383
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,040
Oops, all berries?

384
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,760
No, Papa Smurf Berries, it tastes completely different.

385
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,800
They're the best cereal ever

386
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,680
and they were only around for like a day and I-

387
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,720
Much like Brigadoon.

388
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,720
I have spent the 25 years since their release

389
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,080
and discontinuation searching for a cereal

390
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,000
that has the same flavor as that,

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,240
hoping with every bowl will be the bowl back to-

392
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,120
Be the bowl home.

393
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,560
Will be the bowl back to-

394
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,080
Man, Rachel and I finished that.

395
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
We watched the series finale.

396
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,000
That is a rough ending on that.

397
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
That is a tough-

398
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,320
No spoilers.

399
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,360
Tough cookie.

400
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
It resolves his entire shit

401
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
with like a single line of text at the end.

402
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,680
Like, oh, and this is how he turned out.

403
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,120
Thanks, Quantum Leap.

404
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
Could have used maybe a bit more expo.

405
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,160
A little more expo on that.

406
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,760
If they thought they were gonna get another season.

407
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,800
If they thought that they had another season in them

408
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,520
because it's weird.

409
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,080
Doesn't it end with like a sabbatical basically?

410
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,000
Like he's just gonna chill on the leaping?

411
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,560
I mean, it hints at that.

412
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,080
You know what it needs?

413
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
And we're talking on the wrong podcast about this.

414
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
How fucking good would a Telltale adventure game

415
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,960
of Quantum Leap be?

416
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm serious.

417
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Walking dead.

418
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,360
It'd be amazing.

419
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
It'd be absolutely phenomenal.

420
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,600
I would buy a game system just to play that.

421
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:07,840
Right.

422
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,520
I don't know if those dudes are listening,

423
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,400
but call me.

424
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,600
I will write the entire thing.

425
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,120
I have fan fiction.

426
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,840
That is not a joke.

427
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,560
Ready to go.

428
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,160
Anyway, I got another question for you guys.

429
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,520
What's the appropriate time or distance

430
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,800
one should hold the door open for the next person behind them?

431
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,360
I don't want to slam the door in the person behind me,

432
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,480
but I also don't want to stand there staring at them

433
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,840
for a full minute.

434
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,600
Is it different for men and women?

435
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,560
That's from Desmond.

436
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,840
I tend to hold it.

437
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,680
See, I don't really subscribe to the gender side of this.

438
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,480
I tend to hold the door open for everybody

439
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,920
as do like everybody in Huntington.

440
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,120
Or at least in the area that I live.

441
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
There are probably many areas where that is the case,

442
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,560
especially in the South.

443
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,280
My delineation on distance is age-based, not gender-based.

444
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,760
I agree.

445
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,360
If it's an old person, I will hold it open so much longer.

446
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,600
Keep it open for like a full country mile.

447
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, absolutely.

448
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,560
I think a big part of this too is,

449
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,640
and this is something that I've kind of learned the hard way,

450
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,920
is if you're going to push on through,

451
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,240
if you're going to go through and not hold the door,

452
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,160
it's essential that you not have made eye contact.

453
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,720
But you have to have plausible deniability.

454
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,000
The person behind you, if you look at them and they see you

455
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,200
and you see them, then you know they're coming.

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
And at that point, if you don't hold the door open for them,

457
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
then it's on you.

458
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,600
Also, if it is a double action door that swings both in and out

459
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,560
and you let go of it, it's like 50% chance

460
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,800
it's going to swing back and smack that person in the face.

461
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
And if it does, there's a 10% chance they'll die.

462
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah.

463
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
So just think about that hot shot.

464
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,440
Think about that murderer.

465
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,320
It's hard when there's a huge group of people.

466
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,800
I think that you don't want to fall into that trap.

467
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,920
You got to be careful about that.

468
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,080
Because if there's like 50 people exiting a place,

469
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,440
that could be your whole day.

470
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
I remember getting pinned down when church let out

471
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,840
when we were little and I pulled the door open

472
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
and it was just like, suddenly just a line of people.

473
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
And it's like, I just want to, can I, I need to go.

474
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,360
Guess what?

475
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,760
They're all 99 years old too.

476
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,360
You can't like, get it yourself.

477
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,720
Can't.

478
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,760
You know, my favorite door holding experience

479
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
is when, you know, those airlock kind of doors

480
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,680
where there's like two sets of doors.

481
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,480
And so one person holds the door open for you

482
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
and then you hold the door open for them.

483
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
It always makes you feel like we're about to start

484
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
like a Fred Astaire-esque kind of dance routine.

485
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,040
Like door holding.

486
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,040
Or if there's like 199 year olds

487
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,520
and they're all coming towards the doors

488
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,200
and then you're the only person with door holding capacity.

489
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,800
And so you have to like,

490
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,600
cliffhanger sandwich yourself between these two doors

491
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
in a way that you can keep them both open at the same time.

492
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,160
Like you take your fucking shoes off

493
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,600
and like tuck them under the doors.

494
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
Like, no, it's cool.

495
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
I didn't need those anyway.

496
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
You guys are going to take like five years

497
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
to get through both of these doors.

498
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,040
So I'm just going to leave those shoes there.

499
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,360
They're the church's shoes now.

500
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,880
You know, one thing I've, is interesting.

501
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,520
I've discovered with, that my wife Sydney does not,

502
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,600
and it took me a long time to get this.

503
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,040
She does not like me to hold the door open for her.

504
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,040
She wants me to, I don't know

505
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,360
what biological impulse is driving this,

506
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,120
but she wants me to go in first.

507
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,760
I don't know if she's expecting an assailant.

508
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,720
And I scout around and you come back and tell her it's safe.

509
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,160
She wants me to go in first.

510
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,600
For what reason?

511
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,320
Like, I don't know.

512
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,480
Hello, I'm the envoy to the Grand Sydney Empire.

513
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,280
Presenting the lady ship, Sydney of McElroy.

514
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,520
Does she make you carry around a little tin horn?

515
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm not saying, I'm not saying shit.

516
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,960
You guys are paying for this next Christmas

517
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,680
and I'm not fucking, I'm not going to withstand that.

518
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,040
Listen, I'm not knocking it.

519
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,160
She can get you to do that.

520
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,680
I think that's the dopest shit.

521
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,080
We used to actually, we were in college

522
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,320
and we would go through a double door.

523
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,120
We would also, we would, there were at least three of us there.

524
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,640
We would say, okay, who's the man?

525
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
And we would pick who would get to be the man.

526
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,080
And then the other two would open the door for that guy.

527
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,840
And that guy would walk in really cool.

528
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,760
Because everybody would be like, who is that guy?

529
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Can you tell me what your really cool walk involved, Justin?

530
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Yeah, a little green bag in your head.

531
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,000
That's essential.

532
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
And kind of like a strut shake shimmy.

533
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,040
Can you even strut while you're wearing cargo shorts?

534
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Or is that?

535
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,320
It's more of a switch, to be honest.

536
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,200
Who is that guy?

537
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,920
Oh, he's the heir to the cargo short fortune, clearly.

538
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,200
He's the son of the man who invented cargo shorts.

539
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,040
He's Jimmy Buffet's son.

540
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,120
Did Jimmy Buffet?

541
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
Did James Buffet involve cargo shorts?

542
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm pretty sure that would be his defacto wardrobe, right?

543
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,160
I listened to Jimmy Buffet.

544
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,640
Don't.

545
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,600
By myself.

546
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Didn't.

547
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,880
And wept.

548
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,240
Sometimes you need a little bit of that beachy vibe.

549
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,600
So there's Radio Margaritaville on the Sirius XM.

550
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,320
Now, normally when I need an emotional lift, I'll turn to 40s on 4.

551
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,760
But 40s on 4 has been replaced by an all fucking Billy Joel station.

552
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,720
That's like not getting it for me.

553
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Is it still called 40s on 4?

554
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,040
Is it called Piano Mandate?

555
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,560
No, now it's called Billy on-

556
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,520
Joel Jams.

557
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,480
Joel Jams.

558
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,600
A Billy Joel joint.

559
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,160
And so I'm listening to Margaritaville.

560
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,920
I listened to the entirety of the song Off to See the Lizard

561
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,600
while driving by myself at 8 30 at night to pick up a pizza bread from Geno's.

562
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,080
Oh my God.

563
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
And I needed that beachy vibe right then.

564
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,920
James is there for you with that.

565
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,920
Jimmy's got your back on that front.

566
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,360
If you need to like just escape the incredible sadness of the act you are participating in.

567
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,800
Does the Billy Joel radio station come with an in-car breathalyzer

568
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,320
that you have to blow into?

569
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,640
But it'll only play if you are drunk driving.

570
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,000
You have to blow-

571
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,640
Come on, my man.

572
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Let Billy Joel handle this for you.

573
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,720
Billy Joel has become kind of an expert of what you're doing.

574
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,400
Come on, Billy's got-

575
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
I can talk you down.

576
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
I can talk you down.

577
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,040
This place sings from Italian restaurant.

578
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,200
Can you get one turn left up here?

579
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,760
I am the father of five girls, the oldest, which is 13, and begun to take an interest in boys.

580
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,320
As such, I'm left in the position that fathers have been left in for the last 23.6 years.

581
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,560
How does one balance the instinctual desire to crush these little hormone filled

582
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,080
balls of lust and desire to be a cool dad?

583
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,120
GoldenEye tournaments?

584
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
Playing a game, a little catcheroo?

585
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,760
Working on a car together?

586
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,440
Or should I just accept the natural order of things and hunt this little bugger down

587
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,800
Terminator style?

588
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,680
That's from hormonally hijacked California.

589
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,760
Man, I do not envy your position, my dude.

590
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,080
I have got what-

591
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,320
I mean, I've got a daughter on the way.

592
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:05,680
And the best plan I've been able to cook up is to raise her to be sort of like just a sexless

593
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:14,880
locust of emotion that loves science and loves research and loves supporting her parents with

594
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,360
money and just cannot in any way, shape, or form have romantic love.

595
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,560
Would that be a failure as a parent?

596
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,040
I assume so.

597
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,200
So like she doesn't understand romantic love or she simply does not desire it.

598
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,080
In a way that colorblind person cannot tell the difference between red and green, she

599
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,240
cannot distinguish love from other emotions.

600
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,920
Just does not have the receptors for-

601
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,960
Are you angry at me?

602
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,880
Why are you moving your face towards my face?

603
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,040
Is this-

604
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,160
I don't understand this.

605
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,120
I feel like I lean towards the natural order of things argument here because I feel like-

606
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,640
I don't know, I feel like it's a position that, like natural selection, it must be that

607
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,000
we behave that way for it is the way to continue the spe-

608
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Right?

609
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,760
Like you have to be the dad who's like, now you be respectful of my daughter, honey.

610
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,560
I don't want you dating until you're out of the house, blah, blah, blah.

611
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:13,040
Because otherwise you're like, I don't fucking care, whatever.

612
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I don't understand, like dudes are the worst.

613
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,560
And little dudes don't even have that, like, they don't even realize they're the worst yet.

614
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,400
And so they will just like wedge their dick between a mattress and box spring and like

615
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,600
not understand why they're doing that.

616
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,360
And that-

617
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,440
I don't understand why they're doing that.

618
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,320
That's what, cause it's just any crevice with surrounding pressure.

619
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,120
They're like, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna just put my dick right in there.

620
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,040
Let me throw this out.

621
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,200
That's what he's up against though, he's up against like basically feral little jizz slugs.

622
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,520
Like I've called them that before and that's what they are.

623
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:03,360
So here's my advice, rather than trying to combat these awful, awful human beings that

624
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,520
are 13 year old boys, you need to like train and raise your daughter to be so incredibly

625
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,440
self-sufficient and wise and smart that she sees their bullshit coming a mile away.

626
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,960
Raise a powerful woman who's respectful of herself and who-

627
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,400
But then they invent new bullshit, they're the fucking, I'm telling you-

628
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,680
Well that's the arms race that is hormonal 13 year olds.

629
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:31,120
But I'm saying right now we need to create like a stronger bulletproof vest, if you will.

630
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,120
So then they'll come up with, you know, their armor piercing rounds or whatever.

631
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,920
Travis, future dad Justin is on board with you.

632
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:46,320
13 year old Justin would like to just heartily thank you for making girls more complicated.

633
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,480
Because like I was nailing it constantly, so I'm really glad.

634
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,200
What I really need was an increase in the difficulty curve there, Travis.

635
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,320
So I thank you for that.

636
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,480
But I don't think, I don't like, I don't think either party in this arrangement knows what

637
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,680
the fuck they're doing.

638
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,440
No, absolutely not, right?

639
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,880
Do you mean the dad and the 13 year old boy or the girl?

640
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,480
I'm talking about 13 year old boys and girls.

641
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,240
Like I just don't think there's any, I don't, man, I don't know.

642
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,760
I didn't like, I didn't like date or whatever until I was like a freshman in high school.

643
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,600
I didn't like speak to other human beings.

644
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,120
I don't understand.

645
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,400
Like there's a pretty rough patch there between I would say 11 and 14 where you are just fucking

646
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,400
just going with it.

647
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,160
Just going with the flow.

648
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:40,240
And then like at 15 it's still a little foggy, but you at least understand that it's foggy.

649
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't, I just, I don't think like dating at 13 is like, that's crazy town to me.

650
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
I mean, it's like, I'm not here to-

651
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,120
That's like snowboarding at 110.

652
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,680
It's like, that's not an appropriate age to do that.

653
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,080
I don't know, man.

654
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,640
I can't imagine any, like any judgment I'm going to pass here that's not going to come

655
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
back to bite me on the ass.

656
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Like all I can say is, and this is a guess, a hypothesis, is that the reason this is stressful

657
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,880
for you is that it is sort of the beginning of the end of your like training period for

658
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,120
this human you've created and the beginning of the process of them, you know, leaving

659
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,440
that training period to become their own person.

660
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,080
And I think it's scary right now because you've been in sort of a dry tech period for them

661
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,840
as a human where they don't have as many things that they really have to deal with that you

662
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,720
can't help them with.

663
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,600
And this is the start where they're going to be tested on the training that you've provided

664
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,040
them up until this point.

665
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,600
And I think you just, the fact that you're like super concerned and on point, you're

666
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,880
already ahead of the game, like in the, in the grand scheme of things.

667
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,160
I think you need to have faith that you have raised a quality human who's going to be able

668
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:54,960
to deal with this stuff.

669
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,160
But like this first test that they do out the gate is the fucking gom jabbar of humanity.

670
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,320
Like this is the fucking worst.

671
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,440
But let me throw this out.

672
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,640
Here's, here's, here's the real issue here, if I may.

673
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,560
It's not the question you asked, but it's what I'm going to answer.

674
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,320
About being like that dad, arms crossed.

675
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,520
I don't want you to do that.

676
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,520
My only fear with that would be that you're creating an environment in which your daughter

677
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,160
would be afraid to come to you and ask for advice and ask questions and speak to you

678
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,720
in an honest, open way, because you're this grumbly, angry about the fact that she likes

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,600
boys kind of thing.

680
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
That's not a bad point, Travis.

681
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,360
Yeah.

682
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,920
Whereas what you really need to be is the guy who's open and is willing to talk to her

683
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,040
about things and not just shut down like, well, you shouldn't even be dating.

684
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,800
You should create an environment in which she is feel safe and comfortable talking to

685
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,720
you because you are still the best source of advice and information she's got.

686
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,440
If someone knows that they have your love and your trust, that's always going to be

687
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,680
more powerful than knowing that they're risking your judgment, because otherwise they're

688
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
just going to see how much they can get away with.

689
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,880
The other one, it's like it's the next best thing to be in there.

690
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,320
Yeah.

691
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,520
Or you could do like we did and take them to church camp, because that worked pretty

692
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,240
good for me.

693
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,520
For a good long walk.

694
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,080
I mean, there was a lot of, obviously we weren't a party to this, but there was a lot of fingering

695
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,960
going on at church camp.

696
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,320
There was like a lot of fingering going on.

697
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,280
To hear the rumors, there weren't a dry shorts in the house.

698
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,560
Let's put it that way.

699
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,760
There was a lot of it going on.

700
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,560
I didn't see it.

701
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,040
Listen, I didn't see it.

702
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,160
I didn't see shit.

703
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,360
I obviously didn't take part in it.

704
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,720
Put my finger where?

705
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,880
Excuse me.

706
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,120
But you know that shit was going on.

707
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,640
Pools closed.

708
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,520
What are you doing?

709
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,020
Fingering.

710
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,960
What are you doing here at the pool?

711
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,520
It's closed.

712
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,120
Oh, fingering.

713
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,680
Okay, cool.

714
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,180
Bye.

715
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,040
Kill an Arby's manager.

716
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,640
Kill an Arby's manager just to watch him.

717
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,600
What?

718
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,240
No.

719
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,440
This podcast will self-destruct because we don't want to be implicated.

720
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,080
Here's your mission.

721
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,440
Get fit by summer.

722
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,240
What's the problem?

723
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,520
That vending machine at work.

724
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,640
I know you love it.

725
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,120
What's your guys like vending machine thing?

726
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,360
Because I have sometimes I'll just get dirty with like a honey bun.

727
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:27,920
Something like that.

728
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,840
Honey don't have us a vending machine.

729
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,520
But God fucking when they had those like the Nutty Buddies, like the wafer, chocolate,

00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,640

731
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,360
Oh, man.

732
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,720
I used to cream a honey button.

733
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,800
Honey button and then I'd be like, it's a breakfast.

734
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,480
It's not a lot of breakfast.

735
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,000
It is a little Debbie, my man.

736
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,120
Here's what I'm saying to you.

737

That's naturebox.com slash my brother.

771
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:11,200
You guys, I saw you the other day through your windows in the two different states you live

772
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,880
and watching Hulu on your computer.

773
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,080
Sounds right.

774
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,080
Saw you do some other shit on the computer too.

775
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,200
I'm very disappointed in.

776
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,960
That was research.

777
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,720
Yeah, it was research, sure.

778
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,800
For a book I'm writing.

779
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
About butts.

780
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
About butts.

781
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
Butts through the ages.

782
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,000
If you like that Hulu, let me tell you about Hulu Plus.

783
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,160
Because it's better than regular Hulu.

784
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,960
With Hulu Plus you can watch current season episodes of your favorite shows

785
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,120
like Family Guy, Parks and Recreation.

786
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,400
Both in one.

787
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,960
Both in one.

788
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,400
It's two shows in one.

789
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,560
And The Tonight Show with new host Jimmy Fallon.

790
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,360
Jimmy Fallon.

791
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,480
James Fallon.

792
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:50,960
James Fallon.

793
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:51,680
And you can watch every-

794
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,640
James Fallon.

795
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,600
James Fallon.

796
00:35:53,600 --> 00:36:00,400
You can also watch every episode of like archived episodes of shows like Community and South Park.

797
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
Community and South Park.

798
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,480
And you can watch that on all kinds of different devices.

799
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,440
Tablets.

800
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,000
Computer.

801
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,080
Smart TV.

802
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,200
Your Roku.

803
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
I mean Six in Japanese.

804
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,160
I bet you guys didn't know that.

805
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,560
I've been trying to get people onto Hannibal.

806
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
And you can watch this whole season.

807
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:18,960
It's a great show.

808
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,320
I was telling Travis about it before.

809
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,600
You can go to HuluPlus.com.

810
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,640
You can get Hulu Plus.

811
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,680
Watch the whole season.

812
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,400
This has been going on catch all the way up.

813
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,280
You also get originals that you can't get access to anywhere else.

814
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
There's a new show, Deadbeat.

815
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,960
It's a comedy about a pot-spoking guy who talks to ghosts.

816
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,240
So there might be some legal ramifications there.

817
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
That'll be there.

818
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,080
We'll have to talk to them about that.

819
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,800
How can I get this?

820
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,120
I want it for free, Griffin.

821
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,240
I want it for free.

822
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
Well, bad news.

823
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,280
You can't.

824
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,840
Just kidding.

825
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,040
You totally can.

826
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,920
Did you like my joke?

827
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,160
Because for the first two-

828
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,280
We can get you two weeks free here at my Bim Bam Co.

829
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,240
All you got to do is go to HuluPlus.com slash my brother.

830
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:00,800
All one word.

831
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,280
And we'll get you two weeks full access of all that programming.

832
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,440
And after that, it's only $7.99 a month.

833
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,960
Theresa and I got rid of cable and now we just watch stuff on Hulu.

834
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,440
We wait a day for $7.99.

835
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,240
It's such a good deal.

836
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,120
I have not had cable since Jesus.

837
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,280
God, I honestly can't remember since Jesus.

838
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,840
Yep.

839
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,560
Since Boston Jesus walked the face of the earth.

840
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,760
What are you watching?

841
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:28,640
Project Runway, huh?

842
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,880
You could be out extolling my name or whatever.

843
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,760
That's fine.

844
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,960
Yeah, it's fine.

845
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,760
It's a good show.

846
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,560
Love that Tim Gunn.

847
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,160
HuluPlus.com slash my brother is where you can go to do that.

848
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
And watch it and get it.

849
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,920
Because, yeah.

850
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,200
This next message is for-

851
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,120
You know what's funny about Hulu Plus?

852
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,640
They have been advertising with us for months.

853
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:58,160
So, I know that they're continuing to see a return on that directly because we have a special URL.

854
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,880
It's hot catchphrases like, so yeah.

855
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,840
So, but here's the thing.

856
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,080
There are people the 12th time we tell them to get Hulu Plus, they're like, fine.

857
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,280
You warm me down.

858
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,680
Fine, fine, fine.

859
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,040
Maybe this is your time to finally commit your life to Hulu Plus.

860
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,600
Anyway, we got some personal messages too.

861
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,240
This message is for Adam Ford and it's from Chelsea Kerr.

862
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,880
Hey girl, happy birthday.

863
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,520
It's your 27th rotation around the sun and providing I sent this in on time for your special day-

864
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,000
Probably not.

865
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
I'll say- Yep.

866
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,680
I'll say belated happy birthday as well.

867
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,080
I love you as much as you should love a horse.

868
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
Love, Chelsea.

869
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,120
P.S. You are a butt.

870
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,680
Now that last part isn't from Chelsea.

871
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,240
That's just Travis putting you on blast.

872
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,320
Hey Adam, you're a fucking butt.

873
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,160
You're a butt, sir.

874
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
You're a butt, sir.

875
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,040
Look at yourself.

876
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,400
Look at yourself in the mirror.

877
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,000
You're a butt in clothes.

878
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
This level of love that you described does not exist.

879
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
This inter-human love that you described.

880
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,960
I mean, it's admirable and I'm sure that you do love this guy a lot, but-

881
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,280
As much as you love a horse.

882
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,640
It's a great thing to aspire to.

883
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,960
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure, sure.

884
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,480
I hung out with a horse yesterday.

885
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,360
Name was Pop Tart.

886
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,280
Oh wow.

887
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,720
Hanging out with a horse and went out to a ranch.

888
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,000
There was a horse and two donks.

889
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
Pretty much the best Saturday anyone's ever had.

890
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,440
That's so weird, because horse and two donks is what I call my bits.

891
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,160
Oh, Travis got driven.

892
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,360
Sorry to get blue, everybody.

893
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm sorry.

894
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,040
Theresa asked me the other day.

895
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,360
She said, you guys talk about horses a lot on your podcast.

896
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,560
Has any of you ever actually wanted to own a horse?

897
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,080
I would own Pop Tart.

898
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Pop Tart is like real chill.

899
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,360
Kind of an older horse, which is not ideal for prancing.

900
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,080
But it just hung its head over the fence and just let me pet on it.

901
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
And it was so soft.

902
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
I almost went in and gave him a little kiss.

903
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,920
And I was like, I'm at a party.

904
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm at a party.

905
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,800
You're feeble about it.

906
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,000
I said, my horse, I shouldn't give Pop Tart a sweet kiss on the nose.

907
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,160
But I almost did.

908
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,080
I started to lean in like, oh, here he comes.

909
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,120
But then I was like, the owner might be watching, and that's not a good look.

910
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,960
I almost gave this horse a sweet kiss at a party.

911
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,680
Oh, Victoria, the one with the glasses out there.

912
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,200
Did you invite the horse kisser?

913
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,560
Did he just kiss Pop Tart on the mouth?

914
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,760
It was one of Rachel's co-workers too.

915
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,280
So the ramifications for her in the workplace environment would be everlasting.

916
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,040
Yeah, your husband was really great.

917
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,160
He did kiss Pop Tart.

918
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,200
Pop Tart's still talking about him though.

919
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,360
Pop Tart's a hit with Pop Tart.

920
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,640
You married him, huh?

921
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,480
You married that guy, huh?

922
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,920
Horse smoocher, huh?

923
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,480
David Early got a message for you from Gabe and Josh, and this is how they started.

924
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,760
David Early, you thought this would be from your friends, Josh and Gabe, but it's me, Dio.

925
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
I'll do my Dio voice.

926
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,000
Happy birthday.

927
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,800
You're a gentleman, a scholar, and a worthy opponent.

928
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,440
But your attempts to hide your warrior cat, NBNBA, and fanfics were useless.

929
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,800
You've been defeated.

930
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,400
But remember this as your best birthday ever, for it was given by me, Dio.

931
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,080
And I said birthday wish ever, but I do think that Dio does grant people birthdays.

932
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,840
I don't think it's your birthday unless Dio clears it.

933
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,880
Unless Dio stops by.

934
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,560
He's very, very busy.

935
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,280
Just kidding.

936
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,520
He's super not, probably.

937
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,400
Isn't he dead?

938
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,600
He's fundamentally dead.

939
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,680
It's not funny that he died, but it's funny I didn't know.

940
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:33,520
I guess, I guess, kind of, yes, basically.

941
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,720
So, uh, happy birthday, David Early, from me, Dio.

942
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,080
I'm Jesse Thorne.

943
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,880
Bullseye is all about discovering the good stuff in culture that will do nothing less

944
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,480
than change your life.

945
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,160
You know, I've never heard anything like it before.

946
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,280
It'd be like seeing a new color, which I guess is music's like biggest asset is that you

947
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,080
can hear new sounds.

948
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,600
I'll probably never see a new color.

949
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,280
I'll probably never experience like a new crazy taste, but I'll hear new sounds constantly.

950
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,000
Culture picks, comedy, and in-depth interviews.

951
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,880
It's the good stuff and just the good stuff in popular culture, every week on Bullseye.

953
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,200
Do y'all want a yahoo?

954
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,840
Please.

955
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,320
Yes.

956
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,720
Um, we did Arby's manager as a club banger.

957
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,840
There's a club banger.

958
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,640
I just want to send him by-

959
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,600
That's an instant classic.

960
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,200
I just want to send him by Amelie Belcher.

961
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:31,920
Thank you, Amelie.

962
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,040
Justin, please don't.

963
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Taylor, who asks, Amelie?

964
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:37,600
No.

965
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,600
Who asks, sneaking bong into music fest?

966
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,320
I'm going to a music festival called Waka-Rusa.

967
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,480
I would like to bring my bong, but I hear they check you.

968
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,640
Like, search your bag if you have one.

969
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,840
Can anyone tell me how to get by with a glass bong or give any tips?

970
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,640
Thanks, everybody.

971
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,200
And that's signed from everyone going to that concert.

972
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,440
Yeah.

973
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,200
Don't waste my time or yours telling me just don't bring it.

974
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:10,960
Not even an option, my man.

975
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,760
Not even an option.

976
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,880
Can you throw the bong over the checkpoint, make it through, and then catch the bong?

977
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,440
Frankly, you're embarrassing yourself by even suggesting that I don't bring it.

978
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,160
That I don't bring it.

979
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
This bong goes where I go, my friend.

980
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,000
It is my Winnie the Pooh of bongs.

981
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,000
I will say, if you go to the right, if you go to the correct music festival,

982
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,920
the people at the checkpoint, I saw this at Bonnaroo all three years that I went,

983
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,000
they will just pull the bong out of your backpack and then put it right back.

984
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,200
Like, they will pull the bong out to make way for the rest of their search,

985
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,680
and they will say, okay, now here's your bong back.

986
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,800
Enjoy your day.

987
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,600
Aren't they checking-

988
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,800
Sorry, I had to move your bong to check out your granola and shit.

989
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,400
Aren't they checking bags to ensure that you have a bong?

990
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,800
Because they booked shitty bands.

991
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,080
Listen, these bands aren't-

992
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,160
Are you really sure about doing this sober?

993
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,880
I'm not sure you're going to really get the full effect.

994
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
Do you know who's one of the three headliners at Bonnaroo this year?

995
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,840
It's like the first year since Goblin was last time I went in 2009

996
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,000
that I actually thought about picking up some ticks.

997
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,600
Lionel Richie's in the mix.

998
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,120
Whoa!

999
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:17,680
Yeah.

1000
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,040
How do they pick these things?

1001
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,000
How do they-

1002
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,640
A fucking the smartest wizard ever picks them and says,

1003
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,680
what would Griffin be into?

1004
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
I do love the mix at Bonnaroo because it's always like,

1005
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,280
we've got the Flaming Lips, the Black Keys, and James Taylor.

1006
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,080
Guys, if Lionel Richie and the Flaming Lips did a dual performance together,

1007
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,480
that would probably be like a really good band.

1008
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,520
Don't you think?

1009
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,080
Yes.

1010
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,280
I mean, that sounds like something they do.

1011
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,480
Like I saw the Flaming Lips do all White Stripes shit

1012
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,480
when Jack White like broke his hand or whatever.

1013
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,360
Man, that was tight.

1014
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,120
Anyway, I think I'm probably the only person who's been through

1015
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,800
a music festival drug checkpoint.

1016
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,840
Unless Justin and Travis, you guys.

1017
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,920
I went to Sharon, Lois, and Bram and they were pretty strict about that shit.

1018
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,760
You got chewable Tylenol?

1019
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,560
What is this shit?

1020
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,920
Are you going to eat all these Flintstone vitamins?

1021
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:14,880
You sick fuck.

1022
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,960
This is all Dino.

1023
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:19,600
What the fuck?

1024
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,080
I have never, Dino is what you, yeah.

1025
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,520
Dino is what gets you fucked up.

1026
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,960
Announcement, everybody, please do not eat the Purple Barney.

1027
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
There's some bad Dino going on.

1028
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,800
Some bad Dino.

1029
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,960
Just stick to the Betty.

1030
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,640
Actually, there's not a Betty.

1031
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,760
Did you guys know that?

1032
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,880
That's bullshit.

1033
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,080
Well, largely because the character models for Betty and Wilma

1034
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,280
were indistinguishable.

1035
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,400
Oh, interesting.

1036
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,960
They didn't initially have Betty vitamins.

1037
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,360
Also like, I'm going to eat a woman.

1038
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,960
Okay, I mean, they had Wilma, so that's not weird.

1039
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,600
Betty's in the mix now, but like she wasn't for two decades.

1040
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:00,880
A lot of Vore fetishists were born out of those Vites.

1041
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,320
You guys know about Vore?

1042
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,720
I learned about Vore while I was looking up Yahoo answers.

1043
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,680
Man, it bummed me out.

1044
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,880
What?

1045
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,840
I don't know.

1046
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,080
It is a sexual fetish about swallowing people.

1047
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,080
Okay.

1048
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,040
There's videos that are like CGI videos.

1049
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,000
Like hole?

1050
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,280
Yeah, like maybe a giant snake swallows a man

1051
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,600
and someone is jerking off to that, yes.

1052
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,440
Oh no, I'm aroused.

1053
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,320
Oh, damn it.

1054
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,240
A gelatinous cube falls on top of a woman and absorbs her.

1055
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,840
And there's a dude like, yep, that will be my thing.

1056
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,960
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1057
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
Do you guys, you guys think it's weird?

1058
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,040
Like I'm gonna have a baby soon.

1059
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,440
You think that's weird that that baby will only think of,

1060
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,040
like when she hears of Flintstones,

1061
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,560
like the only context in which she will understand Flintstones

1062
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,880
is the people that make both vitamins and pebbles cereal.

1063
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,080
Yeah, it's really a cultural touchstone.

1064
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,520
Yeah, what an odd corporation that's gonna seem like to her.

1065
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,120
What an odd diversification.

1066
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,480
Well, and also John Goodman's finest acting role basically ever.

1067
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,440
Yeah, she will not be watching the Flintstones.

1068
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,600
A lot of adult ideas in the Flintstones.

1069
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,080
The second one, it's all about that,

1070
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,000
there's like a lady who's trying to seduce him.

1071
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,040
That's a married man.

1072
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:24,480
My dream is that I'm in one of the scenes

1073
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,360
where Kyle McLaughlin also is

1074
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,560
and I like smash through the window, SWAT style.

1075
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,000
It's like, we're getting out of here.

1076
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,200
Come on, Kyle.

1077
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,160
And in the rest of the movie,

1078
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,240
there's just like shots of empty rooms.

1079
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,560
We took Kyle away.

1080
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,640
I got everybody, I got them all out.

1081
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,400
It'll be like, but there was like, I couldn't save-

1082
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,680
Tom Arnold is still there.

1083
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,360
I couldn't save Tom Arnold, he's still in there.

1084
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,720
It's like the end of Schindler's List.

1085
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,920
If I had one more helicopter, I could have rescued him.

1086
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,800
Specifically Tom Arnold, I could have got him out of there.

1087
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:55,680
No, he's doing okay.

1088
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,080
I've never under, was that, wasn't that Moranis?

1089
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,480
It was, it was Rick Moranis.

1090
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,000
I get that, they're interchangeable.

1091
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,160
And then after that, he retired from acting.

1092
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,560
Yeah, I have never understood bringing a bong anywhere

1093
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,920
because it's not like,

1094
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,840
it is certainly not the most convenient means

1095
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,320
to imbibe that stuff.

1096
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:18,240
I just, am I missing something?

1097
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,240
Is there something about the allure of a bong

1098
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,360
that like I just-

1099
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,760
You are certainly asking the right two people.

1100
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,400
All right.

1101
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,800
Did you ever know somebody with a bong that had a name?

1102
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,520
Yeah, I actually knew someone with a famous bong

1103
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,520
that it was featured on the cover of High Times.

1104
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,440
What was so famous about it?

1105
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,560
A picture of Jesus grew from the resin.

1106
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,160
No, that particular bong, that very one

1107
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,760
was featured on the cover of High Times

1108
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,880
and that's why it was famous.

1109
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,560
Oh, so the bong itself,

1110
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,640
it was a bong model that was very famous.

1111
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,160
No, the bong, the one that he held in his hand

1112
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:50,720
was the one from the-

1113
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,600
Did he blow it?

1114
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,360
Did he like create it himself?

1115
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,520
I mean, there's no such thing as a bong

1116
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,680
that everyone has created from like glass.

1117
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,000
Why are you getting hung up on the worst details

1118
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,480
of the story when we still don't know the name

1119
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
or distinguishing characteristics of this bong?

1120
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,960
The distinguishing characteristic is the bong

1121
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,480
where it was about three feet long

1122
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,480
and it had these two tree frogs on it

1123
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,640
that were like climbing up the sides of the bong.

1124
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,120
Sure.

1125
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,920
It was mostly primarily blue and clear glass

1126
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,360
and it was named Tocan Choke.

1127
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,440
Tocan Choke.

1128
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,400
Why are there frogs?

1129
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,720
I don't know, but the frogs were named Toc and Choke.

1130
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,000
They were the two frogs.

1131
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,080
How often did you have to feed them?

1132
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:31,600
Feed the frogs?

1133
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,160
Um, they ate the resin.

1134
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,200
What was the heaviest-

1135
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,720
Frogs are fucked up.

1136
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,880
What was the heaviest rip you ever got on it?

1137
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,240
We've discussed drugs before, so this is a new territory.

1138
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,480
One time I took a hit off Tocan Choke

1139
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,680
and then felt as though all my organs

1140
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,040
were shifting around my body.

1141
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,600
I had to go into the other room

1142
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,520
and lay down on my friend's weight bench

1143
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,320
and just take a quiet minute to let all my organs settle.

1144
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,000
Yeah, that'll happen, man.

1145
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,640
Get the old-

1146
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,600
That was pretty cool.

1147
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,200
Get the old meat tornado in there.

1148
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,960
I'm a college student living in an apartment

1149
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,920
and my neighbor's noisiness keeps me up at night.

1150
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,360
Almost every night around 1130,

1151
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,240
I'll hear a satisfied, uh, or mmm sound

1152
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,280
through our shared wall.

1153
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
Now you're gonna be up every night.

1154
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,840
This goes on for 15 to 30 minutes or so

1155
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,280
and then stops.

1156
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,400
I've never heard anything else

1157
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,040
besides my neighbor's deep groans of satisfaction.

1158
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,240
I can only assume that he's jerking it.

1159
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,320
It's not exactly loud,

1160
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,360
but knowing that a dude is going to town on his hog

1161
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,520
mere feet from me makes falling asleep difficult.

1162
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,160
Other than these pleasure moans,

1163
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,840
I never hear from the guy.

1164
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,160
He doesn't call, he doesn't write.

1165
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,960
I have only seen him once or twice in the last few months.

1166
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,960
How do I deal with these loud jerk-off noises?

1167
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,760
That's from extremely restrained in Raleigh.

1168
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,280
Raleigh?

1169
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,400
Raleigh, North Carolina?

1170
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,160
Raleigh.

1171
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,000
From Raleigh's, North Carolina.

1172
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,440
From inside of Raleigh's.

1173
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,720
Oh, Jesus.

1174
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,120
How do you-

1175
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:05,840
Okay, a lot.

1176
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,280
When you hear it, you just have to loudly say,

1177
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,320
nice, dude.

1178
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,160
Nice jerk sesh, dude.

1179
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,120
You are getting it, son.

1180
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,560
You crushed it.

1181
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,440
Did it again.

1182
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,640
Too fruition, bro.

1183
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,800
Dude, too fast.

1184
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,480
You gotta peek and back off.

1185
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,040
I have been at Home Depot a lot lately

1186
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,600
because I own a house and have no fucking idea what I'm doing.

1187
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,400
And I was in the drywall section

1188
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,600
and it struck me how thin them shits is

1189
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,920
and that I have been in so many situations

1190
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,840
where I've had roommates who were probably doing this activity

1191
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,040
and now I know the, like, the slightness of the barrier

1192
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:50,080
that was in between us.

1193
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,800
We were just basically jerking off right next to me.

1194
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,920
So what you're gonna need to do

1195
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,520
is you're gonna need to get yourself some bricks

1196
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,640
and some mortar.

1197
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,800
And you're gonna need to put a new wall into your room

1198
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,760
that's six feet away from the wall that already exists.

1199
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,600
Gotta build a new house inside your house.

1200
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,040
Basically.

1201
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,720
It's like the little tent that sweet Haley Cho Lawson made

1202
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,560
and the six cents to keep the ghosts out

1203
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:16,880
and it'll be like that, but the ghost jerking off.

1204
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,760
What you basically need is your own personal sweat lodge

1205
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
inside your basement that you go to to ignore the sound.

1206
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,080
Like a panic room.

1207
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Instead of a spectral Misha Barton,

1208
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,200
we're talking about a dude that's probably just jerking off

1209
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,680
over there.

1210
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,960
At least he keeps a regular schedule.

1211
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,160
You can be out of the room at 1130.

1212
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,280
Is that, okay.

1213
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,880
Okay, if you hit the ceiling with a broom handle,

1214
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,840
like the moment that this happens,

1215
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,240
is that worth?

1216
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
Okay, so like that might solve your problem,

1217
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,200
but is it going to be worth the sort of like

1218
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,760
eternal heart wrenching salting of this guy's personal game?

1219
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,080
Like forever.

1220
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,600
Because the moment he hears,

1221
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,040
like the moment you have that exchange,

1222
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,440
not only will he never masturbate again,

1223
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,440
but he will have to wonder like how many times.

1224
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,080
He might have to come kill you.

1225
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,120
He may have to legitimately come kill you.

1226
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,360
Is that worth the risk?

1227
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:21,920
He knew too much.

1228
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,880
I don't want to dive too deep into this person's psychoses,

1229
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,600
but why is he making sounds jerking off?

1230
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,800
Like why is he like, oh yeah, myself.

1231
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,160
I am doing awesome.

1232
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,560
Oh yeah, Steve, who is me.

1233
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,400
You know how I like it.

1234
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,920
Oh, Steve, keep it up.

1235
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,080
Yes, me.

1236
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, I, yes, good job.

1237
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,280
Oh, our God.

1238
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,920
Oh, us, good, good, good.

1239
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,440
Me, yay.

1240
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,680
I did it.

1241
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,880
I'm doing it.

1242
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,600
Me, yay.

1243
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,920
This one's on us.

1244
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,320
Usually when you do that stuff,

1245
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,080
it's to like let the other person know,

1246
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,520
like keep it up.

1247
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,240
You don't have to get worried until you hear him shouting

1248
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,480
something that's obviously a safe word.

1249
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,080
That's the point at which.

1250
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,200
Banana, banana.

1251
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,760
I said banana.

1252
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:22,800
You have to move.

1253
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,360
You have to move away.

1254
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,120
You can't, you can't alert him to the problem

1255
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,800
without giving him motive to kill you.

1256
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,640
Do you have a roommate that you could convince

1257
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,920
to switch rooms with you?

1258
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,280
Oh, that's not bad.

1259
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,400
That's not bad.

1260
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,840
Hey, the function of my room's off

1261
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:41,920
because the light's coming from the east or whatever

1262
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,880
and I can hear this guy.

1263
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,160
Nope, you don't know.

1264
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,640
I'm just saying like, I think I feel like

1265
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,960
you are more of a south yellow wall.

1266
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,800
Why don't you go ahead and just give my room a shot.

1267
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,280
Okay, bye.

1268
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,640
When you love to be there the first night

1269
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,520
where he comes knocking.

1270
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,240
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Kevin.

1271
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,840
Kevin, remember we switched?

1272
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,600
I would like to switch back.

1273
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,360
Oh, sorry, no takesies backsies.

1274
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,760
He's doing what?

1275
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,040
I don't know.

1276
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,240
I've never done that before.

1277
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,520
I've never heard that sound.

1278
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,040
Must have the ears of a bat.

1279
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,160
What is jerking off?

1280
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,640
Jerking off.

1281
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,120
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.

1282
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,120
Thank you so much.

1283
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Jerking out?

1284
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,120
He's jerking out.

1285
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,200
Thank you so much for listening to our comedy podcast,

1286
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,320
my brother, my brother and me.

1287
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,600
Uh, real quick.

1288
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,560
I have been neglecting to do this forever.

1289
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,600
So I wanted to say thank you to all the people

1290
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,440
who sent us Candle Nights gifts, uh, PO Box 54,

1291
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,200
Huntington, West Virginia, 25706.

1292
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,880
Wow, a little belated.

1293
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,320
A little belated, sorry.

1294
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,760
I've had this sheet of paper here.

1295
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,320
Thank you to Veronica for the horse ties.

1296
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,360
She made us horse ties.

1297
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:47,920
What?

1298
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,800
Cody Garrett sent us some fruity yummy mummy.

1299
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,200
When were you thinking about fucking like forwarding this

1300
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,640
to my PO box?

1301
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,320
Ryan sent us three scratch off Illinois lottery tickets.

1302
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,120
No winners in that.

1303
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,240
I'm sorry to report.

1304
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,520
God damn it, Justin.

1305
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,600
One's for you, one's for me, one's for Griffin.

1306
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,920
You understand that there's like a Trinity thing happening.

1307
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,760
How can I figure out how to distribute them

1308
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,280
until I saw which one's the winner?

1309
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,200
If only there was another mail system.

1310
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:11,760
Yeah, it's weird.

1311
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,840
It's like, uh, yeah, mine was the only winner.

1312
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,040
I know.

1313
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,040
I mean, our PO Box is in Huntington,

1314
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,160
so maybe we should move.

1315
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,320
Patrick and Christina sent us a book called

1316
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,200
Why Does My Horse?

1317
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,840
Uh, Roger sent us a book of country proverbs.

1318
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,640
You're gonna finish?

1319
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,080
You're gonna finish the name of the book?

1320
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,120
That's it.

1321
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,640
That's the name of it.

1322
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,000
Why Does My Horse?

1323
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,280
Why Does My Horse?

1324
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:33,920
Question mark.

1325
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,040
Uh, Josh sent us Horseopoly.

1326
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,080
Oh my God, I've played, I haven't played Horseopoly,

1327
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,160
but it's at the lake house we go to every year.

1328
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,120
It looks like a blast.

1329
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,880
Got a mammoth book of ghost romance,

1330
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,360
but I lost the label, so I'm sorry about that.

1331
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,720
People sent us some shit.

1332
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,600
That's crazy.

1333
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,080
Jesus.

1334
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,920
Yeah, Alex sent us his game Nom de Nom that he made,

1335
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,480
and Ian and Julie made us some pretzels,

1336
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,080
some power break pretzels that we could-

1337
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,880
Are they still good?

1338
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,560
They were gone.

1339
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,200
They were good.

1340
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,880
I can't fucking believe you've been hoarding presents.

1341
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,040
I've been hoarding them until you guys come visit,

1342
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,520
which is-

1343
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,280
FedEx, I'll pay for the FedEx.

1344
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:11,760
I'll pay for you to forward that shit for pretzels.

1345
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,320
You know.

1346
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,200
Listen, thank you.

1347
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,800
Thank you.

1348
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,840
Also, thanks for the wedding invite to Stephanie and Philip,

1349
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,640
who are getting married in Singapore in like two weeks.

1350
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,200
So thank you.

1351
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,320
I'll be there.

1352
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,480
Can't make it, but we sure appreciate you sending that out.

1353
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,480
I can't make it, because here's the problem.

1354
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,640
I've only had like three minutes to prepare,

1355
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,880
and not the four months that you fucking intended.

1356
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,160
Should we talk about the live show?

1357
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,800
Because we're doing a fucking lot of them now.

1358
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,840
Yeah, okay.

1359
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,880
So here's the deal.

1360
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,120
We sort of, we decided to do shows in New York,

1361
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,720
and when we decided to do them,

1362
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,240
we didn't know how many people were going to come out,

1363
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,480
so we didn't want to get like a massive-

1364
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,760
We thought 12 at most.

1365
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,040
Tops.

1366
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,160
So what happened was,

1367
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,080
we basically sold out two of our shows

1368
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,840
at the People's Improv Theater pretty much almost instantly.

1369
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,400
They were up for like the night.

1370
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,840
We published them in the afternoon,

1371
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,520
it was up and it was sold out in the morning.

1372
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,120
Then we released more tickets.

1373
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,560
They went up a little bit earlier than we intended.

1374
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,480
We didn't have any control over that,

1375
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,160
but the trigger got pulled a little bit early,

1376
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,280
and so there were people who set calendar alerts and shit

1377
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,280
for the time that they were supposed to go on sale,

1378
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,360
and they were sold out long before it got there,

1379
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,080
which we are very sorry for.

1380
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,440
So here's the insanity.

1381
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,720
At 1.30 on Saturday, May 24th,

1382
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,560
we were doing yet another show

1383
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,400
at the People's Improv Theater.

1384
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,960
You can get tickets this Wednesday at exactly,

1385
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,400
we have been assured, exactly noon EST.

1386
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,240
That'll be the 9th, April 9th.

1387
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,040
April 9th, Wednesday, noon EST.

1388
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,320
If you don't listen to the show early, we're sorry.

1389
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,400
We also put it on like our social media and stuff,

1390
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,320
but that's the deal, okay?

1391
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,560
Noon EST this Wednesday.

1392
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,680
If you already have tickets to one of the two other shows,

1393
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,720
please like-

1394
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,520
That's the other thing, please.

1395
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,440
We saw a lot of people like do that

1396
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:10,560
to come to both shows, and it's great

1397
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,960
that you guys want to spend that much time with us,

1398
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,800
and you're very sweet, but please,

1399
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,680
don't get tickets to this other one,

1400
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,840
because there are a lot more people who want to come.

1401
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,200
If there end up day of being tickets left or whatever,

1402
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,600
then by all means, please come to all three.

1403
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,800
That probably will not happen, we hope.

1404
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,440
No.

1405
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,120
We wouldn't think so, but please don't buy tickets

1406
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,920
if you already have them.

1407
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,520
And that sounds like the most egotistical thing in the world,

1408
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,720
but that's the deal.

1409
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,680
So please don't do that.

1410
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,880
Anyway, you can get- We literally can't add any more shows.

1411
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,800
No, Justin's doing, so it's Sawbones,

1412
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,240
and my brother, my brother and me.

1413
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,160
Justin's doing six podcasts in one day.

1414
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,360
It's fucking insane.

1415
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,680
I don't know how it's gonna work yet.

1416
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,680
But we're doing it for you because we love you.

1417
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,520
Yeah, it's not, there's no other reason

1418
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,440
other than there are a lot of sad people

1419
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,600
and we didn't want that, so that's what we're doing.

1420
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,440
And as far as like hanging out afterwards,

1421
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,400
I don't know, because we were doing six shows.

1422
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,920
I don't know when we're gonna be-

1423
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,360
But maybe in between.

1424
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,160
You can give us like a power bar and like a Gatorade.

1425
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:11,360
Yeah, really, no kidding.

1426
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,840
Yeah, if people want to bring me some like Pepsi Max,

1427
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,760
that would be like greatly appreciated.

1428
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,920
If you can find Josta, then we would really appreciate some Josta.

1429
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,840
Maybe just some fries or something would be great.

1430
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,280
See, I say that as a joke now,

1431
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,880
knowing that people will actually deliver,

1432
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,760
which would be amazing.

1433
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,120
The pit-nyc.com is the address,

1434
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,680
the web address where you can find those.

1435
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,280
If you look at their calendar section,

1436
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,960
you'll see where those tickets are gonna pop up.

1437
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,040
You can also follow them on Twitter.

1438
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:43,120
I'm sure they'll tweet right as those go available.

1439
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,480
But anyway, that's what you need to do.

1440
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,440
Please come and see us.

1441
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,560
You are great.

1442
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,960
I also want to thank Nature Box for supporting the show.

1443
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,600

1444

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,360
I also want to say thank you to Hulu Plus,

1450
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,640
who once again, this is I think the 27th time

1451
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,080
we've told you to go check it out.

1452
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,080
So if you haven't done it yet, you're a dummy.

1453
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,200
So go check it out now

1454
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,840

1457
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,520
I want to thank John Roderick and The Long Winters

1458
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,200
for the use of our theme song, It's a Departure,

1459
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,880
off the album, Putting the Days to Bed.

1460
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:28,720
It's a really great album.

1461
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,960
We got an email from somebody actually,

1462
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,480
I think had a question on this show

1463
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,480
who said they were hanging out with John Roderick

1464
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,720
talking about how they got into The Long Winters

1465
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,880
because of us and that's so crazy to me

1466
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,240
because before we did the show,

1467
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,200
I recommended that band to so many people.

1468
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:43,920
So I don't know.

1469
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,200
It's cool that we have a weird vehicle to do that more

1470
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,680
because they're really, really, really good.

1471
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:52,640
That's it.

1472
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,840
I want to hear one more question.

1473
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,160
Oh, go to maximumfun.org.

1474
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,520
You can listen to all the other great shows there.

1475
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,440
There's Jordan Just To Go, Judge John Hodgman,

1476
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,680
Stop Podcasting Yourself, The Goose Down, Lady to Lady,

1477
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,800
Oh No, Ross and Carrie.

1478
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:08,400
Song Exploder.

1479
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:08,960
Song Exploder.

1480
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,000
Bam Bam Pow.

1481
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:10,320
Yeah.

1482
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:11,920
Sawbones.

1483
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,640
I make a medical history podcast with my wife called Sawbones.

1484
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,360
She's a doctor.

1485
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,880
I'm an idiot and it's fun.

1486
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:17,760
It's good to listen.

1487
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,920
It's my wife's favorite podcast on the network.

1488
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,440
Take that.

1489
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,320
So there's that.

1490
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,600
So there's that to deal with.

1491
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,000
Anyway, go listen to all those shows.

1492
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,080
We need one more question from Griffin.

1493
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,320
Sure, this one was sent in by Emerald member Drew Davenport.

1494
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,040
Thank you, Drew.

1495
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:36,080
It's by Yahoo answer suzer Philip who asks,

1496
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,080
what kind of car does Judge Judy own?

1497
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,080
I'm Justin McElroy.

1498
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,120
I'm Travis McElroy.

1499
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,080
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1500
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,360
This has been my brother and brother and me.

1501
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,000
Kiss your dad.

1502
01:02:48,000 --> 01:03:02,480
Score on the lips.

1503
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:08,400
Maximumfun.org.

1504
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,440
Comedy and culture.

1505
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,560
Artist owned.

1506
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,760
Listener supported.

1507
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,640
I'm Carrie Poppy.

1508
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:13,520
I'm Ross Botcher.

1509
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,560
And we make a show.

1510
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:15,680
Oh no, Ross and Carrie.

1511
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,400
Oh no.

1512
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
We investigate fringe science.

1513
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,440
Spirituality.

1514
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,400
Religious groups.

1515
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,760
Alternative therapies.

1516
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,640
We put ourselves through a lot of uncomfortable situations.

1517
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,760
So that you don't have to.

1518
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,360
Because really, why would you?

1519
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,360
For example, I watched a tube be inserted into Ross's anus.

1520
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,840
That's true, but it sounds terrible out of context.

1521
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:36,800
We've tried penis and breast enlargement pills.

1522
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,280
We spent six months undercover becoming Mormons.

1523
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,040
We hung out with the 9-11 truthers.

1524
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,800
The UFO cult, the Raelians.

1525
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,680
And we're going to do more.

1526
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,800
It's one of the newest shows on Maximumfun.org.
