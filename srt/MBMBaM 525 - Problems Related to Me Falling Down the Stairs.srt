1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother, me, and advice show for the

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,000
Mungin era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy. I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy. It's time. That's right. The fall is here.

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,080
The fall has fallen. The fall has fallen. I have an exciting Munch Squad episode right here at the

9
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,720
beginning of the show that I feel like apropos. I would love to set the tone if I could, if I

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,320
could invite you guys in. Yes, please. Okay, come with me. Okay. Let's just step behind this curtain

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:26,640
here. Now, I am going to make a quick call on my phone. Who am I going to be calling, you ask? Well,

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,360
Starbuck. Hello, this is David. Oh, Travis was doing some foley work. I thought it'd be fun if

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,200
I could do foley work too, but I didn't really know where to put it. Okay. Hello, this is David.

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:48,880
Hi, David. What's your role here? I'm a vampire. Oh, that's a fun choice. I don't know what we're

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,480
fucking doing. No, no, no. I like it. Wait, hold on. We'll get back to Justin's thing in a second,

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,600
but let's roll with this. I'm an autumn vampire. Halloween's just around the corner.

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,640
Starbucks has declared that fall has begun, and the pumpkin spice latte is returning,

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,880
according to Curious, our magazine, a magazine for the quick service restaurant industry. And

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,120
I did want to just set the tone because I'm so excited to say that it came back two days ago

20
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,120
as we're recording this, but as you were listening to it, it came out August 25th.

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,120
So Starbucks is like, hey, listen, we can't do a lot, but maybe this. Does this do anything?

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,240
Is this anything? This is sort of like the one gif of Donald Glover walking into the room with

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,680
pizza from Community, you remember, and the whole place is on fire, and he turns around and walk

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,720
away. Love that gif. Love that gif. Except he's holding huge cups of pumpkin spice latte, and he

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,400
does attempt to up in the cups onto the fire to see if it does anything. Maybe this does something.

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Hey, can I also just say, this year, and maybe Justin Griffin will go along with me on this,

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,120
I would like to play some moratorium on making jokes about pumpkin spice lattes and everything,

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,920
because I think pumpkin spice is the least of our worries this year.

29
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,600
Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish. Bigger fish.

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,640
Starbucks has made this even more exciting and meaningful this fall with the fall hotline,

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,640
1-833-GET-FALL. Get fucked. I don't know what to expect, but I'm calling right now,

32
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,480
and we'll just all sort of experience this together and see what happens.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,440
Hey there, all you hayriders, leaf breakers, and pumpkin spice lovers.

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,600
If you're coming here to spice up your leaf life, then you have definitely come to the

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,040
right place. Thou one to head out on a hayride. Thou two to practice your pumpkin mantras.

36
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,560
Thou three to cozy up with your cup. Thou four to hear flannel on repeat.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,600
Thou five to adventure to the pumpkin cream cold brew falls.

38
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:07,680
Thou six for endless PSL perfection. Thou seven to go on a lovely leaf crunching stroll.

39
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,360
Thou eight to knit sweaters with grandpa. And if you get lost,

40
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
just dial nine to be directed back to the main menu.

41
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,840
Close your eyes while your mind walks through a forest of fall fields.

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,040
Ooh, this is nice. Can I get some more treble in the mix, Starbucks?

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,440
Oh god. Being out here reminds me of what life is all about. Finding laughter, love, and leaves.

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Also, I need to borrow like a thousand dollars. I promise you I'll pay you back.

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,840
Can you imagine? I have an opportunity for free money. Hey, quack if you love pumpkin spice.

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't give the ducks pumpkin spice, please. It will make them very sick.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,880
He's feeding it to the ducks. Let's go on a hayride.

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
Oh, this is fun. One round trip around the pumpkin patch coming right up.

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
Take me. Oh no, Tommy fell under the wheel.

50
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:19,920
He's dead. We got to go back. He can't play a banjo. Tommy's dead. He's dead, man.

51
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,400
You want to hear the one about fucking your cup? I'll start the fire.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,400
What? Wait, is this the cup's voice talking? I'm burning your house down around here.

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,040
You better get to a Starbucks quick. It's the only safe place.

54
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,880
This is for the insurance money. It's what you were hinting at, right?

55
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,800
We both agreed. I'd kill your mom. You kill my dad.

56
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,280
It is wrong to wear fuzzy socks and footy pajamas. I don't want to be right.

57
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,560
Wait, what about the fire? What? The fire is happening.

58
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,920
The fire is happening. Also, why would you wear footy pajamas and fuzzy socks?

59
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Yeah. Oh, Susan, you're here. I wasn't expecting to see you.

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
What's that in the back behind the counter? Is that Tommy's ghost?

61
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,120
I don't know what they say. When the leaves start falling,

62
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,320
the BSLs start calling. He liked that. He liked that one.

63
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,280
More whip, please. Can you do that?

64
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,800
You've had enough whip, sir. Hey, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

65
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,960
More whip. More whip.

66
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:59,360
He's just blowing the foam off into the guy's face. Is that more whip again?

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,160
You work for me, Jerry. No, my name's not Jerry.

68
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
It's Tommy. Oh, no.

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,640
Floats off into PSL ghost. So anyway, there is a cult about

70
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,400
pumpkin spice lattes that Starbucks has been fostering for years.

71
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,320
That's fine. Rush into a Starbucks.

72
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,520
Crap. Fill that place. Fill it up with warm bodies.

73
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,320
Close as you can pack them. Like sardines.

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,400
To the window, to the wall, till the leaves all start to fall.

75
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,320
It's pumpkin spice latte season. So welcome to fall.

76
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
The autumnal energy is strong here on this episode.

77
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,680
It's 104 Fahrenheit degrees outside. Still doing summer here.

78
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,400
Looking forward to the PSL. You know what I call that?

79
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,600
Hot fall. There's hot fall.

80
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
There's cold fall. There's green fall.

81
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,000
And there's fall fall. That's it.

82
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,840
Hey, are you guys... I don't want to keep distracting Fred.

83
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,000
This is an advice show. We will get to the advice.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
It's kind of a weird time. Things are weird.

85
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,000
I just want this to be a weird show. It feels appropriately weird.

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Are you guys getting a lot of weird political texts from people

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
who supposedly are sort of on your team?

88
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,480
Fucking pretty wild. Let's talk about this.

89
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,200
So Trav, I know you got one and yours tops mine.

90
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
So I want to just share mine first.

91
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,120
Literally, as we started recording, I got this text.

92
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,280
With just 12 hours to go, Joe Biden is rapidly dropping in the polls.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,640
Undecided voters love Trump's convention and no one is donating to our texts.

94
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
That's a fundraising bitch.

95
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,680
First off, what happens in 12 hours?

96
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,180
Yeah.

97
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,880
Are we voting in 12 hours? That's very unnerving.

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,240
It's voting. When the leaves start to fall,

99
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,920
you have 24 hours to vote for the American president.

100
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
Now I receive a text.

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,600
James Carville here. As a lifelong Cajun, I've seen them all.

102
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,880
This is a text in which James Carville is telling me

103
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,920
who to vote for in the Louisiana election.

104
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,720
And I am uncertain why I'm on this list and how I might use this information.

105
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
Have you got any fun texts?

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,480
All mine are very- are porny.

107
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,800
I just get weird, porny texts.

108
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,880
And I get the weird, porny texts to me in a bunch of other 304 numbers.

109
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,280
And there's always somebody in the 304 numbers that's like,

110
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,800
what's your fucking problem?

111
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm gonna come fucking-

112
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,520
Somebody will send it and be like, do you want to see my wet butt?

113
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,560
And then some random Huntingtonian will be like,

114
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,960
I'm gonna fucking kill you in my car.

115
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,560
When that happens to me, it's 20 West Virginians,

116
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,000
20 rowdy West Virginians that they've gathered into one text thread

117
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,200
who are not pleased.

118
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,080
So this is a thread of people.

119
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,760
Each one of the texts I'm about to read you is from a different phone number, okay?

120
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
So we all get the spam text.

121
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,400
And then someone texts, picture of a stop sign.

122
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,880
Stop.

123
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,320
Next person.

124
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,040
No kidding.

125
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
Next person.

126
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,200
Stop.

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Next person.

128
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,120
Stop.

129
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
And then they've included the email address of the person that sent out the initial text.

130
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
By person, of course, I mean robot who is not reading this.

131
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,400
Next person, all caps.

132
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:26,960
Stop.

133
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Right after that.

134
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,480
Quick texting me, asshole.

135
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,040
I'm getting same text messages from a third party.

136
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,160
It's called spam.

137
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,520
Just delete the damn things.

138
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,040
Next person.

139
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,400
It's not me.

140
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm trying to get this mess off my phone.

141
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,760
Next person.

142
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,640
Trying to get these guys off my phone.

143
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
I am not texting you.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,360
They're saying this in a text message to the entire group.

145
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
Last person.

146
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,740
Okay.

147
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
And then they were done.

148
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,840
And then everyone got the memo.

149
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,360
Do you guys ever get these?

150
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
I get them sometimes where it's like,

151
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,680
hey, it's dad, I left my medication at your house.

152
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
Please call me.

153
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,520
Please.

154
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,560
I need that medication so bad.

155
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
And it's using dad's phone number.

156
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Dad's phone number.

157
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,480
It's like someone got hacked.

158
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:14,800
Yeah.

159
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
And I'm like, spam.

160
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
And he's like, no, please.

161
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,160
I need this.

162
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm having my dark cravings again.

163
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,360
Please.

164
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Daddy likes his medicine.

165
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,520
Can we do a question?

166
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,880
My cat, who I assume was lost for over three years, has reappeared in my neighbor's window.

167
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,240
The perfect crime.

168
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,640
I don't want to take her back, but I do want to visit her as she acknowledges my presence

169
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,480
through the clear window.

170
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
Problem is, I'm very socially awkward, and I don't know what to say to my elderly woman

171
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
neighbor in order to visit my courageous calico kitty.

172
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
Thank you for the alliteration.

173
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,080
It's very much appreciated.

174
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Brothers, how do I visit my cat at my neighbor's house?

175
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,280
That's from Kitty Conundrum in the Keystone State.

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,200
What's wild about this is that the middle road that you're attempting to find here

177
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,640
is the wildest option.

178
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,400
The two options you have are nothing or full blown Liam Neeson smash in the front door,

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,520
grab the cat, smoke bomb, rappel out the window like, this is my fucking cat.

180
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,600
The commuter.

181
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:16,720
What's that?

182
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
The commuter.

183
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,700
Huh.

184
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,160
So there's a movie called The Commuter starring Liam Neeson.

185
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah, but that's not-

186
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,160
What happens in it?

187
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,000
And I changed that to the commuter.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,960
What happens in the movie?

189
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,720
So he steals his cat, it's his neighbor, and he has to get in-

190
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Why wouldn't they just call that movie The Commuter then?

191
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
Because it's trademarked by me just now.

192
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,200
But this is after the movie came out.

193
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,280
Love Actually.

194
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,320
Now that's a movie part.

195
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,880
Now that's a feel.

196
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,640
No, but you would call it My Cat Actually, because you would say, that's my cat actually.

197
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,760
My cat actually.

198
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,640
Walking into this house and be like, hey, what's up?

199
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,080
You stole my cat.

200
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Can I pet it?

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,360
Is fucking out of this world.

202
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,960
It's the hardest possible one, right?

203
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,040
Because there's not a decent human being on earth who-

204
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,960
I mean, one of two things will happen, right?

205
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,680
If you say, hey, that's my cat, then the neighbor, who is also a person with their own thoughts

206
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,840
and feelings, will say, well, you should take this cat back.

207
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,680
I don't want to be a cat thief.

208
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,480
That sucks.

209
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,520
Or I've been watching this cat for two years.

210
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,960
You need to go home.

211
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,520
This cat and you don't live together anymore.

212
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,640
They don't know who you are.

213
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,600
There is no middle ground where they're like, joint custody, maybe?

214
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
May we share the cat?

215
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,680
Nights and weekends?

216
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,480
Counterpoint.

217
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,560
Okay, you ready for this?

218
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,240
Meanderpoint.

219
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,880
Meanderpoint.

220
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,640
Yes, hello.

221
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,280
Hi, I wanted to visit Cinnamon.

222
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,200
Is Cinnamon home?

223
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,520
Excuse me?

224
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,360
Cinnamon, the cat, used to live with me, now lives with you.

225
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,160
Totally cool.

226
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,960
I just wanted to check in and see how Cinnamon's doing.

227
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,960
I can tell you're having trouble hearing me.

228
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,680
Let me remove my face mask and get even closer to you.

229
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,800
Okay, go ahead.

230
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm here to visit the cat.

231
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920
I'm willing to do it here on the porch if you don't want me to come in your home.

232
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,880
Can you pretend there's something that the cat left at your house that it is probably missing?

233
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Like this dead mouse.

234
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
I know you have Mr. Cinnamon here, he left his vape pen at my house.

235
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,120
If you will please take it back just so he has his chunky ADV that he craves.

236
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
And don't forget, he likes his food warmed up.

237
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Can you not just open the front door and crack a can of Star Kist and just wait?

238
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,960
The cat will find it.

239
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,800
The cat will find a way.

240
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
The cat's gonna get out there.

241
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,040
That's a good point.

242
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
I mean, it'll open the door.

243
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,320
Just open a Star Kist outside.

244
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,360
What if the reason you finally, after all this time, saw your cat in the window

245
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,920
is your cat was trying to signal you that it needs rescued.

246
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
This is the first time the cat was able to get your attention.

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,080
It's like, get me out of here.

248
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,320
This lady thinks that I am her son.

249
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Please.

250
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,480
Cats do have this one unique ability.

251
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,840
If you open the Star Kist can near an open window,

252
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,760
they could actually float out on the waves, the stink waves.

253
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,800
Yeah, I've heard that.

254
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,760
I've seen that happen.

255
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:33,600
If it makes you feel any better, the cat does not remember you.

256
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:33,840
No.

257
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,120
If that lessens the burden in any way, this cat does not remember you.

258
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,400
Dog would.

259
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,920
Yes, absolutely.

260
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
I've seen those videos of hero soldiers.

261
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
The dog would.

262
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,640
Okay, the cat does not care.

263
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,320
You ever see one of those videos of the cat?

264
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
Absolutely not.

265
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,560
I think we've talked about this before,

266
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
but it's the most unbelievable part of the Incredible Journey.

267
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,800
Was it called with the two dogs and the one cat,

268
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,720
that the two dogs had crossed the bound?

269
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Homeward Bound, thank you.

270
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,520
The Incredible Animals Journeys.

271
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,920
Yes, where the two dogs, yeah, I believe that.

272
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,520
Two dogs, they would jump over the Grand Canyon.

273
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,440
The fact that the cat's like, I'm also gonna go with you two dogs?

274
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
No way.

275
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,840
I think it was called Pet Friends on the Road.

276
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,320
I think it was just called Rambling Pets.

277
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,800
Hey, can I do a Yahoo?

278
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,840
Yeah, please.

279
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,360
This Yahoo was sent in by, this is an interesting one.

280
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,960
And I'm really just gonna, it was sent in by Emma Cant, thank you, Emma.

281
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,480
And I'm just gonna ask it.

282
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,640
And then I'm gonna go one, two, three,

283
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,240
and then everybody say their answer.

284
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
And we're not gonna do anything else on it.

285
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
I'm just really, like I saw this and I was like,

286
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,720
this isn't a good question.

287
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,920
It was just an interesting sort of,

288
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,560
like Myers-Briggs personality test.

289
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,520
So I'm gonna ask it.

290
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,160
It was from a Yahoo Answers user, Frost,

291
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,800
or perhaps Frayge, who asks.

292
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,840
And again, I'm gonna ask it.

293
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,680
And then one, two, three, and say it.

294
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
And don't make it, don't be funny.

295
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,080
Don't do your usual joke bullshit.

296
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,880
Like let's pretend like we have a bit of respect

297
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,920
for this podcast and its listeners.

298
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,640
Griffin, I have never once been funny on this show.

299
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,140
Good.

300
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Frayge asks,

301
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,600
which chess piece is the sexiest?

302
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,760
One, two, three, bishop.

303
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,480
Knight.

304
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,980
Rook.

305
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,880
Okay, we all said different shit.

306
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,560
I thought for sure we'd all say bishop.

307
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,680
Well, the rook is the least sexiest, Justin, I'm sorry.

308
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,640
It's got like a bunch of different,

309
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,120
it's got the closest to a hand.

310
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,180
Fair?

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
I didn't even think about that.

312
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,360
Now hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

313
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,800
We have not established criteria.

314
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,880
I said we weren't gonna, I said we weren't gonna talk.

315
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,160
I know, I'm sorry Griffin,

316
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,240
but I was thinking about it in terms of sexiest to look at.

317
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,280
Knight, the idea is sexy.

318
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,440
Travis wasn't even thinking about finishing.

319
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,360
Yeah, I was thinking about like if I was working in an office

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,040
and it was like a break time and I looked out the window

321
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,400
and I saw this chess piece cracking open a cold Diet Coke

322
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,680
whilst working on the construction site across the way,

323
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,200
which one would I most enjoy?

324
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,560
I don't want you.

325
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,000
What I most enjoy looking at, the knight.

326
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,320
You're just gonna keep it at a distance,

327
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,720
a romantic dalliance for your daydreams.

328
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
Listen, I'm saying that maybe this is a aspiration

329
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
or maybe it's just perhaps, if you will,

330
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
fuel for the fire back home.

331
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,440
I am not looking for an entanglement with this chess piece,

332
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,080
but I like the idea of a knight and I think it's a sexy course.

333
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,280
I don't, maybe this isn't the fucking PC thing to say,

334
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,240
but I'd rather get to know the chess piece's mind first

335
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
because that's what's sexy to me.

336
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
Neither one of us went for power though.

337
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
None of us went for like queen or king.

338
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
We all, we know our plays.

339
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,440
Yeah, like we know, we know where we pull, okay?

340
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,760
But all of us rose above pawn.

341
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,040
No one said pawn.

342
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,800
Well, no, we're better than that.

343
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,720
All right, come on, there's lots of those.

344
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,080
I'm just saying if I could have all the pawns,

345
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,320
then we may be into something of a situation.

346
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,920
Now, Griffin, you said bishop.

347
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,640
Does the religious aspect not scare you off there at all?

348
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,720
Well, that's not what I was thinking about, Travis.

349
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,560
But I don't, again, I said,

350
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,960
when I said we're not gonna talk about it,

351
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,280
it's because I didn't really want to get into it

352
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
and I thought that you guys would share my feelings.

353
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:29,680
But I guess depending on-

354
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
Hey Griffin, can I just, can I say one word

355
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
and you tell me if I nailed it?

356
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,120
Yeah.

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,320
Curvature.

358
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm gonna try one, slot.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,120
Here's another Yahoo.

360
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,240
No Griffin, who was right?

361
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,040
I mean, depending on how you look at the bishop,

362
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,800
it could either look like a peepee or a jug.

363
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,360
This Yahoo is sent in by Johannes.

364
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,560
Johannes, thank you, it's from Yahoo Answers user Christopher

365
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,160
who asks, if Adidas started selling t-shirts

366
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,320
with photos of your face on them, how would you react?

367
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,080
Confused it for, if I'm being honest,

368
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,400
why I was chosen-

369
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Not supposed to be confused.

370
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,360
Yeah, why was I chosen to represent any sport?

371
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Confusion wouldn't even be, well, first of all,

372
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,360
you wouldn't be representing a sport, right?

373
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,920
Like it wouldn't have you and then like,

374
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,600
you know, the New England Patriots logo, probably.

375
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,200
No, I'm not saying a team.

376
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,520
I'm saying that Adidas, as you have said,

377
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,720
is a sporting goods company, are they not?

378
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,640
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that you represent sports.

379
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,400
It just means Adidas thought that your face

380
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
would be cool to put on a t-shirt.

381
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,120
I think confusion would be the first reaction for most of us

382
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,920
and then it would continue to be the reaction for a while.

383
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,320
I wanna know what goes deeper than that.

384
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,920
Can I be honest, Griffin?

385
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,160
Please.

386
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
Deeper confusion.

387
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,000
Because at first, I would be confused

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
why Adidas has chosen me.

389
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,960
But then I would start to think, how did Adidas get this photo?

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,280
Who within the Adidas Corporation was like,

391
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,560
I guess, looking on perhaps Instagram or my Facebook?

392
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,480
Yeah, it's your Facebook profile photo

393
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,920
and then you get upset about it

394
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,160
and fucking Zuck is like, this allowed.

395
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,120
You put it on Facebook.

396
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,400
It's mine now.

397
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,560
It's mine now and I gave it to Adidas.

398
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,040
They were scrolling by and they would have just thought,

399
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,960
this is aesthetically pleasing enough

400
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,800
that it will sell t-shirts.

401
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Then I guess maybe flattered might be.

402
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,320
Do you think that's buried in the TOS somewhere

403
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,520
when you go on Facebook?

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,960
Like Zuck's just like, hey, Zuck,

405
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,880
I hope you're not reading any of this legal stuff

406
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,480
because I'm gonna sell all your shit to Adidas.

407
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,640
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

408
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,960
All day I dream about screwing you over.

409
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
You know what I mean?

410
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,640
It'd be like, and then I'll be out on the street

411
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,000
and I'll see somebody walking.

412
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,040
I'll be like, man, their shoes look like my bare feet.

413
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,400
And then it turns out Adidas has gotten my feet off Facebook.

414
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,720
That explains why they have made those pants

415
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,760
that look like my naked body from the waist down.

416
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,800
Your new legs, yeah.

417
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,400
It's your beepus and butt and everything

418
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,640
is on these new Adidas track pants.

419
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
It's your beepus and butt, your hairy legs, my feet,

420
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,320
and Justin's face is like the whole torso.

421
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,680
Now here's what I imagine happens.

422
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,000
I go to Adidas and I say, hey, what the fuck?

423
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,720
And then they say, well, turns out your body

424
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,560
is perfectly aerodynamic.

425
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Your body is the most, you are like a blade

426
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,320
moving through the wind.

427
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,240
And so now every sporter wants their body

428
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,120
shaped like your body.

429
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
And I'll say, can I have some money please?

430
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,240
And they'll say, you don't own your body.

431
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
God owns your body.

432
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,960
God owns your body and Zuck.

433
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,080
Also that explains why all the new formula one races

434
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,800
we've been seeing lately are just big paper mache

435
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,920
Travis heads just zooming around the track so fast.

436
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,600
Nature's arrow.

437
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,680
Nature's arrow, Travis's face, which makes it

438
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,040
all the more upsetting when there's a big accident

439
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,400
on the field because that's my brother's head

440
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,000
just going all topsy-turvy.

441
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,400
But it also explains why they've put those amplifiers

442
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,640
in the mouth so the cars are just screaming

443
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,960
as they go around very scary.

444
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
And Travis, you said the first thing you do is,

445
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,960
and I quote, and Justin back me up on this.

446
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,720
You go to Adidas.

447
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,640
Tell me what that looks like.

448
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,320
I want you to, you see on the street today-

449
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,880
Well I imagine they're pretty, they're joys

450
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,920
that I'm there.

451
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,440
It's him, they'll say.

452
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
Okay, stop.

453
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,200
Stop it.

454
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,560
Listen to me and use your fucking brain for once.

455
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,440
You see someone's face, you see your face

456
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,480
on both a t-shirt and an Adidas sponsored

457
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
formula one race car.

458
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
You say, that's fucked up.

459
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,440
I should go to Adidas about that.

460
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,280
Now tell me literally the next thing that happens

461
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
and don't say, go to Adidas.

462
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,280
I'd probably tweet at them.

463
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
Like, where can I find you?

464
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,440
Where are you?

465
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,200
And they would say, well, yes, of course,

466
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,400
you're the face of Adidas.

467
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,400
Please come visit us.

468
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,360
Yeah, not enough people are tweeting at brands.

469
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,160
Where are you?

470
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,280
Where are you?

471
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,640
Where are you right now?

472
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,600
I gotta get over there.

473
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,840
Do you guys know what Adidas stands for?

474
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,280
All day I dream about soccer.

475
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Hey Griffin.

476
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,880
That is what I thought it was so far.

477
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,040
Yeah, it's named for its owner, Adi Dassler.

478
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,280
It was founded in 1924 in Germany, Adi Dassler.

479
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,520
More like Daddy Dassler.

480
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,360
Yeah, but of course, don't tell that to Jonathan Davis

481
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,920
who heard one day someone said,

482
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,320
you know, it stands for all day I dream about sex, right?

483
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,120
And he's like, fuck, that's funny.

484
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,480
I'm gonna sit down and write a song.

485
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,440
I can't tell about that.

486
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,040
Yeah, that's awesome.

487
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,240
I think I would be disappointed.

488
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,360
I think that would be the arc.

489
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,920
I think I'd be confused and then flattered

490
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,040
and then disappointed

491
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
because I wouldn't get any money.

492
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
If it's your face, Travis,

493
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,680
I know what fucking face it's gonna be

494
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,120
because you have a fucking...

495
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,720
The face you make in all the fucking pics

496
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,720
that you're always sharing to people,

497
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
you've trademarked, you've patented that face.

498
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,040
I get it.

499
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't know which one I'm gonna have on there.

500
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't have a go-to face.

501
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
Maybe it's your face that you make

502
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,520
when I've just said something that is dumb

503
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,360
and you kind of curl up one eyebrow

504
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,360
and your mouth twists into this little...

505
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,080
That's the rock.

506
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,120
You're thinking of the rock again.

507
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,680
Ah, damn it, you're right.

508
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,480
I don't do that one.

509
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,840
The rock does that one.

510
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,360
I've seen you do it.

511
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,120
I make a lot of faces in photos

512
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,920
that a lot of people see them

513
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,600
and have to wonder,

514
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,120
what did he just do before this photo was taken?

515
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Because it seems unscrupulous.

516
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,760
It's a little...

517
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,440
You're impish, for sure.

518
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,680
You have a certain impish quality about you.

519
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,640
But like a stinky, bad imp.

520
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
You're not like a devilish trickster,

521
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,120
like a real garbage.

522
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,640
Justin, would you make the face

523
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,160
that you think would be on the t-shirt,

524
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,880
make it right now?

525
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:03,760
Okay.

526
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Oh yeah, that's it.

527
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,680
That's how I am.

528
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,480
So my dad owns a small family business

529
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,240
that used to be my grandfather's.

530
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,480
My siblings and I have made many attempts

531
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,080
to bring him in the 21st century over the years

532
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,120
with very success.

533
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
The big hurdle is this.

534
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,840
He brings his work desktop computer with him

535
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,520
when he travels.

536
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
Going on a Disney cruise with my mom

537
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,960
brings the desktop and sets it up in the cabin.

538
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,040
Monitor, keyboard, tower, mouse.

539
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,120
His favorite mouse pad.

540
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,680
Everything comes with him.

541
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,000
No matter how short or long the trip.

542
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
We bought him a laptop last year

543
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,880
and set it up for him.

544
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,280
And he and my mom only use it to Zoom with us.

545
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,600
He said laptops aren't for work

546
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,200
because you can't trust them.

547
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,960
We are fully at the end of our collective rope here.

548
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,640
Is there no hope for him?

549
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
Will he never know the joy of a travel size computer

550
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,680
that's from Luddites of Long Island?

551
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,320
Holy shit.

552
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,120
Holy fuck.

553
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,560
That's so good.

554
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,680
It's rough.

555
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,160
You know, I will say it didn't occur to me

556
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
until Justin was reading it.

557
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,760
You can't trust and comment

558
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,800
if you just look at the construction,

559
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:17,440
there is no built-in lock point in a desktop computer

560
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,400
because no one is ever cruising around the Starbucks

561
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,480
looking for unwatched towers that they might spear it away.

562
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,840
Yeah, no one's gonna steal your tower.

563
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,320
Because you see a laptop

564
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,880
and there's also a certain guarantee of

565
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,720
this is a functioning computer.

566
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,040
But a lot of desktop towers,

567
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,280
unless it has some like dope ass LEDs

568
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,920
and some fucking real gamer coolers up in it,

569
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,720
I'm just gonna assume it's running fucking Windows 95.

570
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,040
Yeah, with this cat.

571
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
Yeah, that would be sick

572
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
if he didn't have like a monstrous vapor.

573
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
He's bit mining.

574
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,760
I can't use my laptop

575
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,560
because I've melted my third video card this week.

576
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
Maybe that was your grandfather,

577
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,880
like an esports gamer

578
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,720
and now your dad has taken over

579
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,080
and he's disappointed because you aren't into esports.

580
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,120
You're out there, I don't know,

581
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,800
maybe studying law or whatever

582
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,440
and he's disappointed that you didn't follow along.

583
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,480
I brought the laptop with me on the trip now

584
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,160
and look at my fucking frame count.

585
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Right now I'm gonna jack up control to ultra.

586
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,000
I was supposed to raid with my group later

587
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,280
and fucking look at this.

588
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,400
Look at this fucking shit.

589
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,280
You think anybody else on this cruise is ray tracing?

590
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,440
I'm the only one ray tracing on this cruise.

591
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:37,940
Come on.

592
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
This is wild, this is wild.

593
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,840
This laptop melted my dick off.

594
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,360
This is how I fucking run it.

595
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,240
That's how I run this shit.

596
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
That's how I run these hogs.

597
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,440
I actually have five computers

598
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,560
because I keep burning them up and rebuilding them.

599
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,400
I lost my dang Bitcoin.

600
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,960
Someone took my laptop, stole my dang Bitcoin.

601
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,200
Jingle-jangled right out of my freaking pocket, man.

602
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,240
Wait, can you trust laptops?

603
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:04,640
No.

604
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,400
Hold on, can you trust them?

605
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
They have the built-in camera.

606
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,280
Do you think that's what it means?

607
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,320
No, I think it's, hey, you look at those babies,

608
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,520
man, a desktop, a hard G tower,

609
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,320
you could drop that shit of a two-story building.

610
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,720
A laptop-

611
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,920
And it would break and explode.

612
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,520
And it break and a thousand-

613
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,160
A laptop, you accidentally leave a pencil in there,

614
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,120
it's done.

615
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,040
Why do you have a pencil inside your laptop?

616
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,880
Because I forgot it wasn't a book.

617
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,640
Yeah, I had a MacBook a few years back

618
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,640
and I lost a particularly frustrating game of chess

619
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,640
and I punched the keys so hard

620
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,160
and it only took one punch for it to get all bent up,

621
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,280
not working no more.

622
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
Not like a tower.

623
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,400
I'm glad that a media company

624
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,240
I was formerly in the employ of,

625
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,840
I had to tell them I fell down the stairs.

626
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,320
You fell down the stairs or it fell down the stairs?

627
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,240
Then I fell down the stairs, I was like, whoa.

628
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,440
Okay.

629
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,360
Wait, shut up.

630
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,480
The keyboard was the part that was broken, right?

631
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,440
So it was open?

632
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,960
Everybody who's not Justin needs to shut up

633
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,160
for the next minute

634
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,680
while you tell me every detail about the story you told them.

635
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,680
I got the email.

636
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,400
Holy shit.

637
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,480
See, by the way, media company,

638
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,720
if you do, yeah, please, nobody tell them.

639
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,240
I mean, please don't tell them.

640
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,280
But if a media company, if you do hear this,

641
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,920
let me know, I'll pay for it.

642
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,800
It's just goofing.

643
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,360
It's just goofing.

644
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,920
Hello.

645
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,840
Oh, yeah, this is all fake.

646
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,200
Hello, my MacBook Pro is having some major problems

647
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,120
related to me falling down the stairs.

648
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,920
And then in parentheses, it says, I am okay.

649
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,320
Thank you.

650
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,400
Oh, thank God.

651
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,160
Oh, thank God.

652
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,080
Oh, I'm not gonna tell him that I fucking got out Kasparov

653
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,840
and had to one punch man that shit.

654
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,520
But doesn't all you said is related to me falling down the stairs?

655
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,320
Travis, I was trying to,

656
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,000
I didn't want to get into like a courtroom recreation

657
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,680
like because I couldn't imagine the actual particulars of it.

658
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,080
Exactly.

659
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,040
Just things happen.

660
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,600
It's, what did you, did you drop it down the stairs

661
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,800
and it fell out of your hand into a big man's fist?

662
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,240
When I was thinking, what I was thinking happened was-

663
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,280
Was that all the detail?

664
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:45,760
Wait, hold on.

665
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,120
Was that all the details?

666
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,480
Much love, Justin.

667
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,920
Please send replacement.

668
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,240
He doesn't need to, he's not gonna do a,

669
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,840
it's not unsolved mysteries.

670
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,440
He's not gonna do a reenactment of it.

671
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,280
Like he doesn't need more than that.

672
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,760
Holy shit, that's so choice.

673
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,440
I guess in my head what happened was I had the computer open

674
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,560
while I was walking down the stairs, which was reckless.

675
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:11,760
And then I tripped and then used the middle sort of punch size

676
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,480
section of the keyboard to break my fall.

677
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,640
I think that's what I, yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,680
That's why you're fine.

679
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,880
If you hadn't had your laptop at the time, you'd be dead.

680
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,880
This one's, this one's cashed,

681
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,160
but do something to honor this hero laptop.

682
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,920
Yeah, and I will, I would like to talk to Tim about that.

683
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,520
I mean, you should, here's what I'm gonna say.

684
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,720
If your laptops can't take a punch, they shouldn't run chess.

685
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,120
Yes.

686
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,760
Is that fair?

687
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,160
Is that fair to say?

688
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,600
That's what, this is what I'm saying.

689
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,520
This is why laptops are for nerds.

690
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,880
You can't punch them once, can't punch it one time.

691
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,320
I'm, what if I get very mad?

692
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,840
Yeah, Justin, it's not like Justin

693
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
punching it over and over again.

694
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,000
It was one punch, can't take one punch.

695
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,600
It would be so dope if during one of the press conferences,

696
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,360
Tim Cook is like, pushes the button.

697
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,880
He's like, and in this new model, 3.6 punches.

698
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,120
Watch, wham wham wham, boop.

699
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,400
Record 3.6 punches.

700
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,320
Get out of here, Brock Lesnar, fuck it up.

701
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,120
It's my friend Brock.

702
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,520
He and I have been lifting together.

703
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
Hey Tim, it's me, Brock Lesnar.

704
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm so impressed with this new MacBook model.

705
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,600
Anyway, I'm gonna punch it for you.

706
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:26,960
And then I'm gonna rip it in half.

707
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,840
One, two, three, stop, stop, stop.

708
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,080
It's the only one I've got, don't do that.

709
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,560
What's frustrating is you can't punch them,

710
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,920
which you would, but you can't tear them in half,

711
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,600
which you would never, right?

712
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,280
Doesn't that seem stupid?

713
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,840
You should make them un-tear-in-half-able.

714
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,880
That's a tower, Justin.

715
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,320
Yeah, no, I'm saying you can punch it,

716
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,920
but you can't tear it in half.

717
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,240
Okay.

718
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,320
And I would never try to tear it in half in anger.

719
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
I would punch it in anger.

720
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,720
And I actually might try to tear it in half in anger.

721
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,080
I have tried to twist,

722
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
I've twisted controllers in half in anger.

723
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,880
So wait, Justin, just to get this clear,

724
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,720
your complaint with laptops is that you can't punch them.

725
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,320
You cannot punch them, but you could rip them in half.

726
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,360
But Justin, I would argue it sounds like you did punch it.

727
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,720
No, I'm saying the problem is they can't take a punch

728
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,360
and yet you can't rip them in half.

729
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:30,080
So they can't take it, what else can a laptop not do, Justin?

730
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,960
I'm saying that I would not in anger close my laptop

731
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,760
and then attempt to rip it in half, right?

732
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,240
It doesn't need that much structural integrity.

733
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,880
It does need the power to withstand a medium punch.

734
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,960
Now, see, I thought when you were talking about ripping in half,

735
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,880
you meant screen from keyboard, which I could do.

736
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,920
Anyone can, Trav, you don't have to.

737
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,960
Anybody can do that.

738
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,600
If we're gonna buy this dad a high-end,

739
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,240
top-of-the-line, government-level gamer laptop rig.

740
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,240
Something he can also stream from,

741
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,920
something he can also Twitch from, you know what I mean?

742
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
If we're gonna turn this into a Twitch daddy,

743
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,720
we're gonna need it.

744
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,600
Yes.

745
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,160
And by the way, we're not going to,

746
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,920
that's not a service we offer at the show.

747
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,040
Not yet.

748
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,040
Okay, but we're not gonna do that,

749
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,880
but we should go to the Money Zone.

750
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:30,000
Let's go.

751
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Hey, honey.

752
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,600
It's me, Justin.

753
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,720
No, I said that.

754
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,760
No one will ever know that, though.

755
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,400
It got edited out.

756
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
I know, but I said it first,

757
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,040
and then we had to start over again.

758
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,520
You're waste.

759
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,720
You're burning time.

760
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,640
Hey, honey, this is an intro I came up with

761
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,000
for the company Honey.

762
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,520
And I love Honey.

763
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,320
I wish that I could express,

764
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,480
I wish I had a secret signal I could send

765
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,200
for when I don't actually like an advertiser that much

766
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,040
so I could not do it for Honey

767
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
because it is the best.

768
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,320
Takes a few clicks.

769
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,400
It installs in your web browser,

770
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
and anytime you check out, it is like,

771
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,960
hey, let me just see if you got any coupon codes anywhere

772
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,360
in the back.

773
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:07,920
I'll be right back.

774
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,040
Let me just look real quick.

775
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
And then it looks, and if it's got promo codes

776
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
that it found on the internet,

777
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,200
it just automatically applies them for you,

778
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,000
saves you money.

779
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,440
I mean, you can't, it's best.

780
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,400
It's free.

781
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,840
Takes a second to install.

782
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,360
It's so weird that you wouldn't be using Honey.

783
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,800
Do you just like giving away money?

784
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,360
Is that it?

785
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
It's honestly free money.

786
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,560
So please get Honey for free

787
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
at joinhoney.com slash brother.

788
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,960
That's joinhoney.com slash brother.

789
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,680
What do you call it?

790
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,960
Get some, get money.

791
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,480
Hey guys, what do you call it

792
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,720
when you use a web app to find discounts on underwear?

793
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
Me hundies.

794
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,240
I want to tell you about me hundies.

795
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
Cause I said me hundies.

796
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
God, don't you love it when you can hear the pride

797
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,480
in his voice?

798
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,600
Me hundies.

799
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,240
Yeah.

800
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,840
Me hundies.

801
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,600
And then he says it like 70 times

802
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,000
to make it feel like a joke.

803
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
Oh, that's fucking funny though.

804
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
Did you hear the voice he did in that time?

805
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,040
Oh, that's fucking great, Travis.

806
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,520
Yeah.

807
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,600
Me hundies just wants everyone to feel comfy as heck

808
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,440
with the freedom foods.

809
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,960
Me hundies.

810
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,760
They love it.

811
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,400
They love it.

812
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,360
The audience loves it.

813
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,800
The advertisers love it.

814
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,480
The ad reps love it.

815
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
The ad reps send this to advertisers

816
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,360
and they're like, this is good.

817
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,880
How much money do they want?

818
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,320
We'll give them all of it.

819
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
Please, is there a tipping feature?

820
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah.

821
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,200
I'd love to tip.

822
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:31,920
Oh, what's that?

823
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,560
Oh, money.

824
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
Suddenly I'm inside one of those money booths.

825
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,600
Trav, you stopped doing the voice

826
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,240
and the advertisers love your voice.

827
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,360
Fuck, this sucks.

828
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
I can only do that one thing though.

829
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, okay.

830
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,280
Okay.

831
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,440
So me hundies, they got really good,

832
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,720
good soft stuff that you put on your body.

833
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,160
They got stuff like underwear

834
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,720
and they got lounge pants and they got onesies

835
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,160
and they have very, very just comfortable stuff.

836
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,960
And not only that, it's got good patterns.

837
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,760
Fun patterns.

838
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,560
I just got a pair of underwear with dinosaurs on them.

839
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,000
And I know you think, aren't you scared

840
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,800
that they will bite you on your privacy?

841
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,880
And I say, no, it's just pictures.

842
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,240
And they have a sustainably sourced fabric

843
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,160
that is from beechwood trees.

844
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,660
How?

845
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,440
Well, they take the trees, they turn them to pulp

846
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,040
and then to yarn and then to underwear.

847
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,960
But I've put my leg inside a tree before

848
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,400
and it did not feel good.

849
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
They do stuff to it between the tree and your privacy.

850
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,720
And you can get a me hundies membership,

851
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,800
Me hundies.

859
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,160
Hey, J. Keith.

860
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,800
Hey, Helen.

861
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,960
Hey, you've got another true false quiz for me?

862
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,680
Yep.

863
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Our trivia podcast, Go Fact Yourself,

864
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,840
used to be in front of a live audience.

865
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,240
True.

866
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,920
Turns out that's not so safe anymore.

867
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,720
Correct.

868
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,200
Next.

869
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,560
Unfortunately, this means we can no longer record the show.

870
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:08,960
False.

871
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,880
The show still comes out every first and third

872
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,760
Friday of the month.

873
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,400
Correct.

874
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Finally, we still have great celebrity guests

875
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,920
answering trivia about things they love on every episode

876
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,040
of Go Fact Yourself.

877
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,000
Definitely true.

878
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,320
And for bonus points, name some of them.

879
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,720
Recently, we've had Ophira Eisenberg plus tons

880
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,920
of surprise experts like Yardley Smith and Suzanne Somers.

881
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,640
Perfect score.

882
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,520
You can hear Go Fact Yourself every first and third

883
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,160
Friday of the month with all the great guests and trivia

884
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,280
that we've always had.

885
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,720
And if you don't listen, well, then you can go fact yourself.

886
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,400
That's the name of our podcast.

887
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:40,960
Correct.

888
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
Here is a question I have here.

889
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,240
I have recently moved into an apartment with a friend

890
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,880
from high school.

891
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,920
Everything has been great except for one thing.

892
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,240
She has grown overly attached to my cat.

893
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,200
She's home a lot more than I am and therefore spends

894
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,440
more time with her, playing with her, taking her on walks.

895
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,320
A lot of pronouns here.

896
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,520
It's getting confusing.

897
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,880
I sometimes come home to find lipstick marks from her

898
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,240
kissing my cat on the forehead.

899
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,360
Whoa, whoa.

900
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,080
She even has started calling her cat our cat even when I've

901
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,280
made it clear that she is mine.

902
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,840
What should I do?

903
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,480
Do I need to relax or is she overstepping?

904
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,280
I just hate the idea of my cat liking my roommates more.

905
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,360
That's from Mift in Minnesota.

906
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,720
I actually, you know who would be good to help with this?

907
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
I cannot fathom Ron Funches.

908
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,080
Travis read my mind.

909
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,040
Yeah, Ron Funches.

910
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,760
Let me see if I can.

911
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,280
When I think about roommate cat dynamic, Ron Funches.

912
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,680
A real cat kisser.

913
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
Best in the biz.

914
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,680
Let me call him real quick.

915
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,520
Hi.

916
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,040
Hey, Ron.

917
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,400
It's Hoops.

918
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,480
I was still dialing.

919
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,520
Ron has one of those special phones where all you have to do

920
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,520
is sort of hit one of the phone numbered numbers over and over

921
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
and over again until you hear him yell hi.

922
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,280
Yeah, it felt like you were knocking.

923
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,400
So I just answered.

924
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,960
If you ever need to get Ron Funches, just keep hitting seven

925
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,360
and eventually he'll answer.

926
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,760
So Ron, you are probably so familiar with this sort of question

927
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,040
that I don't even need to tell you.

928
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
But it's like the classic sort of roommate

929
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
to attach to the cat kind of deal.

930
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,320
You have to find a lipstick on the forehead.

931
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,200
Just a regular Tuesday for Ron.

932
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,680
Am I right?

933
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,760
So we reached out to we're just cycling through our different

934
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,880
Trolls World Tour co-stars.

935
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,920
How is Justin doing?

936
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,160
Haven't gotten JT yet.

937
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,680
Just hasn't quite been the right fit for him.

938
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,320
He keeps asking about it and I'm like, you know.

939
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,520
Just nothing up his alley yet.

940
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,120
He's like, please, Justin, please.

941
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,320
And I'm like, crime your river.

942
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,760
Of course.

943
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,920
Yeah, he loves it when you reference his song.

944
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,760
It's his favorite thing.

945
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,720
He also demanded that Justin legally change his name

946
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,240
before he woke up.

947
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,640
Did you know he's never been on a thing with another Justin?

948
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,120
Like even like a best boy key grip.

949
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,960
Like they do need to.

950
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,040
He was supposed to swear in Justin Trudeau

951
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,160
at his swearing in ceremony that Prime Ministers probably have.

952
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,760
And he just he wouldn't do it.

953
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,560
He wouldn't do it.

954
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,160
Trudeau wouldn't change his name?

955
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,040
And neither one would.

956
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,080
They were at a sailmate.

957
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,360
So Ron, where are you at with this with cats and ownership

958
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,800
and roommates, where are you at?

959
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,120
Can one really own a cat, Ron?

960
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,720
That's how I feel about it.

961
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:37,120
You know, it's really about just the relationship of love

962
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,640
and it goes back and forth.

963
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,880
And if you're not home with that cat and your roommate is

964
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,200
and they're building a bond, I say, why stand in the way of it?

965
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,520
It seemed like a little bit of jealousy,

966
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,480
if not a little bit of guilt about, you know,

967
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,400
maybe they've been working too much,

968
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,640
not spending enough time with their cat.

969
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,280
So, I mean, I feel either you have to learn

970
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,000
to let go a bit about it

971
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,680
and let that cat be loved by a full family.

972
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,160
You know, it takes a village to raise a cat.

973
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,280
Everyone knows that.

974
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,200
That's so true.

975
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,960
I would want to know where like cat maintenance duties

976
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,680
are being assigned at this point, right?

977
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,640
Because like I have there's a cat that lives at our house

978
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,760
and it belonged to my other cat that died.

979
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,800
Very inconsiderately, my older cat died

980
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,520
and left her cat here for us to take care of.

981
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,000
I don't not get any of the transactional love or support

982
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,320
or company or anything from this cat.

983
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,440
I just clean up its duty and refill its bowl.

984
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,640
And I feel like if this person is getting love

985
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,600
and affection from the cat, maybe they should step up

986
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,320
with like some food, some water,

987
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,760
some litter box cleanings, that sort of thing.

988
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,840
Well, because there's a very real potential here

989
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,240
that if you say these roommates only lived together

990
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,680
for like a year, right?

991
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,840
When they part ways and the cat's like,

992
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,160
okay, well, I'm going with her now

993
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,240
because she's been the one around.

994
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,760
She's been there for me.

995
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,840
Oh, seen it several times.

996
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,920
Yeah, yeah.

997
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,080
Yeah, the cat will choose and it will make a choice

998
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,840
and you just have to live with it.

999
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,480
So, I mean, I think maybe she should consider

1000
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,560
quitting her job in order to spend more time

1001
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,960
with the cat and truly support.

1002
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,440
I've been watching a lot of 90 Day Fiancé

1003
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,240
and it seems like one of the best things

1004
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,520
you can do in a relationship is stop caring

1005
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,840
about yourself and your responsibilities,

1006
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:40,400
whether that's children, jobs, things of that nature,

1007
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,800
and to start fully focusing on the needs

1008
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,160
of the other person.

1009
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,960
Or cat.

1010
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,400
Or cat, or cat in this case.

1011
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,160
Oh, clearly, clearly, yeah.

1012
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,880
And this is such a great point, Ron,

1013
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,600
because if there's ever been a moment

1014
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,880
to start taking economical risks

1015
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,240
and quitting jobs willy-nilly, this is it.

1016
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,760
I mean, this is the moment to do it.

1017
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,480
I mean, it's also-

1018
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,280
Cats and money.

1019
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,000
Jobs and money come and go.

1020
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,720
A cat will always be there for you when you need it.

1021
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,760
Is this the time for us to get Jackson Galaxy's

1022
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,080
My Cat From Hell back in the mix,

1023
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,760
but blended with 90 Day Fiancé,

1024
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,160
just a very intensive spiritual journey

1025
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,000
that you do go on with your cat for three Gregorian months?

1026
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm gonna say yes.

1027
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,440
I like the idea.

1028
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,520
Yeah, if Jackson Galaxy's answer was always,

1029
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,280
well, maybe you're just not working hard enough

1030
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,960
your relationship with the cat.

1031
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,400
What's that?

1032
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,880
Your cat destroyed all your plants and shit

1033
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,280
and all your shoes and bit your daughter?

1034
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,280
Well, time to quit your job.

1035
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,040
Ron's suggestion that you need to quit your job

1036
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,280
to take care of your cat is laughable,

1037
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,960
and all us humans are having a great time

1038
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,280
chuckling at it, but make no mistake.

1039
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:54,800
If you had a talking cat,

1040
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:58,320
like in the hit film, A Talking Cat,

1041
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,480
this is exactly what they would be saying to you.

1042
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,040
Like, I am the most important thing in the world.

1043
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,960
You have to start quitting your job

1044
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,480
and putting in the time.

1045
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,840
And also you need to send Nermal to Abu Dhabi.

1046
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,120
That's important too.

1047
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,880
Ron, I'm curious, where do you land

1048
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,680
vis-a-vis kitty kisses though?

1049
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,360
Oh, kisses on the forehead?

1050
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,040
Leaving lipstick.

1051
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,160
Okay, we're talking about two separate things.

1052
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,880
I'm saying no to both.

1053
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,960
I don't think it's right to kiss Nermal

1054
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,360
unless it's a cute little puppers with his sweet Toby.

1055
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,640
But a kitty cat kiss, I'm not a fan of.

1056
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,200
I think we can all get behind leaving lipstick marks

1057
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,640
on the kitty cat.

1058
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,280
Like the kitty cat is Ricky Martin

1059
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,520
and you are in the music video Livin' La Vida Loca

1060
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,400
is not great, right?

1061
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:44,800
Correct.

1062
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,200
Is there any will in Ricky?

1063
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,320
I hate to disagree,

1064
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,440
but I mean, A, one of the best music videos of all time.

1065
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,800
So who doesn't want to live that out in cat form?

1066
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,160
And B, cats have, you know,

1067
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,040
cats have, if you get a kiss back from the cat

1068
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,520
who has the scratchiest of tongues,

1069
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,480
which are fun, you know, that's just a different experience.

1070
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:14,880
So I just say-

1071
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,800
That is assuming you're getting a kiss back.

1072
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,320
I would, I have to say though,

1073
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,800
if I was a cat and you're going to leave lipstick on me,

1074
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,960
that's the one fucking hardest play.

1075
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,320
How could you do it there?

1076
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,880
I can access almost every other place in my body.

1077
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,000
Leave it on my butt.

1078
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,680
I can get there easy.

1079
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,720
I'm there anyway.

1080
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,400
I'm scheduled to be there at 320.

1081
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,560
Just leave it on my butt and I'll get to it.

1082
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,760
Honestly, it sounds like that roommate is leaving a message.

1083
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,000
You know, she possibly is claiming,

1084
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,040
I want this cat.

1085
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,280
It used to be your cat.

1086
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,080
It is now our cat and it will be shortly my cat.

1087
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,520
That is step two is that our cat is now step two of the process.

1088
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,280
Y'all know the best part of the Livin' La Vida Loca music video?

1089
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,000
I got that from a loop in one tab here.

1090
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,240
All of the sexual central things that Ricky Martin

1091
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,520
is experiencing in this video,

1092
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,920
his facial reactions are that of childlike wonderment

1093
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,880
as if he has never had these sexual experiences before.

1094
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,000
It's almost like Ricky Martin has been sort of wizarded away

1095
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,720
into this sort of sexual dimension

1096
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,400
and somebody pours wax on his chest.

1097
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,840
He's like, whoa, hey.

1098
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,720
I'm watching it right now

1099
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,880
and he seems like he's thoroughly into this.

1100
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,960
I love on YouTube, YouTube is like,

1101
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,560
oh, you like Livin' La Vida,

1102
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,760
may I recommend Lou Bega's Mambo number five?

1103
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,520
Not a bad segue.

1104
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,680
They do go hand in hand, truly.

1105
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,520
You actually, we actually found out later on

1106
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,360
that Lou Bega doesn't even like Mambo.

1107
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,280
So that was actually a big moment.

1108
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,720
Well, I'm just happy Ricky found what he was looking for.

1109
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,080
Absolutely.

1110
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,000
I love, huge spokesperson speaking out

1111
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,360
for all kinds of stuff.

1112
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,240
Very active, fully in support of Ricky.

1113
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,800
Muffins and corn.

1114
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,640
Yeah, he's a big corn lobbyist.

1115
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,560
If you like the low price of petroleum,

1116
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,200
you can thank Ricky Martin, power broker.

1117
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,840
He's up in DC cleaning it out.

1118
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,680
Corn powered car.

1119
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,640
Ricky Martin did that.

1120
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:24,080
Corn powered car.

1121
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,280
It's all thanks to him.

1122
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,240
And I know that.

1123
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,480
Corn cob pipes, also Ricky Martin.

1124
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
That's him, that's him.

1125
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:31,120
Corn pops.

1126
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:33,360
Oh, I didn't know that was Ricky.

1127
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,160
The BAMed corn, he was the co-founder.

1128
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:36,960
Yeah.

1129
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,600
Kicked him out.

1130
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,560
Because they wanted to change it to K

1131
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,240
and he said, I think that's going to be confusing.

1132
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,400
That's not going to help corn sales at all.

1133
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,200
Yeah, he was thinking bigger than that.

1134
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,880
Ron, we're all trying to stay busy in our own way

1135
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,600
in these times.

1136
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,080
What are you up to these days?

1137
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,360
Oh, I'm just trying to spend time with my wife.

1138
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,280
I got married a few weeks ago.

1139
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:00,800
Congratulations.

1140
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,080
Thank you so much.

1141
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,280
Enjoy my family.

1142
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,680
And I'm also doing a live show Saturday on September 5th

1143
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:12,480
that people can watch from their homes if they want.

1144
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,040
Since I can't go on the road safely right now,

1145
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,440
I'm going to bring a show or have a live audience of 10 people

1146
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,000
that's safely distanced and amassed

1147
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,240
and we'll be live streaming it out on YouTube for 24 hours

1148
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:26,880
on the 5th.

1149
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,200
So I've been preparing for that

1150
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,000
and just working on trying to get them to get us bigger parts

1151
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,360
in the next Trolls movie.

1152
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,680
I love this.

1153
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:38,160
I love it.

1154
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,600
Yeah, we're working together now.

1155
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,800
It's collective bargaining.

1156
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,360
Oh, you want Ron?

1157
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,800
Ron comes packaged with the McElroy brothers.

1158
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,680
That special is Awakening, correct?

1159
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,040
I don't think you said the name of it.

1160
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,000
I did not.

1161
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:54,720
They should know.

1162
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,000
It is called Awakening.

1163
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,440
They can get tickets at my website, ronfunches.com.

1164
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,040
Or if you check any of my socials, Instagram or Twitter,

1165
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,520
there's links all the way all around.

1166
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,880
And I'm just, you know, I'm working on my own game show as well

1167
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,680
on Quibi that's out right now called Nice One.

1168
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,640
What's that called?

1169
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:16,080
It's called Nice One.

1170
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,920
And it's just about, it's like looking at,

1171
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
most like my comedy,

1172
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,200
looking at the bright side of bad situations.

1173
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,200
It's just me and my favorite comedians making fun jokes

1174
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,200
and me giving out points.

1175
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,920
Now, Ron, I don't have a lot of time to watch TV.

1176
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,880
I can maybe spare one Quibi to watch something.

1177
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,320
How long is an episode?

1178
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,760
It's about a Quibi.

1179
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,560
Oh, nice.

1180
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,600
Okay, good.

1181
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,640
That's a relief.

1182
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,240
Ron, I recently saw you on Twitter

1183
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,600
telling people who spoke bad about Quibi,

1184
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,360
I believe that you would fight them.

1185
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:45,600
Yeah.

1186
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,800
Is that true?

1187
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,880
I did say that and I stand behind it.

1188
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,000
So if anybody listening to this has ever said anything bad

1189
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,560
about Quibi and wants to fight Ron Funches,

1190
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:57,920
this is your chance.

1191
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,360
Yeah, as long as you have no background in fighting.

1192
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,880
That's cheating.

1193
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,120
That would be rude if you had a background in it

1194
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,320
and are, if you were physically fit.

1195
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,720
So if you're neither of those

1196
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,960
and you talking trash about Quibi,

1197
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,440
then I will fight you.

1198
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,920
I feel like anybody who's in any sort of entertainment

1199
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,720
that complains about Quibi, the secret subtext,

1200
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,680
and I can absolutely put myself in this category is,

1201
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,800
why didn't I get a Quibi?

1202
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:37,680
I would love to get a Quibi.

1203
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,560
I would love to do a Quibi.

1204
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,080
Why didn't nobody ask me to do a Quibi?

1205
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,040
I'd do a Quibi.

1206
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,800
Come on, help me out.

1207
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,520
I agree.

1208
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,960
I mean, really, it's just, I feel,

1209
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,680
I understand making fun of things.

1210
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,320
I love making fun of things and talking trash,

1211
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,560
but when it was just like this actual,

1212
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,320
like wanting people to fail,

1213
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,400
I'm like, not a lot of people hand out shows.

1214
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,440
Yeah, absolutely.

1215
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,960
If a new place pops up

1216
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,080
and they need a whole new slate of material,

1217
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,400
I think that's extremely positive

1218
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,720
and not a negative by any means.

1219
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,880
And listen, as people who have had a show

1220
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,120
on a thing that failed, it's not fun.

1221
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,680
It's not fun.

1222
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,280
It's not great.

1223
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,040
It's way better when the thing succeeds

1224
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,640
and you get to keep making your show.

1225
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,440
Oh, truly.

1226
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,240
I would love that.

1227
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,040
You know, I'm not putting all the eggs in that basket.

1228
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,880
The shows are very short.

1229
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,000
That's too small of a basket.

1230
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,640
That's right.

1231
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,160
Don't be a goofus.

1232
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,800

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,320
I very much appreciate you.

1236
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,600
Oh, it's a true pleasure.

1237
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,920
You guys are so much fun to talk to

1238
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,880
and very enjoyable and truly,

1239
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,640
I don't know if they,

1240
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,800
would the movie have been successful?

1241
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,840
You know, without the work that you've done?

1242
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,560
Who knows?

1243
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,840
I'd say yes.

1244
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:12,400
That's a great, probably yes.

1245
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,760
At least 98% as successful as it was, I would say.

1246
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,000
Well, but you know, you need that 2%.

1247
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,280
You need it.

1248
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,600
That's what they put in the milk.

1249
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,760
Thanks, Ron.

1250
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:26,320

And I'm sure a specific place on YouTube,

1259
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,480
not just like, I don't think it's a takeover.

1260
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,840
It's not like controlling your horizontal and vertical,

1261
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,400
you know what I mean?

1262
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,320
Yeah, it's not a takeover.

1263
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:00,640
It's not gonna interrupt the cabbage video you're watching.

1264
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:01,520
Yeah.

1265
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,560
About cabbage, because you're boring as fuck.

1266
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,080
