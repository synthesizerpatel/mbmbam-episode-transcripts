1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,940
It's better it's better

6
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,980
It's better it's better

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,220
Hello and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice show for the modern era me

9
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,660
I'm your oldest brother just McElroy. Oh this guy over here. I'm in the middle. It's brother Travis McElroy

10
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,500
I gotta take my socks off. Whoa, I can't can't sleep in socks. Can't do podcasts in socks. It's Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
You know Griffin I do that, too

12
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,620
yeah, and

13
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,460
Sometimes I only make it through one song as I'm like recording take off one song and then I'm out in the house

14
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,920
That's my wife. My wife is like, where's your other socks? I'm like, I don't know baby. We all have these

15
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,200
Ceremonies, don't we? We all we all have these rituals. Don't we to make don't we?

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,800
Being ants marching, you know, yeah

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,440
Doolin days, baby. Oh shit. We didn't do that before. Sorry. One of our rituals is that we do sing

18
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
We call it Doolin Dave's

19
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Yeah, we accidentally did it on stage one time. We had to pay mr. Matthews in his outfit

20
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
$50,000. Yeah

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,160
Hey guy, can I just say normally we talk before the show about what our introduction is gonna be but I don't even think

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,240
that we

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,240
That we need to do that this

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,680
Because there has been such knit. Well, I will say this because it we didn't talk about it. We are recording so this

25
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Decision

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,520
So we might as well lean into it no, do you guys realize

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,600
that within a week-long span we the hosts of my brother my brother and me are getting a

28
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:58,560
Quantum leap reboot. Yeah, sure and the Santa Claus reboot both of those franchise ones an announcement ones are released

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Both in one week. Are you kidding me over here? Our cup runneth o'er. What do you want us to talk about the fact that you're

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,840
Making more quantum leap that may or may not have a gushy presence

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,800
Well, it'll be there Justin it might be an undercurrent it might be implied gushing

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,520
I mean, I'll say this if I'm watching

33
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,280
If I'm watching yeah, he's very deeply in love with that

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,440
but if I'm watching quantum leap Mondays on NBC, you know, there's gonna be a

35
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,960
gushy presence

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,640
Know what I'm saying your your wife Rachel is a corner bleep

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,520
Abacula fan a freak for her did her reaction

38
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,320
Is there any way her reaction could to hearing about the reboot could have lived up to your expectations?

39
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,320
For the thrill that she would experience is having the quantum leap project back in full operation

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,160
I think we have yet to watch it. She is I think suspended in a state of terror

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,920
That it won't it won't hit you know that it won't that it won't be gushy enough

42
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,880
Then it won't be gushy enough or maybe they'll mess up the legacy like so they bring up. Dr. Sam Beck and he's like

43
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,880
I actually he was in prison

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,880
Yeah, entire life for him. Yeah, and he's a monster. What if what if they combined the two?

45
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,880
What if they're in a shared universe and at one point the quantum leap shows?

46
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,120
I mean, I hope so that would be wild if two different people figured that out

47
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:37,640
No, Justin the new leapist leaps into the Santa Claus the leper. Yeah. Thank you. The leopard jumps into

48
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,040
The body of the Santa Claus. That's funny. And he's so he's like beating

49
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,720
The shit out of Martin shorts Jack Frost and then he like wakes up and he's just killed

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,940
What he must think is the real Martin short and then yeah, and then he's like whoopsie

51
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,440
Which is the new thing is in the reboot

52
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:06,200
And then you get the if that theme song if that theme song is not just a soaring

53
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,520
ba ba ba ba ba da da da scab skiddy doo then

54
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:19,000
There's the then there's God is dead and that's what I'll say about that's all that's my only thing that I'll say about it

55
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,780
Let's talk about Santa Claus's though, cuz I think we've held off long enough

56
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,820
That was a good discussion of quantum leap, but I think everybody here wants to talk about the Santa Claus's coming to Disney

57
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,040
Plus, it is a series. There's so much meat on the bone. It could be contained in one episode

58
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:52,000
So this this show yeah show of the Santa Claus's is about like a

59
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Santa is talking in the trailer for this. We see him talking to Peyton Manning about becoming Santa Claus

60
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,960
but what he means is like a game designer he meets like a game designer who comes up to the North Pole with his family and

61
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
I think he

62
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,640
So he's he and now he's looking for a replacement

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,880
So like I know I know what the Santa Claus is about

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,400
Whoever kills Santa takes over a Santa that's not a goofy came up with for the show

65
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,520
That's what happens in movie is Tim Allen actually kills Santa and then he has to be Santa forever

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:33,620
So Travis if I may what what this show is about is about Santa Claus trying to get Peyton Manning

67
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,140
To be the one that kills it. I think yeah

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,040
I'm on I'm on all the Santa Claus forums as you know, and our theory

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,240
Yes, what we're talking about is the possibility of he's arranged some kind of like flatlining scenario

70
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,640
Where it's like I will die for a moment medically die

71
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll be medically brain-dead and then you're gonna resuscitate me, but the moment will have passed

72
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,480
You'll be the Santa Claus and I'll be free to go back to being a shithead

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,360
Shithead Scott Calvin free from this horrible morality curse that I was given

74
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,240
I can go back for like voting for Trump and just like loving

75
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,280
Being conservative politics. It doesn't work though. What we get is to Santa's one's a regular Santa

76
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,800
And the other is a demented Santa that can remember hell and that is I don't like that at all

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,720
I do like that though. If this show is just I'm guessing it's not Timothy. I'm

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah, it is Timothy. Okay, so

79
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:44,460
They already took Buzz Lightyear away from him Griffin. They're not gonna take Santa to it's got Laura San Giacomo as a Christmas witch

80
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,460
It says here do like that

81
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,280
But oh, I wanted to say a thing go say your thing

82
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,680
I want to hear it Griffin if this show is just Timothy Allen trying to trick Peyton Manning into killing him for

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,320
For a 12 episode season

84
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,680
If it's just Peyton Manning starts his car and he turns on the rearview camera and sees Tim Allen just lying behind his car

85
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
He's like

86
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Oh

87
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,360
There's so many houses and the presents are so big he stands up

88
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,160
He's like, oh you got me this time Peyton

89
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,640
And then when Peyton pulls out in the driveway Tim Allen tries to throw himself in front of the car

90
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,080
Like you're gonna make me late for football practice

91
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Is it Peyton Manning as himself?

92
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:39,320
Peyton Manning as himself? Yeah, Peyton Manning as himself and Santa's like, please kill me. That's the only way he can become Santa. That's the only way he can take over.

93
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,640
Here's what Tim here's what Timbo said about this at the D23 Expo. I need money

94
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,840
Hilariously due to the confluence of Buzz Lightyear. I mean they're out of the Buzz Lightyear business

95
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,080
But he can still be Santa. There's a new Buzz Lightyear in town, but Timbo's still I guess that they're they're working it out

96
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Here's the quote from Tim

97
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,560
You people made me

98
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,600
Said Allen we asked where he decided to reprise the character

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
We thought about this for a long time

100
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:16,360
The only way I would do this is if they answer some of the background they answer the questions. Yeah

101
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,240
What Tim is saying is like that he adds you guys are gonna dig it. So what he's saying is like

102
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,040
He wants to get into the mythos. That's the only way really dig it into the dirt of Santa

103
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,680
I'll give you some hard examples that are literally from this article among the questions

104
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,040
It will be answered are why mrs. Claus doesn't have a first name

105
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
The history of Santa. Hold on. Wait, is that syntax?

106
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
Good

107
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,000
The sentence is among the questions that will be answered are why mrs. Claus doesn't have a first. Okay, okay

108
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,120
Okay, the history of Santa and whether there has been any human children at the North Pole

109
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,440
Well, first of all, yes. Yeah, we already know cuz Max we saw in like the first episode episode movie

110
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,800
But also hey, hey

111
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,860
They're episodes to the Santa Claus is a 12 episode series pretty bold

112
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:21,720
That the Santa Claus which don't get me wrong has already established the murder lineage lore is like, hey

113
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,740
I think we're the ones who should put this in our hands. We've already established it goes Santa to Santa through bloodshed

114
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,560
We're gonna talk about why mrs. Claus doesn't get a first name and you know

115
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,780
Timbo with all of his open-minded progressive values is definitely gonna do a delicate job

116
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,960
Handling why his wife doesn't get a first name

117
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Yeah, he's gonna do he's gonna be fucking funny. I think we're all are we ready? Are we ready? I don't know

118
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,600
The balls in our court, isn't it?

119
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:08,840
Well, they canceled last man standing because of his conservative values as far as he's concerned, right?

120
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:16,720
And then Disney was like, you know what? We've actually been a little too progressive lately been getting a lot of good press for that

121
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,720
Let's rope in some of those guys. Let's bring in some of your

122
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:28,080
Fellows. Oh, you know, they're gonna be deep and and rambunctious these

123
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,160
These Santa grunts. Oh, man now he's Santa grunts the sound he's gonna make or the fans of the Santa Claus

124
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,360
Okay, that's all the that's actually as much as I can gin up

125
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,600
Pretending to

126
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,280
Enjoy, I will just say in closing. Happy David Krumholtz is working. Yeah

127
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,520
Agreed there everyone make David Krumholtz work more

128
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,800
No matter what he says and no matter what the work is just make David Krumholtz work for you

129
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:06,120
Hey, it's time for nature to start healing itself make David Krumholtz work for you

130
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,080
Too long have you worked for David?

131
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,280
Digging up his movies watching them

132
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:18,000
Now I have to return the favor David Krumholtz has a van and he's ready to work

133
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,120
I work in IT for a local bank outside of work. I wear hats

134
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
baseball caps or snapbacks I

135
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,840
I think of snapbacks as baseball caps, but I'm trying to make this anyway every day

136
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,960
Hats are not not allowed per our corporate dress code

137
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,800
But my boss seems pretty chill and I think as long as I get my work done

138
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,960
She maybe wouldn't care. Can I start wearing a hat to work?

139
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,620
Or is there a way I could test the waters before fully committing that's from uncovered in, Utah County

140
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Can we

141
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Just

142
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,880
Overthrow

143
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,080
This whole thing. Yeah hats. It's time

144
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:08,120
Right if if we we've been doing this for a while. Yeah, and I like to think of the work as being important

145
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,360
It bums me out that someone has to ask if they could please wear a hat to work

146
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,120
that feels like it's it is your head and unless you I I don't know what unless you're a

147
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,900
Dentist like if I look up at my dentist is wearing like an Ashton Kutcher

148
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,520
Like on Dutch like a Von Dutch Ed Hardy hat or he's wearing like a fedora

149
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm gonna say if you're in the medical field keep it

150
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
bare up there

151
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
It literally anything else

152
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,160
No, you're there. That's incorrect. Okay

153
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,880
Let's really put this to the test Griffin if you want to talk about it

154
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,200
If you've got okay, sure you go to me ma's funeral. There's a field director. Thank you so much for coming

155
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,520
Please ignore my federal body inspector hat now. Hold on. Okay, there's a difference

156
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,460
I would say any any any sorry about my hat. I love the Chargers my dad's from San Diego

157
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,160
I got no

158
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,140
But this is a perception thing just I'm not an inherent thing because I think what Griffin saying is if we swung at it

159
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,480
Hard, right? Yes, there would be some

160
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,040
Adjustment period right where you'd be like

161
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,860
But then after let's say two years, maybe it's fine funeral. This is like a really long funeral

162
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,600
Why have I been there for two years? Well, no, some funerals are gonna fall by the wayside

163
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,540
Some funerals you're gonna have to put in the L column at first

164
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,780
Yeah at first that'll be all anybody talks about and then it's like so commonplace for field directors to be wearing baseball caps

165
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,860
Do we have one industry at a time or do we just have to accept that?

166
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,100
There's gonna be a month or two of utter calamity as we all adjust to the new normal

167
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,900
Except except for dentists. No

168
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,900
No, I want the hat put the hair that's what I'm saying

169
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:06,460
Get it behind you because here's the thing Griffin what you're ignoring and I think everybody who outlaws baseball cash is ignoring is the baseball

170
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:12,500
Cap as a prop because imagine this the dentist comes in they got their hand on and then they look at you and they're like

171
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,660
All right, turn it backwards. Let's get down to business

172
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:20,780
Yeah, and you're like, oh fuck this is serious or like the tip of the cap or they like doff it

173
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,380
Can't have a bill if you're Dennis cuz you're gonna they have this big gnarly light

174
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,180
I don't know if you guys been to one but they got a big light and in a minute. Yeah

175
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,620
I've been a little bit right in a minute. I'm gonna need a dentist. I need a dentist to look at my teeth

176
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,540
Um, hey, what's it my dog? Oh, man. Never I my daughter I took with our the dentist recently and Charlie

177
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,860
Had a cavity a man I felt like such a turd cuz it really kids that's on you

178
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,940
Yeah, it's not them. It's not them

179
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,780
I've been using COVID-19 as a reason and I have to go to the dentist

180
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,660
But then like the further we get obviously it's still clear and present danger

181
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:05,620
But it is it's hard to look at the 19 in that and not go like it's been three years. I should get someone to

182
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:12,360
Get in there and sort of do some stuff. I love going to the dentist. I love going to the next

183
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,540
Well, let's say that the question about baseball cap. So inevitably we've ended up talking about Travis's feeling on dentist

184
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,620
In fact, you know what?

185
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,180
I might go ahead and use my old older brother veto power to say I don't want to hear your feelings about Dennis

186
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,540
Okay, what do you think? Can I get a quorum? Yeah, we have a quote. Okay, that's fair. That's fair. That's fair. No

187
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,180
Oh bad news. I've just been captivated by curiosity

188
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,300
Travis's feeling on Dennis and when he denied me now, it's all I can think about

189
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:43,820
I like the professional certainty of this is the cleanest your teeth could possibly be if it were up to me

190
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,580
I go to the dentist once a month because listen, I know myself even when I'm doing my quip two-minute brush every four sides

191
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Don't give them free promotion. There's no way I'm doing as good a job

192
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,620
As someone who professionally studied to make my teeth

193
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,860
You're like god these feel so clean. How was I content a moment ago? How was I content?

194
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:08,860
There's more space between the teeth somehow. How the fuck did you do that? Anyways? Yeah

195
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,380
I'm just saying Dennis or magicians clip hasn't actually sponsored us in a minute

196
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,120
So if we could actually say more stuff about equip, I'm just saying clip is great

197
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,820
This is a new trick. This is a new technique. I'm working on. Yeah catch more flies with honey

198
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,820
also

199
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,900
Tremendous tremendous start doing the ads first

200
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,660
Yeah, maybe they pay you for a maybe break them off a sample of it

201
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,940
And then if they like the sample they can come have more we had an idea wants to do

202
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,060
well, I had an idea nobody liked it to do a

203
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:45,020
Jurassic Park Fallen Kingdom sponsored episode and then ask for ask Universal for the money afterwards

204
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:52,940
I do the episode celebrate it give all the plugs, but then just be like whatever you think is fair. Yeah

205
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,520
You know

206
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,660
I think I think would be a good system the aspect of this question that I think we haven't touched on that

207
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,900
I really want to dive into is how do they ramp up to wearing a hat?

208
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:10,740
Right. Do they just dive in one day come in wearing a hat and like wait for the boss to say something or is there?

209
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,000
A way to be like, oh that hat

210
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,480
I don't know how that got here. I guess I could put it on wouldn't that be weird something?

211
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,760
Like is there a way to dance around it engage your boss's reaction?

212
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,920
I mean, okay, so you could come in there is an escalation here that we haven't addressed which is

213
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,120
Start with a fascinator little guy and then maybe if it's I mean, it's pretty maybe

214
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,200
Appropriative but like a yarmulke just increase that would be appropriate if Griffin. I don't

215
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,320
Area of the head maybe and then you work your way up to like a toboggan

216
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Or a to beanie what?

217
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And then like, you know, maybe

218
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:01,320
Very good baseball cap, but the bill is only like one inch deep and then you just a real chode of a big

219
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,680
Real showed and then you just expand. Holy shit. Is it okay when we talk about merch?

220
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
We usually talk about

221
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,520
Designs that go on merch. We don't talk about bold new

222
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
directions in hat technology

223
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,760
innovating I'm talking about a baseball cap a

224
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,360
Chode ball cap, but with just a one inch front brim that just bear it doesn't do anything

225
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,920
but you can wear it as a

226
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,920
transition

227
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,760
Into a full baseball cap lifestyle

228
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:44,040
there's a person a very good person named Sarah McKay whose job it is to listen to the things we say and then turn them into

229
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,080
Physical objects like she's out of me like outcome. Yes

230
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,320
It's incredible if you've bought anything from us in the past couple years

231
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,440
You have the Sarah McKay thing

232
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,920
I can only imagine the terror in her deep down in her bones hearing us say like in any way

233
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:04,720
It's a baseball cap with a chode you sort of villain anyway, because in her mind there's a timer

234
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,240
It's like if they talk about this for ten more minutes. It's going to heaven

235
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,320
I hope please God let them get distracted. Okay alternately. Oh, man. I'll come in with a huge. Yes

236
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,080
Huge fucking hat same page same page same page and then they're like you can't wear that

237
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm like, well, I have this smaller one I could wear

238
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:31,040
It just says like it's the words opening offer or printed in like yeah. Yeah, it's not like this is my the beginning of negotiations

239
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,240
This is what I call a turbo sombrero

240
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,760
And if you want if you don't like this because I'm hitting people in the office with it every time I move my head around

241
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,640
Maybe you'd find this more except no, how about this choke? How about this chode ball cap? I do gosh

242
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,200
This is so embarrassing. Well, I do have one thing

243
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,280
I do have one more that you might like one more that you might enjoy you heard this. I have one for you, too

244
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Do you like podcasts?

245
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,280
only chode ball caps have the

246
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,280
Good quality don't get don't get store-brand chode ball caps. Oh

247
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,740
What imagine being a hateful person that just had a regular red hat?

248
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Here's the problem

249
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,600
If we invent the chode ball cap, we're gonna have to invent chode ball. And I don't think maybe that's just baseball

250
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
but the bat is

251
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Trey if you're listening the base

252
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
I know you guys like the word chode

253
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,720
We have in the last five minutes and guys if you're not sold yet

254
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,180
How's this it you chode balls and now now we've now that's jokes on jokes on jokes. We like it

255
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
Hey, how about a wizardly?

256
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Approach to things Chloe sent this one in things like it's it's a wiki how article and

257
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,600
It is how to scat

258
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,000
how to scat

259
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,160
Scatting or scat singing is when you sing not

260
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Scatting no one's ever said scat singing in their entire feel confident enough to say that

261
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,520
No, probably not. It's the ultimate creative

262
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,320
Spontaneous expression for a vocalist allowing them to play on melodies and solos. You can't have in pre-written lyrics. I

263
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
Could pre write a scat I bet

264
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,560
Okay, yeah, I'm just saying I could sit down at the typewriter and just be like scoot

265
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,160
Scoot scoot scoot scoot scoot up. I'm gonna start with a scat

266
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,060
Okay, listen to the whole article like and see if we can improve it

267
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,920
Okay, no, no stop I'm gonna stop you already I'm gonna stop you already okay, don't say scooby-dee

268
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,460
Well, no, you just did the intro to I'm the scat man. Okay, okay

269
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Let me try

270
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,720
Okay, so now we're doing

271
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,580
Scat man. Oh, I need something new. Okay, let me try something new and fresh. Okay, okay

272
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
scatting

273
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,600
There's a lot of room

274
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,760
I think you did you did get dangerously close to the corn riff again, which boys

275
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:18,640
I'm pretty sure every episode for the last like five episodes has had a heaping help in a corn

276
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,400
I need to get that on my soundboard. Don't I? Yeah, okay, so

277
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,400
getting used to

278
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,620
Okay getting used to scatting use improvised syllables and sounds to scat over instrumental tracks

279
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,820
That's fun because it does it doesn't even say

280
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,660
You know over over songs. It says instrumental tracks so you could take you know

281
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,180
Yeah, the Moonlight Sonata and just be like scoop scoop scoop

282
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,020
Scoop scoop, dude, if that's where you need to start. You got to start with

283
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,060
I think you guys are saying I think you guys are saying boop like way

284
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,260
Way too much duty that duty that duty daddy duty. No, you're saying duty dad

285
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,420
Do you think duty dad over again? You're right. You're right. You're right

286
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,060
Practice call and response with scat singers and instrumental lines. I like that. Yeah, the problem is they don't always leave room

287
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,780
For a deposit. Yeah, so when so you turn on scat man, and he hits you at that school

288
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,780
and then you pause it you're like

289
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:42,820
There's no fucking way. No, it's just he was so fast. There is no way it's what they're saying like you should

290
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:50,140
You should play regular scat records, and then it's just like a fine places to like slip in a little bit

291
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,380
Well, you get that you get those moments in songs where it's like screw

292
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,220
You know what I mean not a lot of songs these days though you might have to look for some older

293
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:08,300
They're not throwing that a lot in there Harold stylish isn't throwing in a lot of scat breaks which by the way

294
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:15,740
I don't want to give notes because obviously I'm not a musician but maybe maybe think about it start with simple

295
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,460
rhythmic syllables focusing on melody instead of new sounds as you begin improvising your own scattered line start with a couple of

296
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:30,020
Accepted in quotes scat words and syllables simple percussive noises are the easiest way to start using sounds like Bob beep

297
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,100
Ski do etc. But remember ski do but

298
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,980
That's really good we're improving remember that you're not gonna say anything you're playing with musical notes

299
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Oh words, okay

300
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:48,340
The musical scale made famous in the sound of music is a great place to start do re mi fa so la ti do I'm pretty

301
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,500
sure

302
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,980
That existed before sound of music, but I actually don't know I actually are you confident?

303
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:58,380
Okay, accent modulate and have fun with your syllables

304
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,020
Oh things like change the volume singing like bop bop and then tone like bop

305
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,340
How do you

306
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,340
Perhaps the most important pitch is how high or low your notes

307
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,700
So you said I don't know

308
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,980
No, I'm sorry, I that was my theme song for the show Doug serious

309
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,860
Practice with a metronome or an instrumental track to help you stay on time. That's fun

310
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,780
I worry you could develop some bad habits that way if you do it with a metronome

311
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,580
We're just like ski ski ski ski ski ski ski be but what about when you're in front of an audience

312
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:50,740
You're like, all right, everybody clap your hands. Nope a little faster. No, two four two four, please two four. Thank you

313
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,940
Yes, good. If you guys want me to scat fast, you got to do it in 16 time

314
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:01,860
Skip scott scott scott introduce a little okay, so in Corvin that sounded like a like a scatting troll in like a

315
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,860
C&C

316
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:12,020
Introduce a little rhythmic variety with doublets and triplets is doublets. I've is doublets

317
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
That's two of something

318
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,640
Doublets are simply two sounds thrown quickly together. Okay, ah and triplets are three sounds beep-de-bop

319
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,740
Instead of using straight quarter notes where you have one sound per beat one two

320
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:31,460
Three four start stringing together these other phrases leaving spaces in between them for a bouncy swingy feel. Okay, I under I understand this

321
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,300
So sort of like you would say like goo-goo-gah-gah-gah Griffin. How's it coming with you?

322
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Can we hear I feel like you've been talking so much. We haven't heard much of your psych. Sure

323
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:50,860
I'm square. Wow. I like the squay at the end. That was good. Yes way is an advanced

324
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,260
I did a master class on that one

325
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:02,860
Oh with who yeah, who taught it. Yeah, please speak on that scatman crothers. Whoa, you got him

326
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,660
Got a look at his dad quick to see if he's dead gonna do a quick search

327
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,700
He died before I was born

328
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
You took a master class with the ghost

329
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:23,380
Yeah, he was born in 1910 it would be crazy if he was still alive that was one

330
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,180
How did you how did you live so long scatman crothers

331
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:35,540
Scatting is a young I learned that as long as you whenever you're scatting you're not aging

332
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
Just on his death

333
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:46,040
Oh the angel of death zooms in through the window and he's just like skips got good leap above skips

334
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,540
Go ahead. He's like shit. I can't get him right now

335
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,740
So, uh, oh is that it no, there's there's a little bit more uh, get a little swing behind your scatting

336
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,460
We just did that learn the chord progressions to improvise like a jazz singer. That's too much work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

337
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,300
Yeah, I'd rather music just change to fit what I'm doing, right?

338
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,980
Scat through your vocal solos to bridge classical singing and scatting. That's cool

339
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,740
so you could be singing like, you know, like

340
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,980
Rolling in the deep

341
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:29,300
Skip this cop cops keep it up up up. Well, I should have picked a song that I knew more than four words

342
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,300
Yeah, when I started that exercise, that's a very Jason Mraz move and frankly, I'm here for it

343
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,660
I once saw that dude perform live

344
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,980
10-minute one song jazz odyssey. I was incredible. Fuck

345
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,660
underappreciated artists

346
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,740
Mr. A to Z though, he you know when he was playing in the high team

347
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,060
I was directing a children's theater production of Superman. He told the audience ghost a ghosty Superman

348
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,020
I don't know how you really he did. He really he did that. Mr. A to Z. Appreciate you. Thank you, Mr

349
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,140
Z. Let me get a quick Google in here for him

350
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
I think he's okay. Yeah

351
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,780
He's alive still definitely yep, which is a good start he alive and

352
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,740
Okay, looking good Jason looking good. Yeah, thank you Jason to the cannon

353
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:27,580
There's the McElroy brothers temporary stamp of approval. Well, welcome Jason

354
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:34,780
We are conducting some some more background deep background work. You've joined the pantheon of 13 different people that we have deemed it

355
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,700
Okay to joke about and we should say right now

356
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,980
Recording this episode. It's 10 57 a.m. Eastern Time, Thursday, September 15th

357
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,340
2022 just to hold up the newspaper in front of that statement

358
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,860
Here's some sports scores for events that are happening right now

359
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:58,700
Get a little weird with tone voice and coloring. That's fine. Yeah, that's it. So I think that that's obvious though

360
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,860
I think it'd be weird to be like, well, I love skiing singing scat, but I like to keep it pretty vanilla

361
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,780
I don't I to mix it up would be I would that would put me out of my comfort zone, frankly

362
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,500
Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. I mean you're a novice at scatting. So who are you to come in and tell everyone?

363
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,180
Hey, you're doing it wrong. Let me go. Let me let me show you how it's how to do it better

364
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,940
Okay, now Justin now that we've had the full thing and you're warmed up. Can we hear where you're at now? Yeah, sure

365
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,940
I thought we were about to do a Hanna doll watch. Yeah, I mean I love your scat. That was good

366
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,460
That was a thematic reference. That was like a thematic. I was trying to like it was clever. It was playful

367
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:52,700
It was playful, clever, way too many bops, but it's

368
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,540
But you can but it takes you got to extend your vocabulary. Okay, let me try it now

369
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,740
Boo boo bah

370
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,300
Boo boo bah bah bah bah boo boo bah

371
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,940
Boo boo scooty daddly scooty da

372
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
They are the gummy bears

373
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:15,580
You saw the moment where you Travis realized he had been saying booba for like four whole bars

374
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,420
And he was like, I got to say something else and he came in with a scootaly scoot

375
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:25,900
Hey Travis, it's you aren't you need to keep practicing. I'm only on level two. I'm still singing along with other songs

376
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,860
Yeah, but Justin escalated it during this segment. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm not as good at Justin. It's scatting Griffin

377
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,260
We've had this conversation you had every opportunity to improve in the same

378
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,180
That was for you to heat like just step-by-step

379
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
Step-by-step, yeah

380
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,180
He did that and then I did

381
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,100
Listen, what were you doing? Were you playing video games?

382
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:55,420
No, I was looking at theme songs from Disney cartoons that I could scat along to I wish you would take anything seriously

383
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,780
Well, that's not how I live my life. I'm kind of like the Patch Adams

384
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:10,620
Lot of beeps and bops but it's good. It's interesting. It's interesting. I'm worried Justin stuck in scatting now

385
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Let's go the money zone

386
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,420
I want to say thank you a big. Thank you to babble for

387
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:32,820
Sponsoring our show. They've very prominently listed the languages that they support on this incredible app

388
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,500
Apparently maybe we've made some up in the past. Yep. They don't necessarily do

389
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,780
I don't know why we talked about Klingon so much that one time and I'm really sorry

390
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,140
But let me tell you about the real babble not the pretend one you

391
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:48,900
Want to learn a language? Maybe it's for work. Maybe it's for fun. Maybe it's a little extra practice at school

392
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
Whatever, but maybe it's to win a bet

393
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:56,700
You need a fun way of doing it or you're not gonna stick with it. And that's where babble comes in

394
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,580

397
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,460
Pretty impressive. I mean

398
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,500
Say no more with babble

399

457
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,480
What

458
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,880
Where am I?

459
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,440
What happened? What what did what's going on?

460
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,320
Who are you two?

461
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,120
My name is dr. Sam bet no

462
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:02,120
I just thinking like wouldn't be cool if he quantum leaped in here. How would he explain he doesn't normally introduce himself like that

463
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:06,720
I think that would kind of break the concept of the show first. Yeah. Yeah, he leaps in and he's like

464
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm not the dude. I want a lunch squad

465
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
I want to munch

466
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:22,840
Welcome to munch squad. It's podcast within a podcast profiling the latest and greatest in brand eating

467
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:30,680
Y'all got frios gourmet pops around here your area. No Fritos gourmet pop. Sorry. It's very confusing

468
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
f r i o s

469
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,720
lowercase F if you okay, that's not like you're saying Fritos, but you're in a terrible hurry

470
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
This free Zaxby's

471
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,640
The premium quick-service restaurant beloved for its chicken fingers

472
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,760
Wings and legendary Zax sauce has partnered with Alabama based gourmet popsicle brand frios to introduce

473
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,360
Sauce flavored popsicles. No, Zaxby's sauce sickles will be available for free

474
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,400
I'm assuming they mean on it from a monetary perspective. They will be free not from the hole

475
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,680
It will take on you as to eat just cold sauce

476
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,920
The frozen treat will feature two of the brand's boldest sauces

477
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Zax sauce and tongue torch

478
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,720
Oh you guys want to see him real quick while we're while we're chatting about this give me one sec

479
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,960
I don't know if I actually do. I mean, I guess it's just a popsicle right? How gnarly could it look?

480
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,560
I'm Ben pretty gnarly cuz I just feel like it looks kind of gnarly like

481
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,680
I mean if they didn't say tongue think about Zax sauce though, like what would that think about how much of that?

482
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,040
I don't think I know what Zax sauce is

483
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,120
The Zax sauce flavored sauce sickle features all the sweet tangy and creamy flavors

484
00:40:54,360 --> 00:41:00,160
From the signature blend of spices black pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Oh, that's no I'm good

485
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,280
I'm alright actually without that the tongue torch sauce sickle is a mild heat tomato pop with nuts garlic paprika turmeric and a hint of lime

486
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:15,640
Zaxby's is renamed the month of September sauce timber, which I don't think you could just do not a portmanteau

487
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:24,200
I mean listen guys Congress has been getting stuff done lately. And it seems this seems like a worthy federal holiday. Oh

488
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,780
We don't work in September. That's when we think about sauces that we enjoy all day

489
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:37,780
Uh Zaxby's is celebrating sauce timber, which they made up by treating loyal fan base to this saucy goodness on a stick

490
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,700
The sauce sickles come packs at eight and are limited to one per person

491
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:49,260
Can I just stop you there trade man and say I don't this place will give you eight free popsicles. That's a lot

492
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,580
The only way that that works is if they tasted the first one and said we can't fucking sell this

493
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:02,060
We need eight million of these fucking things we give them away

494
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:07,460
I don't think you can call something that is frozen solid saucy

495
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:14,140
Right. It is inherently as it no not about that as it melts. Your hand is just covered

496
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,780
The very smell if it gets on your skin

497
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,980
Yeah, like as you're eating it, that's you all day. You can't wash your hands enough

498
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,340
Here's what's up, though

499
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,900
Like if you go they'll be available for free on September 19th online through sauce sickles calm

500
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,020
okay, so if you're like listening to this like

501
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,420
Go get some take a picture. You know what I mean? Like do I don't live near a Zaxby's?

502
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,620
It's kind of a road trip treat for me. Like, you know, good luck. Good luck spelling sauce sickles though

503
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:52,660
Oh man, go to sauce sickles calm. They're like melting in a puddle. Oh god

504
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,660
It's like a creamy oh god, oh god

505
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,380
I've tried three different spellings of sauce sickles calm and none of them have gotten me there even in this picture

506
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
It doesn't say the words

507
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:14,580
Yeah, now let me tell you how they could have really made something special is if they had called them Zaxby's prank sickles

508
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:21,820
And then all of a sudden it's a nice the 4th of July BBQ and you have your you know

509
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:28,760
Nephew Dale Dillip who you fucking hate and you're like enjoy a creamy treat Dillip and but then he gets the spicy

510
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:36,020
Chicken flavor well, but now you guys talk to his dad Jormie and you and Jormie has never been really close

511
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,980
Yeah, he's one other brief with you all please. This just came across my desk

512
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,820
Chipotle

To offer garlic guajillo steak in the metaverse for a limited time. Wait, did you say in the metaverse?

514
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,060

Across the US and Canada and virtually in the metaverse for a limited time

517
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:08,500
The brand's latest menu innovation introduces an entirely new flavor profile to Chipotle's menu featuring tender cuts of steak

518
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,900
seasoned with the bold flavors of garlic and guajillo peppers earlier today Chipotle became the first restaurant brand to officially unveil a

Chipotle grill simulator experience on Roblox. How?

522
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780

That should be a trick where like if you do that your bank just automatically gets notified and shuts down like closes off your bank

Accounts like you you are not responsible enough for this. You can't you just spent you just spent

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,400
So that is happening in the in the metaverse

537
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,280
I don't want to read about the menu innovation garlic

538
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,080
We here steak pairs a familiar crave ability of garlic with the allure of I don't care get to the digital

539
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,680
Roblox day an awesome protein with a slight kick. This does sound good though

540
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:59,560
I'm starting to have roblox on my phone. I don't Chipotle premiered its new menu innovation on roblox today at 7 a.m

541
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,680
PT with Chipotle grills a burrito hour

542
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,600
That's what I'm reaching for you

543
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,360
They wanted to make sure they got all those school kids before they had to get to class of the school kids all they're talking

544
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,800
About guys. No, look all the topics are here. No way Derek

545
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:23,800
They no one's ever revealed a new menu item in the metaverse. It just doesn't it doesn't happen. Hey, um

546
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,040
Can I pull back the curtain a little bit and just be honest for a moment?

547
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,240
Is the metaverse just like the way people are referring to like the Internet now?

548
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,540
How much longer do we have on the it looks like we could go about 10 minutes on this. Do you want to Travis?

549
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,700
Because is the roblox. I thought the metaverse was just what Zuckerberg was doing

550
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,900
Well, how deep does it go? It's it's what's next? It's not funny

551
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,140
This is the one thing I'll say. I mean, it's kind of fun now Griffin. What are you doing?

552
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:59,160
Are you looking up the metaverse on your phone? I'm on I'm trying to log into roblox, but it's been a while

553
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,640
Can I go into the metaverse and eat the steak

554
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:14,080
Um, do you have Mark Zuckerberg? That's true. Can we get Joey pants to say like actually the steak of the metaverse is

555
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:22,120
Delicious. I told you all now. Do you have Mark Zuckerberg special flavor harmonica attachment for the oculus? Yeah

556
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,480
You do it slots right into the bottom and it looks like a regular harmonica

557
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,440
But it's got different flavors inside of it

558
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:32,320
And then you just suck them out as you like you'll walk toward the giant

559
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:39,320
burrito in the Chipotle experience and it'll be like suck pepper suck flower and then you get like those flavors in your mouth and it's

560
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:47,480
Suck beef. Yeah. Oh, okay juice. Thank you. Thank you juice. Yeah, of course you have of course you have roblox ready to go

Roblox here now. I'm in the virtual Chipotle. So this is the metaverse. So this is the metaverse trap God

00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,520
I wish you guys knew how loud how loud the music is in my ears. The metaverse is so loud

Okay, so I'm at the Chipotle restaurant and there's all they got a drink fountain. No brains. That you are running into

578
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:27,680
You get to work at you get to work at Chipotle and not get paid you while you get paid in

579
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,200
imaginary Chipotle script

580
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:34,840
Essentially is what we're talking about and in real life as your character rolls out in real life

581
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:41,720
There's a robot somewhere that you're controlling that's rolling it right so like like in war games and sometimes

582
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,760
They don't even tell the flesh human Chipotle employees that the robots there and so there have been countless

583
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,260
accidents where the robot thinks it's making a

584
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,320
Burrito, but really it's like rolling up

585
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,240
the bones of the poor Chipotle employee

586
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440

They don't they don't say that that it's structurally impossible to make this burrito with tan with a tangible

Constellation counseling Wow, why would they not have more there?

607
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
Okay, here it is sorry

608
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,240
However for the past few years my real interests have been in space law

609
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,400
Yes, how can I show the world?

610
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,880
I'm ready to represent the Stars and as a space lawyer, what should my first order of business be that's from Constellation counselor and Carrie

611
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,240
Well, hmm. This definitely has to exist

612
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,520
I don't think we should look it up because there's no doubt in my mind because there has to be laws about like

613
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,680
launching satellites into space

614
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:21,200
Right and who can have what up there and how much of the moon we own which is all of it the last one

615
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,740
I don't know, but there is there is international satellite law

616
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,600
We got there first and by America standards. I'm not saying it's right or wrong

617
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:38,240
But we got there first we put a flag on it and historical precedent says that's ours. Yeah. Yeah, that's I mean

618
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:42,020
Here's here's the thing about space law if you and it's definitely wrong by the way

619
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,920
Well, I just you jump back putting your flag on something and saying it's mine. Definitely wrong. We not do that

620
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,160
We all share the moon. There's a tree. We all share the moon's all of ours the moon's all of ours

621
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,840
Yeah, but it's mostly

622
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:56,300
But it's mostly my I think of it as a very American celestial body

623
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:02,020
The thing that sure s did that I think you could model here is if you want to do a space thing

624
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,920
Yeah, there's a little moment of fake it till you make it I think cuz you're not going up there very much

625
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,080
nobody is but we like to act like we are for example a

626
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:16,520
Little bit ago. I don't know if you heard but the America did the United States Space Force and

627
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,540
Everyone had a very good laugh about that like wow

628
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,640
It's really wild that they want to start a Space Force and we'll have a lot of fun. There's a different guy in charge now and

629
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,240
We kept the Space Force as far as I know

630
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,400
So I guess we all just kind of like yeah, I guess we got a Space Force now

631
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,180
Yeah, it's one of the things that we have is a fleet of guys and gals and people just to defend space

632
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:43,020
You know, we made them. We made the patches that go on there already did it

633
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:48,240
There's a space marine we printed out we 3d printed their space marine battle armor

634
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:53,700
So we can't just throw that away there and I'm not gonna make them like we're not gonna fire them

635
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:59,380
Then you just got a bunch of angry people trained to battle in space. I don't need that. I see Armageddon

636
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,820
Well now hold on Justin. They started off as drillers who were then trained as

637
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:11,500
Space people because it's easier to train drillers to be space people

638
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:17,900
And it is to train space people to drill as that movie establishes now. I will say this

639
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:23,160
What if you just started on your business cards have it say like, you know Constellation Counselor and Kerry

640
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,940
business and construction attorney comma

641
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:33,980
preeminent space law expert now at this point interesting because now at this point there may be someone else on earth

642
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,760
Who's like no way? I'm the preeminent space law lawyer or whatever now if that happens

643
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,280
You're gonna have to challenge them to a space law off

644
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,180
Right and you beat them maybe in a Yu-Gi-Oh card battle. I don't know. However, you want to settle it?

645
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,980
I mean Travis every every court

646
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:57,380
Hearing is a law off if you really want to get technical about anytime people go to court. It's a loss

647
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:03,740
It's a lot. It's a little laws contest. I guess that's true Griffin. It's all Yu-Gi-Oh battles, but with laws you are correct

648
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,820
That's all the court cases. The evidence is a blue eyes white dragon

649
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,620
There's the the analog works here and off a bunch of different ways. I think we can all agree

650
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:17,200
It's exactly the same, you know when your lawyer transforms into a more serious version of the original lawyer

651
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,300
Yeah

652
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:30,300
We know so much about Yu-Gi-Oh, um, hey, hold on to your beans real tight. Okay, I'm gonna freak him. Okay

653
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
Isn't all law space law?

654
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:43,620
Like we're here like we're all in it. Yeah. Hey, do you know what I mean? So yeah, man

655
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,780
Aliens we're aliens. There's a lot of law. There's a lot of

656
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,860
Argument about where space starts right for space law because there's also sky law, right?

657
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,300
but there's a there's obviously some sort of

658
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:02,300
Permeable barrier there between sky law and space law all the really yes go on

659
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,100
right, but if I if I'm on a

660
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:10,580
Rocket ship and I kill one of my fellow astronauts at like, you know in the ionosphere

661
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,380
Like whose jurisdiction is that in is there air?

662
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,940
What's that? Is there air then it's sky law?

663
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:24,820
There's some air but it's then I'm gonna say at that point you're I think space right now is like international waters

664
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:30,340
I think if you're you get out there you kill someone past the atmosphere. Oh, yeah

665
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:36,220
So what if we what if every rocket ship has to have a bird on the outside of it launches?

666
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,580
And then as soon as that bird dies

667
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:44,260
That's space baby. I think that's cuz birds love sky

668
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:51,180
But they hate space and this may be the only way that we can really tell where one star one as long as we're doing

669
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,420
That Griffin, let's cover our whole basis bird at the front, right?

670
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,220
It's I'm gonna land the animal at the back

671
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:02,700
So that way we know as soon as it goes from ground law to sky law where it's just like, oh, okay that Fox died

672
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:07,820
Okay, the fuck I don't know why you picked a Fox, but okay, we'll go on with Fox

673
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:13,220
I would pause it that Fox and bird would probably die about the same time

674
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,540
Duct-taped them to the outside of a rocket ship as it blasts off. I'm gonna say they're all here

675
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:27,060
I'll grant you this Travis. There's probably going to be a small margin between Fox death and bird death

676
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:33,300
And but I think that the lawyers know the Fox is at the very back so that it's touching the ground

677
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:40,500
Right before you leave, right? Why are we good? Sorry. Why did you take the bird to the rocket?

678
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:45,340
So, you know when you get into space cuz birds love sky Justin keep up birds love sky

679
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:55,460
Here's a mnemonic device if birds alive you're in the sky if birds are dead then space ahead

680
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:01,540
Oh, you're not okay and around space, okay fine

681
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:07,220
But Travis you don't need the Fox to have its feet on the ground in the same way that if I jump in the air

682
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,060
And shoot someone that's not skycrime. That's

683
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:18,180
About of distance where the Fox is gonna be like I can still see the ground. It's totally cool

684
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,660
Maybe that's it's when the Fox starts freaking out. You're in sky here in the sky

685
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,620
Yeah, that's as long as the Fox remains calm

686
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:32,300
Still earth all more. I think that caught the Fox will be fairly upset by being taped to a rocket

687
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:39,300
I will I know that base level obviously just that's that's your new base level. So you gotta let him acclimate

688
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:40,140
Yeah

689
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:46,460
Train chill foxes that don't mind being taped on guys tape them to the rocket a couple head days ahead of time

690
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:53,980
Yeah, we do is this is we were struggling what we do is we tape baby foxes to the space ships and they grow in captivity

691
00:58:54,780 --> 00:59:01,820
This is natural for them. They love it. And this is we're getting into we're starting to get into ethically choppy waters

692
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:07,060
So I just want to say right now choppy waters ahead ethically choppy waters ahead

693
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:16,620
I just want to say right now. These are hero foxes. Oh, see I was gonna go the other way Griffin and say these boxes deserve it

694
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:21,780
These boxes stole some chickens space is Australia for foxes

695
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,740
We're not even doing it for experiments anymore we're just blasting

696
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:35,940
Okay, this is definitely a hero bird right because birds love sky every bird wishes they could get this there's so many birds

697
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,940
So many too many

698
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:48,180
All right, I think we've I think this solves it yeah, yeah the question that was asked which is where does space start yep, you're welcome

699
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,820
Hey

700
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:56,040
All right, I know you had to acquire that and program it during the show

701
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:04,040
No, that's why you're doing your ad Justin well what I've found is a 50 second bed so we can just and it's

702
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:08,700
Isolated it's just that part so it can go for it's chiller than I remember

703
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:15,840
Well, it's isolated so you don't have this this the scorching guitars. You don't have Hetty doing his bass riffs

704
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,000
Oh, hey, can I tell you guys some exciting news, please?

705

715
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:12,020
