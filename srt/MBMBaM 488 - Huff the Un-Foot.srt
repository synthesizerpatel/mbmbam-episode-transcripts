1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,640
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:46,960
Hello everybody, and welcome to my brother, my brother,

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
mean advice show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm your middle brother, Travis McElroy.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm your sweet baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:06,080
Oh, there's a turkey in the studio.

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
Oh man, not again, oh not again.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Could one of our producers come in here and get it?

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,640
Yeah, if you could get the turkey.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,160
Any one of you?

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,680
Someone come get the turkey, the turkey has now soiled my coffee.

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,480
Dillip, could you come get it, or Susman?

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
Don't touch it like that.

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
Susman, show Dillip how to touch it right.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,120
Oh God, Susman, no.

19
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,640
Boy, I wish we hadn't pardoned, boy howdy,

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,120
I wish we hadn't pardoned this turkey for all its crimes.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,400
To be fair, most of its crimes were white collar,

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,920
and it has used its skills to help solve other crimes.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,760
As everyone knows, we may need a little bit of setup here

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
if you don't follow the news.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,720
And perhaps, and I'll say it, it's most ill-advised policy.

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
This administration has decided that all pardoned turkeys

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,080
must live with us, or any other podcaster.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Our name got pulled out of the hat.

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
Of course, everybody knows about Stinky Fred,

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,560
the turkey that lives at the Joe Rogan Show.

31
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,640
And I'm just hoping, what podcaster do you guys hope

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
gets a turkey next year?

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,280
I kinda would like to see Mark Maron interview a turkey.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
He already did, if you ask me, Gallagher.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,960
Guys, that's one real turkey.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,720
Is there a Maron episode with Gallagher?

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,920
Oh, there's a famous Gallagher Maron episode, Travis.

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,520
Get with the fucking net, dude.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,040
I am up to here in turkey shit,

40
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,800
and ready for the holiday to be over.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,920
For those of you who can't see,

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
Griffin just pointed to the bottom of his shoe.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,440
It's not really that dramatic.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
Nah, I'm swimming in it.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,600
In the fiction that we've crafted,

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
whose house is the turkey at?

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,240
I think that in this world, in the fiction we've created,

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,240
we were all in the same studio living together.

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
In like a full house kind of scenario.

50
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,360
As so many television producers who we have floated the idea

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
of making a My Brother, My Brother, Me television show

52
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
have suggested, we all live together in one swinging pad.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
One of us is married.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
One of us is in a long-term relationship.

55
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,440
One of us is a swinging single.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,000
Also, there's like four dozen fucking turkeys in here.

57
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,440
Yeah, and here's the twist that makes this really special

58
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,080
and why I think this is coming this fall to NBC

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
is that one of us is a coyote.

60
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
And that makes things so funny and a little bit sexy

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
with all of the fucking turkeys.

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
And all the turkeys are like paying tenants, right?

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,000
So like, we can't eat them, right?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
But we want to.

65
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
And also, thank you Justin for not giving away

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
because one of us is a turkey,

67
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,520
but you don't find out which one until like season three.

68
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah.

69
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,520
Well, that's interesting

70
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,760
because Justin actually said one of us is a coyote,

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
but the idea that one of us is a turkey

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,280
is also very powerful, Travis.

73
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
And I'm going to bring this up to Ryan,

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
who's the showrunner on this one.

75
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
Oh, we got Ryan.

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,320
Ryan Reynolds.

77
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,360
We got Ryan.

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
No, it's just Ryan.

79
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,440
Yeah, he's the exotic Norwegian television showrunner.

81
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,760
He made fucking cheers.

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,320
But anyway, this is Turkey House coming this.

83
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
And this has been the pilot to Turkey House.

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,160
Turkey House, one coyote.

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
This is Turkey House.

86
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,680
This is Turkey House.

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
And I hope you guys liked it.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
And this was the intro for this funny episode

89
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
of my brother, my brother and me.

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,880
It was a funny introduction.

91
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,400
Turkey House, colon, one coyote is the second season.

92
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,240
We're doing it like Terrace House.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,720
Yes.

94
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,920
With like, you know, boy, ex-girl in the city.

95
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
That kind of deal is one coyote.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,880
And then season three is Turkey House, colon, too many eggs.

97
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,000
Yep.

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,640
Next one is Turkey House boys versus girls in the city.

99
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,600
This one, we're drawing a line down the middle of the house

100
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
and we're putting some fucking catapults in there.

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,360
So this is an advice show.

102
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
Catapult, more like birdapult.

103
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
That's one of the jokes that happens.

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,680
That's one of the many jokes that we have

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,520
in season four of Turkey House.

106
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,120
That was supposed to be saved for the trailer for season five.

107
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm sorry, everyone forget, forget I said it.

108
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,320
Wow, Travis.

109
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,800
Wow.

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,760
We've got nothing.

111
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,240
So I'm going to go back to the joke board for season five

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,280
and I'm erasing that one.

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
And now it's blank.

114
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,600
Yeah, there's no more jokes on the board.

115
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,440
A bird in my hand, more like a hundred birds in my hand.

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,520
If it makes you feel any better, Justin,

117
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,960
the joke board for this episode of my brother,

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,400
my brother and me, as far as I can tell,

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,640
was Griffin makes a turkey noise

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,320
and then we just kind of, everything else

121
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
was just that one little twisted brand of magic that we-

122
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,320
Griffin, you were making that turkey noise?

123
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
You kidding me?

124
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,120
I thought you had a turkey with you.

125
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,800
What a betrayal.

126
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Okay, okay, okay.

127
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,000
I was making it with my throat

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,480
because I am the one who was-

129
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
You're the turkey.

130
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,440
Please, God, we got to start doing the podcast.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,240
This is it, Griffin, this is the podcast.

132
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,680
Betrayal, we're in it.

133
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
This one's getting a little long in the gobbler.

134
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,840
So if we could just swing right on one-

135
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
That is how we finish season five,

136
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,160
the final season of Turkey House.

137
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
This one's getting long in the gobbler.

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,760
So that's the last line of dialogue.

139
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,480
Class dismissed, and then we flip off the light.

140
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,520
Class dismissed, I love, I do love class dismissed.

141
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
Every show should, at the end, every show,

142
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
the last episode of Law & Order should be like,

143
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,000
one of the cops is like,

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,400
anyway, criminals, we caught all of you.

145
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
We got all of you.

146
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
Class dismissed, turn off the lights.

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,920
Yeah, shit.

148
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,120
I have a rare condition called laughter-induced syncope,

149
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
which is a fancy way of saying,

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
I faint when I laugh too hard.

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,400
All the studies I've read say

152
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,160
the best way to treat situational fainting

153
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
is to stop doing the thing that causes it.

154
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm not gonna stop laughing, so my question is this,

155
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,320
how do I tell my new friends they don't have to worry

156
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,480
when I suddenly lose consciousness during a fit of laughter?

157
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,320
That's from fainting goat girl.

158
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,760
Sunglasses, big, loose suit,

159
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,720
weakened at Bernie's, is this anything?

160
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
Huh, huh.

161
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Is this any, I'm partying with my new friend,

162
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,240
they start cracking up so hard that they faint,

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,320
but they're wearing a big sort of Blues Brothers suit,

164
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,600
and they're wearing sunglasses.

165
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,920
I look at them, and I think, hell yeah,

166
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
that must be a cool thing that people are doing now,

167
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,920
is just sort of a surprise siesta situation.

168
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,040
And maybe have a friend with you who, when you do this,

169
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,040
say, they're processing it, right?

170
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,320
And it makes it seem like, wow, not only do they enjoy my joke,

171
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,160
they're really taking it in.

172
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,880
They're really appreciating my contribution

173
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,160
to the conversation.

174
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,040
Hey, what was up with what just happened to you?

175
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,960
Oh man, your joke was so fucking dope

176
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
that I had to dream about it right now.

177
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,560
Sometimes I hear jokes that are so funny and so cool,

178
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
I think, I'd like to play with that in the dream space.

179
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,720
And so I go immediately to sleep right there,

180
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,080
and right then and there.

181
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,600
Here's, I've never, I don't think I've ever done this

182
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,040
on a show before, but I am going to offer my services here

183
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,560
to the question asker.

184
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Here's what's gonna happen.

185
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,600
I'll travel around with you,

186
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,520
and when someone makes a really funny joke,

187
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,600
and you feel yourself starting to laugh too hard,

188
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,240
I'll then make a joke of my own making

189
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,400
to level you out back down to the middle.

190
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,040
Travis is the comedy chill out tent, essentially.

191
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,520
I'll make a joke that you go, I mean, conceptually,

192
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
that's funny.

193
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,160
Yeah, it's kind of a thinker, huh?

194
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
I guess that's, yeah, that's funny in a way,

195
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
it has the structure of a joke.

196
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,920
If Justin and I are bringing the acid,

197
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,000
Travis swings back in with the base,

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,120
just to keep your pH as close to zero as possible.

199
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,160
Yes, and I'm willing to do that for you,

200
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,400
I guess for the rest of your life.

201
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,240
I guess that's what I'm offering here.

202
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
Let me tell you something about friends.

203
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,560
Okay, oh, everybody, wait, hold on, give me a second,

204
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,360
let me get in place.

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm ready to laugh about Ross and Chandler, please go.

206
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,760
Joss, Roey,

207
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,040
Pandler, Chibi.

208
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,280
Those are my new set of friends.

209
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,560
No, let me tell you something about friends.

210
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,600
A true friend will still worry about you

211
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,920
even if they know why you fainted.

212
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Yes.

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,320
I still think there should be concern,

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
I think concern is fair.

215
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,960
You were standing over a big pile of broken dishes,

216
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
you know, when you were laughing so hard.

217
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,240
When you were laughing so hard.

218
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
Other unsafe things,

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,960
come on, play with me in this space.

220
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
Yes.

221
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,440
You know, unsafe stuff.

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah, the bus saw factory.

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
Yeah.

224
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,480
Bus, thank you, bus saw factory.

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,880
You were working on a girder, building a tall tower.

226
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,320
Yeah, and it was lunch break,

227
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,360
you were having a big 1920s sandwich.

228
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,280
Oh yeah, and a big old thermos of coffee

229
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,200
with your sandwich, I guess.

230
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,720
Having a big stogie, looking out at the 1920s

231
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,320
New York City skyline.

232
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,120
One of your friends tells an off-color joke,

233
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
it's the 1920s, so probably about,

234
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know, Eisenhower.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Woo, off you go, I'm concerned.

236
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,000
Your real friends are always gonna worry about you

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,720
when you faint, and that's fine, that's healthy.

238
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,000
I think that's normal.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,400
Has this never happened to you guys?

240
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,160
Laughing so hard that you fainted?

241
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,200
Yeah.

242
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,040
No.

243
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,400
No, I don't think so.

244
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
Okay, this has happened to me.

245
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,760
Well, but Justin, you have a tendency

246
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,520
to get a fit of the giggles, in a way that

247
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,240
Griffin and I don't really.

248
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,260
I titter like a polite little mouse,

249
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,040
but Justin, you rip and roar like a big,

250
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,720
I don't know, like a monster truck.

251
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,700
Yeah, you start going, and I've seen the tears

252
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,000
flow from your eyes, the color rise to your face,

253
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've seen you near death from enjoying

254
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,160
a joke I have made so much.

255
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,440
I would love a super cut of all the times

256
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,500
that we've gotten noises out of you on this show

257
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,520
that are more like, bleh!

258
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,160
Like, do you, like, let's like,

259
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Trav, hey Trav, do a laugh for me, like one of us.

260
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,200
Okay, and when I do it, I'm like.

261
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,300
But sometimes, Justin, when you do it,

262
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,140
you're like, bleh!

263
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,000
Is that what it's like?

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Yeah, wow. Sometimes that.

265
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,400
And it doesn't start like that, but you get there,

266
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,320
and that's probably, so if I guess.

267
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
You know how Dennis Nedry sounds

268
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,560
when he gets hit in the face with the spittle?

269
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,920
Oh, this is a good, yeah, please, go on.

270
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
It's like you were laughing at that noise that he made.

271
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Justin, don't take this as us slamming you,

272
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
or dunking you, or burning you, or razzing you,

273
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
or zapping you, or anything like that.

274
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm saying you would pass out less

275
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,840
if you opened the glottis a little bit.

276
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,440
Or if you just didn't enjoy things anymore.

277
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,160
That, no, stop it.

278
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,280
I want Justin to have a joy-filled life.

279
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,560
I'm just saying, when you have a laugh in there,

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,360
don't squish it down and give it a, bleh!

281
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,960
Open the glottis, and just, ah, and let it out.

282
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,800
Yeah.

283
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,960
Speaking of.

284
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh, let's hear you try it.

285
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
Pry open that glottis, and let them.

286
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,680
Do something fucking funny.

287
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,520
Farts.

288
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,720
Here's what, now, let me see if this makes me,

289
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,800
I came up with a joke.

290
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay. So, let me say it,

291
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,640
and see if I laugh hard enough.

292
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,260
Okay. To where, okay.

293
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,860
Bernie Man?

294
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,000
It's like Bernie Man, but with Bernie Sanders.

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Is that anything?

296
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,240
Bleh! Oh, God.

297
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,080
Shit, actually, I kind of get it now, Juice.

298
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,680
That feels good as hell.

299
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,140
It's like I'm a laugh crockpot.

300
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,320
It's like I'm a giggle pressure cooker,

301
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,560
and I keep it down there, and I feel it more.

302
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,160
I feel the happiness more.

303
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,360
I'm glad I could help.

304
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,280
Do you guys want to, how about a Yahoo?

305
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes, please. Yeah.

306
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
Tessa sent this in.

307
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,500
It's from Yahoo Answers user, Colin, who asks.

308
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,200
Hey, thanks, Tessa.

309
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm thankful for you.

310
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,120
Can a principal have a paper that says

311
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,240
list of student I don't like?

312
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,120
Oh, definitely.

313
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
Yeah, for sure.

314
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,200
I was supposed to interview the principal at my school,

315
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,360
and I walked into her office before she did,

316
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,560
and I saw a paper that said that,

317
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,440
and it had a list of freshmen, sophomores,

318
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,560
juniors, and seniors.

319
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Right as she walked in, she hurried up and took the list,

320
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,480
and hid it in her desk.

321
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm surprised this teacher needs a list,

322
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,720
because my list of people I don't like

323
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,840
is kind of always at the forefront of my brain,

324
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,600
just sort of cooking there.

325
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm shocked that this person is having

326
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,440
such trouble keeping track.

327
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,920
If I may, perhaps they misread this,

328
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,320
the question asker misread the situation,

329
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,000
and that was the weekly list turned in by each teacher

330
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,840
to the principal, so they could keep a catalog

331
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,480
of just the worst little shits in the school.

332
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,280
It's like, hey, we're all gonna get together,

333
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,720
in the teacher's lounge, and compare notes

334
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,360
about what students we don't like,

335
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,880
who we're gonna give detention to or fail,

336
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,160
just cause the ones who, I don't know,

337
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,040
maybe we'll hide something in their desk,

338
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
and then yell at them for it.

339
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,000
You know how teachers are.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Like chattering teeth.

341
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Yeah.

342
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,680
These freaking millennials that show up

343
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,280
with their chattering teeth,

344
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
causing a ruckus in my classroom.

345
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, you get it, with their joy buzzers,

346
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,440
and I don't know, their sticky hands

347
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,080
that they use to whip across the room

348
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,440
to collect things from one another.

349
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,960
Oh, I hate those.

350
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,520
Their wax lips.

351
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,680
Yes.

352
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,160
Oh.

353
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,000
You know what I don't like?

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,920
You know what I don't like?

355
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,740
What, Travis?

356
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,960
I don't like their troll dolls,

357
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,800
with their tall hair.

358
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Okay, thank you.

359
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,720
And their little weird belly buttons.

360
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,560
Oh.

361
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,800
They stick it in Jeff's nose,

362
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,560
and then he gets into a sneezing fit,

363
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,800
and I'm trying to talk about algebra.

364
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,060
They won't stop tickling Jeff's nose with the troll dolls.

365
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:29,900
Yes.

366
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,040
I'm going to confiscate every one of them

367
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,520
and burn them in a big pile.

368
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,880
Another big problem is that millennial baby names

369
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,340
are pretty wild now,

370
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,560
and so maybe it's tough to member those.

371
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,800
Yeah, like Diplo.

372
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,120
Diplo is a big popular one.

373
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,540
Skrillex.

374
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:49,680
Jandice is a huge one now.

375
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,520
Suisman.

376
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,600
Nedry.

377
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,920
John Jirndi is huge.

378
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,360
Travis.

379
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,520
If you guys were teachers,

380
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,880
what subject would you teach?

381
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,040
This is a fun question.

382
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,360
Drama.

383
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,080
Driver's Ed.

384
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,200
Which means also coaching.

385
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,440
Oh, yeah.

386
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,440
I would be Driver's Ed.

387
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,760
I would go at it backwards,

388
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,360
how most of the time they let the coach do Driver's Ed.

389
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
They would bring me in for Driver's Ed,

390
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
because of how good I was,

391
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,200
but then I would have to do coaching.

392
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,960
What would you coach?

393
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,460
You know.

394
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,520
I don't.

395
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
Skateboarding.

396
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,560
Nice.

397
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,360
Uh-huh, a skateboarding coach.

398
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,640
I'd probably coach e-sports.

399
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,480
They say those who can't do teach,

400
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,760
so that would be actually a really good gig for you,

401
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,440
Griffin, with a skateboarding coach.

402
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,400
Yeah, it's easy.

403
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,240
Get up there.

404
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,060
Jump.

405
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,000
No, not like that.

406
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,440
I'll push you.

407
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,280
Let me push you.

408
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
I'll push you.

409
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Now make the board go up with you when you jump.

410
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,680
No, not like that.

411
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,960
Not, I would show you, but that's too easy.

412
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,920
You need to find, everybody's got their own style.

413
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
You fell over again?

414
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,260
Don't do that.

415
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,500
I'm gonna pull out this row of bleachers.

416
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,480
Just make the thing go up with you

417
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,920
and you grind all the way down it.

418
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
No, not like that.

419
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,120
Oh my God.

420
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,880
Now do a Chrysler 360.

421
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,320
Why are you having so much, F, F.

422
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
F's across the board.

423
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,220
All right, Justin, what would you teach?

424
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,440
How am I?

425
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,800
Okay.

426
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,040
If I don't have any more, just like cooking.

427
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,360
You know what they need in school?

428
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Just like basic life skills.

429
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,880
Sure.

430
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,360
I would get, you know what my class would be

431
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
called the real shit.

432
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,960
Yeah.

433
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,360
What it'd be is called the real shit

434
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,280
and I would tell your students how it really is.

435
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,440
I would teach, this is a class that I wish

436
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,480
they had been taught to me when I was in.

437
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,400
Pirating media.

438
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,240
Yeah, that would be another one.

439
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,400
That's a good one.

440
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,560
In high school, I wish that, this is a class

441
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,600
I would teach of the importance of opening mail.

442
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Cause you know, sometimes you get the mail

443
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,560
and you're like, I'll open this later.

444
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,080
And then you open it like three weeks later

445
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
and you're like, oh, that was an important letter.

446
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,880
I'm gonna get yelled at, right?

447
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,960
And you think as an adult,

448
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,160
you would just open the mail when it comes.

449
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,560
But I feel like somebody didn't teach me that.

450
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,400
And maybe I could go back and teach them

451
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,080
the importance of opening mail in a timely fashion.

452
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,920
That would be a short class.

453
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,440
You think that, but do it, just as in big letters.

454
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,560
Juice, I think you'd be a good cooking teacher

455
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
for cooking class.

456
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,560
However, the worst school fight I ever saw in my life

457
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,240
was in my high school cooking class.

458
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,080
You're kidding.

459
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,080
It was a, it was like a five person, like co-ed,

460
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,480
just real hullabaloo, a real hooskow.

461
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,640
So like, what do you do?

462
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,520
You're teaching about how to make, you know,

463
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,920
taco salad or whatever.

464
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Yeah, definitely.

465
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,560
What happens when that, when the hooskow breaks out?

466
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,360
Here, Griffin and I worked it out.

467
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,200
Okay, okay.

468
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,020
Okay, you ready?

469
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,860
Yeah.

470
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,880
Hey, those are my tomatoes.

471
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,440
Those are actually my tomatoes.

472
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,280
I mean, let's hit each other a lot.

473
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,460
With tomatoes?

474
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,340
Okay.

475
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm already hitting you.

476
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,000
I hit you in the face and in the neck.

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,840
I'm hitting you back,

478
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,180
but I'm hitting you the best and hardest.

479
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,640
Justin, imagine I hit him in the neck and in the torso.

480
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,920
I hit him in the gonads.

481
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
He hit me in the gonads and I fell down over,

482
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
right in my, right in my orbs.

483
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,640
Oh God, he's hitting me in both butt cheeks,

484
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,480
like bongos.

485
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,720
Punching both butt cheeks, I have one, two fists.

486
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
I'm just pounding them, pounding, pounding, pounding.

487
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,520
It's okay to squeeze one.

488
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,600
Oh no, one of my butt cheeks popped.

489
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
I popped one of his fake cheeks.

490
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,120
Oh no, it was actually real.

491
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,960
I don't know how this has happened.

492
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,240
Oh God.

493
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,840
Teacher, teacher, I made the butt cheeks come out.

494
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,680
Oh, it's right down to the bone.

495
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,920
Teacher, teacher, I see his bones.

496
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
Oh no.

497
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,440
Oh, my butt is sliding down my leg.

498
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Oh God, it's in my knee.

499
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,280
Hey, do you guys want to see some new Fortnite dances

500
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,580
I've been coming up with?

501
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,640
He's dancing on my broken butt.

502
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,520
Have you stopped the fight to unite the class?

503
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,760
Is this a different student?

504
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

505
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,560
Who's trying to unite the class?

506
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,400
Hey, hey, hey.

507
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,240
And they're disliked of him.

508
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,480
Guys, guys, cut it out.

509
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,040
This one's called the silly tornado.

510
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,160
Oh, now you're punching my butt.

511
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,600
I guess you didn't like it.

512
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,000
No more butts punched.

513
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I would just do, I mean,

514
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
I have a pretty good teaching style.

515
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,060
Because it seems like you just ignored it

516
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,760
to talk about blueberries.

517
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,420
No, I just let you fight it out.

518
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,320
See, if I catch you fighting in class,

519
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,240
I'm gonna make you fight a whole pack of them.

520
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,000
So you love fighting.

521
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,040
It's the cigarette thing, but more.

522
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,000
So if you like fighting one person so much,

523
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
I'm gonna make you fight a whole pack of students.

524
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,500
Cool.

525
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,340
Okay?

526
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,280
So you'll fight a big, big group the next time.

527
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,480
Okay, wait, can I try this now?

528
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
I want to see what my teaching style is

529
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,160
and you two fight and I'll see if I can break it up.

530
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,040
Hey, Grimbo, I really hate your guts.

531
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,160
Oh yeah, kiss my nunchucks.

532
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,500
Hey, you two.

533
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,000
What's this really about?

534
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,340
I'm proud of you and I support you.

535
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Okay, let's team up.

536
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,600
Let's team up on this nerd teacher.

537
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,920
I'm gonna kick his nunchucks.

538
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,040
Oh, they're punching me in the butt.

539
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,200
Oh no, my butt.

540
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Now Griffin and I are the teachers.

541
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,640
Okay.

542
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,160
And Travis, you fight yourself.

543
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
Okay.

544
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,960
So don't listen to what this guy says.

545
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,080
He always lies.

546
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,320
I'm the real history teacher, not him.

547
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,960
I'm punching myself in the butt so hard.

548
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
He just came in here.

549
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,040
I know he looks exactly like me

550
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,960
because he copied my skin and my face.

551
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,360
Copied my skin and my face.

552
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm the real history teacher.

553
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm the real history teacher.

554
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,080
Which one do I fight?

555
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,600
Well, say something true about history, real teacher.

556
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
Real teacher.

557
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Go ahead, I'm waiting.

558
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,100
Go ahead, I'm waiting.

559
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,920
World War I was a hologram.

560
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,360
Okay.

561
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,840
It's my first time doing a secret Santa exchange

562
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,560
and I got someone who I've only met once.

563
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
The only thing I know about this person

564
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,360
is that they're into feet more than the average person.

565
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,600
Waka waka.

566
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,680
Wait, hold on.

567
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,080
Read the rest of the sentence, though.

568
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,200
Their job specializes in feet.

569
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Okay.

570
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,640
And they don't seem like the type

571
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,380
to use standard presents, such as candles.

572
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,440
Well, should I, no one uses the candles.

573
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,740
That's not the point.

574
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,120
Should I embrace the feet thing and get a goof?

575
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Or is there a special secret Santa ultimate present

576
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,800
I can get them to impress?

577
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,240
That's from Man I'm Not Sure in Melbourne.

578
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,080
Okay, just real quick.

579
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,040
I'm going to speak, is it podiatrists?

580
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,240
Who are the feet doctors?

581
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,300
Podiatrists.

582
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,200
Their job specializing in feet,

583
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,840
they probably don't like it if you describe it

584
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,080
as like they're into feet more than the average person.

585
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,160
Probably don't love that.

586
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,300
Yeah.

587
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,500
My oh me, I'm a proctologist.

588
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,080
Let me open up this package from my friend I've met once.

589
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,620
Well, that's a asshole.

590
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,800
Interesting.

591
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,160
I've never bought a candle for somebody for a secret Santa

592
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,200
because they seem like someone

593
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,520
who's just going to use the hell out of that candle.

594
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
You do it because it's like in a fancy jar

595
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,000
or like it's holiday themed.

596
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,280
You can always go with like, I don't know,

597
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,280
like a Jimmy Dean sausage specialty platter or whatever.

598
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,920
Yes, there's a spectrum of acceptable

599
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,280
sort of person agnostic gifts

600
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
that you can get someone for the holidays.

601
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,480
And the most base of these are, you know,

602
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,760
the Target gift card or whatever the hell.

603
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,220
Something that you're going to,

604
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,580
this is something that you can have and you can use,

605
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,080
but you do not need

606
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,300
because I don't know you enough to know your needs.

607
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Yes.

608
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,000
This is, I have done a lot of like white elephant,

609
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,920
Santa, you know, secret Santa things.

610
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,480
And let me tell you, here's the hierarchy,

611
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
the spectrum of gifts.

612
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,720
At the top is the like, I know you so well

613
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,040
and I absolutely nailed this gift that you weren't expecting.

614
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,680
A novelty shirt referencing an inside joke off Redbubble

615
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,520
or some shit like that.

616
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,640
Right, that's the best.

617
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,160
That's easily the best.

618
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Then the next step is totally generic, but usable, right?

619
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Big tin of popcorn, candle, a gift card, right?

620
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,200
And then at the bottom is I sort of knew you

621
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,280
and took a stab in the dark.

622
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,480
That's where you get a thing where

623
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,000
not only can I not use this,

624
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,880
I now also don't like it.

625
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,640
So like, cool, I don't know what to do with this.

626
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,440
I know you like dogs.

627
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Here is a picture of some dogs framed in a nice frame.

628
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,520
That's nothing, this is nothing you've given me.

629
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,220
You've handed me air, essentially.

630
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,280
I was gonna search for candle that smells like feet.

631
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,320
And as I began to Google it, there was an auto-complete.

632
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,480
So quick auto-complete challenge.

633
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,240
What are the top five things that people search for

634
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,220
completing candle that smells like?

635
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,620
I'm gonna say fart.

636
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,440
No, no, incorrect.

637
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,840
I'm going to say, and this may be cheating

638
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,100
because I saw it on like my Facebook feed,

639
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,520
like rainy cement, like wet cement, rain.

640
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,360
No.

641
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,620
Shit.

642
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,120
Petrichorus is what you're looking for.

643
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,100
Books.

644
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,240
Uh-huh.

645
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,080
Is weed.

646
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah. Okay.

647
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,860
Matches.

648
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,200
I like that.

649
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,880
I love the smell when I light it,

650
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,440
but then that just goes away.

651
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,760
How could I keep that going?

652
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,840
That must be the one that just like haunts

653
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,080
candle inventors of like, just can't get there.

654
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,820
Then there's candle that smells like rain.

655
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,080
And then the last one is candle that smells like gasoline.

656
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,480
Whoa.

657
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,160
That's a wild, that's a wild ambiance.

658
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,180
That might, maybe that's not somebody looking to buy that.

659
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,200
They bought one and it smells like that

660
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
and they're terrified.

661
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,700
Or possibly that Jeff Gordon searched that 50,000 times.

662
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,540
Yeah.

663
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,200
So much so that it shows up now as a frequently searched.

664
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,560
What if you just put out like a new,

665
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,000
like Yankee candle that just was labeled like,

666
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,860
smells like candle.

667
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,840
That would really like boggle the noodle.

668
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,720
Oh Travis, that's so fucking wild.

669
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,080
How does that brain work?

670
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,400
Here comes, here comes a Justin laugh.

671
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,240
If this doesn't get it, then what will?

672
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,520
It smells like candle.

673
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,160
Oh, yeah, dang.

674
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,000
No, it wasn't bad.

675
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,080
I mean, it wasn't bad.

676
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
We need to invent, and this could be fairly lucrative.

677
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,280
We've done this before at the magic acorn,

678
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,580
but that was, I think we can all agree that was rude,

679
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,840
cop out, not practical gift at all.

680
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,840
We need something else in the popcorn bucket sort of milieu.

681
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,500
Like a neutral gift that's just like as good as a gift card.

682
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,020
Something like, you know, fucking paper towels.

683
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,560
God, I'm always running out of these things,

684
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,500
but still more of a gift than that.

685
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,940
That, oh yeah, but that's not it, right?

686
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,340
Because that doesn't imply,

687
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,020
I want something that both implies

688
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,580
I didn't know about you,

689
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,300
but I thought about the human experience, right?

690
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,260
Ooh, that's a good point, Trav.

691
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:59,060
To quote the home wrecker in Love Actually,

692
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,540
I don't want something I need.

693
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,700
I want something I want.

694
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,160
And in that one, she's talking about her boss's sex,

695
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,860
even though he's married.

696
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,220
What about a scarf?

697
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,860
Again, in Love Actually, she gets him a scarf,

698
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,420
and it's quite a, that one's thorny,

699
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,780
because of Love Actually.

700
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,020
That one's a little bit thornier,

701
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,700
because she gets him a scarf.

702
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,500
What about a laundry hamper?

703
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,880
Not expensive, but something everyone uses,

704
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,140
but I would never think to buy at the store.

705
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,780
Maybe you get a laundry basket,

706
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,340
like a really nice one with nice handles,

707
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,540
and then you go into their house early,

708
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,460
and you break theirs.

709
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,500
Uh-huh. Cool.

710
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,340
And make sure- I guess that could

711
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,660
really work with anything, huh?

712
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,820
That particular strap.

713
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,480
Break it right in front of the front door,

714
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,500
so they see it.

715
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,700
Like, as they're leaving the house that day,

716
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,140
like, ah, dang, wait, what's that?

717
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,340
I got a new one, a secret Santa.

718
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,500
What fortuitous circumstances.

719
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,260
Put the shards of their shattered laundry hamper

720
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,260
inside of the new laundry hamper

721
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,420
when you give it to them.

722
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,980
That'll really flip their fucking bean, dude.

723
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,500
What about, oh, here's a good universal gift.

724
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,340
Oh, he's got one.

725
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,100
Yeah, get a big bow, and put it on their car

726
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,820
outside in the parking lot, right?

727
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,060
And then you pull back, and say, I got you that.

728
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,020
This is for hunters, I'm assuming?

729
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
What?

730
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,620
This is for hunters, mainly, I'm assuming?

731
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,180
A big bow, no, excuse me, like a ribbon bow.

732
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,020
Got it, okay.

733
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,900
And they're gonna look out the window and see it,

734
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,260
and they're gonna laugh, right?

735
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,580
Because that's funny that you did that.

736
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,680
And that's all you're really going for, right,

737
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,100
in this bleak existence, is one bright moment of laughter

738
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,020
shared with a new friend.

739
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,100
Because you were the funny friend

740
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,820
who put a giant bow on a car they already owned.

741
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,880
Oceans eight on blue ray.

742
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,980
Thank you.

743
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,340
Finally, one of us says it.

744
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,640
It's a great flick, not enough people saw it.

745
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,940
Sandy's bringing all of her heat.

746
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,020
If it had been the first one in the series,

747
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,780
y'all would've loved it, right?

748
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,900
I would've loved it because we would've had two more.

749
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,540
Oceans nine and 10.

750
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,980
We still need those, by the way.

751
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,460
If you, please, I'm begging you, please, Hollywood,

752
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,700
make nine and 10, or else I'm gonna do a movie marathon,

753
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,780
I'm gonna have to sit in silence for four hours

754
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,160
before I can start 11.

755
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,000
Please don't do that to me.

756
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,620
Out of respect, out of respect for these fallen films.

757
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm gonna have to hire local actors to act out

758
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,980
what I think would've happened in Oceans nine and 10.

759
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,980
And while that is good for the gig economy,

760
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:35,140
it's not good for my pocketbook.

761
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,180
Okay, how about you put a SD card,

762
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,980
and you wrap that up, and you give it to them,

763
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,940
and they say, what's that?

764
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,780
And you just say, Bitcoin.

765
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,900
Huh, but it's not?

766
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
It's not Bitcoin?

767
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,460
I mean, it's not on there.

768
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,820
That's not how Bitcoin works.

769
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,400
And then you can just start explaining how Bitcoin works

770
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,880
until they've left the room.

771
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,840
The room?

772
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,580
How about a guest role in Oceans nine?

773
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:02,980
Huh, now I feel like that only works.

774
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,140
This only works if you're Sandra Bullock, by the way,

775
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,180
or someone with equivalent juice.

776
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:11,580
If Sandra Bullock got me in The Secret Santa

777
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,580
and got me a candle, I mean, I feel pretty good

778
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,220
because I got a candle from Sandra Bullock,

779
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,020
but I'd also be like, ugh, Sandra Bullock,

780
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,660
you don't know me better than this by now?

781
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,180
Now, hold on just a fucking second,

782
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,180
because I'm pretty sure old Sandy B has access to smells

783
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,820
that you could not even fucking imagine, Travis.

784
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,960
That's true, she can get me the match-scented candle.

785
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,360
That's, you're thinking too small.

786
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,080
Like, you don't know what you don't know

787
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,740
about Hollywood smells.

788
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,060
We haven't reached that echelon yet.

789
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,360
Maybe when we walk that Trolls red carpet,

790
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,660
we'll be taken into the sentitorium

791
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,900
and granted access to the forbidden smells.

792
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,900
But, I mean, I would love one of Sandy B's secret candles.

793
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,800
Yeah, like, here's a candle that smells

794
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,300
like winning an Oscar.

795
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,140
Yeah.

796
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,260
Hey, this question, a lot of questions we do

797
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,420
don't have villains other than just life and how it is.

798
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,420
This one does have a villain.

799
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:11,340
It is not even Thanksgiving yet.

800
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,580
Why is this office busybody looping people

801
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,560
into Secret Santa?

802
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,780
My brain isn't even there yet,

803
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,300
and we're already having to fight about Secret Santas.

804
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,940
You could have gotten to know this person much better.

805
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,780
You had time.

806
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,180
Oh, shit, you have time now.

807
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,740
Well, that's a good point, Trav, I guess, yeah.

808
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,560
Yeah, right?

809
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,400
I guess that's true.

810
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,000
Maybe this is why the office busybody,

811
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,860
or perhaps just friend group busybody,

812
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,220
has done this now, like, hey, you have six weeks

813
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,820
to learn about this person,

814
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,880
and maybe the best present you'll give them is friendship.

815
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,680
This is what Tuesdays with Maury is about, I bet.

816
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,760
We gotta stop saying that every episode.

817
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,680
I know, but I'm just so fascinated by it,

818
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,700
but I'm afraid to read it,

819
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,920
because I think I'll be disappointed

820
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,860
if it doesn't live up to all the predictions

821
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,980
I've made about it over the past, you know, 500 episodes.

822
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,400
Maybe they have put in the legwork

823
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,360
to get to know this person,

824
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,360
and they really are just all about that foot life.

825
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,520
Oh.

826
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,340
Do you know what I mean?

827
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,000
Their house is a foot locker.

828
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,160
Do you know what I mean?

829
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,600
Maybe we were wrong at the beginning,

830
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,380
when we were like, it's probably not a bit.

831
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,820
Maybe they did put in the effort,

832
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,700
and they're like, oh, how's it going, Dr. Stanson?

833
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,080
Exquisite toes.

834
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,040
Like, that's like the heat that they bring.

835
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,080
And I'm not saying people who are into feet

836
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,480
are all about that, but I'm saying

837
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,480
this particular podiatrist is into it that deep.

838
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,680
And also, to be fair, I think we maybe jumped to podiatrist,

839
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,660
but all this is they're just specialized in feet.

840
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,360
They might work at a foot locker.

841
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,880
Possible, possible.

842
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,120
If you are a podiatrist, and the question asker says

843
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,720
they specialize in feet, that seems like

844
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,920
a weirdly general way of putting it, right?

845
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,840
It seems like they could have given us a bit more than that.

846
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,480
That would have given some color, I think,

847
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,020
that would have helped.

848
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,840
Maybe, maybe, it's hard to say.

849
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,640
The holidays are tough for everyone, man.

850
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,280
It's so true.

851
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,600
Is it possible to find, is there like a candle sommelier

852
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
that you could talk to and say,

853
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
give me the candle that's the exact opposite of feet

854
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,940
so that they can burn it in their office

855
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,320
to create a neutral experience?

856
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,160
I'd be here.

857
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,000
Are you talking about fucking smell canceling technology,

858
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,540
Travis, because if so, yes.

859
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,760
Opposite candles that create

860
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,600
the exact opposite smell waves from feet.

861
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,100
Huff the unfoot.

862
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,160
The unfoot.

863
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,620
That's powerful, Trav.

864
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,280
I think, can you get a patent for bullshit

865
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,640
that doesn't exist but should and might?

866
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,480
As long as that's possible.

867
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,140
I think that's specifically what patents are for.

868
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,240
Yes.

869
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,080
This is mine.

870
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,960
No, no, I, no, patents are for,

871
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,720
I figured out a way to do things.

872
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,040
I'm saying a patent for like,

873
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,400
if someone ever does this, I got this,

874
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
because like I thought about, oh,

875
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,240
that it needed to happen.

876
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,800
So we can tell a fib to Uncle Government

877
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,360
that we invented the unsmell.

878
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,800
Yeah, what are they gonna do, send someone over to check?

879
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Yeah, what are they gonna do?

880
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,360
Come in and be like, oh, this doesn't pass the smell test.

881
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Mm-hmm.

882
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,020
Mm-hmm.

883
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,860
Mm-hmm.

884
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,040
Mm-hmm.

885
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,760
See, it feels good to let them out, doesn't it?

886
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,740
It does feel good.

887
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,360
Just rip them, baby.

888
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,200
Hey, if I'm gonna buy some secret Santa presents,

889
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,960
I need to go to the money zone.

890
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,520
Oh, well, let's go then.

891
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,360
Get on my back.

892
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,600
Wee.

893
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,860
Griffin, get on Travis's back.

894
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,700
No.

895
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,160
All right, then follow behind, like a sad song.

896
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,160
Oh, yeah.

897
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,480
You know what I wish I could have for Christmas just once?

898
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,000
A good night's sleep.

899
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,900
But I've been sleeping on this pile of hay and rocks,

900
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,400
and I just don't know what to do.

901
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,900
Not just like the baby Jesus.

902
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,960
Just like the baby Jesus.

903
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,120
Except all year round, and not just at Christmas.

904
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,320
What do I do, fellas?

905
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,720
Oh, jeez, Travis.

906
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,160
Well, boy, you gotta go to Casper.

907
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah.

908
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,880
You gotta also tell us if you're gonna set us up like that,

909
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,920
because I thought that you were driving this car,

910
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,000
and then I looked outside,

911
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,480
and you were like a half mile behind us,

912
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,360
and Justin and I were in the backseat trading Pokemon.

913
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,520
I thought Travis was driving,

914
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,280
and Griffin and I decided to look at some of the local flora

915
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,080
and fauna while he drove us to our destination.

916
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
No, I was driving.

917
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,720
I just needed you all to check the map

918
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,040
to see where I was going.

919
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,880
Okay.

920
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, bud.

921
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,540
Yeah, listen.

922
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,380
That's a full-time gig.

923
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,760
I can't be occupied with that.

924
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,600
Casper's great.

925
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,240
I'm trying to do my Sudokus back here.

926
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,400
Casper makes the mattresses.

927
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,240
They're so nice.

928
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,980
We all got them.

929
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,840
Got the in-laws in town right now.

930
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,680
They're about to crash on our Casper.

931
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,500
So psyched, so jealous, actually, of them.

932
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,040
And there's products, guys.

933
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,460
These products are cleverly designed to mimic human curves,

934
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,680
providing supportive comfort for all kinds of bodies.

935
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
And yeah, the original Casper,

936
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,400
it combines multiple supportive memory foams

937
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,520
for a quality sleep surface.

938
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,380
And it's got sync, it's got bounce

939
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,520
in just the correct sort of ratio that you want.

940
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,080
And also, they got that 100-night risk-free sleep

941
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,000
on it trial that it's gonna do you just right.

942
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,040
Justin, take it over.

943
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,880
So here's what you're gonna do.

944
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,480
You don't wanna take our word for it.

945
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,320
You wanna find out for yourself.

946
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,160
We are untrustworthy.

947
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,620
We are shady.

948
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,560
Proven.

949
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,120
Go to casper.com slash brother

950
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,640
and use the code brother at checkout,

951
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,400
and you're going to get $100 towards select mattresses

952
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,160
by visiting casper.com slash brother

953
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,340
and using the code brother at checkout,

954
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,120
terms and conditions apply.

955
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,680
There's a 100-night risk-free sleep on it trial.

956
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,640
Just give it a whirl, casper.com slash my brother,

957
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,680
and then use the code brother at checkout to save 100 bucks.

958
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,680
I wanna tell you about my new service that I've invented,

959
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,120
and it's called Blayubrin.

960
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,720
And basically, what I do with this service

961
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,880
is I send you already made meals,

962
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,760
and then you're gonna take those meals

963
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,460
and break them back down to their individual components.

964
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,300
Like a puzzle.

965
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,960
Yes, exactly like a puzzle,

966
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,000
except it's like if you bought a puzzle

967
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,720
and it was already done in the box,

968
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,320
and then you had to take it apart.

969
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,480
Fuck, that sounds good.

970
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,000
I would love to smash big puzzles for a living.

971
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,820
And here's the-

972
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,660
It's the best part of puzzles.

973
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,680
The best part about Blayubrin

974
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,160
is that when you are done,

975
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,000
you're gonna ship that on to somebody else,

976
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,840
and then they're gonna take

977
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,720
those individualized ingredients,

978
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
they're gonna make a meal out of it.

979
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,720
Right.

980
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,560
Are they gonna eat it, you're asking?

981
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
No, that would be disgusting at this point,

982
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,360
because it's easily like two or three weeks old.

983
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,540
They're gonna ship it on to the next person

984
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,000
who's gonna break it back down to the end,

985
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,920
and so on, and so on, and so on.

986
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,280
And if that's fascinating, Travis,

987
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,800
but I'm gonna give you a counter proposal.

988
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,120
How about this?

989
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,700
How about instead of that, whatever that was,

990
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,060
it wasn't comedy, but whatever that was, Travis,

991
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,920
how about instead of that,

992
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,840
they head on over to Blue April

993
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,120
and get ingredients delivered to them,

994
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,200
and they can make something

995
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,160
worth celebrating this holiday season.

996
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,680
So they make the meal and send it,

997
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,040
they send the meal to someone?

998
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
No.

999
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,640
No, you actually consume it on site

1000
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,900
in front of God and everybody.

1001
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,680
There is a wide array of Blue Apron recipes.

1002
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,520
They can kinda customize it to different diets.

1003
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,220
I've been going a little healthier lately.

1004
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,900
Last night, Sid made lettuce wraps

1005
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,480
with some beef and farro in it.

1006
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,840
It's delicious, it's delicious.

1007
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,500
They have wonderful meals that you can make at home.

1008
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,960
They're fun to make, and I'll say,

1009
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,860
even more fun to eat.

1010
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,180
Whoa.

1011
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,000
Maybe this season, give yourself the gift

1012
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,560
of learning how to be one of the great chefs,

1013
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,300
and I don't mean competent in the kitchen.

1014
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,240
That's what Blue Apron wants me to say.

1015
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,840
What I'm gonna say is begin your journey

1016
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,480
towards becoming the next Ratatouille chef guy.

1017
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,680
Remi, thank you.

1018
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,260
Start now.

1019
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,040
Bring the magic of the kitchen back and enjoy a home.

1020
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,960
Bring the magic back, bring back the magic of your kitchen.

1021
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,040
Hey, bring that back.

1022
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,600
Bring Magic Mike back to your kitchen

1023
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,200
and have him cook you a home-cooked meal.

1024
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,720
Check out this week's menu and get $60 off

1025
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,560
when you visit blueapron.com slash my brother.

1026
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,600
That's blueapron.com slash my brother.

1027
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,800
Blue Apron, cook more.

1028
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,760
We interrupt the podcast you're listening to

1029
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,280
to tell you about another podcast.

1030
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,920
That's right, we got this with Mark and Hal.

1031
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,160
That's correct, Mark.

1032
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,240
This is Hal.

1033
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,280
We do the hard work for you,

1034
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,680
settling all of the meaningless arguments

1035
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,440
you have with your friends.

1036
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,520
So tune in every week on the Maximum Fun Network

1037
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,360
for We Got This with Mark and Hal,

1038
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,480
and all your questions will be asked and answered.

1039
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
You're welcome.

1040
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,200
All right, that's enough of that.

1041
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,040
We got this.

1042
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,560
Can I Yahoo?

1043
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Please do. Please do.

1044
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,880
This one was sent in by Ethan.

1045
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,720
Thanks, Ethan.

1046
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:58,720
It's a Yahoo Answers user, oh geez, I Am Male, who asks,

1047
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
before Tarzan learned about humans,

1048
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,640
why is he the only one who's wearing a cloth

1049
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,080
while the rest of his gorilla families are naked?

1050
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,840
Okay.

1051
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,600
Well, I assume it's because gorillas

1052
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,800
have a natural protection for their bits,

1053
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,320
what with fur and hair and stuff,

1054
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,160
and just the way that they walk.

1055
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,920
Where humans, because we stand upright,

1056
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,280
would have that genitalia exposed and dangerous.

1057
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,000
Plus, it would really hurt when you're swinging on vines.

1058
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Counter.

1059
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,840
Okay.

1060
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,400
You don't know that Tarzan doesn't have

1061
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,280
a patch of fur down there to protect his stuff.

1062
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,200
Well, I mean, I assume he has some fur, you know what I mean?

1063
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,960
His monster bush, Trav.

1064
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
Yeah.

1065
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,560
Because he lives in the jungle

1066
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,120
where they don't have electric razors and shit,

1067
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,800
so he's probably got mad fur down there.

1068
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,480
But he probably uses a humorous animal tool,

1069
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,000
like on the Flintstones, where we would have,

1070
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,440
I don't know, I almost said a beaver,

1071
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,320
but that's a little too on the nose, huh?

1072
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,400
They have, and I'm thinking about this now,

1073
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,440
in Flintstones, he had some sort of weird

1074
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,200
prehistoric squirrel guy, right,

1075
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
who chewed off his beer when he shaved in the morning.

1076
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,320
Do you use this?

1077
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,880
Ew, wait a minute, is that real?

1078
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,840
But Travis is speaking gospel,

1079
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,360
like they had animals that occupied.

1080
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,640
Like his teeth would go like brrrr.

1081
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,880
That's not, but it says,

1082
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,960
he's eating Fred Flintstone's beer tray.

1083
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,280
He doesn't, I don't think he eats that,

1084
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,160
I think it falls harmlessly to the floor.

1085
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,960
But Justin, you're.

1086
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,760
He's getting, okay, stop.

1087
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,840
No, you haven't even let Griffin

1088
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,680
get to the heart of the question.

1089
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,480
You're in year 2019, I'm in year 3120,

1090
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,320
let me get to my shit.

1091
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm not saying that he is eating some beard,

1092
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,200
that's what I'm saying.

1093
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,040
Yeah, but let Griffin finish,

1094
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,040
because I can see where Griffin's going.

1095
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,200
Come with me down the road, the rest of the highway,

1096
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
because you're 100,000 miles behind me.

1097
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,760
He trims the beard, you know he's doing bushwork as well.

1098
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,680
Unless they have a separate, nastier, prehistoric squirrel

1099
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,680
that gets in there for the edge work.

1100
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,920
It's not possible.

1101
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,840
It's not efficient, it's not cost efficient,

1102
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,040
it's wasteful.

1103
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,360
Hey, Fred, can we talk?

1104
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,960
It's me, your shaving squirrel.

1105
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
This is no longer a living.

1106
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,720
I've been talking with.

1107
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,920
What are you talking about?

1108
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,720
It's a symbiotic relationship.

1109
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,040
It's not though, because I don't eat the pubes,

1110
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,600
I don't need the pubes to live.

1111
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,440
I've been talking with.

1112
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,720
I need your face hair to live.

1113
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
Yes, I've been talking with the mammoth

1114
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,400
that you use to wash your dishes,

1115
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,760
and I've been talking with the pterodactyl

1116
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,960
you use to play your records.

1117
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,520
And we've decided to unionize, Fred,

1118
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,400
and basically the one point, the one point

1119
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,040
we all agree on is none of us wanna eat your pubes.

1120
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,320
Can you imagine the squirrels all sitting around

1121
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,480
and one squirrel's like,

1122
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,600
I think you know the worst part about people?

1123
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,560
It's when they make you eat their bush.

1124
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,960
And then all the other squirrels just fall completely silent.

1125
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,160
Jeremy, what did you just say?

1126
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,640
Yeah, you know, when they make you eat their bush.

1127
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,480
Shut up.

1128
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,560
That doesn't happen.

1129
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,000
No, that's nothing.

1130
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,640
It's nothing, okay.

1131
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,480
We agree that's nothing, but can we also agree

1132
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,320
it's pretty whack that Tarzan reached a certain age

1133
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,440
and his gorilla family is like,

1134
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,360
you gotta cover that thing up, son.

1135
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
That's weird.

1136
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,840
What is going on there?

1137
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,960
Cover that shit up, dude.

1138
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,920
I can see your whole penis, dude, cover it.

1139
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,480
Look at Grog's, right, now look at yours.

1140
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,520
Now look at yours, it's different, isn't it?

1141
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,320
Cover yours up, Tarzan.

1142
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,600
It's so different, I can see your whole boobus.

1143
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,440
That would be a completely different Tarzan experience

1144
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,840
if like Jane and like the whole party was there

1145
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,320
and Tarzan just walked in sans loincloth

1146
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,560
and everyone's just like, oh God.

1147
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,880
And they're just like looking at the sky

1148
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,160
as he's like, aye, Tarzan.

1149
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,360
They're like, yes, yes we are aware.

1150
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Your whole business is just there, Tarzan.

1151
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,880
Tarzan's business?

1152
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,920
And then you have to explain, I don't know, modesty?

1153
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,920
He like steals a top hat from the wealthy benefactor

1154
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,280
of this expedition and puts it on his head

1155
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,360
and he does a little dance with the Rosie O'Donnell gorilla.

1156
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,520
But the whole time the mini driver character's like,

1157
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,520
dude, dude, bud, it's out your thing, please.

1158
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,600
How often do you think animals in nature

1159
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,760
are out like running around or whatever

1160
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,160
and just thinking like,

1161
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,440
man, I wish we could cover this stuff up?

1162
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,000
I would love to have pants right now, it's cool.

1163
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
And I'll tell you why,

1164
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,240
it's because I just ran over some reeds

1165
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,800
and I got nipped a few times by him

1166
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,800
and I wish I had some sort of shell or protection

1167
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,240
like the turtle has.

1168
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,040
It's also like cold, man, I wish I had clothes on.

1169
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,520
Oh boy.

1170
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,360
All right.

1171
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,280
I could have done another 15 minutes

1172
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,640
on animals in Australia.

1173
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,480
Yeah, sure.

1174
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,120
I want to munch.

1175
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:18,960
Squad.

1176
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,800
Squad.

1177
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,120
I want to munch.

1178
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:23,960
Squad.

1179
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,120
Squad.

1180
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,600
I've been hearing from a lot of my Canadian friends

1181
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,320
about Christmas pizza.

1182
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,840
Now Christmas pizza is a product of Boston pizza,

1183
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,920
which is owned of course by Dragons Den,

1184
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,200
stalwart Jim TreLiving, used to be a mountain.

1185
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,800
That always sounds like you're saying Jim for a living.

1186
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,640
Go on.

1187
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,320
Nope, it's Jim TreLiving.

1188
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Yeah, he owns Mr. Lube, owns Boston Pizza, huge success.

1189
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,800
And Boston pizza is going hard this year.

1190
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,760
They are going hard because it is the holiday season

1191
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,560
and they are bringing you a caroling pizza box.

1192
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,400
Huh.

1193
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,240
Huh.

1194
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,560
Now this isn't gonna seem that wild, but we'll get to it.

1195
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,080
So the pizza box, when you open it,

1196
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,080
it will play the song Carol of the Bells.

1197
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,560
How, oh, how?

1198
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,200
So you open it and I'm assuming they're,

1199
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,200
you know, we perfected this technology with greeting cards.

1200
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,240
You just open it and then it'll play

1201
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,700
Carol of the Bells, right?

1202
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,720
Boston Pizza's Niels Van Ooyen, a senior marketing manager,

1203
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,760
says that many of its pizza recipes

1204
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,360
are unexpected and creative,

1205
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,800
so it wanted creative assets to match.

1206
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,800
He says that a caroling box is a continuing expression

1207
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,440
of the brand's unique point of view.

1208
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,140
Oh, that's a long sentence that means nothing.

1209
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,600
Here's our point of view.

1210
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,200
What if the box sank?

1211
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,200
Now, boys, why are they making a caroling pizza box?

1212
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,020
You might ask.

1213
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,600
Well, for one, they're seeing takeout and delivery

1214
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,280
become increasingly irrelevant.

1215
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,600
Boston Pizza's classically sort of a sit down chain

1216
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,560
where you can enjoy a nice poutine pizza with your family,

1217
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,720
but right now, they're providing something very special

1218
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,000
and it's the Christmas pizza.

1219
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,840
Huh.

1220
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,880
Imagine a pizza that you love, okay?

1221
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,240
Imagine it with all your favorite toppings.

1222
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,800
Oh, yeah, okay.

1223
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,800
Okay, now get a rake and scrape all of those off, okay?

1224
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,400
So the good toppings are off, right?

1225
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,280
Yeah.

1226
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,720
So now we're gonna scoop on

1227
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,380
their seasoned rotisserie turkey.

1228
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,220
Okay.

1229
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,800
A house-made stuffing.

1230
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,640
Okay.

1231
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,560
Rosemary sage cream sauce.

1232
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,400
Oh, okay.

1233
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,040
And Italian cheeses.

1234
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,960
Okay.

1235
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,320
And then we're gonna ladle on some warm turkey gravy.

1236
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,360
Oh, boy.

1237
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,720
Some warm turkey gravy.

1238
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,680
And right in the middle, a huge dollop of cranberry sauce.

1239
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,620
Oh, boy.

1240
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:12,620
Oh, and when you buy it, you get a free Toblerone with it.

1241
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,460
Okay, okay.

1242
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,300
That's not on it.

1243
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,420
The whole time, I was like, this sounds dope as hell,

1244
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,580
waiting for the goof to kick in.

1245
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,940
It's receiving a free Toblerone at the end

1246
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,960
that really takes it over the top for me for some reason.

1247
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,900
You get a free Toblerone.

1248
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,740
I would.

1249
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,740
With this delicious pizza.

1250
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,580
Here's what I would be afraid of.

1251
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,520
Now, we are, of course, forewarned,

1252
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,480
but if I was somebody who just ordered a pizza

1253
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,780
from them and it came and I opened the box,

1254
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,340
and upon opening, the box began making

1255
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:45,540
any kind of noise at all whatsoever,

1256
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,660
I would drop it on the ground.

1257
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,820
Like, I would throw it across the room,

1258
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,100
assuming, I don't know, there's a swarm of bees

1259
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,280
or something inside.

1260
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,500
Is there bees inside?

1261
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,220
Sorry, I'm reading down here a little bit.

1262
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,100
There are bees inside.

1263
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,180
Just to let you know how wild this place gets,

1264
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,680
they also have cranberry barbecue ribs.

1265
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,180
I don't understand this restaurant at all.

1266
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,580
Well, we ordered a shitload of cranberries.

1267
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,660
We just got them.

1268
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,460
We gotta put them on everything.

1269
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,740
The box sings to you and it's got Thanksgiving inside it.

1270
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,580
Yeah.

1271
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,060
This is one of the best things you've ever brought,

1272
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,760
I would say, Justin.

1273
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,800
Hey, if you guys can be quiet for 30 seconds,

1274
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,980
I wanna play you an ad for it.

1275
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,740
That's right.

1276
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,420
Munch Squad AV, here we go.

1277
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,380
Christmas pizza, Boston pizza,

1278
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,340
this is an ad for a pizza.

1279
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,300
Cranberry sauce, gravy on toast,

1280
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,260
turkey as well, and also cheese.

1281
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,220
Why is there cheese?

1282
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,180
Cause we love cheese.

1283
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,380
Turkey and cheese, four kinds of cheese.

1284
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:49,740
Come try our Christmas pizza,

1285
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:52,020
this commercial's for Boston pizza.

1286
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,900
It's a turkey dinner on a pizza,

1287
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,900
pizza underneath the turkey dinner.

1288
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,820
Christmas pizza, free topper room,

1289
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,740
with a pizza, get it today.

1290
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:03,340
Boston pizza, the gather round.

1291
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:04,180
Free topper room.

1292
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,580
That's what they're.

1293
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,300
Free topper room in the pizza,

1294
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,020
but not on the pizza, don't get it twisted.

1295
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,260
It will certainly melt in the delivery process, guaranteed.

1296
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,420
I really appreciate that you did that, Justin,

1297
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,520
because it did answer my one qualm

1298
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,860
with this incredible Thanksgiving pizza,

1299
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,260
which is that they still went ahead

1300
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,300
and put some fucking cheese on it.

1301
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,140
It's not-

1302
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,180
They did put cheese on it.

1303
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,540
The rest of it, whatever,

1304
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:34,900
cranberry stuffing, mama's broccoli salad,

1305
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,700
whatever, go nuts on it,

1306
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,620
and it's Thanksgiving on some crust.

1307
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:40,460
I'm into that.

1308
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,220
But then they actually also melted some cheese all over it,

1309
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,900
and that commercial kindly explains,

1310
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,140
well, we like cheese.

1311
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,980
Yeah.

1312
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,820
Okay, Boston pizza.

1313
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:48,940
Hey, because we had cheese,

1314
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,780
and so they should have said-

1315
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:50,620
Hey, gym for a living.

1316
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,460
We have it with a bucket load.

1317
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,160
Gym for a living, could you step in to R&D real quick?

1318
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,980
So, wait, hold on, let me do my fucking gym for a living.

1319
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,940
Yeah?

1320
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,020
Well, we did what you asked,

1321
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,460
and we put a whole fucking Thanksgiving dinner

1322
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,300
on a Christmas pizza for some reason.

1323
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,220
Oh, that's great.

1324
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,380
Oh, that is great.

1325
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,220
The problem is-

1326
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,780
I love the sound of this pizza.

1327
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,660
Well, there's nothing to hold it off.

1328
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,860
It's just a bunch of wet, goopy ingredients

1329
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,820
kind of piled onto a flat surface.

1330
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,380
It's just going everywhere.

1331
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,220
So-

1332
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,940
Well, let me think about my assets.

1333
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,660
I got Mr. The Lube, does that help?

1334
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:27,340
No, I would say that just,

1335
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,160
that would make it more goopy, I would argue.

1336
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,580
Okay, I also own Boston Pizza,

1337
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:35,060
the restaurant that we're standing in right now.

1338
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,980
And you know what we got at Boston Pizza?

1339
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,820
Pizza?

1340
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1341
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,220
I'll let you get there,

1342
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,580
because that's going to be real satisfying.

1343
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,540
Singing boxes, I don't know, Jim.

1344
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,860
You had us working on that too.

1345
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,780
Can't we just make regular pizza with like-

1346
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,620
Cheese!

1347
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,460
Cheese!

1348
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,220
It's just that I didn't get my chocolate and pizza.

1349
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1350
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,460
God damn it.

1351
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,060
These rocket boots were supposed to kick off

1352
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,100
whenever I said cheese,

1353
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,020
and I was going to blast out the ceiling.

1354
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,420
God damn it.

1355
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,180
All right, hold on one second.

1356
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,020
Fuck.

1357
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,500
Let me try again, hold on.

1358
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,060
Cheese!

1359
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,300
Oh God, he exploded.

1360
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,220
Am I still here?

1361
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,540
No, you're on fire.

1362
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,860
Oh damn it, hold on, let me get this out.

1363
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,660
He's melting the cheese on the pizza.

1364
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,460
It's perfect.

1365
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,060
It was all part of my plan.

1366
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,980
Anyway, I'm glad I could help.

1367
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,980
Cheese!

1368
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:29,940
Okay, now it's working.

1369
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:30,780
God damn it.

1370
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,620
Now it worked that time.

1371
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:33,020
Ah, shit.

1372
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,660
Hey, how about another question?

1373
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,340
Yeah, do you have a question about what just happened?

1374
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,780
I don't have any questions for all I just have,

1375
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,620
it makes perfect sense to me.

1376
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,420
It all tracked to me.

1377
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,780
I'm going to need to travel for work this week.

1378
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,460
And I said I was thinking of driving myself.

1379
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:48,860
While my co-worker's thinking of flying

1380
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,860
or taking the train.

1381
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,420
Man, it's a boring start.

1382
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,780
Let's hang in there though.

1383
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,980
Together so far, it's pretty boring.

1384
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,260
I don't see what's boring, the rest of the question is,

1385
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,620
and if we leave at the same time

1386
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,180
and I'm going 60 miles an hour.

1387
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,580
Right, yeah, all right.

1388
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,980
Sorry, let me find my place here.

1389
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,500
A co-worker who I absolutely can't stand

1390
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,620
said it would be cost effective if I took someone with me.

1391
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,180
Pointing to himself.

1392
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,660
Yeah, we got it.

1393
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,580
I think I responded kind of non-committally.

1394
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,980
How the fuck do I shut this down

1395
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,740
so I don't have an aneurysm during a three hour drive

1396
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,780
with this completely inseparable person?

1397
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,260
This is tough because it is more cost efficient.

1398
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,060
Yeah, it is.

1399
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,900
That's true, it's much more cost efficient.

1400
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,500
You could tell them your car's cursed

1401
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,820
and anytime you drive with someone, they die.

1402
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,460
Okay, but that's gonna be tough to believe, I worry.

1403
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,740
Yeah, but I would also argue

1404
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,780
if this inseparable person isn't also completely dense,

1405
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,100
they're gonna read between the lines

1406
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,940
and get that you don't wanna ride with them.

1407
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,860
Do you think that?

1408
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,020
Because I find that people,

1409
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,260
one of the things that they lack,

1410
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:05,740
people who are tough to kind of hang out with a lot,

1411
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,180
one of the things that they tend to lack

1412
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,260
is sort of basic, you know?

1413
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,100
Yeah.

1414
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:11,940
Kind of like getting it.

1415
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:16,700
The stuff that we all kind of agree to without saying it.

1416
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,460
Right, yeah, just sort of like the stuff

1417
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,060
where like we all get it.

1418
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,100
Like the type of person

1419
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,420
who would invite themselves along

1420
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,940
on a three plus hour road trip

1421
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:27,060
with someone who they don't really get along with.

1422
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:30,980
Well, they don't know, see, okay, Jarv, here's the thing.

1423
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,860
They don't know they don't get along with you.

1424
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,300
This is what I'm saying.

1425
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,380
They don't have the stuff.

1426
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,020
They don't have what it takes.

1427
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:40,420
Okay, I'm changing my mind on this.

1428
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,940
You need to go on this road trip.

1429
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,620
It's the holiday season,

1430
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,340
and if holiday planes, trains, automobiles, I love it.

1431
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,060
What's the one with the dude from Married with Children

1432
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,660
where he goes to pick up his, I guess, new son,

1433
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,220
like stepson or something?

1434
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,420
You remember that one.

1435
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,260
It's not called, no.

1436
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,660
Sorry?

1437
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
Yes, with Tim Allen, Timothy Allen?

1438
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:02,780
No.

1439
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,860
Right, JTT?

1440
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,700
No, there's that one.

1441
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,980
JTT's in it. I'll be home for Christmas.

1442
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,860
No, on that one he goes home by himself.

1443
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,140
Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about though.

1444
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:11,740
I'm talking about the one with Ed O'Neil.

1445
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,580
Good flick though, good flick.

1446
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,180
Where he goes to pick up the kid

1447
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,020
and has to like drive him back to his family.

1448
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,260
You know the one.

1449
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,100
Duff.

1450
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,580
Yes, thank you.

1451
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,100
Ed O'Neil's only been in one movie.

1452
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,540
If you had just said the words Ed O'Neil,

1453
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,380
there's a chance. I said Ed O'Neil at least twice.

1454
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,220
Duff.

1455
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,060
Dutch. Good flick.

1456
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,660
It was Dutch, damn it.

1457
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,660
Dutch, Griffin, it was Dutch.

1458
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,580
Did Justin play it?

1459
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,420
It wasn't Duff.

1460
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,260
It was Dutch.

1461
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,100
Damn it.

1462
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,940
It was Dutch.

1463
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,660
Duff's my porn parody.

1464
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:42,660
Huh, that's a weird one.

1465
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,740
That's a weird conversion there, Justin.

1466
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,780
Okay.

1467
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,260
So anyway, do a Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with him.

1468
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,580
It was Dutch.

1469
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:54,100
I gotta stop doing this podcast with the two of you.

1470
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,980
The cover of the movie has him carrying the child in a bag.

1471
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,700
Wow, that is grim.

1472
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,780
Yeah.

1473
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,100
The T in Dutch in the title is just him shrugging,

1474
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,140
which says a lot about the movie to me.

1475
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,740
Ethan Embry is in it.

1476
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,660
Ethan Embry is not in my porn parody.

1477
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,940
I do not know where you heard that.

1478
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,500
I could never afford Ethan Embry.

1479
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,540
No, he's in Dutch.

1480
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,740
He plays Doyle.

1481
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,540
The two main characters in this movie

1482
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,180
are Dutch Dooley and Doyle Standish.

1483
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,300
That's rough.

1484
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,500
I say go on the road trip, I think.

1485
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,740
To get to know his girlfriend's son,

1486
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,500
a working class good guy,

1487
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,780
volunteers to pick him up from a prep school.

1488
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,260
I'm gonna play Pokemon.

1489
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,300
Only to learn that her son isn't the nicest kid.

1490
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,100
Written by John Hughes.

1491
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,980
What else about Dutch trash?

1492
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,820
JoBeth Williams is in it.

1493
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:50,980
Oh, huge.

1494
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,100
I'm gonna look at the trivia.

1495
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,260
Right now, I feel like how 80% of our audience feels

1496
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,860
when we discuss Frasier.

1497
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,980
I finally get it, everybody.

1498
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,260
Can we talk about Frasier real quick?

1499
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,100
Oh my God.

1500
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,940
In a meta sense,

1501
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:05,060
not one that requires knowledge of Frasier.

1502
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,620
People who listen to our show

1503
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:13,020
talk a lot about how our Frasier jokes go over their head

1504
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,100
because they never watched Frasier.

1505
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,980
I want to be kind of clear about something.

1506
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,780
We didn't watch Frasier either.

1507
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,020
We don't know.

1508
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,260
We osmose some Frasier.

1509
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,100
There's Frasier particulate in the air that we inhaled.

1510
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,380
I have watched, I would say 45 minutes of Frasier

1511
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,180
non-consecutively.

1512
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,380
Yeah, hey guys, don't sweat it.

1513
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,660
Nobody watched Frasier.

1514
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,980
Nobody watched Frasier.

1515
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,020
We all just agreed.

1516
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,540
We all allowed it to be on,

1517
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:41,540
but nobody actually watched Frasier.

1518
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,860
There's not some context you're missing here.

1519
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:44,940
It's Kelsey Grammer.

1520
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,780
He is-

1521
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,620
Fancy boys.

1522
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,260
A fancy boys, but the dad's isn't.

1523
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,820
And he has a dog and a stinky chair.

1524
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:52,420
That's it.

1525
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,060
End of synopsis.

1526
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:55,100
Should I do another question?

1527
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,580
Because I almost certainly cut about 90%

1528
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,260
of that hot Dutch material and threw it right in the-

1529
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,620
Oh, that should be the porn version.

1530
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,380
Hot Dutch.

1531
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:04,660
Hot Dutch material.

1532
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,500
Now, wait a minute.

1533
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,340
Travis has just opened up a cool idea,

1534
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,740
which is just like, if you want to make a pornography jaws,

1535
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,580
you would just do hot jaws.

1536
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,420
Hot jaws.

1537
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,820
Mel Gibson turned down the role of Dutch.

1538
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,940
Are you fucking-

1539
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,580
You can't pivot back around-

1540
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,420
Nothing is Dutch.

1541
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:22,260
Dutch is nothing.

1542
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,180
If our audience doesn't get fucking Frasier,

1543
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,300
they're not going to get Dutch, okay?

1544
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,700
None of us on this call saw Dutch.

1545
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,020
Is that agreed?

1546
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,860
Wait, hold on.

1547
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,180
Guys, this is a tasty one.

1548
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,340
This is a tasty.

1549
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,460
Six of 15 people found this interesting.

1550
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,740
Hold on, hold on, Travis.

1551
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,180
I gotta fucking, cause you said it.

1552
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,700
I had to sing the tasty Dutch trivia jingle

1553
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,660
or people will go wild.

1554
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:44,940
It's Dutch.

1555
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,740
Don't worry too much.

1556
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:48,820
Cause it's time for Dutch.

1557
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:50,660
Hot Dutch trivia.

1558
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,740
Now, there's a piece of trivia.

1559
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,820
Six of 15 found this interesting.

1560
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,620
Dutch, parentheses, Ed O'Neil.

1561
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,940
Wait, hold on.

1562
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,780
That's a bad hit rate.

1563
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,740
I see nine out of 15 people that cared enough

1564
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,060
to go look at the trivia for Dutch.

1565
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,260
You had to rate it very good.

1566
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,300
Looked at it and said,

1567
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,260
this actually isn't very interesting.

1568
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,020
I'm sorry that I wasted so much time

1569
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,580
looking at the trivia for Dutch.

1570
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:15,300
And you said, hold on, I gotta put this on a podcast.

1571
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,620
Dutch, parentheses, Ed O'Neil, and parentheses,

1572
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,060
says that at one point in his life,

1573
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,060
he drove a concrete truck, period.

1574
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,860
He and Doyle later hitch a ride on a truck

1575
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,380
that carries concrete pipes.

1576
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,980
End of trivia.

1577
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:32,460
Why are we talking about this fucking movie so much?

1578
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,140
There's some trivia too, but it's mostly spoilers.

1579
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,460
Sometimes I don't know how to stop it, Griff.

1580
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,500
That's what worries, that's what I get worried, honestly.

1581
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,660
I've tried a few times, Justin.

1582
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,420
I'm gonna have to say, you're a little bit complicit.

1583
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,420
You did write a whole song for Travis's-

1584
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,420
It's a jingle.

1585
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,700
Okay.

1586
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,540
If you're not gonna do them, I got to.

1587
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:51,860
I got another Yahoo here.

1588
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,340
And we'll do it real fast.

1589
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,180
We gotta end on not Dutch.

1590
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,660
I'm looking through the cast list down-

1591
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,700
Graham Robux- I'm just trying to see

1592
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,540
if there's any hidden gems.

1593
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,740
Graham Robux, from Yahoo Answers user la-la-la-la,

1594
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,740
who asks, when you catch a Frisbee, what are your options?

1595
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,460
Huh.

1596
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,820
When you catch a Frisbee, what are your options?

1597
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,620
Like, keep it?

1598
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:17,140
Catch it with both hands, or one hand is cool.

1599
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,540
You can do the one where you jump in the air

1600
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,780
and you catch it under your leg,

1601
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,860
like you're a neat youth pastor.

1602
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:24,420
Behind the back. I would say the best option

1603
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,140
is to always act like it's the first time

1604
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:28,900
you've ever successfully caught a Frisbee.

1605
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,500
And make it a real celebration.

1606
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,340
You know what I mean?

1607
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:34,500
Cause catching it's not assumed, right?

1608
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,460
There's no guarantee in this world

1609
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:38,260
that you're going to catch that Frisbee.

1610
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,220
So let's treat every time like it's your first.

1611
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:42,060
Yep.

1612
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,660
You could also catch it and take a big bite out of it.

1613
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,540
Yeah, catch it in your mouth like a doggie

1614
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,940
and take a big bite out of it,

1615
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:51,180
but then nobody can throw the Frisbee.

1616
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,020
So that's actually not,

1617
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,380
I'm gonna say that's actually not one of your options.

1618
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,220
I mean, it is an option.

1619
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:59,500
I would say probably the biggest crack up you could do

1620
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,140
would be to catch it

1621
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,100
and then immediately spin around 180 degrees

1622
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,820
and chuck it as hard as you can

1623
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,300
at a person that is not there.

1624
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,580
That would be a real crack up.

1625
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:11,740
Yeah, and you can shout like, catch dad.

1626
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,540
And then you throw it to nobody as far as you can.

1627
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,940
And then you can look kind of sad

1628
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,620
and no one's gonna ask you to clarify what just happened.

1629
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:19,820
I guarantee it.

1630
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:23,220
You know, the director of Dutch,

1631
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,500
it was his last movie he directed.

1632
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,060
You could throw it up in the air

1633
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,740
and then have it coming right back down to you

1634
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,220
and then say like, it's just me from now on.

1635
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,140
You guys can go home

1636
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:35,740
and you keep throwing it up to yourself.

1637
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,980
You could catch it and be like, oh nice, Dutch on DVD.

1638
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,020
But this only works with the Frisbee is Dutch on DVD.

1639
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,860
Correct.

1640
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,900
You could have another Frisbee

1641
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:46,340
that you throw at the other Frisbee in midair

1642
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,660
to knock it out.

1643
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:52,660
And when you do that, you yell, Beyblade, rip it up!

1644
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,340
This has been our show, my brother and me.

1645
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,820
Catch her to throw.

1646
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,780
Do a back flip in midair.

1647
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:05,900
If you are in Canada

1648
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,260
and you get one of these Christmas pizzas,

1649
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:08,300
please tweet us a picture.

1650
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,980
Make it clap right on that Frisbee disc.

1651
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,820
What it looks like.

1652
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,740
Cause I bet it does not look as tantalizing

1653
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,140
as these images make it appear.

1654
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,540
I feel like that could break bad really easily.

1655
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,060
And if you are listening to this

1656
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:20,420
and Dutch is your favorite movie,

1657
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,260
please let me know.

1658
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,080
I'm gonna hang up on the Skype call.

1659
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:22,920
You guys finish it.

1660
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,380
Please let me know if Dutch is your favorite movie.

1661
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,180
Oh, Griffin did leave.

1662
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,620
So anyway, this has been my brother, my brother, me.

1663
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,580
We hope you enjoyed it.

1664
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,700
We hope you're gonna download Dutch today.

1665
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,860
And oh, Griff's back.

1666
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:36,700
Thank goodness.

1667
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,220
I wanna thank John Roderick and the Long Winters.

1668
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:39,860
I'm just gonna barrel on through.

1669
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,700
Cause I-

1670
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:43,380
I won't reference the D movie again.

1671
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,420
I can do a noise cancellation.

1672
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,300
The D movie is the, of course, the third sequel

1673
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,500
to the B movie.

1674
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,620
Okay.

1675
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,460
All right.

1676
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,700
Now we're back in safe territory.

1677
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,540
Make a judgment on B movie.

1678
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,380
We got it all out of our system.

1679
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,220
Okay.

1680
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,740
Go ahead, Travis.

1681
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,580
The latest episode of Paul Blart Moncop

1682
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,020
Till Death Do Us Blart is out now

1683
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,500
where we watch Paul Blart Moncop 2 every Thanksgiving.

1684
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,580
The three of us and Guy Montgomery and Tim Batt

1685
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,060
from Worst Idea of All Time.

1686
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,540
Episode five is up now if you haven't listened to it yet.

1687
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,500
Also, because it is a new month,

1688
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,460
there's lots of new merch to check out

1689
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,060
over at McElroyMerch.com.

1690
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,820
We're excited to see you all at Candle Nights

1691
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:22,900
here in a couple of weeks.

1692
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:23,780
If you're gonna be at the show,

1693
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,100
make sure you send in questions,

1694
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,060
make sure you write that they are, you know,

1695
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,340
for the Candle Nights show in the subject line

1696
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,620
that goes for Yahoo's as well.

1697
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,100
What else, fellas?

1698
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,740
Oh, if you can't come to Candle Nights,

1699
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:41,820
you can still be a Candle Nights star.

1700
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,580
Every year, Riley Smurl and the other two Smurls,

1701
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,380
all the whole Smurl family,

1702
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,660
of Still Buffering fame raise money.

1703
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,100
This year, it's going to contact

1704
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,620
a Huntington-based organization.

1705
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:56,780
This is a 24-hour rape crisis center.

1706
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,020
And it's a fun organization.

1707
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:04,580
And for just $5, you can get a Candle Nights star

1708
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,460
that we will display during the show.

1709
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,900
So I think that's pretty cool.

1710
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,740
Absolutely. Honestly.

1711
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,060
I think you should go do that right now.

1712
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,900
I want to thank John Roderick and the Long Winters

1713
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,260
for the use of our theme song.

1714
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,220
It's a departure off the album,

1715
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,580
Putting the Days to Bed.

1716
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,260
Great tune, great track.

1717
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:24,500
One of the best, it's Rolling Stone's best song.

1718
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,220
They said. They said it.

1719
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,940
Rolling Stone said best song.

1720
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,820
And thanks to Maximum Fun for having us on the network.

1721
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:32,260
Go check out that hot new website, MaximumFun.org.

1722
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:33,620
Go look at all the shows on it.

1723
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:35,300
Oh, you know what's a great gift?

1724
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:37,220
You know what's a great gift to get someone?

1725
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,220
If you say Dutch on DVD, I swear to God.

1726
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,300
The knowledge that in just a couple months,

1727
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,900
they are going to receive a copy

1728
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,140
of the Adventure Zone Graphic Novel Book 3.

1729
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:46,980
Oh, right.

1730
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,780
You can pre-order that now, maybe include like a letter

1731
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,500
about it in an envelope that says,

1732
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,900
hey, in July, this book's all yours.

1733
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,940
It's based on the Pedals to the Metal arc

1734
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,100
and it is so good, y'all.

1735
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,020
Super good.

1736
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,660
It's so good.

1737
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:01,500
You're gonna like it.

1738
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:02,340
I got a final Yahoo here.

1739
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,780
This one was sent in by Jeanette.

1740
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:04,620
Thanks, Jeanette.

1741
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:06,580
It's from an anonymous Yahoo Answers user

1742
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,220
who I'm gonna call Dumpy asks,

1743
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,380
what was the best decade of the 1990s?

1744
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1745
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,500
My name is Justin McElroy.

1746
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:18,820
Travis McElroy.

1747
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,660
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1748
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:21,500
It's been my brother, my brother.

1749
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,020
May kiss your dad's square on the lips.

1750
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:41,300
I hate the girls, do you want to say, and I want to.

1751
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,020
Maximumfun.org.

1752
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,420
Comedy and culture.

1753
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:45,620
Artist owned.

1754
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,740
Audience supported.

1755
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:50,100
One, two, one, two, three, four.

1756
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:50,940
Hi, everybody.

1757
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,780
My name is Justin McElroy.

1758
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,620
I'm Sydney McElroy.

1759
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:53,940
We're both doctors and

1760
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:54,780
Nope, just me.

1761
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,700
Okay, well Sydney's a doctor

1762
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,780
and I'm a medical enthusiast

1763
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,780
and we create Sawbones,

1764
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:01,260
a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1765
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,860
Every week I dig through the annals of medical history

1766
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,300
to bring you the wildest, grossest,

1767
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,740
sometimes dumbest tales of ways

1768
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,420
we've tried to treat people throughout history.

1769
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,340
And lately we do a lot of modern fake medicine

1770
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,220
because everything's a disaster,

1771
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,940
but it's slightly less of a disaster every Friday

1772
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:20,300

a marital tour of misguided medicine.

1775
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:26,180
And remember, don't drill a hole in your head.
