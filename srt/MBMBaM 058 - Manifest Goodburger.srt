1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:48,640
Welcome, my brother. My brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. It's June,

6
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,560
and you know what that means. We are frantically prepping for the biggest summer event of the year,

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,960
a week-long celebration of fun and frivolity that we like to call FatBeachCon 2011.

8
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,360
PBC is the industry insider lingo. Yeah, PBC.

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,760
I heard that this year they were gonna actually do a panel and they were gonna get Alma Collins

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,120
and Eric Fleeks and Brian Hooks and Jermaine Huggie Hopkins. They're all gonna be there, guys.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,600
Travis, do you possess an encyclopedic knowledge of the people who were in FatBeach with a Ph?

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,720
Travis is actually the keynote speaker of our event. Actually, we refer to it as the

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,680
the G note speaker, but you get the idea. I can't remember my girlfriend's name.

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:46,240
You can buy the soundtrack to FatBeach on Amazon right now on audio CD for $1.99.

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,440
I actually can't. I can't do that. That is prime, too. Two-day shipping. I need it now.

16
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,520
Hey, FatBeach. Amazon, get it to me now.

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
How quickly can you get it before our FatBeachCon? My name is Justin McElroy.

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm your oldest brother and conference scheduling supervisor.

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
I am Travis McElroy, your middle-est brother and keynote speaker.

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,480
G note speaker.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,960
I am Griffin McElroy. I am a Coolio cosplayer.

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:22,480
So what we do is we take your questions, both FatBeach and non-FatBeach related,

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,760
and turn them into wisdom. Let's get right into it. Hi, my bim bam. I'm contemplating

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,880
venturing out into the Twittersphere for the first time, and I feel like I need a

25
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,560
signature Twitter handle to mark this exciting occasion. I want to use a variation of my name,

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,320
Jody Burgs Bacon, and I'm hoping you can throw out some ideas for me.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,360
The people who brought up people brought us people's nasty gum are clearly brilliant

28
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,840
at branding. Work your magic and thanks for your help, Jody. Jody, what a great question.

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,960
Jody Burgs Bacon.

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,360
That is your it's your virtual identity. If you think you aren't who you are anymore,

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
you are what you tweet. That's so deep, Griffin.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,320
That's like, all right.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
That being said, Burger Time.

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,680
Burger Time is pretty good. I give you that. Only you spell it B-E-R-G like your name is

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
spelled. Enjoy.

36
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,040
How about Baconator?

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
The Baconator. The Burgs Baconator.

38
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
I didn't even consider the bacon contingent.

39
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,160
There's a lot.

40
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,120
God damn it.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
How about Jody 1-6-X-I?

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,680
She's not a robot.

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,800
Oh. Then I've got nothing.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,760
Then I've got nothing.

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
What about something that plays off her name and the fact that she's going to be talking

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,520
on Twitter? Something like Jodydeas. Something that's out there.

47
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
What about Jodyalog?

48
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,560
It's like Twitter isn't just about me broadcasting to you. It's about the two of us talking back.

49
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,160
Having a convo.

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,720
Yeah. I think if you can get Jodyalog, I'd go with that. What about Candace Burgs Bacon?

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,040
What about Meredith Baxter Burgs Bacon?

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,880
What about Good Burgs Bacon?

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Good Burgs Bacon. Fat Beach. Brought to you by Fat Beach.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
Brought to you by Fat Beach. God, that movie was Fat Beach, wasn't it?

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,600
Good Burger's basically Fat Beach.

56
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,760
But in a burger shop.

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,080
Yeah.

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,760
Fuck, that movie is so funny.

59
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Well, hold on. Good Burger?

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,760
It's pretty good?

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,840
I wish I could find it right now because Kel has the secret recipe to his sauce that turns

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,800
the whole stand around.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Okay.

65
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,560
Who was that? Neil Patrick Harris? Wanted it.

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Do you feel like they missed a cross-branding opportunity by not making a Good Burger stand

67
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,600
at Fat Beach? Like, how did you guys get so fat, obviously? Obviously crossover.

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,000
Would you guys eat at a real Good Burger? If that was a real thing. I think that,

69
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
as long as we're speaking about Good Burger branding opportunities, because that is what

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,800
Jody asked about.

71
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:12,960
Yeah.

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,440
I don't know. Like, I think that that's a successful business. I would love for people

73
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,000
to just open up an ironic Good Burger stand and it turns into a chain and it becomes like

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,360
it beats Subway and is now the most famous fast food restaurant in the world.

75
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,280
Griffin, can you break down for me real quick what an ironic Good Burger stand is?

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,560
Well, people are like, I'm talking right now, like, hey, you guys remember Good Burger?

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,720
That was a solid pick.

78
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,280
I think that if you name your-

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,800
Do you think anyone other than us is having that conversation ever?

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,080
I think if you name your stand Good Burger, but say it's ironic, then that's bad. Like,

81
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,000
bad burgers is what you're selling.

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,720
Oh.

83
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,400
Yeah. I sell good burgers. Get it? This tastes bad.

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,440
Why did you do this?

85
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
I just don't know why you're trying to take the wind out of my sails.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,040
You're right. I'm sorry. To me, whether or not I would frequent, patronize, I would haunt

87
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,160
a local real world earth, you know, 619-

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,640
A tangible, not a Good Burger of the ethereal realm. I'm talking about a real ass tangible

89
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,360
Good Burger.

90
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,520
Manifest corporeal Good Burger.

91
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,240
My frequency of dining there would depend on how many adjectives are on the outside in

92
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,000
the advertising, because I'm a sucker for those. Like, I could say to you right now

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that no, that probably wouldn't be a good idea, especially if I see Kellen there up

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,840
to his old tricks, up to his new jinx.

95
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,680
He wouldn't turn up the pot.

96
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,160
If they have a sign outside that says, like, beefy or satisfying, like, I don't know.

97
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,480
Juicy.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,680
Maybe. Juicy. Like, exactly.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,000
But if I walk in, and I see Kell, and he's in the milkshake machine, like, spinning

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,680
around, I will leave that restaurant right away. That is not sanitary Kell.

101
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
Well, that's a health violation.

102
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,680
I'm gonna say that I think I would actually be more likely to go to an ethereal Good

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
Burger. Like, a Good Burger of the mind.

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
Well, as soon as you die, you'll be able to do just that.

105
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,640
God, I hope so.

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,880
Hey, Griffin, you got a Yahoo for us?

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,720
I do. Here's one. This one was sent in by Crystal Whalen. Thank you, Crystal Whalen.

108
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:28,240
Regular contributor, Crystal Whalen. It's by Yahoo Answers user Olaf Simprini, who asks,

109
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,520
looking for a career in genital painting?

110
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,960
In what?

111
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,880
I assume he's asking for himself, but the way you made it sound sounds like the start

112
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,920
of an infomercial. Like, looking for a career in genital painting?

113
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,200
Excuse me, I'm sorry, one more time. Genital painting?

114
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
Uh, yes. Genital painting.

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm gonna need some more info.

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, he provides it, if you'd give me a chance. The other day, I was with my boyfriend, and

117
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:02,480
he asked me to paint the Hand of God painting by Michelangelo on his penis. It says wang,

118
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,240
but we're all adults here. I think being in his clinical terms.

119
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Bracket penis in bracket.

120
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,600
It looks really, really good, and I'm wondering if there's a sort of industry for this thing,

121
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,440
because I think it is my calling. Please help. Do you know of any universities or colleges that

122
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
specialize in this sort of thing? Also, I have pictures, if anyone is interested in my work.

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,360
Check, please. Yeah, hello. I would like to get on that.

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah, can you, uh, my bim bam dot com?

125
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
Yeah, just send that out.

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
Just send that to our web address, I guess?

127
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,920
Send that to Day Express, because I need that.

128
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,920
If you could overnight, I'll front the shipping, COD. Just gotta see them.

129
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,200
I want to say that when you first posed the question,

130
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
I immediately interpreted it as painting with one's genitals.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,400
There's three ways I could see doing this, right? Painting with your genitals,

132
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,360
painting on someone's genitals, which is using genitals as a medium for art,

133
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:10,960
and then there is the actual painting of genitals. Like, check out this sweet pee pee that I painted

134
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,640
here with my watercolors.

135
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,960
Oh wow, yeah. I didn't even think about that.

136
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,640
I can make a pee pee sing with watercolors.

137
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,720
I went to the zoo once and they trained an elephant to paint on this guy's genitals.

138
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
It was pretty cool. Horrifying for him.

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't think that's a- I don't think-

140
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm almost positive that was- wait, was that on TV again?

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,400
No, that was a movie. Yeah, that was a movie, yes.

142
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,840
The Operation Demba Drop.

143
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,880
Yes! God, I was-

144
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,240
That was the best movie.

145
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,080
I did not watch it that closely, but I'm pretty sure that that's what happened.

146
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,120
There's a really great scene where it's tender and the elephant gets a paintbrush.

147
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
I would think! I mean, that elephant's huge.

148
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,000
It's very tender, and the elephant, he is not confident in his painting,

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
but Chuck Sheen talks him through his psychoses,

150
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,240
and then the elephant paints on Chuck Sheen's balls and dick.

151
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,800
You know, people give him a lot of static for being nutso,

152
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,160
but you go through something like that, you weren't there.

153
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,440
You don't know what that film-

154
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,480
He's operating on a whole nother plane than everyone else,

155
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
and it's because he has had this amazing experience.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,840
Also, on this plane, Ethereal Goodburger.

157
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,600
It's just Chuck Sheen and Ethereal Goodburger.

158
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,080
I would like to point out to the person who asked this question that if you look at,

159
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,120
okay, so you're painting a Hanagon painting on your boyfriend's dick,

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,760
is it possible that maybe that skill could translate to a more conventional medium or-

161
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,920
No, no, no, absolutely not.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,120
No, only dicks.

163
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,160
Dicks?

164
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,240
I'll tell you what, it's the dimensions of it.

165
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,360
The contour?

166
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,440
It's like a natural easel.

167
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,640
Natural easel, and it's taut and canvassy.

168
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,400
I get it.

169
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,600
I get what this guy's selling.

170
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,920
I think that it is the most perfect sort of medium that we can wear.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,520
It's the most natural, at least.

172
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,040
A lot of the canvases these days are corporate-made,

173
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,840
and this is shade-grown artistic medium.

174
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,080
What if you painted a dick on someone's dick?

175
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,280
Whoa.

176
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,400
What if you painted a dick on someone's vagina?

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,760
See, that's why I'm upset by this question,

178
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,320
because it doesn't leave many options for our lady friends, because I don't-

179
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
You could paint a Georgia O'Keeffe painting on someone's vagina.

180
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Sure.

181
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,060
Yeah.

182
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,200
So are there any responses?

183
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,240
Anybody have some good ideas?

184
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,200
Somebody said, ooh, I want the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

185
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,640
Very clever.

186
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,120
For my crooked dick.

187
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,640
For my tilted member.

188
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,400
And for my sweetie, maybe the Grand Canyon.

189
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:54,880
Hey, dog.

190
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,160
Hey, dog.

191
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
That's not quite right.

192
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah, don't let her hear you talking that way, because that ain't gonna go over well.

193
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
I have a nickname for your vagina, honey.

194
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,940
Honey.

195
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,200
Hey, honey.

196
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,240
You're gonna love it.

197
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
Listen to this great goof, honey.

198
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,200
Hey, check it.

199
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
The Mariana Trench.

200
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:17,920
Get it?

201
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,480
I love you.

202
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,480
So we got another club banger, another hot question coming in from a real person,

203
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
and not like the one Griffin read from a monster, an animal, a subhuman.

204
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,560
How long do you have to wait after you break up with a girl to start dating one of her friends?

205
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,880
I had a friends with benefits relationship with a young lady that sort of turned into

206
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,960
an exclusive relationship of a sort, but it's become clear that one of her friends

207
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
is interested in dating me.

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,680
How long do I have to wait to pursue this other young lady?

209
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,640
Oh my god.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,080
Is this anonymous?

211
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,540
Yeah.

212
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
Okay, first of all, it sounds like you're still dating the other lady.

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,040
So obviously not soon.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
Yeah, not this second.

215
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
It hasn't been long enough, because it's been none.

216
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
It's been no time.

217
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,360
What's that rule or something like the amount of time you're with someone divided in half

218
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,840
is the amount of time you more in the relationship or something.

219
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,120
Isn't there like an accepted standard for that?

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,520
It is.

221
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Yeah, it's how long you've been together divided by half, and then you add the number

222
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,840
of lunar cycles that happened while you were dating.

223
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,880
And your first pet's name and the street you grew up on.

224
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,520
And then you multiply it by infinity.

225
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,720
Sheila, I miss you.

226
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,640
Oh, Sheila.

227
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,160
I wish I dated a lady named Sheila.

228
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,800
I know.

229
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:58,560
I say if there's a special somebody in your field of vision that you suspect it has a

230
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
little, you know, that you don't wait on it at all.

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,320
You break up with friends with benefits.

232
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
And then say goodbye to her forever.

233
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
How's this for a benefit?

234
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,000
Bye.

235
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
Here's your severance package.

236
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
Enjoy.

237
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,960
I got nothing for you.

238
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,720
Shouldn't have nailed me down when you had the chance.

239
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,800
This is why it never works.

240
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,120
This is why this never works, because right now I'm doing this.

241
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
So this is a pretty good example of why friends with benefits is not a thing.

242
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,960
And then you just go talk to another girl.

243
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,240
What's the matter?

244
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,600
Or a guy?

245
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,560
Is it a guy or a girl?

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,960
Listen, only guys would do this.

247
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
I didn't even have to ask, of course.

248
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,360
Girls don't think this way.

249
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,440
Only guys would be this monstrous.

250
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
You got to dance with the one that brought you.

251
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,040
And that means you have to stay with this girl that you don't really care for for the

252
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,760
rest of your life, because leaving her, that would be rude, sir.

253
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,920
You don't want to be that guy, do you?

254
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,600
Do you want to be rude, sir?

255
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,080
Would you rather be civil?

256
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
God, I miss the Victorian era.

257
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,040
I know.

258
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,400
You couldn't get away with that shit.

259
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,320
You didn't have to worry about dating.

260
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,520
You said, hey, daddy, hey, mommy, who am I marrying?

261
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
Tell me who to love, please.

262
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,720
You're marrying Carla, the butchers.

263
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,280
She is the eldest of three daughters that didn't die of tuberculosis.

264
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,120
She's got a fine frame.

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
You're really going to be into it.

266
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,280
Hey, I like this girl, but I'm afraid to ask her out because we haven't spent a lot of

267
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,840
time together.

268
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,640
However, I'm sure if I wait too long, the whole thing might peter out.

269
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,720
What should I do, form spring?

270
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,800
Does he know a guy named Peter that's going to sweep his lady?

271
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,440
I don't know.

272
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,640
So 58 episodes in, and that's the final answer.

273
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:48,640
This is where I finally admit that I don't get these people that, like, sometimes we

274
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,120
get these questions and the answer is so obvious that I think they're fucking with me.

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,240
Like, hey, hey, just ask her, dummy.

276
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,560
If you don't ask her to spend time with you, you can't spend time.

277
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,760
How do you think that happens?

278
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,720
You're not filling up, like, a giant novelty thermometer on a donation board.

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,640
You don't have to spend X amount of time before you ask her out.

280
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,520
You're just, like, hoping you get stuck in an elevator.

281
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,280
Just ask her to go fucking go.

282
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,800
You want to go ice fishing with me?

283
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,880
Hey, I hear there's going to be a tornado warning on Thursday.

284
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
Do you want to come to my basement?

285
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,600
And, like, it'll be hilarious.

286
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,120
Do you want to get accidentally stuck in a freezer with me so we can recap all the great

287
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,400
times we've had together?

288
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,640
Like, in that one episode of Perfect Strangers?

289
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,240
Because then I can ask you out after that.

290
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,120
Cute meets, they don't happen in real life.

291
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,320
No, they don't.

292
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,840
They do not happen like that.

293
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,600
Do you know how you spend more time with someone?

294
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,640
You ask them out.

295
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,560
Yeah, just ask them out.

296
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,760
You're ready.

297
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,680
Peter, which I'm assuming is your name, and that you've come up with-

298
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
Oh god, I hope so.

299
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,680
And he uses the phrase Peter out to mean something awesome.

300
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
Yeah, you guys want Peter out?

301
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,520
That's what he says whenever he leaves the room.

302
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,560
Peter out?

303
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
I, uh-

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
Hey, check this out.

305
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,760
Check this out, Peter.

306
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,360
You wait too long, and you die.

307
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,900
Oops.

308
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,440
Ah, I could have loved her forever.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,800
No, I can't.

310
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,240
You got any big plans this weekend?

311
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:14,720
Yeah, man.

312
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,040
I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

313
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,520
Yeah, I'm going to go to Zaxby's and totally Peter out.

314
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,720
Those people aren't going to know what they saw.

315
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
It's going to be heinous in there.

316
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm just going to let loose and Peter out.

317
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm just going to Peter out.

318
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:28,960
I've earned it.

319
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,800
I've earned one fucking weekend of petering out, I think.

320
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
I've sold all the shoes at Foot Locker.

321
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,960
I think I'm going to have one weekend of petering out.

322
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,060
I think.

323
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
I think I've earned that.

324
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,560
They can't take that from me.

325
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Hey, hey, hey, you can take as much alimony from me as you want.

326
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,160
You'll never like my my ability to Peter out was not part of the settlement.

327
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,260
Depra.

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,960
How about a Yahoo?

329
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah, I'm ready.

330
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,000
This one was sent in by Jacob Locker.

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,640
Thank you, Jacob.

332
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,600
Champion.

333
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,640
It's by Yahoo Answers user Jenna Rain who asks.

334
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
Sexy sailor suit in bed.

335
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,040
Dirty things to say.

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,240
It is my BF's dream for me to wear my sexy sailor suit for him.

337
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,400
What are some dirty things to say in bed?

338
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
And before to get him in the mood.

339
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,160
I'm going to demand that all of the things that we say

340
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,800
for the next few minutes be nautically themed.

341
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,340
Okay.

342
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,880
So she wants to turn it.

343
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,080
She wants to to raise his mast.

344
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,880
I don't have time to load the torpedoes.

345
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,380
Yeah.

346
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,880
In a seaman's garb.

347
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:41,920
Okay.

348
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,480
Wants to.

349
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,640
To vagina off the starboard bow.

350
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,040
Plunge into my briny deep.

351
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,800
That's good boners.

352
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,040
That's good Travis.

353
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,240
It's very on the nose.

354
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
He can get a tattoo on his penis.

355
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,000
It says welcome aboard like Kelsey Grammer in the hit film.

356
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:04,800
Don't Paris Co.

357
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,440
That would be good.

358
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,480
I hope you're ready.

359
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,400
Time to swap the poop deck.

360
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:10,960
Oh no.

361
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,600
Oh, I'm ready for cock Cousteau.

362
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,680
Um, I just don't.

363
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,280
Unfortunately, you're not my first mate.

364
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,800
Come break a bottle of champagne on my face.

365
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
I don't like that at all.

366
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,400
Are not a play got naughty.

367
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
It's not a play a thing.

368
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,840
Like it's it's nautically themed.

369
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Justin can I tell you as somebody who on a weekly basis scours Yahoo answers for things

370
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,120
that are funny.

371
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,840
There is every kind of play that you can imagine.

372
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
There's just no kind of play that I've been.

373
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
I've been trying to find a way to talk about it on the show.

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,720
You guys know about age play.

375
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,480
Excuse me.

376
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
It's called age play.

377
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,960
I couldn't find a funny Yahoo answer about it because they're all just so just so crushing.

378
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
But it's where one person uh, pretends to be a baby.

379
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,840
Oh, look at him.

380
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,760
But not like you pretend to be like a senior citizen and get a nursing home.

381
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,320
You can.

382
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,400
You can do that.

383
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,560
The world is your oyster in the world of age play.

384
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,600
Fuck.

385
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,680
You just got into the movies for 550.

386
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,400
That's so hot.

387
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,200
Tell me about that early bird special.

388
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,040
We're eating dinner at 4 p.m.

389
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,840
God, I'm a wreck.

390
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,880
Do you think that there are people that are like hardcore like goth enthusiasts or steam

391
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,520
punks or something and their idea of this kind of sex play is like you put on a suit

392
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,040
and you carry a briefcase and like you talk about spreadsheets.

393
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,640
They call it they call it norming it up.

394
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,020
Norm.

395
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
Um, norm play.

396
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,600
I can't wait to norm you tonight.

397
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,040
Tonight.

398
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:49,520
Let's just listen.

399
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,720
We're having casserole.

400
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,040
I want to plan the perfect evening.

401
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,960
First, I want to I want to light some candles.

402
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
We bought it back from Body Works.

403
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
And then I want to

404
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
What's that on the TV?

405
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh, my God, it's a Becker marathon.

406
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,480
I want to put on that Mad Men soundtrack we bought at Target and just go crazy.

407
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
Well, go restrained on you.

408
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,400
And when that's done, I got Colby Callie lined up.

409
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,680
It's next on iTunes.

410
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
I'll open your delicate mouth and feed you some Oreos.

411
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,240
You imagine goth people can't eat Oreos.

412
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,560
Got people can't eat Oreos.

413
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,440
I know they like blood cookies.

414
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,160
That's true.

415
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,680
From Toll House.

416
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,720
Those are delicious.

417
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,440
Those Keibler elf commercials are fucked up, though.

418
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,400
Give me regard.

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,120
Come into the tree.

420
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
And I'll survive it.

421
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,080
Put a baby in.

422
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Elk and blood cookies.

423
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,640
Introduce that blood cookies.

424
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,200
Don't ask.

425
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
Hey, I'm headed to uni this coming fall.

426
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,600
Do you mean college?

427
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,480
Do you mean college?

428
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,280
College.

429
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,560
This is an American show this coming fall and will likely be rooming with a bunch of guys

430
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,840
I have never met before.

431
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,280
I actually call it call.

432
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,880
I shorted it to that.

433
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,380
Callie.

434
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,660
Okay.

435
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,760
My issue is that I am a huge anime fan and will likely want to have anime paraphernalia

436
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,720
in my living room.

437
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,520
I want to have anime paraphernalia in my living space.

438
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,040
I want to, of course, make a good impression and not weird out the people I will be rooming

439
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,560
with for the following school year.

440
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,240
So my question for you is how much anime stuff is too much anime stuff?

441
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,680
That's tactless and Toronto.

442
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,320
The answer to that last question is one.

443
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,920
I'm going to say go out on a limb and say if you have to ask that question, you have

444
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,440
too much anime stuff.

445
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,760
Yeah.

446
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,000
It is a concern that you have.

447
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,760
You have a-

448
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,560
Overdone it.

449
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,960
You have a troubling amount of anime stuff.

450
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:03,200
You're you're looking in your bedroom right now and you are worrying about how you're

451
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,400
going to fit all your anime stuff into a space with a bunch of a gentleman you don't know.

452
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,880
For real though, I think we can answer this honestly without being mean.

453
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
I think there's a tasteful way to do it.

454
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,680
Let me give you an example.

455
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,760
I like video games.

456
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,160
Yeah.

457
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:28,320
My jam. When I was in high school and middle school or high school, on my wall, I cut out

458
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
pictures from video game magazines and tape them all over the wall, right?

459
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Like I taped video game pictures all over the wall because I like video games, right?

460
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I still like video games, but what I have now is a poster, a very tasteful poster for

461
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,000
one game that I enjoy that was made by our good friend Justin Russo.

462
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,200
And that's sort of the nod to video games I have.

463
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
And it's like it still makes sense in the space.

464
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,880
It's sort of like it's tasteful, but I'm not like relinquishing my love of this thing.

465
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,920
What you shouldn't do is be ashamed of this thing that you like.

466
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,320
Yeah.

467
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
We'll give you shit for it.

468
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
It's not that.

469
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,800
It's that this is a time to transition a lot of things in your life.

470
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,320
You know, going to college, it's a big step towards adulthood and maybe you look around

471
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
and say, you know, maybe it's time to kind of revamp my approach to these things that

472
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,520
I love.

473
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,160
Maybe it's time to, you know, start getting some, you know, books on anime and stuff like

474
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,680
that instead of cool.

475
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:31,920
Yeah.

476
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,280
That's a very sort of cut out of magazines.

477
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:35,520
Yeah.

478
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,000
And you know, the other sort of worry and the reason that we I think the reason like

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
it's very easy to sort of make gags about anime, but we all all three of us like some

480
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
really terrible shit.

481
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,640
I seem to remember one episode where we spent the first 10 minutes talking about Good Burger.

482
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,120
That was the hardest choice I had to make of what to do with all my Good Burger paraphernalia.

483
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:03,280
You're going into a time where you're in high school, you're graduating high school,

484
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,960
you're going into college, you really will sort of be defined in large part by the next

485
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,440
four years.

486
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,520
And I think you want to go into it without stigma, you know, like I think you want to

487
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,400
go into it kind of as close to a blank slate as you can and open yourself up to a lot of

488
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
stuff that you're going to be exposed to for the first time.

489
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,520
You know, maybe you get there and you do the blank slate and you go, you know, I could

490
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,400
probably do a little like corner of, you know, figurines here or a poster here.

491
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,120
And you kind of build back up to a point that you're comfortable with.

492
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,080
But I think it's best to start at zero and then find where the new normal is for you.

493
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,880
Don't define yourself by anime, I guess is what what I'm saying.

494
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,160
No, Christ, no, nobody should do that or any other.

495
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,920
You shouldn't define yourself by anything.

496
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,600
No, no pop culture thing.

497
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,520
You're not allowed to define yourself with that.

498
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,480
Like video games.

499
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,360
I don't I really don't like it when people are like super into movies.

500
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,320
There's like, oh, check out my Criterion collection.

501
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,280
It's like, cool.

502
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,920
I got Netflix.

503
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,800
Or you're like the music snob or the movie.

504
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,480
Yeah, just figure out who tactless in Toronto is.

505
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,800
And maybe he's not tactless.

506
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,520
That's what you'll discover.

507
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,320
That's what I hope you'll discover.

508
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Maybe he's a smooth operator.

509
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,720
Maybe he's a smooth operator with a pension for Cowboy Bebop.

510
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,520
Hey, and remember, you're going in.

511
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,120
You're going in and nobody knows you.

512
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,800
Like you're a complete enigma.

513
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,840
If you if you lay out all your anime cards on the table, like right from the jump,

514
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,400
people will think they they've cracked your case.

515
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,320
Yeah, you got to go in sneakier than that.

516
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,800
You got to go in and put a put a picture of like a football guy.

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,280
Nobody else see that coming.

518
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,520
What if you went in there with you?

519
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,880
You went in there with nothing.

520
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,720
No possessions.

521
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,240
You just moved in and your room is just empty except for a bed.

522
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,360
Okay, huh?

523
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,360
That's it.

524
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,720
Oh, you don't have a follow up.

525
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,680
So that's the end of my thought.

526
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280
He's like a wonderer.

527
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,080
What are people going to think?

528
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,760
Roams from college to college.

529
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,400
They're going to think that he's the pretender and that nobody knows his real face.

530
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Oh, shit.

531
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,760
The pretender.

532
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,440
You're saying the pretender ploy.

533
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,320
I think that I haven't seen that well implemented since the early 90s,

534
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,920
but it could definitely still work.

535
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,080
And even then it wasn't really well implemented.

536
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,680
Not terribly well implemented.

537
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,440
Occasionally well acted, never terribly well written.

538
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,040
Had a big problem getting reliable guest stars.

539
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,720
And the plot was kind of a one trick.

540
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,040
And the main actor kind of looked like David Copperfield.

541
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,720
A little bit like David Copperfield.

542
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,040
Just some helpful notes.

543
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:37,760
The pretender that you can ingest and use next time.

544
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,880
The next series.

545
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,920
The new pretender.

546
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,800
Starring Shia LaBeouf.

547
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,200
Is it time?

548
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,440
Yes.

549
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:45,760
Yes.

550
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
It's time to take a trip together.

551
00:27:47,760 --> 00:28:02,960
To the money zone.

552
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,800
Happy birthday to you.

553
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,360
Using that trademarked.

554
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,000
Trademarked.

555
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,440
I did under 10 seconds.

556
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,800
That's okay, right?

557
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,720
Hey, that song is under 10 seconds.

558
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,280
That whole thing.

559
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Maybe I need a new one.

560
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,680
Hold on, let me see it.

561
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Happy birthday.

562
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:18,960
There you go.

563
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,360
Song.

564
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,560
Song for Alex birthday.

565
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,320
Gonna get born.

566
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,080
Gonna get born.

567
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,200
In the city.

568
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,000
Good times.

569
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,080
20 years ago birthday.

570
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,560
Birthday June 10th.

571
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,120
Pass that cake fork to me.

572
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,000
Give me some frosting.

573
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,440
Alex wanted us to wish Janelle a happy birthday.

574
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,520
We're putting the jingle horse in front of the message cart.

575
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,480
I don't care.

576
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
This is our show.

577
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,280
Fuck it.

578
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,120
Fuck it, right?

579
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,360
Right.

580
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,760
Here's what we know about Janelle.

581
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,400
She works in product development for a toy company.

582
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,680
That's dope.

583
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,720
She enslaves our youth with an insatiable desire for material possessions.

584
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,160
She gets them early.

585
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,920
She gets them deep.

586
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,000
They need that Kromazord.

587
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,960
Yeah, Janelle made that.

588
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
And she was never in a podcast until NBNB AM.

589
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,600
And she's a little bit older than Alex.

590
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Kind of.

591
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
She's a couple years older.

592
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,960
Alex is 13.

593
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,800
Alex is a 13 year old boy.

594
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,680
That's not true.

595
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,480
Alex is pretty close to her age.

596
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,840
So he wants to wish her a happy real 28th birthday.

597
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,920
And a fake 29th birthday.

598
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,880
He's been joking about her age to friends.

599
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Hey, Alex.

600
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,920
Ladies love that shit.

601
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,800
Hey, Alex, here's a special treat for you.

602
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,680
Here's a bonus.

603
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,720
Check out this wrinkly old broad.

604
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,000
I love you, Janelle.

605
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
This is my old lady.

606
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,040
Emphasis on the old.

607
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,320
If you know of any advice podcasts that you enjoy,

608
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,800
we would strongly encourage you to write in and ask

609
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,080
if you should be doing what you're doing.

610
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,920
Sneak preview?

611
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,680
No, you should not.

612
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,640
Also, on the birthday train,

613
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
Matt wants to wish his brother Alex a happy 30th birthday.

614
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,320
Three zero.

615
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,360
Dirty 30.

616
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,160
Dirty 30.

617
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,920
Flirty 30.

618
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,400
If it's Alex, you know him.

619
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,360
Shirty 30.

620
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,560
Because that's, it's customary to buy somebody a shirt

621
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
on their 30th birthday.

622
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
Like a nice Oxford.

623
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,760
And if you get Tweety Bird on it, it's birdy 30.

624
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,320
A birdy, shirty 30.

625
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,120
Here's what we know about it, about Alex, okay?

626
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,080
Different Alex.

627
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,360
Different Alex, not the giver from before.

628
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,640
Now he is the receiver.

629
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
He's huge, okay?

630
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,320
Six three.

631
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,840
Got a dog named Talon.

632
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,160
Has a-

633
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,480
Like a thing that, like a sharp foot?

634
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,840
Yeah, I think so.

635
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,320
Sharp hawk foot?

636
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,280
But not spelled that way.

637
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,040
Good at video games.

638
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,480
Street Fighter IV, Mortal Kombat.

639
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,000
He's got all the kicks and punches.

640
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,600
Lives in Boston.

641
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,280
How many, can I ask,

642
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,560
his hadouken technique?

643
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,920
Like, where is it?

644
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,400
Where he likes to go is down, then toward, then punch.

645
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,520
So like for a hadouken?

646
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,000
For like a hadouken, that's his basic game.

647
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,200
That's what he's, where he's at.

648
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
That's how I like to do my hadoukens as well.

649
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,280
But he's 30 years old now, and you know what that means.

650
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,920
No more video games.

651
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,520
No more games, put them away.

652
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,120
Legally speaking, you can't play them.

653
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,000
And they've rented a lake house in upstate New York

654
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,440
to celebrate, but they have not rented the lake house,

655
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,440
which I would recommend.

656
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,280
It's an important distinction.

657
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,680
So since we've sort of painted ourselves into a corner

658
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,800
by not being able to use the traditional birthday song,

659
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,080
Griffin, I would ask that you write a song about these two

660
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
that sort of bridges the gap, I guess,

661
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,160
between a licensed track and a not-licensed track.

662
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,920
So let's, parameters, because I love those.

663
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,680
It's gotta be a birthday song.

664
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,040
It's gotta be a birthday song.

665
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,560
It has to be like fill in the blanks so that we can use it

666
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
for future birthdays.

667
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,720
Only this time we will fill in the names of Janelle and Alex.

668
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,440
The important thing about this is that it be free to the public.

669
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,040
I don't want to try to get into a copyright battle over this.

670
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,320
I want you to become like the new Applebee's song.

671
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,360
They come out clapping their hands.

672
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,880
What could you be saying right now?

673
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,400
They give you a free piece of birthday cake

674
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,200
and they sing you a song and it's like happy, happy birthday.

675
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,040
Janelle and Alex.

676
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,680
This is confusing.

677
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,880
There's two Alex's in the mix.

678
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:44,960
Don't worry.

679
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,160
Listen, you've got to let go of Alex 1 and Matt.

680
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,000
It's a gift.

681
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,840
I just purged you from my mind.

682
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:52,880
Yeah.

683
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,920
You never existed.

684
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,240
This is take one of, I'm going to call it Birthday Town.

685
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,240
Good.

686
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,000
That's a good, good name.

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,880
So instead of like waiting to the end of the song to put the names in,

688
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
what if we just do it right at the jump?

689
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,280
Okay.

690
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
Janelle and Alex.

691
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,240
You are the twin mayors of birthday.

692
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,160
Hold on, here we go.

693
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,280
Did your guitar die?

694
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,600
That's all very good.

695
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
I'm liking the whole thing.

696
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,840
Janelle and Alex.

697
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,840
You are the twin suns that shine on birthday planet.

698
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,080
Where it is everybody's birthday every time you go around.

699
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,520
One of you is 28.

700
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,400
The other one of you is dirty 30.

701
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,320
But just because you're old doesn't mean

702
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,600
you don't know how to get down.

703
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,120
Hooray!

704
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,600
Hooray for Birthday Town!

705
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,520
I don't know that we can ever use that again.

706
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,040
Well, we have to because that's the law.

707
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,600
I like, I like twin suns.

708
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,760
Although I guess it only works if we have two birthdays at the same time.

709
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,480
Well, next time we have double birthdays, we'll take them to Birthday Town.

710
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,240
Oh, double birthday would have been a good song.

711
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,880
Double birthday would have been a very good song.

712
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,160
But see, that's why I keep, I make the swan pay for my pearls now.

713
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,840
I don't just throw them out for free.

714
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,400
That's my personal copywriting idea.

715
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,480
Hey, Janelle and Alex, see you next year.

716
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,560
Hey, see you guys next year.

717
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,560
If you know someone that has a birthday coming up or a special message,

718
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,760
you can do personal, you can do business.

719
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,800
Contact Teresa at Maximumfun.org.

720
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,760
It's Teresa with an H and let her know and we can get that all set up.

721
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,320
And you too can have an amazing jingle.

722
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,040
If you think you might want to do it though, get in contact with her early.

723
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,720
We've had a couple people who've wanted to do something for a special occasion.

724
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,560
But we're, we're, we, like for the next couple of months, we're booked.

725
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:15,200
So getting, get in contact with her with plenty of lead time and we'll, we'll figure it out.

726
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,280
Here we go.

727
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,400
I was coming home late from the bar the other night.

728
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,680
My cute neighbor and a few of her friends were sitting on a porch drinking,

729
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520
but I was unaware of this at first.

730
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,080
As I was walking to my door, I ripped a fierce one.

731
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,440
It was loud enough that it echoed down my street.

732
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,240
Holy Christ.

733
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,400
And that's when I heard my neighbor and her friend start laughing.

734
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
I can't imagine fucking shattered windows.

735
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,840
Quiet alarms are going off.

736
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,120
I was extremely embarrassed, appropriate, and got inside the house as fast as I could.

737
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,880
Is this something that will haunt me forever?

738
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,720
Or if I just avoid her for a couple of weeks, will she forget?

739
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,680
Tootin in Tennessee.

740
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,920
Nope.

741
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,040
Nope.

742
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,600
Nope.

743
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:55,840
Nope.

744
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,800
Maybe it's time for you to become like not tooting in Texas.

745
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,240
Just normal in Nebraska.

746
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,880
You got to absorb this experience.

747
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,160
Holding it in Hawaii.

748
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,400
You got to eat this experience and you got to keep it ever present in your mind.

749
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,320
Cause you fucked up, man.

750
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,320
Oh, did you goof?

751
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,600
Oh man.

752
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,480
Is that never a goof?

753
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,600
One time I was on a city bus going to college and I completely forgot that I was in public.

754
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,280
I had a huge fart.

755
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,560
And so then I bought a car.

756
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,880
He could never go back to the bus system.

757
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,280
The whole, the whole public transportation game was shut down.

758
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,520
There's a picture of him on every Oklahoma city bus.

759
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,160
It's a do not let this man on your bus.

760
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
The driver's come to refer to him as stinky Carl.

761
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
We do not know his real name or his locale.

762
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,760
But he has mega toots.

763
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,880
They, uh, when Travis finally did sell that car, they, the car dealership ramped it into a chasm.

764
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,800
They're like, we can't sell this to anyone.

765
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
This is a biohazard.

766
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,200
What have you done in here?

767
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,280
You're, you were killing us.

768
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,760
Um, yeah, you can't.

769
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,920
No, you know what?

770
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,600
Unless you do something like either a far more embarrassing.

771
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,960
I mean, you've really got to take it to the limit where I'm talking like,

772
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,720
say something, uh, super racist around the person who's race is being belittled.

773
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,800
I mean, like a goof on that scale.

774
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,600
Is that better?

775
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,800
I don't think so.

776
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,680
Can you, can you fall out of your window while jerking it and land on her porch?

777
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,760
Is that as far as I can tell us?

778
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
And continue jerking it.

779
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,400
Yeah.

780
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,160
You have two options.

781
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,280
You can either fall out of your, her window, your window while jerking it and land on her porch.

782
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,320
And then you're that guy.

783
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,680
Or you fall out your window and fly and no one will ever,

784
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,920
ever talk about the flatulence again.

785
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,080
You know what I think you should do?

786
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,600
Just go right up.

787
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,520
Of course the plot of the boy who could fly.

788
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,760
Go right up to her door, ring that doorbell and she answers the door.

789
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,800
Be like, it happened.

790
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,520
Okay.

791
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,800
Like it happened.

792
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,000
And I want to move on.

793
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Do you, can we please move on from this?

794
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
My name is Tootin in Tennessee.

795
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,440
I'm a person.

796
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,240
I'm a man.

797
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,280
I saw a copy of the newsletter you sent out and I do not appreciate it.

798
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,720
I think you just got to grab this bull by the horns and you got to.

799
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,760
Fart in its face.

800
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,640
And you got to fart right in.

801
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,840
You got to just handle it.

802
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,960
Just handle it.

803
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,160
Cause you can't live in fear.

804
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,960
If you do that, then the terrorists won.

805
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,600
I think you should go knock on her door and say,

806
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,000
I just went to the doctor and turns out I have butt diabetes.

807
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
So you were laughing at my medical condition that is going to claim my life.

808
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,400
So sleep well tonight.

809
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,880
I have a tiny goblin that lives in my stomach who is slowly killing me,

810
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,800
but he also makes me fart.

811
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,080
That's what the doctor said.

812
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,440
Do you want to see my x-rays?

813
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,880
I'm your man.

814
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm a person.

815
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,440
I'm a person.

816
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,240
I wanted you to know that.

817
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,160
I'm not just some fart clown for you.

818
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,880
Nothing's a fart machine.

819
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
I have a fart goblin.

820
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,080
God damn it, Susan.

821
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,120
And it's killing me.

822
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,200
I want you to know that a few years back I invited Jesus to live in my heart.

823
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,800
So which one of us were you laughing at?

824
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,300
Exactly.

825
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,960
He's in here too.

826
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,480
Just so you know.

827
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,760
Enjoy hell, Susan.

828
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
Enjoy hell, Susan.

829
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,600
And then fart again.

830
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,560
And then do a little, do like a brief jig and then leave.

831
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
And then move away.

832
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,520
The first time was an accident.

833
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,520
This time has to be intentional for you to get the power back in the relationship.

834
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:46,400
Every day, for the next month, greet her in the morning as she steps up to the paper like,

835
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,440
hey neighbor.

836
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,880
And then you're standing on the porch with a cup of coffee and your bathrobe.

837
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,760
And you just blast it.

838
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,040
And then you fart and the bathrobe flutters.

839
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
And you say, see you tomorrow at eight.

840
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,440
You're saying fart stalker, basically.

841
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,360
I think fart stalker was Gared McGavin's finest performance.

842
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,720
Oh, man.

843
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,360
That was too bad.

844
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,480
I'm sorry.

845
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,120
You do have to move.

846
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,800
I've gone out four times with this girl.

847
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,440
I'm 16.

848
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,160
She's 15.

849
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,480
Gross.

850
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,320
Things are going great.

851
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,000
We always have a great time.

852
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,040
I have not kissed her yet.

853
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,960
Since it would be both of our first kisses, I want to make it perfect.

854
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,460
Aww.

855
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,640
Problem is, I'm fairly new to the dating game.

856
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,440
I'm not sure when I can approach the topic of going steady and becoming a couple.

857
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,120
Please help me in being Ben from sunny Germany.

858
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,160
I almost feel like we should just skip it.

859
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,840
Because we're going to ruin this.

860
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,720
We're going to ruin you, Ben.

861
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,560
Like a rabbit in a mice of men.

862
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,880
You know, you pet it too hard and the neck snaps.

863
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,600
Yes, that is exactly true, Travis.

864
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,800
That is the perfect analogy.

865
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,280
Ben, you've brought something very precious to us.

866
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,840
And if you give this to us, if you give us this thing to care for for you,

867
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,600
you will come back in a week and it will be, you'll be like, what's that smell?

868
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,360
Like, yeah, that was the precious thing that you gave us.

869
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,000
We killed it and we buried it underneath the sink.

870
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
We did a bad job with this precious thing you gave us.

871
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,200
We hugged it too hard and it's been dead for a while.

872
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,120
And Ben, we're so sorry.

873
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,520
I have a confession to make.

874
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,000
The only reason I still host this show with you guys is that for an hour every week,

875
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,240
I can remember what it's like to feel this way.

876
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,200
Oh my God.

877
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,880
To feel, just to, yeah.

878
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,200
Yeah, it's like, it's vicarious.

879
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,280
Vicarious innocence is, it's addictive.

880
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,760
Do you think he's, do you think he's held her hand yet?

881
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,560
Ah, man.

882
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,520
I can't even think about it.

883
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,240
It's too chaste.

884
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,560
Oh, Ben.

885
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,320
Do you think that like one of their dads drives them to the movies?

886
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
I can't think about it.

887
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,400
Oh.

888
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
I can't because I think about it.

889
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,520
Do you think she spins on his dick?

890
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
Ben, this is what we're talking about.

891
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,240
If we go any further, then I am going to suggest that you make her spin.

892
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,160
She should spin on it.

893
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,640
Like.

894
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,920
It's not worth a spin on it, Ben.

895
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,600
This is what we do, Ben.

896
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,920
We don't have, there's not a different setting.

897
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,360
We're going to kill your thing, this precious thing you brought us.

898
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,080
All right, let's try it.

899
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,800
Let's hold it down.

900
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:09,860
Okay.

901
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,480
You got to go slow because this is the most terrifying thing you've done so far.

902
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:15,940
Yes.

903
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Yeah, and it will be terrifying right up until the moment when you do it,

904
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,000
and then it won't be so scary.

905
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,760
Ben, I have a new mindset for you, and this should apply to everybody.

906
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,760
Fear is only applicable to things that are in the future that you can't figure out.

907
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,680
If you knew exactly what was going to happen, you wouldn't be afraid of it.

908
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,160
So fear only limits you if you're trying to guess the future.

909
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,960
If you are in the immediate, if you're in the here and now, you can never be afraid of anything

910
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,360
because you're just experiencing it as it comes.

911
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,960
And also, think about it this way.

912
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,080
You're, what, 16?

913
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
No one is expecting you to succeed.

914
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
Yeah, you're going to fail this time.

915
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,200
You're going to be super bad at it.

916
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,480
A lot of times you're going to fail.

917
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,600
So there is zero pressure on you whatsoever.

918
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,280
Like, this is the time that you try things and you learn what, you know,

919
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,920
what you do in relationships and what's best for you.

920
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,000
And so, man, you're just not going to be good at this first time, but nobody is.

921
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,080
Nobody's good at it at 16.

922
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,560
My first kiss was my freshman year of high school playing Spin the Bottle.

923
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:38,320
I received it from a acne scarred girl from the flag corps because this was a band party.

924
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,440
And it happened on the dirty floor of a kitchen in the west end of Huntington.

925
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,160
So, Justin, that is the sweetest thing I've ever heard. As long as you can top that,

926
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,800
if you can top that magic, that romance.

927
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,080
Don't remember her name, by the way.

928
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,760
Only vaguely remember what her first name was. Flaggy.

929
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,800
Flaggy the Kissmabot.

930
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,840
If you can beat that for romance,

931
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,680
then you are well on your way to a special moment in your marriage forever.

932
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,760
Justin, I think the only way that he could not top that romantically

933
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,000
is if during his first kiss he had beef jerky in his mouth.

934
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,000
Is that what I think it is?

935
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,320
It is.

936
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,400
Uh, goddammit, this is so adorable.

937
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,160
Can we just take a moment and just, like,

938
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,360
soak in this beautiful moment of the human experience?

939
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,120
Somewhere in Germany, Ben just said a lot,

940
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:35,440
God, I feel a lot less innocent and less special like someone who's drinking it.

941
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,320
Someone who's drinking my naivete and turning it into evil. So we hope that helps, Ben.

942
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,120
I don't want to give you any more-

943
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,800
Don't listen to us whatsoever.

944
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,760
Just don't do anything we say and you'll be off the races.

945
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,360
Do you guys know that in addition to it being fat beach con time-

946
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,480
Goddammit.

947
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,080
It is also the first show that we've done in the month of June.

948
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,240
I want to jump back real quick and say that there was someone on Twitter

949
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,880
that got really mad at us because last week's episode did not contain the monthly thing.

950
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,920
It was still May, dawg.

951
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,480
Hey, buddy.

952
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,080
How about, um, uh, okay, I picked it out ahead of time so we didn't have to do the list thing.

953
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,720
Celibacy Awareness Month.

954
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,000
Oh, good.

955
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,360
So we, in case people are unfamiliar, maybe you're just now joining us,

956
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:33,600
can you explain the premise of this, this, this bit you keep, uh, uh, uh-

957
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,560
Well, every-

958
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,760
Subjecting us to-

959
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,960
Every month there is important issues that everybody has to stay on top of.

960
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,000
Um, important things like, um, uh, Fireworks Safety Month.

961
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,600
June is also Fireworks Safety Month.

962
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,480
I would say maybe save that one for July when everyone uses all the goddamn fireworks.

963
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,400
You gotta get to them so early though in July is a thing.

964
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,680
June you have a whole month to be a dick about it.

965
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,440
So this month is, what is, what is this month, Griffin?

966
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,520
It is Celibacy Awareness Month.

967
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,280
Okay.

968
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,000
Our previous question dovetails nicely into this.

969
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,240
Yes.

970
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,480
I'm aware that somewhere someone is celibate and it brings me great joy.

971
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,800
Okay, uh, so how about Celibacy Awareness Month?

972
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,040
Don't make us switch to Celibacy Enforcement Month, my brother, my brother, and me.

973
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,800
Celibacy Awareness Month, that's one excuse.

974
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,760
My brother, my brother, and me.

975
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Um, Celibacy Awareness Month.

976
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,480
Don't get your dick wet, my brother, my brother, and me.

977
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,200
That's pretty good.

978
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,640
Keep that dick dry, my brother, my brother, and me.

979
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,240
Just jerk it, you goof.

980
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,360
My brother, my brother, and me.

981
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:55,280
What ever happened to watching secretly from the bushes, my brother, my brother, and me?

982
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,340
Uh.

983
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,560
There's always dry humping, my brother, my brother, and me.

984
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,040
Hey.

985
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,480
Celibacy Awareness Month.

986
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,080
Because Jesus is always watching, my brother, my brother, and me.

987
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:14,160
Hey, were you aware that there are people who don't fuck?

988
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,000
My brother, my brother, and me.

989
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,880
Okay, a little on the nose maybe.

990
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,240
A little, sort of like, yeah, like a little direct.

991
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,080
But I definitely think that there's, um.

992
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,920
I don't care if you're married, my brother, my brother, and me.

993
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,400
Celibacy Awareness Month.

994
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
It's like that movie, 40 days and 40 nights, only 10 days shorter.

995
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,720
My brother, my brother, and me.

996
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,360
Celibacy Awareness Month.

997
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,760
It seems to be working out okay for babies.

998
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,800
They're happy and shit.

999
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,480
My brother, my brother, and me.

1000
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,080
Oh, man.

1001
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,040
Celibacy Awareness Month.

1002
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,440
It's the only way to get super good at kung fu.

1003
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,680
Celibacy Awareness Month.

1004
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,400
It's true.

1005
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,520
I thought it was true.

1006
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,880
Oh, I think that was a good ender.

1007
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,720
I think we cashed it on kung fu.

1008
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,760
Yeah, good.

1009
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,400
I was trying to come up with one about that involved the phrases

1010
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,280
celibacy awareness life and Verne Troyer.

1011
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,560
I decided to just let it go.

1012
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,680
It works both ways.

1013
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,320
One, he's going to die without knowing the touch of a woman,

1014
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,240
presumably in the next couple of years.

1015
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
And B, if his parents have been celibate,

1016
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,720
that's one less thing we got to worry about.

1017
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,520
How much time do you spend worrying about Verne Troyer?

1018
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,280
Well, how much time do you spend with your eyes at regular human level?

1019
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,840
You would be unaware of a Verne Troyer attack.

1020
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,000
So like Verne Troyer Awareness Month.

1021
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,400
Verne Troyer Awareness always, because where is he?

1022
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:58,880
Right now.

1023
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,040
Can we get a tag on him or something?

1024
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,160
Can we?

1025
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,160
God, this garbage can is heavier than I thought it would be stabbed.

1026
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,720
He was in there the whole time.

1027
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,320
You just got burned.

1028
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,000
You got burned.

1029
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
This phone booth seems surprisingly crowded.

1030
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,440
I didn't anticipate stab.

1031
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,560
Did that teddy bear just move?

1032
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:20,960
Stab.

1033
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,400
Stab.

1034
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,280
My mileage has been really moderately worse than normal.

1035
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,760
Stab.

1036
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,400
Backseat.

1037
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:28,960
The whole time.

1038
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,760
We're not jibing him because of his size.

1039
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,160
He is a despicable human being.

1040
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,440
That's not a good person.

1041
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,600
As anybody who's watched this in real life can attest.

1042
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:41,760
Yeah.

1043
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,120
I want to hear Gervin's last question.

1044
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,000
But first, I want to say that nbnbam.com is a website that you can go to

1045
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and visit and experience for yourselves.

1046
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,840
At nbnbam is our Twitter thing.

1047
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,400
You can follow us.

1048
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,520
We're almost to 4K.

1049
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,440
And whoever is the 4000th will be the 4000th one.

1050
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,480
Mr. 4000.

1051
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:03,440
Yeah.

1052
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,360
Like that movie with Bernie Mac.

1053
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,480
God rest his soul.

1054
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,520
Oh, it really brought it down.

1055
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:08,800
Yeah.

1056
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,480
Hey, Bernie Mac's dead, everyone.

1057
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,800
Bye.

1058
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,160
Bye.

1059
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,040
Hope you liked our show.

1060
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,120
We have a voicemail that we haven't talked about in a while.

1061
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,400
Griffin, do you remember the number?

1062
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,360
Do you listen to that?

1063
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,480
I do not.

1064
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,160
But that's only because nobody calls it.

1065
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,440
So what's the number?

1066
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,960
203-mbnbam1.

1067
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,480
If you want to just talk like into my ear, like slow,

1068
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,680
because I'm celebrating National Celibacy Awareness Month

1069
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,240
and I can really use the ear company.

1070
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,480
Yeah.

1071
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,960
So get in touch with Griffin.

1072
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,760
Ladies, if you want to give him some of the dirty stuff, that's cool, too.

1073
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,800
It's just read recipes, but do it like softly.

1074
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,400
Yeah, it's like sexy.

1075
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,760
What else is going on right now?

1076
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,240
We've got a live show in Cincinnati on Sunday, June 12th.

1077
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,760
Our next episode is going to be live, so it may be a day or two late.

1078
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,680
I'll try to get it up as quick as I can.

1079
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,320
Hopefully that won't be an issue, but we'll get it up for you lickety split.

1080
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,000
If you're going to be at the show and you would like a question read there,

1081
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,320
you can send it in and make sure to put Cincinnati in the subject line.

1082
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,600
Start sending those in now.

1083
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,040
We'll be building the list pretty soon.

1084
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,120
So if you're going to be at the show, let us know.

1085
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,720
It's our first full-length live show, so we're going to need as much shit as we can.

1086
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,120
So if you are like a regular Yaku contributor, like I'm talking to you,

1087
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:40,880
Jacob Locker and Krista Whalen and Galea Ali, like my people.

1088
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,880
It's time to really step up.

1089
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:47,600
Little SARS gots to step up your game and just send it to me.

1090
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,640
Like, send it to the MBM account every time you see one,

1091
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,600
because I could I'm really going to need the help.

1092
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:03,120
We love seeing people talking about us on the Twitter using the MBM hashtag.

1093
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,440
Galea Ali, for instance, just said that she's disappointed that I'm on that like a dog mat.

1094
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,800
Never made it into our lexicon, so maybe we can bring that back for her.

1095
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,360
We just did.

1096
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,040
Yeah, there you go.

1097
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,680
Bethany is awake.

1098
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,880
Joanna 11 has been talking about the show a lot.

1099
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,120
We really appreciate Babylonian.

1100
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,440
He's sort of a new convert, but he's been spreading the word to people.

1101
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:31,600
We love that.

1102
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
By the way, if you could just tell a friend to listen,

1103
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,400
that's the only way we really expand the listener base is through you guys.

1104
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,280
So just grab a friend, send them a link to our sampler.

1105
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,200
It's bit.ly forward slash it's MBM.

1106
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,520
And before I forget, with the live show,

1107
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,640
we're going to have some special live show only posters for sale.

1108
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,400
Oh, fuck, yes.

1109
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,560
So they are absolutely beautiful.

1110
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,920
Make sure to bring some cash with you because we're not going to have like

1111
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,200
any of them fancy, smancy debit card machines or whatnot.

1112
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,480
And bring some extra cash because our buddy Felicia Gillespie

1113
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,160
is going to be there selling her CDs and stuff.

1114
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:10,560
And what if she's like supes funny and you need a physical reminder of that?

1115
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,280
It's when she is when she is supes funny,

1116
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,160
you will feel compelled to purchase her wares.

1117
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,520
One or more of her wares.

1118
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,040
After the show, we're going to Arnold's Bar and Grill,

1119
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,600
oldest bar in Cincinnati and absolute best bar in the world.

1120
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,240
So check it out.

1121
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,560
Gonna get drunk with my dad.

1122
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,840
It's going to be sick.

1123
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,000
Yeah, it's going to be really low.

1124
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,840
And hey, if you're if you're at E3 this week and you see me or Justin, say hi.

1125
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,440
If you see Travis, holy shit.

1126
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,240
How did you do that?

1127
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:40,880
Because he's not there.

1128
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,720
He's not there.

1129
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,120
He's not.

1130
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:43,840
It's not Travis.

1131
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,640
That's Hideo Kojima.

1132
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,240
It's someone doing Travis cosplay.

1133
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,600
More than you'd think actually there.

1134
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,440
Oh, we're going to have new T-shirts super soon.

1135
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,600
So big things.

1136
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,000
Storms, storms of Bruin.

1137
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,280
Storm of merch is a Bruin.

1138
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,240
And they still have some stuff on Level Up.

1139
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:03,920
Yes.

1140
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,400
Search for Level Up Studios and you'll see some of our,

1141
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,400
I think the red T-shirt is still there.

1142
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,920
So get up on it.

1143
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,440
Also, we want to wish a hearty get well soon to Carl.

1144
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,560
I'm a Bim Bam fan who is laid out in the hospital right now.

1145
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:21,920
But Carl, you get feeling better and we're all thinking about you, buddy.

1146
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,520
Griffin.

1147
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,360
I'm ready.

1148
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,520
Should I pull this comedy ship into dock?

1149
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,720
Yes, let's dock it.

1150
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,720
This one was sent in by Eric Nier.

1151
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,760
Thank you, Eric.

1152
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,720
It's by Yahoo Answers user, Tim S, who asks,

1153
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:40,720
is it illegal to push a live moose out of an airplane in Alaska?

1154
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,320
My name is Justin McElroy.

1155
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,600
I'm Travis McElroy.

1156
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,120
I'm Griffin McElroy.

1157
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,400
This is my brother, my brother.

1158
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,520
May it kiss your dad.

1159
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:57,520
May it kiss your dad, I swear on my life.

1160
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,200
Keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1161
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,240
Keep your heart.

1162
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,400
Hey, keep your heart, Three Stacks.

1163
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,440
Keep your heart.

1164
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,720
Man, these girls are smart.

1165
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,480
Three Stacks, these girls are smart.

1166
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:24,480
Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart, Three Stacks, keep your heart.
