00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line. Honey, I'm still free. Take a chance on me. If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around. If you got no place to go, when you're feeling down. If you're all alone, when the pretty birds have flown, honey, I'm still free.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome, welcome back to my brother, my brother and me. It's an advice show for the modern era. I'm joined. I should not be so presumptive. My name is Justin McElroy. I'm Travis McElroy. I'm Griffin McElroy.

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And we are my brother, my brother and me.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So let's just get right into the advice. Let's tuck in here. We've got an anonymous question from FormSpring. I'm in love with my long distance girlfriend and I want to marry her. Should I quit my job and move to Oregon to be with her?

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nope.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Nope.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Next question.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, that's an easy one, man. That's gonna put a lot of pressure on her, on your relationship, and I don't think you're gonna... I don't think... unless...

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're moving to Portland, Oregon.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, then it's alright.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Is that alright?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's a fly city, man. I was watching an episode of No Reservations with my boy Tony, and man, they cook some weird shit up in Portland.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is she a weird shit cook?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can you get a job as a weird shit cook?

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She might be... there's a whole, like, coven of tattooed gastronomes up there who get, like, their favorite cooking instrument tattooed on their body, and then they eat, like, dog eyes and shit. Like, I don't know what they're doing up there in Portland. It's crazy.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh yeah, aren't they the people, like, meet at each other's house and...

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yeah, they have, like, these secret... it's like Fight Club, but with cooking and eating dangerous things. I love it.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's pretty sweet.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't think they're any...

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It sounds like going to Hillbilly Hot Dogs.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It is kind of like going to Hillbilly. I don't think there are any other cities in Oregon, though. I think Oregon, in my mind, is just, like, a vast wasteland with one pretty cool city in the middle of it. So, I mean, I would like to live in Portland.

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think if you have the opportunity to move there, you should do it, especially if you love this girl. So, you know what? Flip my answer.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here's my question for the anonymous person asking this question. A, would you move there if she wasn't there? Are you interested in going to the city otherwise? And also, were you guys in the same area prior to this, and she moved?

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Right.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Did you meet on MySpace, is basically...

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you have been together in the same area before, that's cool. And who am I to say, if you think you've got a real shot with this girl, like, this is really the way it's going to shake out for you, you know, that's the most important thing you can find in the world.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So, I say, I mean, you need to try to pursue it, but you've got to make sure you have your situation together before you go, or else it is just going to put too much pressure on you guys.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I really super recommend, don't, like, move there saying, baby, I'm going to marry you. Move there, hang out for a while in the same location, seeing how that dynamic goes.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's how hard it is to get broke.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah, and I would try to, if you can, I would try to get your out of the Pacific, that's how they do it. I would try to get your own apartment too, and not skip straight to moving in with her, I would say.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We need more info. I can't tell you...

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
More info, dude, more info.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I can't tell you how to roll in your ship, but...

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll say this, if you want to, do it.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Just do it. You know better than us.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This one comes from Dylan via Gmail.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It says, so a few friends and I will soon be knee-deep in the excitement and thrills of post-adolescence cohabitation.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This will be our first time living with people we aren't related to outside of an on-campus housing arrangement.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
While we all have some pretty awesome social anxiety, we seem to be able to tolerate each other.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm slightly worried, however, because one of them is a female. How should I prepare for this? Are there ground rules I should be aware of? Any advice would be much appreciated.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Dylan, I gotta say, man, for my money, you gotta go naked day one.

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You gotta go...

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just really get it all out there.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Just really, you gotta get it out. Out. Get it out. Out there. Naked day one.

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Naked day one. Everything I know about...

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But then full suit of armor day two.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Everything I know about living, cohabitating, as you put it, with a lady friend, I learned from two guys, a girl and a pizza place.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So it sounds like you should be prepared to... that you and all of your male roommates will probably fall in love with your female roommate at some point or another.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But she'll eventually just end up with Nathan Fillion, so you should be... it shouldn't be any big of an itch.

51
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Which all women do.

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Here's my advice. One word. Boundaries. There has to be set boundaries.

53
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Literal boundaries.

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A firewall. A literal firewall.

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
A chest high wall of fire.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Dividing the apartment so she can put all of her pink shit, her I love Lucy collectibles, on one side and encroach on the other.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Her Wizard of Oz, Chotskies.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Grain of truth.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Who's up next?

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Griffin, peeling off of the topic.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ramtrap. This is a cohabitation issue that you yourself Dylan may soon be dealing with.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You too, anonymous guy moving to Oregon.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ramtrap says my girlfriend of over a year gets angry about having Maxim magazines in the bathroom.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Sure, it's great to look at side boobs while you're pooping, but I think they're just well written, clever articles.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Maxim is the McElroy brothers of magazines, except better looking and less offensive, at least in my view.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Is she wrong to be a dickhead when it comes to my magazines, or should I remain faithful to my promise to take the magazines only to work Ramtrap?

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's wrong for you to be a dickhead and call us ugly, which is basically what you just did.

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
To be fair, his taste is turned off because he thinks that Maxim has clever, well written articles.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, and where offensive, and where the offensive was.

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, but good question.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Top 20 best topless nude scenes with ladies in them.

72
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is a Maxim meet your own poop.

73
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why don't you put them, here's my suggestion.

74
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm unnecessarily shortening words today.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My suggestion is to put the magazines under the sink.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Done.

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't put them on the back of the toilet, that's a very convenient place for readables to go, but it doesn't look nice.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And also, Maxim, I'll read a Maxim.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not above it, but it doesn't make you look like a classy dude.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So maybe hide your Maxims underneath the sink.

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Buy some GQs. GQs are classy.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't come in here with this veneer that you're reading it for the articles.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, please.

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come on, man.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Best places to do it, in a public bathroom.

86
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's not...

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You want good quality articles without side boobs that you and your lady friend can both get behind?

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Get a Reader's Digest subscription.

89
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And here's the thing, as far as her...

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She's not saying don't have them, she just doesn't want to look at them.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And that's completely fair, I think.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Because pooping is an intimate thing.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's her time.

95
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And she doesn't want you ogling Miranda Kerr while you're dropping a deuce.

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No, that's not her problem.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's not her problem.

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Her problem is that she has to ogle Miranda Kerr while she is...

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well, ladies don't poop, but while she's in the restroom, powdering.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, she's...

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know what they do in there.

102
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I think they powder stuff.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Powdering.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Cheesecake Jones, his wife tells, via Twitter...

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
His wife tells him that you can wear blue shirts with blue jeans, but it doesn't feel right.

106
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Help me, brothers. I'm going to defer to Travis on this one.

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I assume when you say blue shirts, you work at Best Buy.

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But if you don't, I'm going to go with that's fine.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The only time I have a problem with pants-shirt combination is when the colors are the same.

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
So khaki pants with tan shirts, but if it's the same color blue...

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If it's the same color blue, which would be weird, why are you wearing a denim shirt with denim pants?

112
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's not okay.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's a whole lot of luck.

114
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah. That's a whole different choice altogether, my friend.

115
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that from Billy Ray Cyrus?

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who got that last question?

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, what's up?

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:58,000
My wife says it's okay to wear blue jeans with a blue jean vest and a blue jean hat.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And a rat tail.

120
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And a rat tail. Is that...

121
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And also I'm John Cougar Mellencamp.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I am John Cougar Mellencamp.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This one comes from Google Answers user Danny.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Headline, is masturbation create problem?

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The question is, is masturbation create problem in future life, in married life?

126
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is the semen is make daily what we eat or not because after masturbation feel very weakness?

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And is it create problem should I do or not in future?

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Is it also decrease sex power?

129
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh, goodness.

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to move beyond the grammar issues because he's clearly not a native English speaker

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and address some of his very real concerns about his renunciation of sex power.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He might be a natural born American English speaker,

133
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
but he's just masturbated so much that he's lost a couple verbs and nouns.

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He's saying he's masturbated himself stupid.

135
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah, he beat himself silly.

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe that should be the concern.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm masturbating my brain stem out, y'all.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is the guy that just wrote us about Maximal.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's like a before and after.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, exactly.

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Well, answer number one is from user Otterly Evil who says excessiveness will make you infertile parentheses flaccid in future.

142
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So I guess it is.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's not true.

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's not true at all.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Your body's constantly that's like saying that blowing your nose will cure congestion for the rest of your life.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yeah.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's no, that's not the way it works.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Human beings are just seed factories.

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So, I mean, you're in the clear, man.

151
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The only thing you actually have to worry about is sensitivity.

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And also-

153
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you're going nine, ten times a day, dude.

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Your decreased sex power because you can't, that is a-

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's a real thing.

156
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's a thing that you can run out of.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If you're masturbating regularly, hold off five days, you can power an entire town off of your one penis.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just with your sex power?

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah, just with your sex power.

160
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's the new green movement.

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You keep the whole town lit up.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you know what I found out is a thing in sperm count is if you use your laptop a lot because the heat from it can kill your voice.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

164
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can cook them up.

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not on the permanent.

167
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You would think that it would be like a nice soothing sauna for them, but no, it's an oven.

168
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, it's a bad scene for them.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Speaking of sex power, you know, I was reading my Cosmo, like I do, it's what I do, and I found some great advice for the ladies.

170
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A little something the ladies might like.

171
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's from an article called 30 Things to Do with a Naked Man, and this suggestion is find his G-spot.

172
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The hint is a guy's prostate, the walnut-sized gland under his bladder, is the ultimate magic button to push if you want to blow his mind in bed.

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Ultimate magic button.

174
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,000
To tantalize it, partway through oral sex or intercourse, rest two fingers against the swath of skin between his testicles and anus.

175
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You stay the fuck away from my walnut.

176
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do you mean taint?

177
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You mean his taint.

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You mean his taint, right?

179
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's an efficiency of language issue at this point. You mean his taint.

180
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Excuse me, Cosmo. Please don't tell anyone to do that.

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Cosmo, my walnut is a temple, and I don't want, it doesn't need any insurrectionists. Nuh-uh.

182
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What's your walnut, how's everybody's walnut situation today?

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's feeling good.

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The walnut's fine.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do you guys remember when I went to Bonnaroo and I didn't shower for five days and I got walnutitis?

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Here's my question. What actual situation would that be okay in? Like, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

187
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When I went to see a walnutologist about my walnutitis and he checked my walnut, like, still questionable.

188
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know what's weird about that story? Griffin went five days without a shower, still shampooed every day.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

190
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It was nice.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I had lots of Aquafina, which I could, you know, wrap my shit up with.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hey, wait a minute. Don't touch my walnut.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Stay away from the walnut. Don't listen to Cosmo.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's do another one from Yahoo. This one's from Yahoo Answers User.

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wait, wait, wait. Quick timeout before we go to Yahoo.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you're, like, sitting down, popping up in Gmail about to tell us that we need to be more free about our walnuts and maybe we should try it, stop it.

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Gross. I don't want to hear anything about it.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What you do with your walnut is your business, friend.

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, that's your walnut, not my situation.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I would never do that, but if you want to, I mean, if you want to tell me about it, whatever.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Just keep your hands off my walnut.

202
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll give you guys my personal email. We'll make some shit happen.

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers User Donald.

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It is possibly the saddest thing I've ever seen on the internet.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm in love.

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That was his. That was his emphasis, not mine.

207
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm in love with Krista from FernGully.

208
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are there any websites devoted to her?

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, God.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I mean, we've all been there.

211
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She's a good looking fairy.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Cartoon fairy.

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Now, if he had said baddie, I would have understood that.

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I get that.

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You know, the problem with Krista from FernGully, if you're in love with her,

216
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
is that no adult woman is going to satisfy that fantasy for you.

217
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I mean, they're just too old, right?

218
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
They're just too beaten down.

219
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They're too big.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
They don't have the naivete of a Krista from FernGully.

221
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And that's the problem.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're just not going to find an adult woman to fill that need for you.

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you know what I mean.

224
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's tragic, really.

225
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Listen, we help everybody on this show.

226
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And that means sicko child molester perverts.

227
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We do not discriminate.

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We will help sick pedophiles and not help them to get better,

229
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but help them to just keep it quiet.

230
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Have you considered taking up a parent?

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, goodness.

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, golly.

233
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, my goodness, my golly.

234
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hey, to clarify, I don't support pedophiles.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You just help one bitch.

237
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But to clarify, guys, if you are a pedophile, stay away from the walnut.

238
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't care what age you are.

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's not going to be a cool scene.

240
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This one comes to us from our good friend Mitch Dyer via Gmail.

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He says, my friend needs to leave his dead-end, low-paying job

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and get out of his lame living situation.

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He likes the idea of university in my city and would excel in it,

244
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
but he refuses to leave home for another city because, quote,

245
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
all of his family is here.

246
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He is 22.

247
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How do I convince him to sack up, move out, and get his education on?

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, that's a tough one, Mitch.

249
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, Mitch, I would say that there is, I mean, okay.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You only get one shot.

251
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You only get one spin around the globe.

252
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And I definitely could see where he would value going to the university,

253
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
as your people say, in the great white north.

254
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But I don't know.

255
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There's a value to having people surrounding you who care about you.

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I mean, there's a worth to that.

257
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I think you have to accept that worth before you can, you know,

258
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you can't blow that off.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can't convince him to do anything if you aren't also accepting

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that there's value to that.

261
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And I'll say this.

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
As someone who is in a similar circumstance,

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I graduated college and moved home and didn't know what I was going to do.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If I had moved earlier than I was ready to,

265
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
it wouldn't have been a good situation for me.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like, I wasn't sure what I was going to do.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It took me three years to decide what I was going to do.

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But once I decided, I was ready to go and I got to move on.

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So, you know, maybe he's just not ready to do it yet.

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
On the other hand, it also helped that I had people in my life,

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
like Justin and Griffin and our father, who encouraged me to find what I wanted to do

272
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and encouraged me to make decisions and move on with my life

273
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
and not just sit around at home.

274
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,000
So don't let your friend wallow and hang out and do nothing in his dead-end job,

275
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
but at the same time pushing him, you know, just help him get ready.

276
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But you also say he needs to leave.

277
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
And that's an interesting word to me because you're not saying he wants to leave.

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're saying he needs to leave.

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And that sounds like your judgment, Mitch.

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no, no. I think some people can legitimately get the blinders on

281
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
where they can stay and just, you know, be stagnant in a town

282
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
because they're so familiar with it.

283
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Like, just because all your family and friends are there,

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
just because you move out, they don't all die, you know?

285
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They do all die.

286
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I agree, but here's the problem with that, Griffin, is I agree,

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but everyone's definition of success is different.

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So while some people might go, man, you've got to get out and explore the world

289
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
and try new things every day, his friend might be completely happy

290
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
staying in this town and working a job and just being employed and having a family.

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So what you should do is you should take that friend out for a night on the town, okay?

292
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And at the beginning of the night, hang out with all of his friends and his family

293
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
like for a big family dinner at the Olive Garden.

294
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
And you have soup, salad and breadsticks for hours, and you just have a great time.

295
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And then at the end of the night, you take him to a local subway

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
and you show him the 55-year-old sandwich technician that's working there

297
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and you say, you want this to be you, it's okay if you do, that's your choice,

298
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but if you stay in this town, you're going to be a lonely 55-year-old sandwich technician.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I think it's sandwich artist. It's more art than technical.

300
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Sandwich engineer at a subway.

301
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Also, Mitch, here's a key point for you, buddy, because we care about you

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
because you're the one riding in.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you convince a friend to move out to the city you live in,

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you're opening yourself up to a lot of pressure.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yeah, that's all on you to be BFF.

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's all on you to be his BFF for life.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And if you're cool with that, fine, but for life, Mitch.

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Not just his BFF, but you are replacing his city ambassador.

309
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
When SD Zow from Twitter goes to the movies,

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
how the hell is he supposed to know which armrest is his?

311
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There's only one each side.

312
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Am I lost? Guys, what's the deal?

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I have a great trick that I do, and I'm happy to share this with people.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
As soon as you get to the movie theater, first thing you do, hit that concession stand,

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
buy a soda, and then as soon as you sit down, put that soda in one of the armrests.

316
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And then if the person next to you has umbrage with that,

317
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
you just meet their eyes and you just keep your hand on your soda

318
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
with your arm on the armrest, and it's yours.

319
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I actually have a move that I do where if I sit down and the armrests are already taken,

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I just wedge my elbows in behind their elbows and smile at them a lot.

321
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And then they slowly move their elbows away from mine, and then both armrests are mine.

322
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If it's one of the things where the armrests can deploy or be hidden,

323
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I think the thing to do is to put it up, move one, put it up, wink at the stranger.

324
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
They will more than likely be so happy to put the down.

325
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hey, let's take turns giving each other back rubs.

326
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Hey, my hammies are real tight. I got some tight hammies.

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No pressure.

328
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Can you rub this down for me?

329
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey, Mitch, you were right. It was a great idea to move here.

330
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can you just give me a quick back rub like Banana would do if we were in a movie together?

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Because you're my whole system now.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're all I've got.

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I have put all of my eggs in the Mitch basket.

334
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So if you could give me a slow rub down.

335
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Bringing it back.

336
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This one comes to us anonymously from FormSpring.

337
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It says, I feel like I'm slipping away from all of my friends.

338
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We used to have a big thing in common which got us all hanging out together,

339
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
but now that's gone and I hardly see them anymore.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
M-B-M-B-A-M? How can I say my friendships?

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Was that big thing like you all murdered someone?

342
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It sounds like this guy got pulled along by the Mitch wagon.

343
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is what happens, Mitch.

344
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Have you considered uniting over your shared adoration for a podcast?

345
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Say one that featured three brothers giving advice to people just like yourself.

346
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I totally understand where this question is coming from.

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
My group of friends was established because we all did community theater when we were kids,

348
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
but now we have scattered across the country.

349
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It sounds like that's the same thing that's going on there.

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I think you need to just evaluate.

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I still consider these people to be my dearest friends,

352
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
even though I only see them or talk to them a handful of times every year.

353
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
But every time we do see each other, it's not weird.

354
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's not like, hey man, why haven't you given me a call?

355
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's just a naturally sort of established thing.

356
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's a really good point.

357
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I had a super close-knit group of friends in college.

358
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We're literally hanging out every day.

359
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I think that what you're experiencing is totally normal.

360
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We're not built to have a super close group of friends your whole life.

361
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is sort of how we progress.

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You have this super close group of friends in college.

363
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Then you grow up, you do the family thing, but they're still important to you.

364
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What you have to keep in mind is as an adult,

365
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
friendships are more work than they were when we were children.

366
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Everything was convenient.

367
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're my best friend because you live across the street from me.

368
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
As an adult, it's all about phone calls and making trips and making plans.

369
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It's not the same.

370
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Lives are different.

371
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You grow apart.

372
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The important thing is that you work at it.

373
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
If you want to keep these friends, you make the effort.

374
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Don't expect it to be as easy as it was.

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Call more. Use the phone. It's great.

376
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,000
A Skype user named Date Wives just asked to be added to my contacts list,

377
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
offering me sex with married women.

378
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Do you need our advice?

379
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I do. That would be great.

380
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Is it internal show advice?

381
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Don't do it.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I never use Skype.

383
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I went through today in my request.

384
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I literally had like 30 hot sex with me requests.

385
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And I was like, do I know these people?

386
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
This is great.

387
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But I didn't know them at all.

388
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
It was awful.

389
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Jesse writes from Gmail.

390
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
He says, my wife is a very tidy person and is always putting my stuff away.

391
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Unfortunately, I'm not a slob and I keep my positions well organized.

392
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So mostly this entails her rearranging my things in a manner that makes them impossible to find.

393
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
For instance, today I spent well over an hour searching for printer paper

394
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
that was previously neatly stacked on top of a shelf at my home office near the printer,

395
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
but had been put away in a closet in our guest room.

396
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Oh, that would piss me off.

397
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I'm having a visceral gut reaction to this question.

398
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm so, so angry right now.

399
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wow, that would piss me off.

400
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Jesse, I will help you with this.

401
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
This is something I have experience with.

402
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I can guide you.

403
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You have to develop boundaries of rooms in the nicest way possible.

404
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
My wife and I got married.

405
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
We decided that all my video games would go downstairs to the den

406
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,000
where I have all my older consoles and stuff like that, all downstairs in the den.

407
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We keep our living room relatively media-free.

408
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We have the 360 and the PS3 and the cable box and all that jazz,

409
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
but as far as DVDs, CDs and stuff, not in there.

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
In exchange, I have an office where I have Master Chief's helmet

411
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
glowering down at me from a shelf because she doesn't move things around in here.

412
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
This is my area to deal with as I see fit.

413
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Honestly, that's the only way you can do it.

414
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You have shared spaces, you have her spaces, you have your spaces.

415
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
You've got to have your own zone where she doesn't interrupt your flow.

416
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Same for her and you.

417
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If she has some crazy way she wants to keep things, you've got to let that happen.

418
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Or just go to two different houses.

419
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Two different houses is a thing?

420
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Two different wives.

421
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Not keep any of your stuff in the house and just have it be all of her stuff

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
and then pretend that you don't live there whenever her dad comes around.

423
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Do you know anybody who's tried that strategy before?

424
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
No, I can't say that I do.

425
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
This one comes from Yahoo answer user NoName2.

426
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
He says, is it strange to be attracted to cheese?

427
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I know this seems like a joke.

428
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,000
It seems like a thing that somebody puts on Yahoo to seem weird or quirky,

429
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
but these answers, man, I'm starting to think it's a thing.

430
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm starting to think that it's the next foot crush food thing.

431
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Foot crush is a thing.

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Can we address that real quick?

433
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's your new tub girl, guys.

434
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
If you want to really mess somebody up, trick them.

435
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Just search for food crush or feet food crush on YouTube

436
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
and then link someone you know or don't care about pictures or videos

437
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
of feet crushing food because it is huge.

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It's like 100 times more disturbing than it should be, right?

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Right.

440
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Find the one with the woman crushing chocolate eggs filled with cream.

441
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh, God.

442
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
It's hugely upsetting.

443
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's upsetting enough because the act itself is not upsetting.

444
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The knowledge that somewhere, somebody is having a slow beat.

445
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Someone is massaging their walnut in small sensitive circles.

446
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That's brutal.

447
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Anyway, cheese.

448
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Someone says Turophile, lover of cheese.

449
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Totally didn't make that up.

450
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Google it.

451
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
It's a thing.

452
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It is a thing.

453
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
One person named Indian Tiger said, no, it is not strange.

454
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Best of luck.

455
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Keep smiling.

456
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
What?

457
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
How about you hide your smile if it's derived in any way

458
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
from sexual cheese pleasure?

459
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
One person says not at all, especially Swiss cheese.

460
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Wink.

461
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Winky.

462
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh, God.

463
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
So here's the thing about abnormal psychology.

464
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
All of abnormal psychology is based on context

465
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
and maybe in 30 years when everyone's boning down on cheese,

466
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it won't be weird anymore.

467
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But yeah, it is.

468
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Hey, it is.

469
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Griffin, do you remember the story?

470
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I think we talked about this like six months ago.

471
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
The woman who was in love with a roller coaster.

472
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Oh, yeah.

473
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
No, it wasn't a roller coaster.

474
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It was like one of those Viking ship swinging rides.

475
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
What's that called?

476
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Objectum sexuality is what that's called.

477
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
That's the scariest YouTube video.

478
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That's like Tub Girl Prime.

479
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
That's like some real heavy shit.

480
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The thing is when someone was telling me about it,

481
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
it was like a sexual thing, the vibration.

482
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
No, like in love, like romantic.

483
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm in love with this carnival ride.

484
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Oh, God, it's awesome.

485
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I made fun of that in a college journalism class,

486
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and I got some shit from people who thought I was being insensitive.

487
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
But nope.

488
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Insensitive?

489
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
What?

490
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

491
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Nope.

492
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Some of us are trying to live in a society, you crazy hooker.

493
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
This one comes from Stevie D from Gmail.

494
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Sometimes when I'm at a party with my friends,

495
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
we play rock band, and we all take turns singing.

496
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I get really psyched for when my turn comes

497
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
because I have super bitchin' pipes,

498
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
and when I sing Simple Man by Lynyrd Skynyrd,

499
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
it brings the house down without fail.

500
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
However, sometime between when I grab the microphone

501
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and the song selection menu, a change comes over me,

502
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
and I wind up picking Crush, Crush, Crush by Paramore.

503
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Granted, every healthy virile man within a quarter mile

504
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
is at half-mast by the time the song is over.

505
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Arr! Half-mast!

506
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But it is still concerning.

507
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
What does this say about me, and is my concern warranted?

508
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Stevie D.

509
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I think we can all agree that Paramore rules.

510
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Paramore does rule. Agree.

511
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What?

512
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Paramore is a... no, they're a catchy band.

513
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Why am I not allowed to love novelty boats at theme parks,

514
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
but you guys can enjoy Paramore, and I rock.

515
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Well, first of all, the lead singer of Paramore

516
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
is far more attractive than an inanimate Viking boat ship.

517
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Can you imagine? What if she was on the masthead?

518
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
What if it was her and Vitamin C

519
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
on opposite ends of the Viking boat ship?

520
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
And they're all holding cheese.

521
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, and they're all holding cheese.

522
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And your walnut.

523
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Can we pause the show for two and a half minutes?

524
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
No, I don't think there's anything...

525
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I would be more concerned with why your singing voice

526
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,000
has an area of effect like gives dudes gay boners.

527
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I don't know why that happens.

528
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And that's not troubling if you're hanging out with a bunch of gay dudes,

529
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
but if your voice has the power to make people gay,

530
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
you should probably have consent forms.

531
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
With great power comes great responsibility, my man.

532
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Absolutely.

533
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You're ruining marriages in a quarter-mile radius,

534
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and be real careful.

535
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Hey, guys.

536
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Hey, Mike.

537
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Mike is in Ann Arbor,

538
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
and he's on a flogging molly kick at the moment.

539
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
He's taught himself some of the songs on the Geetbox

540
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
and is trying to decide how best to sing with them.

541
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
For those unfamiliar with the band,

542
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
the lead singer has an Irish accent.

543
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The problem is that I do not.

544
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I am an American. A lot is lost.

545
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
But I have tried it in an Irish accent.

546
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm afraid I'll be making a fool of myself.

547
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Oh, don't be afraid. That's exactly what's happening.

548
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Just embrace it. Go with it.

549
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You could be an American cover band of flogging molly.

550
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I think that there's a market for that.

551
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Here's my advice. German accent.

552
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I would say learn an accent that is completely different from Irish or American.

553
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh, I like it.

554
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
For some reason, I read this question,

555
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
and it reminded me of Griffin doing Macy Gray.

556
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Just embrace it, brother. Just do it. Don't be afraid.

557
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I think you have to, especially if you're doing it at an open mic,

558
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
you've got to emulate that voice because it makes it a lot more...

559
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Travis and I have been doing a pretty triumphant rendition

560
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
of The Proclaimers' I Want to Be 500 Miles.

561
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
We do the accents, I think perhaps unconsciously,

562
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
but we still do them and it adds to the effect.

563
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What helps in all seriousness is don't take it seriously yourself.

564
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
As you're doing the accent, don't try to nail it,

565
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
especially if you're doing an open mic night thing.

566
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
They know what you're doing, and you know what you're doing,

567
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
so just have fun with it. Don't make it a big deal.

568
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Unless the person isn't familiar, then they're going to be like,

569
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
why is that guy sounding like an idiot?

570
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
He's a child up there at the microphone.

571
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Is that the guy from Once? Nope.

572
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
There are many American songs.

573
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Just find one of those. Save yourself this conundrum.

574
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, that's the other thing. Floggy Molly's a shitty band.

575
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Whoa! Whoa!

576
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user...

577
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh yeah, really? Your cred's been revoked.

578
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
This one comes from Yahoo Answers user Nikolai.

579
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
He says... or she says? No, I think it might be he says.

580
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
This is under the pregnancy and parenting baby names category.

581
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Can I name my baby girl Justin after Justin Bieber?

582
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Yes.

583
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Yeah, yes.

584
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I think we should defer to Justin on this one,

585
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
because it's his name, and he has dominion over it.

586
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I mean, can you?

587
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Can you name your baby after Justin Bieber? Yes.

588
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I mean, should you tell anybody? No, probably not.

589
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Do you think Mr. Bieber will appreciate it? Like, the honor?

590
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Why don't you pick somebody more deserving?

591
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Why don't you pick a more deserving Justin to name your child after?

592
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Someone who's gonna give that kid the sort of minute-one publicity

593
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that a baby starting out in today's fast-paced Twitter-based world needs.

594
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Maybe name your baby after, like, a Justin McElroy.

595
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Somebody who's gonna get the name out there.

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Gonna get that baby promoted.

597
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Justin McElroy Bieber Nikolai.

598
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I love it.

599
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
What about Justin McElroy Bieber,

600
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
and I'll hyphenate my last name. He'll just have me back.

601
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm so sorry, Justin. I'm so, so sorry.

602
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I didn't know what I was doing. I'm so, so sorry.

603
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Please, baby, baby, please. Please, baby. Please, baby, baby.

604
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
One more time.

605
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll tell you one time, Justin. I'm sorry.

606
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
You shouldn't have said that thing about your teeth.

607
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It was just a boat at an amusement park,

608
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and there was a calliope in the background,

609
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
and I had a belly full of cotton candy, and I didn't know what I was doing.

610
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm so sorry. There was no line.

611
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I saw it there in the reflection of the street lamp,

612
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
and I thought, yes, yes, I'm a boatman.

613
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I'm a boatman for life, and I left you.

614
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I didn't go to see your show.

615
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And I'm sorry, Biebs. I'm sorry.

616
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Why don't you name your kid Viking Fury?

617
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That would be the coolest name ever.

618
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That would be the best name ever.

619
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
See, now I want to use that.

620
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Viking Fury. That's awesome.

621
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
This is my son, Viking Fury.

622
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
What's his last name? Fury.

623
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
His first name is Viking.

624
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Sorry about your kneecap.

625
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He's two, and he's got a little baby ax.

626
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
My first ax.

627
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What's up with that beard he's got going?

628
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I don't know. I named him Viking Fury.

629
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It really stuck.

630
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's red like a sunrise.

631
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Did he just kill that narwhal?

632
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Yeah, he did. He's crazy.

633
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Viking Fury, get over here.

634
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Honey, get the muzzle.

635
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Viking Fury's trying to eat mutton.

636
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
His stomach can't digest it.

637
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
He's only six weeks old.

638
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Mush up some mutton, sweetheart,

639
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
for Viking Fury.

640
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Oh, goodness.

641
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I want to hear Griffin's last question,

642
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
but first I feel like we should tell people

643
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
how they can seek our guidance.

644
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
There's so many ways, so many options.

645
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I recently compiled them on a new page

646
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
on the My Brother, My Brother, and Me official website,

647
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
which is MBAM.com.

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
And real quick,

649
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I want to throw out a big thank you

650
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
to everyone who's going to that page

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
and going to all of our things.

652
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And thanks for everything so far.

653
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Given us so many hits.

654
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Once we start selling out,

655
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
we are going to make a tidy profit.

656
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, a tidy, tidy profit.

657
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Actually, we were actually in the...

658
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I think we made it to number 12

659
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
on the iTunes comedy podcast chart.

660
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Which is overwhelming.

661
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And a misnomer,

662
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
because it really... it's about helping.

663
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
It's not about yucks here.

664
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But yeah,

665
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
it was super, super great.

666
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And if you haven't rated or subscribed yet,

667
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
that would be awesome.

668
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
But really, we'd love it if you would just

669
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
find somebody who isn't a fan yet,

670
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
say, hey, do you have 35 minutes

671
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
to really get your shit in order.

672
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Like really get it together.

673
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
You need to tell them that they have a problem.

674
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah.

675
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And that we can address it.

676
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah. And if they want to start listening that way,

677
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
say, I'm going to listen to you

678
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
if you can solve this problem for me,

679
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
we're down. We're up for a challenge.

680
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
But all of our links are on mbmbam.com.

681
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There's links to

682
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
our form spring page

683
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
where you can ask questions anonymously.

684
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
There's our email, mbmbam at gmail dot com.

685
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You can join our Facebook appreciation group,

686
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
which is...

687
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
If you do that, that would be huge.

688
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
You can subscribe on iTunes,

689
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
leave a rating, leave a review.

690
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
We really appreciate that.

691
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
There's RSS feeds for Zoom users that you can download.

692
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's all on Mamba,

693
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
mbmbam.com.

694
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Or the Mamba,

695
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
as I call it.

696
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Everybody for listening, it's overwhelming.

697
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Justin Russo, thanks for making all of our

698
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
sweet images, our JPEGs.

699
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And Travis,

700
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
thank you for joining us yet again,

701
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
despite your debilitating disease.

702
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
I think

703
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
it's nice that with what little time left,

704
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
you're getting to be

705
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
on a podcast.

706
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I'm just glad my wish is coming true.

707
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Thank you all for listening to the series

708
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
finale.

709
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Very,

710
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
very special.

711
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
You can tune in

712
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
next week for My Brother and Me.

713
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Goodbye, sweet world.

714
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Uh,

715
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
final question of the day.

716
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
This one comes from, oh god, I should have

717
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
realized that I can't say this person's name.

718
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
This comes from Yahoo Answers user

719
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
C4TF00D,

720
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
which I think is supposed to be cat food.

721
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Uh, who asks,

722
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I need love potion ingredients.

723
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Help please.

724
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
How am I supposed to break to this?

725
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I'm Travis McElroy.

726
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
I'm Griffin McElroy.

727
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And this has been My Brother, My Brother.

728
00:39:45,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You will never know me.

729
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah!
