1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
The McElroy brothers are not experts, and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,920
Also, this show isn't for kids, which I mention only so the babies out there

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:30,800
will know how cool they are for listening. What's up, you cool baby?

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:44,400
It's a new craze, and good girls do you wanna just say, hey, I wanna, just say, hey, I wanna.

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Hello, everybody, and welcome to My Brother, My Brother, Mean Advice,

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,240
show for the modern era. I'm your oldest brother, Justin McElroy.

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,520
And he has just got to finish this Sudoku.

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,840
I'm your middle-est brother, Travis McElroy.

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,320
And I'm your sweet baby brother, and 30 under 30 media luminary, Griffin McElroy.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Six. It was six. It was six was the last one. Hello, everyone. Like the Chilean Miners,

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:41,840
we've reemerged here in Nashville. We've been slumbering in your sewers since 2017,

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,800
October 2017 at the Teapack, and now we are back here at the beautiful Ryman.

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,120
What an honor it is to finally put this venue on the map.

15
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,320
With our twisted brand of comedy. With our own sick brand of comedy.

16
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
You know, a lot of great performers have performed on this stage before,

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:07,120
the Adventure Zone. If you took the last seven days of, like if nothing else,

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,240
like if history started the last seven days of the Ryman, it would be, oh yeah,

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,400
I know that theater. That's where the Adventure Zone and the Wu-Tang Clan and my brother,

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
my brother and me played. I know the Ryman, obviously.

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
And while we've been in town, we've been enjoying a lot of your local culture.

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,360
We were looking for a lunch spot yesterday. We almost went to Kid Rock's Honky Tonk Rock

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,120
and Roll Steakhouse. And I pitched really hard for Keith Urban's Flapjack Depot.

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Where the Flapjacks never end. Right.

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,520
We looked a lot at Iron & Wine's High Iron Wine, which sounded disgusting, frankly.

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,400
It's like, it is blood. It is blood.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
We almost thought it would be Keith's, I love this taco truck.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:07,360
I love this empty building, four lease. I love this offer on the four empty building.

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,200
Toby Keith's, I loved that bar and grill. I love this now defunct bar and grill.

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,880
I love this future paintball course. But of course we ended up at Jimmy Buffett's

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:31,120
Margaritaville. Sorry. It has been, we've had a beautiful time here. A lovely show last night.

32
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,760
Everybody was so loud. Thank you. In much the same way that you are loud. In fact,

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,280
you remind me of them. Have you met them? You would like them.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,600
I had a lovely encounter last night with a couple of listeners who came up and were very kind,

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:55,520
telling us how much our show had meant to them. It was very sweet and we really appreciated it.

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,960
Some hugs were exchanged. And then just as we were finishing. And our good hugs too.

37
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,320
Not like the lazy hugs that we say for our family. No, yeah. Good hugs that we give listeners.

38
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,520
Not those high school reunion hugs. And then I felt a grab on my arm, which is a little forward,

39
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,400
but I thought, you know what? I'm Justin McElroy. I've always got time for a listener.

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,600
So I spun around and there was a middle-aged woman there. And she looked at me and she said,

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:33,760
Hey, I saw you at Margaritaville. And then walked away. Walked away.

42
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,920
Now, I know, I know. Are you wondering? Was it an angel? Yes, it was an angel. Sent to tell

43
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Justin a message. One of Jimmy's little parakeets that he sends out to watch over his followers.

44
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,320
And to keep the rumors coming. Right. Anyway, as you've certainly guessed by now,

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,640
this is an advice show. Any people who've never heard of us before in the audience?

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:05,920
Oh, good. Good. Okay, good. That will save us a lot of time. We can be weird. Okay. Here's our

47
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,760
first question. And we shouldn't be doing this question because it sets a terrible precedent.

48
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:19,360
It's an advice show. We want advice, questions, requests for advice. Do not follow this person's

49
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,440
example. They snuck in. We will never include it again. When we weren't looking. But then we read

50
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,160
it and we thought we should at least take a crack. The question is this. What if Godzilla was nice?

51
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:46,240
It almost felt like Yahoo Answers had crawled out of our TV screen like the ring and taken

52
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,920
over our real Gmail inbox where supposedly real human beings send us digital letters.

53
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,400
Here's what I really like about this question. The reason I included it in the question list

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,480
is they could have asked, what if Godzilla was good? Which I feel like is a question that has

55
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,680
been answered by movies and TV shows and cartoons and comic books before. But what if Godzilla was

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,080
nice? Sure. What if Godzilla was polite? He's not good. He's not bad. He's just nice.

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:24,160
When the tiger eats up the zebra, I don't think the tiger's not being nice. That's just what

58
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:32,080
Godzilla does. He does a big stomp on Tokyo. Think about this. How many times in your life,

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,000
walking around, have you maybe stepped on an anthill by accident? Now who's the Godzilla?

60
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,000
You're all the Godzilla. Yeah, but if you think about it, no one's gonna watch that behavior and

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
be like, nice. That was a nice thing to do that you did. You don't know how many times in the

62
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
movie between Godzilla's looking down, Godzilla's thinking, oh man, I feel so bad. I feel terrible

63
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,960
about this, but I have to. I'm trying to get to Panera bread. I'm just so hungry and Travis

64
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:13,920
doesn't know what I eat. I've got all this medicine for the hospital. I'm a Lyft driver

65
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:22,480
and I got to go pick somebody up. My bones cure diabetes and no one knows. Please drink of my marrow.

66
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,440
I'm offering myself up to you. I'm offering you shade. Why are you so mad? It is a tourist

67
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,640
attraction too. A lot of cities would love that kind of heat. Come to the only city where Godzilla

68
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,360
is. If you had just treated it with a little bit of kindness and consideration, it could have been

69
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,880
a mutual beneficial partnership. Just make him a chair big enough that he can stop walking around.

70
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,480
Make Godzilla a big chair. Leave big footprint sized holes in your city design. Yes, thank you.

71
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,440
Or submit over those bad boys you got a swimming pool going. Nice. That's fun. Who wouldn't love

72
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,520
that? What if he was nice though? What if he was nice? I feel like he'd still mess things up,

73
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,520
but not on purpose. We try to be nice and we mess things up. Not destroying a metropolitan area,

74
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,880
mind you. Yes, but metaphorically speaking. I think about this every time I walk into

75
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,200
say a china shop or some place that sells figurines. I immediately put my hands behind

76
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,920
my back because I don't want to just Godzilla around, but I still might. There's a toy story

77
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:33,760
take Henry too that has a whole big section of ceramic Russian nesting dolls. Every time I walk

78
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,760
in that section, I'm like, oh, I'm going to fuck this up so bad. I don't know why. Like,

79
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,880
I don't normally reflexively crump, but I feel like I'm about to just start crumping.

80
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,800
Can I do a Yahoo answer from the Yahoo answer server?

81
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
This one was sent in by Teresa. Thank you, Teresa. It's Yahoo answers user. My wife.

82
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:07,120
My wife. It's from Caleb Fax. Yahoo answers user Caleb Fax. Caleb Fax? That sounds like

83
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,440
somebody you'd see on a placemat. Hey, I'm Caleb Fax. Do you know clouds are made of rain?

84
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,280
It's true. I'm Caleb Bad Fax. I'm Caleb Fax. We have mac and cheese and grilled cheese.

85
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,840
I'm Caleb Fax. Did you know that turtles are just frogs with a big shell on?

86
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,800
What are they hiding? Did you know wolves are just mean dogs? It's me, Caleb Fax. It's F-A-X,

87
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Caleb Fax. We also have grapes. Caleb asks, what should I do if random bread appeared in my bird

88
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:50,960
feeder? Some bread appeared in my bird feeder outside. It might not sound weird, but I live

89
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,600
in the forest, so it's creepy AF. None of my family members, so it means someone's walking

90
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:06,320
around my house. What should I do? Update, no. I mean like a giant piece of bread that barely

91
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:15,760
fits in the feeder. Hey, y'all, I'm scrolling through all the responses to this question.

92
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,160
There's not one that's like, do you mean a small piece of bread, Caleb? So I don't know who the

93
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,840
fuck Caleb's talking to with his... Yeah, honey, look, it's just way too big to have gone in.

94
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:37,600
Did you do it? No. Son? No. Fuck. First of all, when it's in the forest,

95
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,560
the whole forest is a bird feeder. That's a good point. We have systems in place for that.

96
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:52,640
Sure. It is obvious to me what has happened here. The birds are now taking care of Caleb.

97
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Ground child, you have fed and nurtured us for long enough, ground child.

98
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,280
We now shall sustain you. We have taken advantage of your kindness for too long.

99
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,640
Suck of this bread, ground child, and let it be known, there is peace between the

100
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:25,440
sky people and the ground children. Our war has ended. Henceforth, let us attack each other no

101
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,280
more. Eat no more of the flesh of the chicken. Let it be known, the sky people and ground children

102
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,960
have made peace. No more shall we poop on your cars. No more shall you eat of our brethren.

103
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,000
Caleb, spread the word to the other ground children. And they too shall have bread to

104
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,200
sup upon. The sky people seek war no more. Suck of this grain, Caleb.

105
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,520
We shall teach you the ways of the skies, Caleb. Come be a wind master with us.

106
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:05,040
Together we shall kill the raccoons. Let us bring down the raccoons, Caleb. Let their

107
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,040
chests and japes no more echo through the forest, Caleb. Bring us your sticks and vomit and we will

108
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:19,280
make you a home. We have seen the bow and arrow that your sister Katie has. Let us rid ourselves

109
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:32,400
of the raccoons. Please get rid of the force field in your walls. Open thine abode. Let

110
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,480
peace be made. You can live in our houses and we'll live in yours. Teach us of the toilet.

111
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,280
We all know birds are just jealous. Place your shame on a toilet like us, Caleb.

112
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,080
Another option is that they're hoping that you're gonna come out one day and be like,

113
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,320
do I put bread in the bird feeder? I guess I do. And they're like, yes, it fucking works. I told

114
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,720
you guys it's gonna fucking work. Got them. That's a good idea. Why am I wasting so much money on

115
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:16,480
bird seed? They probably hate these seeds. My mom has been carrying around a dead butterfly for years,

116
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,840
literal years. And it has even moved through two different houses. It's lived on different

117
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,600
live plants and insists that it is okay behavior. Now this person didn't reiterate that that was

118
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,520
their mom, but I'm assuming it's not the dead butterfly insisting that it is okay behavior.

119
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,040
But how should I handle this? That's from a dead butterfly in Nashville. Are you here?

120
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,280
Hello. All right. Sound pretty lively to me.

121
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,040
Yowzers. This first hit me as my mom has a butterfly pinned to some cork board,

122
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,360
which is some people's thing. And that's cool. That's fine. But it's not because

123
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,960
your mother's putting it on plants and that's the wildest shit ever. Essentially, it has just

124
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,040
occurred to me the possibility that the butterfly was on a plant, the plant died, and your mom got

125
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:18,000
rid of the plant, but just the other dead thing. That's favoritism is what that is. That is true

126
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,120
because lots of people have like butterflies pinned to walls or apparently on plants. But if

127
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,920
you started with saying like, hey, that's a corpse. Maybe they would reconsider because if you did

128
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,840
that with, I don't know, any other animal, other thing. Oh no, but people do that with deer. Oh,

129
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:46,400
wow. What if God was one of us? Maybe we're the aliens. It's just it. What strikes me is when I

130
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,800
beef it up, I'm pretty sure I'll turn into bones. What happens to a butterfly after it beefs it?

131
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,400
Does it got bones? Probably not. What were you going to say, Justin?

132
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,680
We inherited a lot of decorations from Sydney's grandparents, but a lot of them weren't

133
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,560
their decorations. It's like stuff that had been left at their house by their kids. And

134
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
a lot of things in our house, we have no earthly idea where it came from. You don't know the

135
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,560
provenance. Yes, exactly. So in our bathroom, there is a cork board with a glass frame thing.

136
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,320
And there's like 10 butterflies stuck to it and not pinned to it. Not just stuck. They didn't get

137
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,720
trapped there and they couldn't escape. Certainly this semantic distinction is worth doing here on

138
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,120
stage. But three, not three weeks ago, Charlie was brushing her teeth and she looked at me and she's

139
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,920
like, sorry, sorry to brag. My kid brushes her teeth. Dad of the year over here. She was brushing

140
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,920
and she was brushing her teeth. She said, Dad, what's that? And I said, it's a bunch of dead

141
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:00,080
butterflies. And she said, why do we have that? And I had to answer her honestly and say,

142
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:09,520
I don't know, honey. It's just always been in the bathroom there. And it was in the bathroom at the

143
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,200
old house and we put it in the bathroom box and then the bathroom box came in the new house. And

144
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,240
then we unloaded the things from that box and hung the dead butterflies on the wall again. So here we

145
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,840
are with the dead butterflies on the wall. I have, it's as if we hung it there. There is an implication

146
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,520
of saying like, this is what our family believes in. This is what we're into. These dead butterflies,

147
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,880
that's where they belong. Around this house, you better stay caterpillars. Now, J-Man, that was

148
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,840
three weeks ago. Yeah. It's very important. Oh yeah. It's still there. Okay. Sure. Absolutely.

149
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,360
Well, where would I put it? In the trash. Thanks butterflies. At what point in answering the

150
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,320
question to Charlie did you realize like, well, I can't lie about what this is. She's four and a

151
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:06,000
half. It was actually like, I was pretty tired. Being a parent lying takes energy. Sure. Telling

152
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,080
him the truth is the easy way out. Travis, you have five seconds. Come up with a lie. Well,

153
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,840
that's fake butterflies. That's a pretty good lie. That's a wild thing to put in your house.

154
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:25,200
Better than some corpses. Whatever. Disagree. Hard disagree. Here is another Yahoo. This one,

155
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,520
this one was sent in by Michael. Thanks, Michael. It's an anonymous Yahoo Answers user who I'm

156
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:41,040
going to call Diane. With four I's. Diane. And an umlaut on the A. And the N.

157
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:58,720
Is it unacceptable to eat lasagna with your hands at home? At home. Not at a restaurant. At home.

158
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,600
I was eating lasagna with my hands in my aunt's house. So not your fucking home, but okay.

159
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,240
This is how I eat when I'm in my own house. I never use utensils. But in the restaurant

160
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:23,120
I do use fork and spoon. For lasagna. Yeah. Like an arcade claw machine.

161
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,640
My aunt saw me and got mad at me and was like, is that how you eat in the restaurant?

162
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,040
Use your fork. When technically I wasn't even in the restaurant and I was in her house.

163
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,360
Did I only further infuriate her because I just showed up at her house as an unexpected visitor?

164
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,920
Much, much like lasagna, this one's got layers.

165
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:05,920
So, wait, is that the end? Did you need more? I love that right there at the very end you get

166
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,120
this like twist of like, so is my aunt mad at me because of the eating with my hands thing

167
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,160
because I broke into her house to eat her leftover lasagna. I threw one of her flower pots through

168
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,120
the kitchen window, climbed in and started having a lasagna sandwich, which is what I call it.

169
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,560
And also she's not my aunt. She's just a stranger. She's my stranger. What's the big deal?

170
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,680
You're welcome. I didn't go to your utensils. Yeah, good point. Now open the safe.

171
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,800
The problem is if you don't eat with your hands, how do you shuffle the lasagna together

172
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:51,040
and make one big stack? And then you have double-sized lasagna. Yeah, sure, sure. That's

173
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,040
great. Then you unhinge your jaw, slurp it up and you eat it in one bite. You go get the the

174
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:04,240
Jenga box out of the closet and use the little shelf to stack them. Yeah, yes. Hey, what do you

175
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,440
use the spoon for? This is a good question. In the consumption process of lasagna, where's the spoon

176
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,520
come into play? I guess I'll be the asshole and point out that your aunt's house is just a

177
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,280
restaurant where the selection is bad and the prices are good. Right. How's the service? Service

178
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,640
seems a little surly, honestly, especially if you don't have a reservation. Zero stars on Yelp,

179
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,120
Aunt Kathy. I don't have to throw a brick through the Olive Garden door in order to go eat my

180
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,160
uncooked fettuccine. I mean, I do, but I don't have to. I'm adding a tag to your house, Aunt Kathy.

181
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,240
It says bad for kids because I'm a kid and I love lasagna and you're making this bad for me. You're

182
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:55,680
35, Derek. Stop coming over and eating my lasagna. Have you seen how I eat lasagna? I'm a kid at heart.

183
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,720
Still have a joy? Joy of my spirit? Yeah. Watch this. Tell me you don't get a little laugh out of it.

184
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,440
Come on, Aunt Kathy.

185
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,000
It's the worst. I've been running the numbers in my head and I'm happy to report it's the worst

186
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,400
food to eat with your hands. There's no world in which that is acceptable to eat with your hands.

187
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,920
Soup, yes, of course. No, actually, you know what? You're fucking wrong. It's lasagna.

188
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:35,520
Because here's the problem. Here's what I've just realized. If you use your fingers to strain

189
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,560
your soup, then you have a meal of broth and fixins. You just separated them out.

190
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,560
The problem with eating lasagna with your hands is lasagna is a tray bake, so either at some

191
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:56,960
point a utensil was used or you grabbed a meatball of fucking noodles and sauce and cheese and shit.

192
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
Use your fucking five finger exploding heart technique to just like...

193
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,000
They can use a utensil in the serving of it. This isn't a religious issue.

194
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
But then you can't make an argument of like, I didn't want to dirty a utensil. You already did.

195
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,920
But you're dirtying a second utensil. I'm on this person's side now. You guys have flipped me.

196
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,640
Now I'm mad. Now I'm really steamed. Well, if you're gonna use the spatula,

197
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,920
just keep using the spatula. It's just a big spoon if you think about it.

198
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,600
A big flat spoon. Why don't you use that spoon to keep digging your grave, guys?

199
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,960
Because you fucked up. I want to be on this person's side, but I know if they're doing

200
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,160
lasagna sandwiches, you know that they're doing tortellini brass knuckles. And that's no good.

201
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,840
My husband and I were once at one of our favorite burger joints for dinner and halfway through our

202
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:52,640
meal, a couple was seated next to us. We could tell it was a first date. Okay. But then we

203
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,600
noticed the guy still had a price tag hanging off the armpit of his shirt. My man. Wanting

204
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,560
to be a good citizen, what would have been the best way to remove the tag for him?

205
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,960
Now, Shannon B., I don't want to put you on, I'm assuming the B stands for blast,

206
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,720
which is what I'm about to put you on. I don't think if I can get ahead of this, removing the

207
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,680
tag for him is going to be your best path forward. Are you here, Shannon? All right. All right.

208
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,840
Nashville, can I say very restrained wooing? We normally get like 30 woos when we ask people here.

209
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,680
Somebody who wants a taste of the limelight. Laser-like focus. I also just realized that the

210
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:43,840
context of your question is, if this exact scenario happens again, what do I do? At which point,

211
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,560
I don't know, maybe write a book about your life and how you got to this point. What choices you've

212
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:58,400
made? Oh, you got so many options is the good answer. The good news, you can- Tickle check.

213
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Tickle check is also great. Tickle check. If they laugh, say like- 2019, we don't tickle check

214
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:13,520
people anymore. All right. Tickle check is out. What is in is you get a couple knives,

215
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,640
hold on, and you go to their table and you start doing a little hibachi cooking preparation on it.

216
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,240
And then while you're doing your tricks with the egg and the onion volcano, you just real quick,

217
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,000
they won't even notice. Okay. So I'm going to walk you. Go ahead. We're going to head on out

218
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,360
to the end of this little one-act drama you've created. I'm sorry, officer. I didn't mean to

219
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,480
stab him in the thorax. I was trying to surreptitiously remove a tag from his shirt and

220
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:52,000
then I plunged a knife into his chest and ended his young life. Now open your mouth and catch this

221
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:08,000
shrimp. Good job. Hey Justin, I'm just joking. Hey Justin, I'm just being a little stinker.

222
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,360
That's good, but I want Shannon to have actual advice because Shannon's planning on being in

223
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,520
this exact scenario again and so far your your suggestions to Shannon have not been strong.

224
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,720
Okay, uh, maybe you say like, Stephen, you jerk! And then punch him in the armpit, grab the tag.

225
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,640
So wait, hold on. Let him finish. It's not as bad. And then you say, oh, I'm sorry, I thought you

226
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,040
were Stephen. He knows what he did. And then maybe as you walk by, just lean in and whisper,

227
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:51,200
I got the tag. I got you. Now what? Okay. Now poke holes in that rock solid logic. Pay it forward.

228
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,640
I also shall put H&M. I thought of a funny thing you could lean in and whisper. Um, I almost

229
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,760
punched you, but I didn't because it's 2019 and I'm a human being and you've got a tag on your

230
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,800
shirt you should surreptitiously remove. I'm pretty sure Travis was being a stinker though.

231
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:16,880
Yeah, let me check. You didn't even, let me check the clock. Oh yeah, it's joke time. No, no, no,

232
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,920
you did not, uh, let the record show you did not poke your finger into your dimple as you were

233
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,760
saying it. So you were not being a little stinker. You punch him in the armpit.

234
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:44,640
Can, can you just goosh a lot of ketchup onto him? How is this your best idea so far?

235
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,360
This is the best one so far. And then when he goes to the bathroom, stab him, right? Is this stab him?

236
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,880
Now I'm a stinker. Now I'm a little stinker.

237
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,480
No, then you say you have a tag on your, on your armpit. You should get it off.

238
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,480
Go around and say you're taking up a collection for the needy and you're taking up a collection

239
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,800
of price tags. And do they have any? And then they'll say no. And you say, are you sure?

240
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,880
Can you check? Cause we feel like you might. I have another one, but Justin's not going to

241
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:28,480
like it again. You slip outside. You pull on a balaclava over your head. You go back in finger

242
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,720
in your coat pocket. Say, listen up, I'm a very specific robber looking for extremely new shirts

243
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,120
and all know which are the new ones.

244
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:50,880
His because of the tag and then the, but that would, that's not good. Cause then you take

245
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,720
a shirt and also you're robbing him. Maybe just start loudly discussing with your husband. I

246
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,440
believe start a loudly discussing with your husband at how cool it is when people have

247
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,000
armpit tags. Oh yeah. People, when they leave the price tags in their armpit,

248
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,320
isn't that the coolest. And okay. Now this is going to take some pre-discussion for your husband

249
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,840
to buy into it. He pulls a balaclava over his face and he says, let's do this honey bunny. And then

250
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:33,680
you, I have a Yahoo here and this one was sent in by Emma Cant. Thank you, Emma. Crushing it.

251
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:41,600
It's from another anonymous Yahoo answers user. This one's from a pay this and they ask,

252
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,920
how do I get a dog without my parents knowing I want a mini Corgi. We already have a dog.

253
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:56,560
So I know how to look after one. I am 14 update, Google mini Corgi. It's not a breed,

254
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:04,080
but it's bred to be a bit smaller update too. I can also spot signs of diseases and problem.

255
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Our oldest cat is 16. I spotted leg problems before anyone else and hip problems.

256
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,480
My little brother, for those at home, my little brother just punched me while flossing.

257
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,520
And now you fucking know.

258
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,480
So those last two things are qualifications, I guess, for the child spotted the cat diseases

259
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,680
with the leg and the hip problems. How can we help them get a hip problem in a 16 year old cat? You

260
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:54,800
want a medal? Nice work, Eagle Eye. Yeah, good spot. Oh, maybe. Wait, how many is a mini Corgi?

261
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,280
Well, this is going to be adorable, but probably not like, you know,

262
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,960
Oh, not small enough to put in your pocket? No, you can't slide this thing into your

263
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,080
Trapper Keeper. Yeah, I understand my suggestion. Go to your parents, say I have a very important

264
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,320
thing to tell you and I want you to respect my decision. This is my adopted son, Robert,

265
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:19,200
and he's very, he's very furry, but he is dressed like a little boy. And he's my son. And I've

266
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,640
adopted him. And I know I'm young, but this is the right choice for me. I've adopted this small boy.

267
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,280
Could you? Hey, Justin, I don't think that would work.

268
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,080
I don't think that that was reasonable.

269
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:44,480
Yeah, but you're not going to go to fucking prison for it. Worst case scenario in

270
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,280
mine is you don't get to keep the dog. Maybe replace the 16 year old cat with the dog

271
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,600
and convince your parent that it's still the cat. Yes. Because they're not paying close enough

272
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,960
attention to notice the leg and hip problem. Maybe you can slide it by them. You know,

273
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:12,400
you know, that's the cat. I don't think it is, but I've never really made attention to the cat before.

274
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:19,920
Our cat, Mr. Fluffers died, but was reincarnated in this beautiful dog. That's still our cat.

275
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,960
It's just a different shell. It's like you motherfuckers haven't even seen Fluke.

276
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,760
It's like you don't even think dogs have a purpose.

277
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,120
Shit, I hope you guys have seen Fluke and a dog's purpose.

278

text brother to 500-500. Thank you everybody who came out to the live show in Nashville and

304
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,400
Indianapolis. In Nashville we played at the Ryman if you're not familiar that's where Grand Ole

305
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,640
Opry is and that was a pretty wild experience and we were very grateful to those who came out and

306
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,640
to the Ryman for having us. Real quick the audio during the audience sections gets a little bit

307
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,920
dicey. Everything is still like totally listenable but we get picked up in the audience mics in a way

308
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,120
that that kind of sounds a little bit weird so just wanted to give you a heads up about that.

309
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,280
And yeah we are all you know recovering from the tour. We will be back next week though with a new

310
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,560
episode of my Bim Bam so we'll talk to you then. Hey MaxFun listeners have you been listening to

311
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,600
MaxFun for a while and you've just been wondering where's the new Flat Earth podcast to keep hearing

312
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:55,760
about? Well here it is. We give you all the facts on NASA's lies and how we know that the Earth is

313
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,520
actually flat. Just kidding. This is Oh No Ross and Carrie and we join fringe religious groups,

314
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,600
we undergo alternative medical treatments. And we hang out with people like 9-11 Truth

315
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,560
ers, Flat Earthers. We find out why do people believe strange things. We join them and we tell

316
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,960
you all about it. We have a lot of fun, we make a lot of friends. Yeah we do. We joined the Mormons,

317
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,640
we joined the Scientologists, we got acupunctured, we got fire cupped, we got ear candled, we've done

318
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,040
it all and we're gonna keep doing it all. Why don't you check out Oh No Ross and Carrie at MaximumFun.org

319
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:38,960
I work at a bank and a new guy just started training in our branch for two months.

320
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,080
He also works part-time in a liquor store nearby. Around the time he started training I mentioned

321
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:49,440
to him I've been looking for a bottle of specific Game of Thrones whiskey for a watch party I had

322
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,440
been planning. If it was the finale it sounds like you needed it right? I mean just re-shoot

323
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:04,000
the last two seasons right? The other day he came in very excited and told me he got his boss to

324
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,800
order the very expensive whiskey for me and I can come in and buy it next week. Now that Game of

325
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,520
Thrones is over I'm not throwing these parties anymore and I drink so rarely that it isn't worth

326
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,240
it to me to buy an $80 bottle of whiskey for myself. How do I tell him I'm not interested

327
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,960
anymore? Am I required to purchase this whiskey or since he will only be at our branch training

328
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,120
for another month can I just ignore it? Oh that's a long time to go. That's from Boozless Banker.

329
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:39,200
Are you here? Holy shit was that Tuvian throat singing? What was that? I heard one high voice

330
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:48,880
going and then I heard another voice going. That was fucking awesome.

331
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:59,760
Uh yeesh you could just wait for another dragon centric television show to work its way into

332
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,640
America's hearts. Listen that's got to be the thing everyone has to be scrambling to pitch

333
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,680
dragon content and someone somewhere is saying these words so he's a by the book cop and she's

334
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,120
a dragon. Yes. If we can have fucking Frankenstein cop I do not see why we can't have dragon cop. I've

335
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,640
just pitched dragon cop and I would watch the fuck out of it. So are you gonna drive or am I?

336
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,800
Oh right you're a dragon. Time has proven you would watch literally anything.

337
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,640
Yes replace dragon with the devil and I'm already watching that show and loving the hell out of it.

338
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,960
Travis? So you haven't seen Fluke or A Dog's Purpose but you'll watch Lucifer.

339
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,520
On Netflix now you gotta watch it. I was wrong about Nashville. Griffin and I were talking about

340
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:59,120
how we had a hard time getting to sleep last night and Travis said uh not me I went home

341
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,800
had some leftovers and uh went right to sleep. Well I watched two episodes of Lucifer. It's like

342
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,920
what? That's not going straight to sleep. I can't put it down Justin. You don't. It's so good.

343
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,520
Hello everybody and welcome to Munch Squad. It's a podcast within a podcast.

344
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,840
I want to thank whoever brought me this official Dairy Queen Happy Tastes Good

345
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:59,680
shirt. I need complete silence before I ask are you here? Jesus calm holy shit. Thank you I really

346
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,120
appreciate it. I also like how everyone keeps scaring Griffin. That means a lot to me. Munch

347
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,160
Squad is a podcast within a podcast that profiles the latest and greatest in quick service dining.

348
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,120
That Justin keeps threatening we'll die soon and then he keeps doing it. It's on its last legs.

349
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,320
This is its farewell to earth. It has a million last legs. Like a millipede. Um KFC launches first

350
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:34,080
exclusive drink with guess. Mountain Dew. I heard Mountain Dew. Someone said Chick-fil-a and that

351
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:39,600
would be the most fucking bogus thing. KFC announces it's partnering with Chick-fil-a

352
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,640
for Chick-fil-a to make a drink for them. I love that. It's lemonade.

353
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,160
You're gonna think I'm having some sort of episode

354
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:59,920
and I assure you I'm not. I'm just literally reading a press release released to the press

355
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:10,960
by Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mountain Dew and KFC are partnering to electrify their beverage lineup

356
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:21,280
with sweet lightning. A refreshment lit up with a punch of peach and a touch of honey flavors. It's

357
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:29,520
available exclusively at KFC restaurants nationwide by July 1st. Dew is fixing up a true to its roots

358
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:38,880
soda that will brighten each and every one of your taste buds. Now here's where things get a little

359
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,800
weird. Hold on wait. It didn't get weird at Dew is fixing up just like Pa used to make.

360
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:54,720
Yeehaw. On the mountain. How did this come to be? Money. Well it's obviously money and uh they're

361
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:58,960
owned by the same company. That's the other thing. They're owned by the same company. How did this

362
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,600
come to be? Meet Sweet. He's the Mountain Dew pitch man who is. Do you know the official way

363
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:10,720
you write Mountain Dew by the way? The official legal way of writing Mountain Dew is capital

364
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,400
m-t-n-d-e-w as the official name of Mountain Dew. The Mountain Dew pitchman who is sweet,

365
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,320
smooth and lightning fast enough to become a mainstay at KFC where the food is finger looking

366
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:33,520
good. How did it go down? With a glass of with a glass is always full swagger. Sweet strolls into

367
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,560
Colonel Sanders office with his southern charm. Holy shit. And wins him over quicker than a bowl

368
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:50,000
of lightning could strike. Fuck you. No Justin I'm saying to you my brother. It's not me it's

369
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,960
Tipsy Pete the tail spinner. The Colonel and Sweet shook on it. So wait right now you're saying that

370
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,680
this. Can I read my fucking fan section? This is about the same. This is some this is some legit a03

371
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:13,840
shit for sure. The Colonel and Sweet shook on it agreeing Sweet Lightning would not be served

372
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:21,040
in any other restaurant and one sweet deal was struck. Mountain Dew Sweet Lightning is the first

373
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,360
exclusive beverage to be offered at KFC. For Dew this is only the second time the brand has partnered

374
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:35,360
with a quick service restaurant. Been around the block huh? I can dig it. The first being the hugely

375
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:43,680
successful Baja Blast. Of course. That's my munchies. I knew you were out there. Baja Blast

376
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:52,640
at Taco Bell uh a nearly decade and a half ago. Wow time flies when you're measuring it by the

377
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,680
amount of time that Baja Blast has been available. Here's a quote from from Sweet. Oh god. No it's

378
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:08,720
not from Sweet. I wish. Like KFC MTN DEW is inspired by bold ideas and flavors making this an

379
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:17,040
authentic relationship from the start. Now just take a fucking second. Just take a fucking second

380
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:25,600
about words. Can we take a second about words and how we just use the words an authentic relationship

381
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:36,000
from the start to describe how two brands one of them a grease peddler and the other one selling

382
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:45,600
like soda meth and how they got together to do peach syrup and they're like this is off this

383
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:57,600
is authenticity. We are fucking. This is this is real. To come together on an exclusive product

384
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:06,880
product Sweet Lightning is a thrill and we look forward to delighting our customers taste buds

385
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:15,440
and pushing the envelope on creativity. You made a peach drink. You made a peach drink like

386
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,520
Da Vinci before us. Sweet Lightning was developed in partnership with the food and beverage innovation

387
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,240
experts at KFC and Mountain Dew to create the perfect pairing for KFC's original recipe fried

388
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,600
chicken. Don't eat it with with the crisp stuff. Don't eat with the hot stuff. This is perfectly

389
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:40,560
prepared to be a perfect pairing with the original recipe. Original recipe. They've left us hanging

390
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,800
this whole time. Original recipe. You know how it's been missing something. The original recipe is a

391
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:54,240
KFC brand staple and the innovation experts for each brand wanted to create a beverage that is

392
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,960
unique as the fried chicken it was created to complement. At some point somebody went into

393
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:06,320
somebody's boss's office and the boss said um this needs to be 700 words. I don't care what words are

394
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:13,440
in it but it does need to reach 700 words. There are no press sites at all that cover this stuff.

395
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,280
It's only for Justin so we gotta give him some runway. What I love about this is they started

396
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,440
this story saying listen how did this happen? It's not our fault. Sweet showed up and talked to

397
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,440
Colonel Sanders and they did it and then later in their own goddamn press release said our innovators

398
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,960
here made it happen. So what's the real story KFC and Mountain Dew? Was it Sweet and Colonel

399
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,160
Sanders or was it your innovators? And I won't rest till I get to the truth. Hi I'm Travis

400
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:49,760
McElroy cup reporter. Now you think about it if you think if you boil this down to practicality

401
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,560
this is an entire press release to announce the fact that around the country Americans are going

402
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:03,520
to walk up to a soda fountain look at the choices and go sweet ugh no ugh I'll have Pepsi. I'll be

403
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,400
having a diet Pepsi today. None of that for me. Can I is there and this may be asking too much

404
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,680
but is there an image of Sweet lightning? Oh because like is this an MC scat cat situation

405
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,920
where the I have a picture of Sweet that I'm going to show to our friends here in Nashville.

406
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,200
He does not look like what I thought he's going to look like.

407
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,640
He's a handsome yellow suit. Yellow devil. He's the world's most caffeinated man. He looks like

408
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,160
Satan if Satan were a yellow mustard suit instead of the usual he looks like Lucifer basically. Yeah

409
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:48,720
but if Lucifer were made of piss. Yeah hi I'm pissifer. No it's not piss it's pre-piss it's

410
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,720
Mountain Dew. That is their slogan. It's piss ingredients. This will be piss in a while.

411
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:03,360
Mountain Dew. Anyway that's much fun. Uh should we do audience questions? Yes. All right so we

412
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,120
picked some audience questions out you've sent them in in advance and we appreciate it. Thank

413
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,720
you Paul with some nice refreshing water. Thank you Paul from Paul and Storm.

414
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,840
Yes let's start here. Hi hello. Hi. What's your name? Coe. Hi Coe. Uh your question please. Um

415
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,760
I have to walk to class every day. Yes. Uh fourth of a mile um and I have asthma and I have to use

416
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,120
an inhaler. Right. And I was wondering how do I use my inhaler in a way that the other students

417
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:50,640
think I look cool? Yeah. When you let me ask you this because this is going to be very instructive

418
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:57,920
when you blow it out how much cotton are you blowing? Very important. Like could you do

419
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:05,120
like a pirate ship? Only if I blow it out immediately but I need that medicine.

420
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:13,440
Well how cool do you want to look? Come on come on. Maybe when you finish this look somebody say

421
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:19,840
it's weed or write weed on it. Just write the word weed on it.

422
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:27,920
Just say bong bong. This is my cool portable bong.

423
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,560
How long can you hold it? Like hit it and then just keep them waiting and eventually be like

424
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,000
this is the coolest thing I've ever seen. Their lungs are going to be so open. I have to hold it

425
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:51,920
for 10 seconds. 10 minutes. Like David Blaine. Hi I'm going to do a new mantra today. Uh I'm

426
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,480
having a hard time breathing. It's just a lot of pollen in the air. 10 minutes. Put it on the clock.

427
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,280
Wait please come back. It's way longer in the pool. What are you uh can you if somebody catches

428
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,360
you doing it can you do like an animal house and just pop the whole thing in your mouth?

429
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:13,760
Yeah I can. It's that small. That's good. Maybe pass it around because you know what's cool?

430
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,360
Sharing. Yeah. By the way if you need advice on how to fit things that are about that big in your

431
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:34,160
mouth uh can you spin it around like a fucking cowboy gun? Oh yeah a holster. Oh you could do

432
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,240
a whole like and like well 10 seconds still 10 you hold it for 10 seconds but like the fastest 10

433
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,240
seconds anyone's ever seen right? It's a fixed measurement of time. Well so why not and you know

434
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,920
Einstein believes that if you inhaled in space it puts you backwards.

435
00:49:51,920 --> 00:50:00,720
Does that help? It does thank you. Thank you.

436
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,760
Let's go right over here to a microphone I'd like to think of is Housewright.

437
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,640
Hi. Hi. Hello. What's your name? Charlie. Hi Charlie. What's your question? Okay so last year

438
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,520
I was bit by a snake in my backyard uh while I was taking out the trash. Was it one of the

439
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,680
cool snakes or one of the snakes you wicked don't want to get bit by? I mean it was it was like a

440
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,160
garter snake but it was like four feet long. I think Griffin was asking about the poisonousness

441
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,880
and not necessarily the length. It was not poison. Okay good that's a good start. Unless it was and

442
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:46,880
you're invincible. Oh shit. Unsnakable. So do you need help finding and killing this thing or what's

443
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,920
up? Is this a vengeance thing? You need to hire us because it's like five thousand dollars and we got a handle.

444
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,400
I'll kill any snake you all want and this goes for everybody five thousand dollars I'll kill any snake.

445
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:02,240
I'll go to I'll go into a zoo and kill a snake for five thousand dollars.

446
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:10,800
Well Charlie what? Well I'm afraid of snakes now but it's been a year and my parents are

447
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,600
still saying I have to take out the trash despite the fact we've seen more snakes in the backyard.

448
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,160
For the past year are you still taking out or are you pulling a Sarah Cynthia Sylvia style and just

449
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,280
leaving it let it pile up? I've been able to do it but with like extreme caution. Sure you just

450
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:35,840
chuck it out the back door. Have you thought about some kind of leg armor? That's good plate

451
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:43,600
mail solves most problems. Is it are your parents making you do it because they want you to like

452
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:51,600
face your fear because they're just really lazy? Um both. Yeah yeah yeah is there is there a chore

453
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,280
maybe they hate doing that you could barter with them? Like that's what I've been trying to

454
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:07,040
consider. Hey why do you have so many fucking snakes in your backyard? My my house borders

455
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,320
like a forest which is near a river so. My house borders a forest I have yet not seen hide more

456
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,720
hair nor scale with one snake. To be fair if you saw the hair of a snake it's probably the end of

457
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:27,600
the world and that's Quetzalcoatl. Yeah. Uh I mean they say lightning doesn't strike the same leg

458
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,720
twice. No wait in your universe a snake would go to bite Charlie and the snake would be like

459
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:44,240
it is a lot. I mean if you think about it the story you just told us was not super wild.

460
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:50,720
If you ended the story with in any way that's happened three times now it would be wild. So

461
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:56,000
if you just run the numbers you probably won't get bit again. I'm pretty sure that's how statistics

462
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:07,120
work. Unless you do. Charlie let me let you into a secret that parents won't tell you and I realized

463
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,520
this recently Justin and I were talking about this earlier. Uh so I have a two and a half year old

464
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,440
and I've come to the realization that the number of times I've said like hey don't open that door

465
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:26,080
or hey it's time to sit down and my kid just goes no. And I suddenly have the overwhelming

466
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,640
realization I have no power over her. So the next time your parents are like take out the trash just

467
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,800
go no. No. They'll be upset don't get me wrong they'll be upset. They'll take away your Nintendo

468
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:44,480
for sure. Or next time they ask you to take out the trash you say okay hold on one second and

469
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:56,240
you bite them in the leg really hard. Does that help? Yes. Excellent there we go. Hello. Hi. Hi

470
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:02,000
what's your name? Sam. Hi Sam. You can bend that mic down and get right up on it. Hello oh we

471
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,320
messed it up. It was a mistake. Oh no. And that's it welcome to our prank show my brother my brother

472
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:14,400
and me. Hi. Hi Sam. Sorry I messed up the email like four times. Oh no it's fine what's your

473
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:22,400
question? Uh so a few like last year we were gifted some birds for our Christmas gift. I suspect the

474
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,480
person didn't want them but anyway so they were more a gift from my brother. Okay. Uh but he goes

475
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:35,440
to school so I was entrusted with the birds and a so and so happened to the birds and one of them

476
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,160
died. Stop stop stop. You cannot sew. I saw like three people in the audience go whoa whoa whoa.

477
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,040
I need you to get right up on that mic and say what happened to these birds.

478
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:58,560
I don't know. You don't know Sam you know. You know. Look in your heart. Say what happened to

479
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:07,440
the birds. Unburden yourself here at the Ryman. We had two birds. One for me and one for him.

480
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,120
Okay so you each had your own bird and you know we're gonna get to the part where one of them

481
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:18,640
died so maybe we should skip there. I don't even know which one died TBH. Um I hate these birds.

482
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,960
I did not kill them. I suspect they were old because when you get a bird from the pet store

483
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:30,480
you don't know how old it is. You count the rings and then. The fact that you felt the need to say

484
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:40,640
I did not kill it. Relatively sure. Anyways that's not the point. Hold on. Yeah I held it

485
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:49,040
underwater for a long time but. And this harsh words can kill a bird. Okay we haven't gotten

486
00:55:49,040 --> 00:56:01,280
the question yet. So it happened two times. Okay. No no no. So with the first bird we

487
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,200
replaced it with a bird that looked exactly the same. And didn't tell him. And then it

488
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,840
happened again and we replaced the bird but I sent my dad to get the other bird and the bird

489
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:19,520
that he brought back looked nothing like the other bird. Good job dad. Like 100% nothing like the

490
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,080
other bird and I was like well I can I guess maybe convince him that it molted funny maybe

491
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:32,960
and it just looks like that now. Is your brother here? He is. Okay. He's also. Question answered.

492
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,880
He already knew though. He already knew. I had to come clean and I had to tell him but now he

493
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:44,400
doesn't trust me. Yeah. Yeah I stabbed the guy trying to get a tag off his shirt and now he

494
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,760
doesn't trust me. I don't trust you. I did it because I thought he would be very very sad. My

495
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:53,040
brother is my best friend. I thought he would be very very sad if I told him that his bird

496
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,080
passed away and I couldn't get anybody else to do it and I didn't want to do it so. Sam I want

497
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,200
you to know as somebody with a four year old daughter who has in the past two years bought

498
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:15,120
seven fish and only had to come up with two names. I'm on your side. But your daughter's four and my

499
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:26,320
brother's 25. I mean the animals are still dead Sam. They sure are. I mean there's there's some

500
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:32,400
point that you're making that I can't connect the dots on but I think mine's pretty clear that I'm

501
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,280
trying to say I'm on your side. Thank you. You do need to get ones that look similar though because

502
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,840
that's a rookie. That's where the second name comes in. Princess Aurora has to be pink

503
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,320
and you can get another pink fish that's fine. If you get a blue one though

504
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,720
he's gonna know it's not Princess Aurora. Okay trust me on this one.

505
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:03,440
That's why we have Belle and daughter of Belle. That's convenient. Yeah yeah we all want to leave

506
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,120
something behind in this world. It's a legacy. Maybe next time just say your bird moved.

507
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:15,760
The bird moved away got a job out of state. If your family is going to be so bad at doing the

508
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:21,920
Indiana Jones pedestal switch with these birds you need to buy so many fucking birds that your

509
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:27,200
brother can't even keep track of how many birds. I was a hundred percent invested in being like

510
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,800
60 years old and when the other bird died like sneaking into his house and like replacing the

511
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,640
bird like I was in for the long haul. I was gonna do that but then it ended up that my dad dropped

512
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:43,600
the ball or the bird and then we just had to get a different bird. Got it and you know what

513
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:48,640
most of the time you drop a bird it's probably fine. Birds they fly. They're very resilient.

514
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:54,800
Oh I dropped the bird and I dropped it up. And also it was a 10-story building so that was a

515
00:58:54,800 --> 00:59:01,840
mistake on my part. To be fair the bird owed Sam's dad a lot of money. Yes. The feet aren't so happy

516
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:12,240
now are they? The juice is running. Does that help Sam? I reckon. It's fair that's as much as we

517
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:22,320
deserve. Thank you Sam. Hello. Hey what's up? Hey guys. Hey Zach. Zach. Hey. Hey. What's your

518
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,240
question? I mean I know what it is and it's amazing but I'm excited to hear it from you.

519
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:33,920
So I was at TPAC two years ago and I asked you guys how I need to get my dad to not think it's

520
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:52,160
cool for his grandfather name to be Tarzan. Yes. So he still wants that to be a thing. Yeah. So I

521
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:58,480
have two nephews and now my wife is pregnant so I think this is a much more pressing matter now.

522
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:07,360
Now it affects you. Now you got skin in the game. Yeah. So please help me. Yeah. And to be clear

523
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:16,960
we didn't help you last time. No. I just want to get the stakes. So since then you say he wants it

524
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:24,080
to be a thing. Has it been a thing up till now? Okay and even more skin in the game is a great

525
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:41,120
segue because he got a tattoo of Tarzan. Hey bad news it's a thing. Yeah. Your dad is Tarzan now.

526
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:51,280
He made it a thing. Oh god yes. It's over bud. I need a fucking cigarette. It's over bud.

527
01:00:51,280 --> 01:01:00,640
If I had a month to plan maybe but this no. Here I kind of help you. It's Tarzan and it's a thing.

528
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:08,640
Okay hold on all right let's let's go through all of our options because maybe we weren't thorough

529
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,920
enough last time. I thought we had this fucking squared away but uh. Yeah I thought we made it

530
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,400
pretty clear to your dad that he couldn't be Tarzan. I actually think we were on board with

531
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,400
it last time. What was our advice last time? Well I think I think it was Griffin that said just

532
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,080
to have the kids just yell Tarzan a lot in public places and maybe it'll be embarrassing enough.

533
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:36,240
Well it's that backfired huh? Yeah. He just loved it. He he lived it up. He's he's literally doubled

534
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,720
down. Oh maybe see if you can get the kids to start saying Tarzan. Yeah. Now that now he he's

535
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:48,720
like oh they must have my tattoo. Wait does the tattoo say the word Tarzan on it? No it's like.

536
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,200
We got options. Yeah yeah yeah. Can he just say like well my grandpa name is Papa like a normal

537
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,760
one and this is just a generic. This is just Brendan Fraser. This is a swinging jungle man.

538
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,320
My grandpa name is George like George of the Jungle that's who's on my tattoo. Is your

539
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:14,160
dad's name George? No. Damn damn. Give us something. Is it Brendan Fraser? It's not. Is your dad Brendan

540
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:22,080
Fraser? Fuck. No. That would have been cool for a lot of reasons. Zach you're not leaving us many

541
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:31,680
options pal. I know. Do you have any other grandpas you could use? Do you have any backup grandpas?

542
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:40,080
Yeah this one's this one's done with. This one's cached. This one's all used up. You know when you

543
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,480
get food from like like DoorDash or something like that you can leave special instructions

544
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,920
in there. You can say like you have to say that they're his grandpa and they have a normal grandpa

545
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:56,160
name like Jim Jam or something like that. This is your new grandpa. He brings us pizza from the

546
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:05,280
dominoes. Griffin's suggesting a grandpa escort service and I'm very into it. In the sheer economy

547
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:12,080
grandpas are the next big thing. I'm not using my grandpa all the time and now you can.

548
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,080
Now warning my dad calls himself peeps so.

549
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah. I don't know why you should have gone. If we didn't do it you probably should have asked

550
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:34,480
a different podcast. You don't go to a second opinion from the same doctor two years later.

551
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:42,400
You know you get a different smarter doctor. Your butt's still weird. I don't know man.

552
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,840
You go ask Mark Marin or my favorite murder. How to fix your dad problems.

553
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:59,440
Hey so what we can do is. Okay yes you give us a fight. Thank you. So I guess my counter here is

554
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,480
when you guys are doing a show in two years at Bridgestone I'll just ask the same question.

555
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,400
Just keep us in the loop. Yeah this is the new 7 up. And for the love of God next time

556
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:21,040
Zach please do bring your dad. Yes. Okay you can lower their lights and bring back up the

557
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:27,360
Justin lights as I think of them. Thank you. Interesting. Hey everybody. Hey everyone. We've

558
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:33,760
had a lot of fun here. But you know what's not fun? Stabbing people in restaurants. Hi I'm Justin

Mackerel. Now this has been you all have been so fun. Yeah thank you all so much. What a great fun

561
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,200
also last night at the adventure zone did the arena stomp. Which I don't think I've heard like

562
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,080
anywhere else. I know. Okay but stop it's a lot. It's a lot. This building's so old please stop.

563
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:04,480
Thank you. Old and beautiful. I cannot fucking believe that we got to play the Ryman twice.

564
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:11,120
This is the best life-changing dream come true. Absolutely wild. I want to say a huge thank you

565
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:22,880
to Paul of Paul and Storm. Thank you Paul. Who ate some of my drunken beef noodle before I could

566
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,880
tonight. Neat. Wait you know what Paul? He got in there first ate four bites looked at me and said

567
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:35,040
good news it's not poisoned and then left. That's a good tour manager right there. Good guy. Good

572
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,680
quick so we're traveling with our families and we got to get out really early tomorrow to head

573
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,320
to Indianapolis. So we're not going to be able to hang out after the show. We rented this is fun.

574
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:19,040
This is the first time we've ever gotten a bus because there's like 50 of us now. And I flew

575
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:24,960
into Nashville but they came up from from Appalachia and I have just. I came from Cincinnati. That's

576
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,640
basically Appalachia. I literally backstage tonight just learned there are of course bathrooms

577
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:37,920
on the tour bus. You're not allowed to poop in them. There's a sign on the door that says don't

578
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,240
poop here in a bathroom. I'm sure you'll be hearing a lot about that at our live show we record

579
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,760
tomorrow night in Indianapolis. Yeah. But thank you so much. You've been amazing. Every week on

580
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:55,200
my brother me Griffin asks a Yahoo question at the end of the show that we think about and talk

581
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,880
about and then return to next week with some of our answers to it. Have you prepared one? Sure.

582
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,360
This is a one that was sent in also by Emma can't crushing it. Thank you. It's Yahoo Answers. It's

583
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:12,080
an anonymous Yahoo Answers user. Their name is Jim Jam and they asks they asks they asks

584
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:22,720

587
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:04,400

588
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,080
and they hunt monsters at night. It's Blade meets the Odd Couple.

589
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:15,040
Adam Scott and Jane Levy. Come on, Cory. She's too serious. Too business. See, she doesn't know the

590
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:22,880
hokey pokey. She'll learn what it's all about. Busy Phillips and Dave Koechner. Baby, this is

591
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:29,600
family. My Uncle Tell who showed his wiener to Cinderella at Disneyland is family. Do you want

592
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:36,720

month. Only on Dead Pilot Society for maximum fun.
