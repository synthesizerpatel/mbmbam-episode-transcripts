1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,580
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but if there's a degree on his wall, I haven't seen it

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,660
Also, this show isn't for kids which I mentioned only so the babies out there will know how cool they are for listening

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:30,660
What's up, you cool, baby?

5
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,020
It's better it's better with you

6
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,020
It's better it's better with you

7
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,260
Better it's better

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,140
Hello everybody welcome to my brother my brother and me vice show for the modular. I'm your oldest brother Justin McElroy

9
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,660
I'm your middle is brother big dog woof woof. I got please

10
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,140
Travis McElroy, and I'm your sweet baby brother Griffin McElroy

11
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:30,380
So this is a segment we like to do every episode where we ask Travis has repeat

12
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,420
My penis is fine. This is it's my scrotum that I'm doing this we do it. Hey, hey boys we doing this

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,380
Yes, the thing it's a it's a great. It's a fan favorite bit. Yeah

14
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,740
It's great, and we can only do it. I mean God willing in the creek don't rise

15
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,740
We can only do it one more time. Yeah, got myself a vasectomy

16
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,740
Yeah, and just you know I'm not so plugged into so she but juice

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,460
What was the response like when you talked at length about your sort wow actually so funny? You said that very good

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,780
Positive yeah good and positive there were people like I don't want to hear about this dude's hog

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,380
I want to hear him joke about fast-food franchise

20
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,340
Well Griffin the vasectomy doesn't focus on the hog primarily it focuses more on

21
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,060
The the beans as it were focuses on the buns

22
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,900
Focuses on the meatballs. I like to think of it all is the hog. Oh, okay, okay?

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,380
It's a holistic hog time down there, and I'm here's the thing travel. I'm your brother

24
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,500
I love you, and I'm very concerned about your well-being. I'm excited about your

25
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,580
your your your impotence and all that jazz, but even I don't feel that way doesn't even even I

26
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,140
Even I kind of don't want to hear about it

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
I'm you're not supporting me in this time

28
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,980
When I need when I need you the most Griffin that I've ever needed you in my entire life to just say yes to the dress

29
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,180
You're saying no, and yeah

30
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,940
Yeah, can I ask so I've had it so Trav if if I can walk

31
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,820
I'm in like a supportive place with you. Thank you. How did it? How did it go? How did the whole thing go mostly went fine?

32
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,940
There was one weird thing. I don't know how you dealt with this Justin

33
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:21,340
Yeah, the doctor just kept saying wow what a radical scrote, and yeah, yeah, that was a

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,780
Flattering I guess but like I kind of wanted him to focus up

35
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,420
Hey, it was the use. It's the use of the word radical that makes me think that maybe this was not a licensed medical

36
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,020
Professional and maybe some sort of surf surf, dude

37
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,420
Well sometimes you would just walk under his breath like that's just such a cool sack

38
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,660
You know what I mean and like that was yeah nice, but like I

39
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,100
Expected it to be a little less and for lack of a better word clinical

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah, I I've listened to you talk about this for a few minutes now

41
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,600
I wanted to give you a little bit of rope, but it seems like

42
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
You're lying, and that's fine

43
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,220
No, there's humor to be found in that but I am gonna go ahead and assume from your lies from the fact that you've cooked

44
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,300
Up a fabricated thing did it the whole thing wasn't very funny. No no

45
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,140
It wasn't very funny, and I feel like maybe you were going in hoping it would be a gut-buster

46
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
and maybe it was just sort of a

47
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,660
You know an overall success and fun for everybody, okay?

48
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,260
I'll be honest now it was uh it was not bad the only part that really like hurt hurt was honestly

49
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:38,100
He like balls. Yeah, well now he's taped he taped my penis up out of the way, so we can get in the way

50
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,100
Get out of there

51
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
When he took the tape

52
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,980
For me and when he took the tape off it pulled off it pulled off a lot of chest hair, and that really

53
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Wasn't a problem for me at all

54
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,180
Fuck it's all good stuff. It's all good stuff. Just fun regular conversation now

55
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,980
I brothers I do find that I've spent the last 48 hours

56
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,540
Thinking more about my own genitals than I did in all of my teen years put together

57
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,580
Hey same same for me, but for you because you keep telling us about him

58
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,460
You keep a dad keeps asking dad every four hours wants to check in on how my downstairs is doing. He's a caring father

59
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,020
But he keeps saying how's your radical scrote, and I don't know

60
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,980
When I check in I say how are you feeling

61
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:43,640
But I don't say tell me about the tell me about the incision site on your delicate bathing suit area

62
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,540
Because I love you, but that's your private place

63
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,500
That's your private sound and here's the thing is he said mine was the least delicate. He's ever seen

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,520
He said it was like toughened leather trying to get through there, man

65
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,940
You got a cool juice you kept saying he didn't do that with me. Did you guys have the same guy?

66
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,880
There's only one guy in the tri-state area who like gets it just one regular normal guy

67
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:14,160
Okay, he travels the world kind of a reverse Johnny Appleseed really yeah, hey

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,640
What was that? Well just a little soundbite of on the wings of love. Yeah, that's why

69
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,900
Comcast is trying to call me. They'll never read me down. Is that special ringtone Justin?

70
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,160
They said were you using your data to hear things about your brother's testicles?

71
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,200
Cuz we're monitoring the whole thing. The doctor kept calling him besticles. He said these are the besticles

72
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,640
And I was all right, and that was interesting to me. All right

73
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,080
So it wasn't funny. I'm sorry to hear. He asked if he could do a charcoal drawing and frame it and hang it up

74
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,120
Yeah, his personal home. Yeah, that was nice

75
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm starting to think he didn't even get a vasectomy. No

76
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,860
No, no. No, I'm sure I'm sure he did, but I just don't think any funny happened and he was disappointed

77
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,540
Griffin I can send you a picture. Griffin I'll send you a picture to prove it. No, we don't need to do that

78
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,740
This is a kind of jackass style. This isn't like one of those jackasses

79
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:16,700
That would be weird if now like jackass started up again, but it was just like oh man. Yeah, I got an actual like

80
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,520
Prostate exam and it wasn't funny. But here here's my test results. And yeah, they are they are getting older

81
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,280
They are welcome to make a run at it for sure, but they should definitely check in and see what's going on on YouTube

82
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,440
Before they make any grand. Yeah. Yes that jackasses back in the mix because things are

83
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,440
Yeah a lot out there. Yeah, there's a guy on tick tock who's like in this tick tock over the next year

84
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm gonna eat my entire house and it's like Johnny and the gang

85
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,400
How are you supposed to beat that? He's gonna eat a whole house in a year. I treated this guy's over here eating houses

86
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,800
He's giving it away for free. I think jackass should come back and just do unboxing videos

87
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,080
But every time they open the box inside, it's just steve-o's genitals

88
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,960
And play every time and it's still attached. Don't get me wrong still attached. Yeah

89
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,440
Yeah, but he's been under the table for the whole time I love funny. All right, this guy's still got it

90
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,480
So this is an advice show. So we'll only have to do this one more time. But when I get mine, I'm gonna be

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,980
Like a very coquettish about it

92
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,820
You're not even good. You're not even behind a fan. You're not even gonna know

93
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,940
This is an advice show. I need a second

94
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,180
I'd started heating up a pot of water to make macaroni for Teresa when the kids got home and they haven't left yet

95
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,020
So now there's just a hot pot of water on the stove. I gotta go stop that heat one second. All right

96
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,580
I mean

97
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,140
Keep recording. That's a great. Yeah, that's a great thing to let people know that Travis did

98
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,220
Hey, as long as we're doing chores, I'm do can I get permission from you on something juice?

99
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:56,860
Yeah

100
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:03,020
Here's a bad smell coming up through the drain on the floor of my laundry room and smells like an elephant died in my house

101
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,380
Somewhere and I can't find it

102
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,120
So I got the door to my office open out to the outside and getting a little sound of the city

103
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,820
Do you think that's okay? Do you get that in the mix? Yeah, it's fine to get the sound of the city in the mix

104
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,300
Welcome back Trav. We never stopped the show. Oh great. Great. Great. That's good content. I love that's good content

105
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Yeah, that's some content

106
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,540
Okay, so you're back Griffin that's fine get a little sound of the city, okay

107
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,740
And I'm sorry about the smell that's tough as when your house just get to smell

108
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:44,080
It's a bad one. My dishwasher got a bad smell. Oh man, and then I was like, well you clean you clean for a living

109
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,120
It cleans you and it's like, you know to be like the dishwasher washed the dish who washed the dishwasher

110
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
That's great turned out it me

111
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,360
And if you wait too long to clean those things

112
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,680
Some bad things happen. Yeah won't forget can't forget. She can't forget

113
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
So this is my show

114
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:11,280
Um Travis you have places a question from Cora in here. Well, I think that this is important

115
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,320
You know what? I mean? Like I we don't normally treat these as like regular

116
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,480
Listener questions usually that's only because they're not

117
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:25,360
Well, but this was sent from Nathan and I saw and I instantly thought like this is important. This is this is

118
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:34,440
perhaps an important cultural touchstone that we could answer and fix and make the world a little bit better and it's rare that we

119
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Have that opportunity

120
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,960
It just seems like a we're gonna cuss a lot

121
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Doing it is it here's a question

122
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,960
Is it for fuck's sake or?

123
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
for fuck's sake

124
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
It's for a work email so it has to sound professional

125
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,400
It's neither of the ways that they have written it here because they've written it F U C K S no

126
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,600
Apostrophe it is obsessed. It's possessive. The sake is possessive of

127
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,080
Fuck of the f-word. Yeah, and then we move on because it's just it just feels like we're gonna get like really fucking like

128
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,240
Nasty, here's what I think needs to happen Griffin

129
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,040
I think each of us needs to say fuck ten times in a row until the world cuz no the word

130
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,640
Loses meaning right and then we can just discuss it. No, cuz it's done. We're not we're not a whole

131
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,000
George Carlin and we've also said that word so many times and it's fine to say it in the heat of the moment

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
Fun, but to do it to do it like this

133
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
It sucks. It sucks

134
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,200
My my three-year-old daughter threw a chapstick in my eye and it landed right in the eye

135
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,180
Was the chapstick open?

136
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,220
Did you get any chance to open because I was trying to take it from her because she jishes it up the whole way

137
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,680
Oh, yeah

138
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,520
So it's just two inches of chapstick sticking out and it drives me crazy like a dog. Yeah, she's like, okay

139
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,320
Sure, no problem Chuck and then throws it at my head and goes right my eye and I said fuck and then Charlie said

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,800
Don't say bad words. I said this is the exact opportunity to say fuck cuz a kid

141
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Not now then when yeah, if not this then why that's weird coming from Charlie who I believe just per capita

142
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,480
Has cursed more in her life than I have

143
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
Mm-hmm. So I don't understand where she gets off judging you Justin

144
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,960
I think you're doing fine, but the question that I'm left with Justin is

145
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,600
Was there chapstick on your eyeball? Yeah, was it lip smackers?

146
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Mentholated what are we dealing with?

147
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,960
It was a coconut. It was like a coconut cream pie or something like that

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Hey, all right your I feel moisturized afterwards

149
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,960
Uh, no, it was unpleasant. I mean there were tears in it. So yes, I guess it was

150
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,920
Okay, here's a different one

151
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,480
Hello brothers

152
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,440
My partner and I are currently in the middle of making a lovely

153
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,720
Chicken casserole for dinner and we hit a snag the recipe calls for cornflakes for that crunchy touch

154
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,800
But we're plumb out at the moment. However, we do have for rusted flakes

155
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,520
Do I go for that sweet with this chicken bacon rice casserole?

156
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,120
Or do you know any way I can get the frosted off my flakes without them getting soggy?

157
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:25,760
That's some casserole in without cornflakes. This is your moment Justin. Yes, Justin shine shine, baby

158
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,560
Okay, here is my suggestion to you and I think this is powerful

159
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,000
It's a powerful cooking concept because you guys know I love to mess around in the kitchen. Oh, yeah

160
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,280
Crime scene kitchen. I'll watch it. No problem. I'll watch anything with Joel McHale and kitchen

161
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,240
A mystery. So here's what I'm gonna say. There's a little bit of sugar in everything. Okay?

162
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,140
Okay, is that fair to say she put cornflakes on?

163
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,920
Your casserole you have introduced some sugar from the malt

164
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,400
Flavoring in the cornflake and in the you know in the process of making cornflakes, of course

165
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,680
wh Kellogg introduced sugar that his brother was unwilling to

166
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,800
Introduce because he was a health nut. So

167
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,080
You got sugar in there. Is this fair? Mm-hmm. Yeah

168
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,840
But if you have frosted flakes, oh, you've added more sugar. Okay, that's not bad

169
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,540
All you got to do is you got to grab the other sliders

170
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,920
Jack them up to meet sugar. There's not a there's not too much sugar. There's not enough cumin. Yeah

171
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,120
Yeah, it's not enough paprika you put it all in there you jack up all the flavors

172
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:48,300
Balanced and it's intense. It's like that. It's like that book and TV show this like salt sugar yummy sweet

173
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,760
Yeah, and then you got the four flavors you have the four flavors of salt

174
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,280
Salt is salty sugar is has that sugary taste to it

175
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Yummy is most of the other stuff and then sweet is like everything that's sweet, but isn't sugar like honey

176
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,000
That that will be my suggestion is yes

177
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,360
You can introduce the frosted flakes, but some flavors have got to come meet the sugar to play with it

178
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,200
Yeah, or else the sugar will be standing out on stage with his pants down around his fucking ankles

179
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, you know you got to have the other flavors meet it meet it midway. That is my suggestion

180
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,480
What do you are? What would you all really do in this don't do any jokes?

181
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,240
Put joke out of room and just tell me what would you do?

182
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,660
What would you do the truth is Justin when I find myself in this place where it's like recipe calls for some kind of

183
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,920
crunchy

184
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,000
Breaded thing. This is where I start doing that pantry deep dive because there's almost always

185
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,960
some

186
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Cheez-its in there right you gotta have some crunchums. Yeah, I got a four-year-old and a two-year-old

187
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Basically, there's some

188
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,280
Cheez-its somewhere somewhere and cheez-its make an excellent addition the other day. It was making some meatballs

189
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,600
Yeah, and I didn't have breadcrumbs crunched up cheez-its. This is the secret ingredient

190
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,880
I it just like mama used to make boom. Yeah, I

191
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,880
I would say

192
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,520
That a good thing that you could the one thing that you could do. Uh-huh

193
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,800
is

194
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,000
is

195
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,160
She chili cheese Cheetos

196
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,640
Chilly cheese. Sorry, chili cheese Cheetos cheesy cheesy chili

197
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,200
Fritos those. Yeah, those things are fucking great, man. I

198
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,120
Had he knows I had a talkies. No, not one not those just chili cheese Fritos

199
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
I had a bowl of chili the other night for dinner and we didn't have any regular Fritos to put in it

200
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,920
So I put chili cheese Fritos in it and it and they canceled out and they disappeared

201
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,200
My bowl was empty when I'm out. It was crazy. Yeah, I didn't know that it worked like that

202
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:14,240
You know what? Why stop at the Frosted Flakes start replay? Let's see. You got chicken bacon rice, right?

203
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,440
You're gonna add in rice krispies in place of the rice, you know what you can keep the bacon

204
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:25,560
But I'm gonna want you to make it like maple like candied bacon. Yeah, and for the chicken egg egg is like chicken

205
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Yeah, but beginning of it. Yeah, make a meringue right like do that, right?

206
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,960
This is what we're talking

207
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,520
We're gonna make us a sweet because here's the thing you have cinnamon rolls for breakfast and everybody accepts that right?

208
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,040
But if I want a sugary sweet dinner, everybody like turns their nose up at it, right?

209
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah, I want a sugary sweet casserole for dinner

210
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:54,480
Throw up everyone. It's 2021 big dog run. I'm making a sweet casserole get in or get out of the way

211
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,680
Yeah

212
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,600
So don't get out of the way. I'm gonna hit you with my car

213
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,600
Yeah

214
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,840
And I'm gonna back up and do it again

215
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:12,520
Because you got in my way on my way to a sugary sweet casserole dinner and I'll fucking kill you

216
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,520
You with this car you try to say he can't have sweet dinner. Okay. I'll kill you with all right

217
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Yes, we get it and I'll bankrupt your family

218
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
Just just because you said don't put don't eat a caramel apple with that chicken

219
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,840
Popeye and I'll try your family stationery store that's been in your family for 200 years

220
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,360
I'll think I'll murder you and I'll fuck you and then I'll buy it and I'll turn it into a store

221
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,200
The only so sweet casseroles. Yeah

222
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,640
Get him. Oh, they're in the car. Oh, they got on board. Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't shit is embarrassing

223
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,040
Hey, do you wanna do you want some wisdom of the crowd? Yeah, please

224
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,720
I saw I saw a bunch of people on Twitter suggest wisdom of the cloud, which I like quite a bit. Oh

225
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,920
I

226
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,080
Maybe maybe that's a good name for it. But you know, I'm in no hurry to

227
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,240
You know solidify this segment

228
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,280
Maybe we should just call it wiki how or wiki. Why not?

229
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Because you wiki how?

230
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,200
Yow wiki out because this is another one of those Dylan sent this in sticky

231
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
sticky wiki

232
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,760
Sticky. Oh, I thought you were saying stick you were describing Dylan as sticky Dylan

233
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,720
Sticky but listen, this is sticky Dylan and the article is how to be cat-like and

234
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,240
Whether you need to learn to act like a cat for an acting role

235
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,840
Which is a very limited a very narrow window

236
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,720
I would say I believe there's literally one show that that applies to or if you're gonna be like cat woman

237
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,120
But even she doesn't I don't think like cleaner

238
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,160
Butthole or anything like that, but or you just admire feline behavior

239
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,080
There's several ways you can imitate cats each cat's different, but many of them share different behaviors

240
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,440
Unlike dogs cats can be equally finicky and standoffish as they are affectionate and cuddly

241
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,080
Alright, how are you dogs? Have like dogs have deep inner lives. I won't stand for this

242
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,600
Okay, so doing method one doing cat activities sleep a lot and take cat naps

243
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,760
Yep, do yoga to stretch do yoga to stretch your muscles out so far you are describing

244
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:27,520
People stuff. Yeah, nice try though clean yours clean yourself often at least okay at least once a day

245
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Yep

246
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,560
Spend time playing outside like a cat or also

247
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,720
Like a person my cat doesn't go outside. Yep

248
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,820
That's also another thing communicating like a cat use body language to communicate your feelings instead of simply your words like people do it

249
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,700
Experiment with the tone of your voice now. We're talking now. We're getting into it. Yeah, I could definitely hiss more

250
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,060
I've been thinking about this lately like the amount of hissing I do is not nearly as high as it could be

251
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,740
Yeah

252
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,660
If you want to be able to talk there's a sub point if you want to be able to talk with cats

253
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,000
Mimic their meows and sounds the best you can listen to how they talk and mimic them, huh? Are we talking now?

254
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
Are we talking now?

255
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,620
This took a strong turn. I would say

256
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,740
Talking an upbeat tone when you're happy and content and incorporate a growl into your voice when you're mad

257
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,660
I've never tried that before. I'm gonna try that before me try. I

258
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,860
loved this jet ski I

259
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,340
Hate this jet ski. Yeah, I think I've talked like that. I think I've have you guys heard me talk like that before

260
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,580
Well, I've never I've never heard you hate a jet ski before

261
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
You're

262
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:52,340
Hey, this one's appropriate I have a signature scent so juice you didn't even know that you're gone that kitty cat life in a major way

263
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,980
Yeah with my signature scent

264
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
It sent directly

265
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,460
But I mean come in between signature sense right now, but this is the time to talk. No. No, I imagine we'll need that

266
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,140
I'm all friend to interesting interesting response

267
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:18,160
Lot of people said I I don't want it to ever happen again loved it loved

268
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,300
Loved it. Never again. Hey Justin

269
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:26,900
Welcome so much to a very exclusive club that I like to call what it's like making jokes when you're Travis

270
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,460
Hello, come on in. Come on in one person. Yeah. No. Oh, it's too late. Look at that. You're already in here

271
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,220
Oh my god, it was built around me. You've constructed it around my prison. I'd trade that for

272
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,460
fucking

273
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,300
Seven years later eat a banana again, idiot

274
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,660
So, um, I went back and treated myself to the video of you eating the banana and Griffin

275
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,820
I do I do want to point out one thing. Yes that the crunch is extremely loud

276
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,060
Yeah

277
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,640
It's pretty loud in the chance that you want to repel someone make a point to cook with garlic and onions or handle other foul smelling

278
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,120
Materials and don't wash them off. That's cool. Well on the other hand cats are not cooking with garlic and onions

279
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,820
No, but they do I guess put a bad stink on them to scare bad cats away

280
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:14,500
But regardless guess what else you're gonna do you're gonna scare good cats away with your bad smell. Yeah

281
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Hey, this one's wild now. We're getting into it. Now. We're getting into actionable cat

282
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,860
activities cats

283
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,740
Blink slowly to show you like someone reels. It says here real fucking slow make

284
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,500
Your make your eyelids make a noise when they goosh against the bottom. Eyelid make it

285
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,500
Make a make those eyelids clap baby, and then they will know. Oh wow

286
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,820
Is something wrong with your eyes or do you like me a whole lot new?

287
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:53,060
TikTok challenge film yourself doing this with your significant other and see how they react to it because I think they're gonna really love it

288
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,580
Yeah, they're gonna definitely give the you're into them

289
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,580
Yeah, well it does say here some people may not recognize this behavior

290
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:05,540
And it may look more like glaring considering consider batting your eyes slowly instead to be less intimidating

291
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,820
That's not anything

292
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
Swat someone who's irritating you

293
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:17,180
Swat someone who is irritating you to warn them okay hit him. Yeah, this one just says hit him a warning

294
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,620
Swat doesn't have to be hard Travis just and sharp enough to get someone's attention, but hey, what was that?

295
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,780
I punched you not very hard though. Yep. That's your words

296
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,220
If a cat if a real fight does break out cats will bite and scratch their opponents just be cautious and consider the

297
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,540
Consequences of using these methods in a real fight with someone hey this escalated pretty fucking quickly

298
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:43,340
I would say wikiHow and I would say I would say someone who follows this and then accidentally

299
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,580
You know beats the shit out of somebody and goes to court and the judge is like

300
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,540
What are you doing? Why are you blinking so slow at me?

301
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,980
You'd be like no wikiHow told me that this is how I was supposed to work people off

302
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,900
You know how I have a bad smell that was supposed to do the job, but fucking Derek kept coming around

303
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:04,300
So it's hard because you're so deep at that point. You're already kitty cat at that point

304
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,220
Yeah, you're gonna have to read a wikiHow about how to act like a human. Yep

305
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,740
Okay, so here's behaving like a cat around other people stay alert and aware of your surroundings

306
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, yeah reacting erratically and jumping at things that startle you is another way. You can imitate cats

307
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,900
That's sure be shy around people. You don't know but warm and welcoming once you've met. Yeah

308
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:30,260
Just sort of standard operating procedure or ignore people then request attention when you want it so

309
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,300
Now it's just being shitty human. Now it's just being shitty about cats. Yeah, basically anywhere in this article

310
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,380
Does it say bury your poop in some sand?

311
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,260
No, it says bring people presents

312
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,180
well

313
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,260
You can consider uh cats also hunt and leave their kill to provide food to their owners

314
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,740
You can take care of the people you like by feeding them such as cooking them full meals or sharing part of your lunch

315
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:59,800
Okay, now I am pot committed at this point. I am going to kill a bird and give it to my wife

316
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,700
Because that's what I need to do in addition to gently head butting and nuzzling the people I like

317
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,520
Hmm. I think at this point once you're gently head butting and nuzzling people you like while blinking at them slowly

318
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,620
You've passed the point of denying the fact that yeah, I am pretending to be a cat

319
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
Last one is be mischievous. Oh

320
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,120
Oh too late, yeah, that's good make little messes by knocking things off counters

321
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,280
Sit on people when they're trying to work on something or be nosy. He's gotten so straight like you have just

322
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,640
Absolutely overshot your goals. I feel like this. Yeah

323
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
This is the last thing wiki how leaves you with this be obnoxious

324
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,520
If someone asks you to stop don't respect their space and don't dial back the cat mimicking don't talk no matter what?

325
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,160
Because if you dial back the cat mimicking, what are you doing? Yeah, you know what I mean? Like what are you even doing?

326
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:53,040
You're never gonna get cast at that point. You know what I mean? You never because you are this is for the role. Don't forget

327
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,320
You got to be scramble shanks. You need to be scramble shanks. You were born for this. You're born for this role

328
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,920
Here's some questions. I have a cat collar that I made myself and sometimes I wear it

329
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,680
Is that too cat-like? Not at all. You could even go to the extreme and get a real cat collar

330
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,280
Just make sure you can get it off now. Hold on though, because I would argue it is not very cat-like in that

331
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,160
Cats are not out there making collars for themselves. Yeah, if we're going by like the letter of terminology

332
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,120
I think that is very human pretending to be cat-like

333
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,160
But I sure I have owned several cats in my life

334
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,800
Not a single one of them was like begging me for a collar if anything quite the opposite and this is this is maybe the toughest

335
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,280
One how do I know when to stop acting like a cat and begin acting like a human people keep calling me weird

336
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,840
My cousin says that taking naps is for toddlers. Well, that's not true. Hey, that's wrong. Yeah, that's incorrect

337
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,080
I'm 37. Let me tell you taking naps is for winters my man

338
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,800
If I get to take a nap it is to me the sweetest it's it that is truly good for me like happy hour

339
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,200
You know, let's not let's not our let's not focus on that. Let's focus on

340
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,280
Yes, you've been undercover for so long. Yeah. Yeah that you will cross a threshold where

341
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,080
It's no it's more normal for you to be a kitty cat than a human and at that point like you can't

342
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,520
There's an event horizon that once you cross it. You're a cat now

343
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,840
Do you know what I mean? And not a not a person and you would need to find a wiki

344
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,680
How article that would need to reverse the spell and that I don't think they have that one

345
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,480
I'll tell you here's the number one problem. I have with the suzuki how article nowhere in here

346
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,600
Like it should be probably near the beginning is like sit your family and friends down

347
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Tell them you've made a big choice

348
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,720
And you're going to start acting like a cat right because otherwise it seems like throughout here

349
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
There's just kind of a growing

350
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,280
underlying concern

351
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,440
From people around you as it's like has he been cursed by a wizard? You need it. You need a clean break, right?

352
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,840
Where it's like tomorrow. I'm cat, right?

353
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,080
Right, so that way tomorrow. I'm cat tomorrow on

354
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,520
I'm cat so that way everyone's on the same page and they're not worried that you're cursed

355
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,320
Right because if I saw I'm thinking we're in a shaggy dog situation, right?

356
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm seeing griffin act more and more like a cat. I think oh, he's ignored his family

357
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,600
And he's learning a lesson somewhere out there. There's a cat with griffin in it

358
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,160
And here is a cat in griffin and right learning a lot like a lesson about I don't know how to not sit on

359
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:35,160
People's laptops or whatever, right and I need to rescue griffin and bring him back to his family

360
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
And maybe stop a wizard

361
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,240
You know, so you all remember that kid in your class that whenever the teacher was giving you an assignment

362
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,040
They would like raise their hand and ask a question that they knew the answer to

363
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:54,360
Just to like get on their radar like oh and miss trambles. Is this do you want mla citation on this?

364
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,880
Oh, yes, derrick, of course. Thank you. Yes, please use mla citation. Thank you, derrick

365
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,120
That's what the energy that this uh, this person asks. I own a cat. Do you think observing him will help me fuck off?

366
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,560
Come on, fuck off. Well, who's gonna be like no, no, it's not looking at a cat

367
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,960
No, no, it's not looking at a cat and studying how it moves and then trying to act like that will not help you

368
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,160
Act like a cat after seeing how it moves. Come on grow up

369
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
You're not bringing anything to this

370
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
Would you guys like being cats?

00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880

Yeah stitch fix comes with clothes that you can lick if you want to I wouldn't recommend it

400
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,980
But there's nothing stopping you because what are you gonna do ray bradberry and you guys seem to laugh at that last time

401
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:07,340
Oh, i'm going to lick all the clothes griffin. Thank you so much for asking

So here's how it works

406
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:26,060

436
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,320
Bottleneck, um, this is only a canadian promotion

Okay, okay

438
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:09,340
I am shuddering with heinz when heinz gets in the scene heinz gets so fucking nasty. They make their presence

439
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,140
Yeah

440
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:17,100
Sometimes they skin and shear it so I can't wait to see what they've done now being stuck and exhausting and never-ending traffic

441
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,100
Heinz is a

442
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,060
Really amazing brand by the way. I've been watching foods that build america. Do you ever see this one?

450
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,100
Heinz will be identifying those stuck in traffic

451
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:04,700
Driving at the same speed as it's slow pouring ketchup, which is zero point zero four five

452
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:11,580
kilometers per hour and satisfying their taste buds with heinz ketchup and impossible whopper from burger king

453
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,780
Let's say that say that one that last one again

454
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,580
They're going to be satisfying their taste buds with heinz ketchup and an impossible whopper from burger king

455
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:26,860
80% of canadians say they will travel in 2021 and I would love to chill with that remaining 20 real quick

456
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,860
No, no, no, I have my year mapped out and I will be a saying but

457
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,100
Uh, but most won't across international borders

458
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,540
Summer traffic is expected to be worse than usual this year, which is why heinz is turning traffic

459
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,140
into

460
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,140
a good thing

461
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,740
So wait

462
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,100
The idea is if you're in traffic and you're moving slowly

463
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,540
Heinz has a way to identify that

464
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,140
from june 3rd to july 4th

465
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,340
Those stuck in traffic who are driving as slow as heinz ketchup

466
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,980
Will be served traffic activated ads in the ways app

467
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:15,820
What and select slow moving canadians will be provided with this tasty summer combo of heinz ketchup?

468
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:23,180
Okay, what the fuck and an impossible whopper for burger king how this is going to this is going to

469
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,580
Destroy the canadian infrastructure as we know it because if people know this

470
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,380
people are going to start

471
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,540
collaborating like you're driving slow and then it's like

472
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,780
You'll be driving slow, but not slow enough as ketchup

473
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,020
Up and you'll you know what I mean? And then it's like guys slow it down just a little bit

474
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,260
We almost got the ketchup guys

475
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,460
It the they have a mock-up

476
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,660
Of what this would look like

477
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,500
And it's just a car with you know, and the ways app is there

478
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,260
And it just says at the top we are giving you free ketchup for driving as slow as ketchup

479
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,980
Which I guess is how it'll

480
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,540
Really go surprisingly. This is a quote

481
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,560
So surprisingly many people don't know that heinz pours out of our glass bottle at

482
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,120
0.045 kilometers per hour. That's a surprise to this

483
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,040
You don't know that

484
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,040
A lot of people don't know that

485
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,400
Oh

486
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,800
With more canadians potentially on the road this summer

487
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,600
Whether within their own cities or for weekend getaways traffic is going to be a pain point that we all need to get used to again

488
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,720
We want to help our fans see that going slow isn't always a bad thing

489
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:45,680
And reward them with the delicious iconically slow pouring heinz ketchup for those terrible traffic jams

490
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,240
Huh says daniel gotlib associate director of brand building and innovation at craft heinz canada

491
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,120
These are the same maniacs by the way that made pumpkin spice craft dinner

492
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,280
So I think this whole company needs to reevaluate what's going on up there up north

493
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Uh, okay. So there are two

494
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,080
Very strong feelings. I need to finish the quote. Okay, please we are thrilled

495
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
Thrilled to team up with ways

496
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:18,320
And also burger king to bring canadians and the meal synonymous with summer and after sitting in weekend traffic

497
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,680
We know there's nothing more satisfying than a delicious burger with heinz ketchup

498
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Now, why is it an impossible?

499
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,680
Whopper question. I don't know that

500
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,200
That's so here are the two overwhelming feelings i'm having one

501
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,480
Okay is very much like you know people talk about has technology gone too far

502
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,040
and the idea that

503
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,960
My phone can communicate the information not just of like where I am or what's happening

504
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,640
I'm used to that but also that i'm going as slow as ketchup

505
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,480
And someone like hey travis is going as slow as ketchup send him that ad that feels like too much but more than that

506
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,880
Mm-hmm. It sounds like

507
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,440
Kraft Heinz canada

508
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:08,400
Has put a lot of work and capital into this and i'm not a hundred percent sure that they've thought about

509
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,720
the return on investment

510
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,400
of this

511
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,480
This is what I actually think is I think this is my theory on it, right?

512
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,320
I think that hides was like guys. We have a really fucking good idea

513
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,800
Yeah, but if we tell you you have to promise not to cut us out of it

514
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,320
Because we are not essential to it at all

515
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,520
But please it's such a good idea, but you got to promise not to steal it and kick us out of it

516
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,000
Just do it together. Okay, because it's really good

517
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,960
Yeah, I guess the speed of ketchup thing is kind of the hook on the hole. Yeah, but so they

518
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,480
They needed the iconography of ketchup they needed

519
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,720
I wish someone had just been you win with ketchup

520
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,600
Because that's what they've said that every time it's like you win ketchup and I guess a burger if you want that

521
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,280
But you win ketchup

522
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,120
Just go to the drive-thru at canadian burger and they'll give you ketchup, which is already free at burger king

523
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,840
I don't pay just open your pocket and goosh it to the top baby. You don't pay extra for the ketchup packets

524
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,480
It's not there's no deal being made here. Well, that's how that's why it's so hard for the heinz company right now

525
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,000
Think about it. Travis. They've set up an expectation that their shit's always free and you don't it has no value

526
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,800
They should do it

527
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,240
The other this should be a punishment if you get clocked going as slow as ketchup

528
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,880
From now on you have to pay when you go to burger king and you want ketchup now, it's incentive to not have traffic jams

529
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,840
can we just like I just like

530
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
heinz canada

531
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,060
is

532
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,120
Absolutely unhinged. Yeah, I just want to go we're just gonna go

533
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,640
You know what? I got a couple more that I just found for the past. Is that okay?

534
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,400
Well, you guys take me on a journey after searching through decades worth of old posts on forgotten blogs and scouring old tweets and forums

535
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,480
Heinz is releasing three news. This is from march 15th

536
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,840
Releasing three new sauce creations inspired by canadians heinz tart shop

537
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,680
Wow

538
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,040
wasabioli

539
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
and hansch

540
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
hansch

541
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,280
Say all that shit

542
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,020
I'm gonna say it one more time heinz. Tart. Chip tart. Chip was wasabioli

543
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,700
And hansch hansch hansch

544
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Hanch bothers me

545
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,120
Hanz hanz. This is my new boyfriend hanz. This is hanz

546
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,340
Hanz this is my other boyfriend wasabioli

547
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:45,200
I can't eat. There's too much hansch on hansch is your new daddy. I'll put it in slack. You guys want to see I got

548
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,920
hansch

549
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,480
We're over here having a good time with hansch while like my boy clowning over here tart

550
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,760
Chip is also pretty deep in the set tart. Chip is a mixture. Okay

551
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,360
Hey tart. Chip is a mix of tartar sauce and heinz ketchup

552
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,940
Was shared in a decade old late night tweet by condiment mastermind arianne from toronto

553
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,720
Emma from toronto turned an online wedding forum to remove wasabi and garlic aioli stain on her mother's vintage dress

554
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:28,560
Unknowingly releasing the recipe for wasabioli right four years ago while looking to subreddit to spice up his pizza order

555
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
deep from vancouver

556
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,740
Suspectingly shared hansch, okay, which is a combination of hot sauce and ranch. Okay, but here's the thing

557
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,740
Okay, I

558
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,900
Love a portmanteau, but if you look at tartar. Yeah, look at tartar right?

559
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,700
It's the tar of tartar sauce and the chop of ketchup you look at wasabioli

560
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,260
Oh, yeah, that that's a lot of wasabi in there and some oli in there. There's a lot

561
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,460
There's only like one letter cut off of each hansch

562
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:02,420
They took the h off of hot sauce maconte and the rest is all ranch

563
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,780
Yeah, it's not it's not fair ranch is most of the sauce i'd bet too in hand

564
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:12,900
Yeah, and you wouldn't you would look at that. I'm like i'm gonna guess ranch and hands

565
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,060
It's ham ranch, I could be anything I don't know it could be hoisin ranch

566
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,300
It's

567
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:27,060
I hate it. You you can shit all over them and they're big ideas

568
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,020
But I would love to hear how you would mash these two bad boys up

569
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,420
Hot hot hot hot

570
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,980
Here's the ad I got ad for this when this happened

571
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,740
millions of people post online every day

572
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,180
And some of them post about sauce

573
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,820
But little do they know heinz ketchup is watching

574
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,620
We dug deep across the entire internet to find your old posts

575
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,900
And we turned them into condiments

576
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,500
Introducing three new sauces sourced from the most random corners of the internet

577
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,220
heinz crowd-sourced

578
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:12,900
Hatch from the 12th post in an archived sub thread of people arguing about pizza

579
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:18,820
Quasabioli discovered on the advice page of a wedding fashion forum

580
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,940
And tartar posted on social media over 10 years ago

581
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,380
Then we shared the sauces with the actual people who unintentionally created them

582
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,180
Now you can try them too

583
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,020
Careful what you post big ketchup is watching

584
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,600
Like what is what are you trying to establish about your brand?

585
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,200
Yeah

586
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,600
They're clocking your shit 24 7 because yet just a couple months later

587
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,920
You revealed to me that they're watching the speed at which i'm driving and offering me free plant hamburgers in exchange

588
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,080
Yeah

589
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,080
I love this company

590
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,680
They're good. They're they this is one of those rare cases. We're like, yeah

591
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,400
Go ahead and invade this shit out of my privacy you have I will give you access

592
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,920
I trust I will give you access to my my children's birth certificates if you keep cranking out the hits like this

593
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,920
hansch

594
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:19,480
They need to change their name from heinz to hansch today. And if they this is the new company what is called hansch

595
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,600
Their their uh

596
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:29,480
Their last one that they did was they asked people to draw ketchup and then they turned what they drew into custom ketchup bottles

597
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:36,840
I'm telling you can't heinz canada's is is all over it. They've got things. Okay, I think i'd go with

598
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,080
hot saunch

599
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,080
Oh hot

600
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,960
Yes, that would explain your lack of

601
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,120
Contributions i've been working really hard to think about it. Let me give you a twist on that travis

602
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,520
I'm gonna just twist it a little bit hansch. Okay

603
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,480
Did they pay the people that they stole these ideas from?

604
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,480
Definitely not

605
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,160
100 now they pay they get they made their dreams a reality that's a payment right this payment greater than money if you think about

606
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,240
It I wish nerf would come out and be like

607
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,520
As we all know nerf bullets leave the guns at 95 miles an hour

608
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,480
So get out there and if we see that you're driving 95 miles an hour, baby

609
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,640
We're gonna send you some nerf and then just see how how long it takes

610
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:25,480
Um, how about another question, how would that be would you guys like that? Yeah, please

611
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,400
Sounds good

612
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,960
I was recently invited to my friend's surprise birthday party

613
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,480
Okay, the only caveat is that the party files falls on my birthday

614
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,800
I also found his actual birthday is a few days before the surprise party is I really want to celebrate my friend's birthday

615
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,800
But I also don't want to miss my own birthday

616
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,480
I'm afraid to say anything to them for fear of taking the celebration away from my friend

617
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,360
And should I just lay low and ignore my own birthday?

618
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,920
Almost no one at this thing would know it was my birthday too. So it may be possible

619
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,280
That's from befuddled birthday boy in chicago and that that seems like a surface level question

620
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:04,920
But as I kept trying to form sentences to curtly respond to it, I actually wasn't coming up with a lot

621
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,640
It's actually kind of challenging. I I tell you the one thing hearing you say it out loud

622
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,240
One of the things that jumped out at me was uh the word almost

623
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:18,600
Because what that implies is this is not a perfect secret because if you went to this party there is a chance

624
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,240
That someone would say hey

625
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,800
Isn't it your birthday, too?

626
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,320
Oh

627
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,840
Yeah

628
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,960
Oh, man, okay, you're gonna need a collaborator. That's what i'm saying. This is why i'm saying it

629
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,240
This is why it's so tough because someone could very well be like wait

630
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,200
Is it your birthday and that's going to be an absolute mood? Yeah now that's because oh now you made it about you

631
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,880
You need a co-conspirator though who is going to be in this room

632
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,680
Who can look out the window and when they see you coming not the birthday party, you know person who's having the party

633
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,840
They say oh, oh here they come here

634
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,080
They come and then everybody hides and turns the lights off and then the door opens and it's you

635
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,640
And everyone hops out and says surprise

636
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,760
Oh, it's just michael or whatever your name is and then you'll be like, yeah, it's it is my birthday

637
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:16,840
Okay, and now and now it's their fucking problem because now they're gonna have to take your birthday party away from you

638
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,240
They just gave it to you

639
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:24,200
They've just christened it your birthday party and now they are going to have to explain to you

640
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:31,880
I'm, so sorry. We're actually celebrating another person's birthday who it's not really their birthdays three days before and not yours

641
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:38,760
Fuck you get out of here. Yeah. Sorry. I yeah, I the thing is is i'm assuming you're an adult

642
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,520
Um, and that this isn't like at least 18 or older

643
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:47,560
And I would say that point birthday has much more become like an excuse to do something

644
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:55,080
Incorrect, not that age at 25 25. Okay, if you are 25 or older and you're asking this question

645
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,320
I think you just dropped the knowledge because

646
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,200
The fact of matter is and i'm sorry to be the one to reveal this it will not change

647
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:06,760
The event at all, right except that people will say happy birthday to you

648
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,360
And that's really all you want at that point. Probably no one's going to bring gifts

649
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,760
Yeah, but if you say it beforehand

650
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,520
People are going to wonder why you're saying it like why are you saying?

651
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,320
Oh, well that to go back to griffin saying you do need a plant

652
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,720
You need to tell somebody who's going to tell the organizers like did you know that's also michael if that is your name?

653
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,680
It's also michael's birthday, right? I'm sorry to get that stuck in everyone. So yeah, you've done it not michael

654
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But now that's folded in

655
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,080
You can't do it. Oh, let's be clear. You can't be like you can't oh derek

656
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,400
If the other person's name is derek is having a birthday party. Oh, it's my birthday, too. Yeah. No, that's oh

657
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,960
I can't do that, but you could have steven if the other person's name is steven say

658
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:56,440
Hey, oh derek's having assuming it's derek is having a party. Well, it's michael assuming it's michael's birthday, too

659
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,760
Right. Let's just make it one big thing

660
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:02,920
Right now that's all fine. That's all fine and dandy

661
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:07,160
But if susan just assuming you have a friend named susan finds out that you told

662
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:13,080
Dare or you told steven wait, don't let's just not let's just drop the names. Okay if a

663
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,240
A finds out that b told c to tell d that it was their birthday because of e

664
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,560
then

665
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,840
uh

666
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,280
I'm lost. Um this

667
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:30,040
No matter what the situation's going to end with nobody ever throwing a birthday present for any birthday party for anybody else in this group

668
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:35,400
Ever again, so just be careful because birthday parties are great. Uh, I love all the cake and games

669
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,560
Cakes and games are great

670
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:43,240
Yeah, but what you don't want to do is get there and then someone finds out your birthday and they hastily like scroll your name

671
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,600
Onto the cake. Yeah, I try to fill it. Yeah, they put a post it

672
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,960
Under the sign. Happy birthday to derek and michael, huh?

673
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,880
Well, that was either moment too if you're gonna reveal it on your own

674
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,440
and me

675
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,260
And also me why didn't you remember as you're holding up your driver's license?

676
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:08,460
For real though and also even more because it's today

677
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,900
Three days ago and I put it on facebook that today was my birthday and none of you fuckers

678
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,580
