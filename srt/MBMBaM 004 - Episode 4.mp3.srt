1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you change your mind on the first in line Honey, I'm still free, take a chance on me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around If you got no place to go when you're feeling down

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown in Jason Derulo, take a chance on me

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

10
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

11
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

12
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

13
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

15
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If you need me, let me know, I'm gonna be around

16
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I made her mine, a bounty of flesh

17
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I will poke holes in the top

18
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll put a twig in there, some leaves, don't even worry about it

19
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
As far as the signs you're looking for

20
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Sugar water

21
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who is the founder of acting?

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I would really like to know who is the founder of acting

23
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I would really like to know who is the founder of acting

24
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:56,000
A poet named Thespis in 534 BC became the first person to play a part on stage.

25
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Jim Barney revolutionized it though. He perfected it.

26
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like how the Chinese may have invented fireworks, but I guess the Chinese perfected fireworks too.

27
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We perfected blowing our hands off.

28
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This one also comes from FormSpring. Hey guys, just wondering what the word cute means. I hear women use the word in conversation all the time and I am more and more confused about its true meaning given its multitude of uses.

29
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It means chubby. Sorry son.

30
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Chubby, but you got a great personality on you.

31
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Just substitute cute with non-threatening and that's exactly what it means. He's so cute means he's so non-threatening.

32
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And by non-threatening it means you don't know what she means when she says cute. That's non-threatening for you.

33
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's the definition of non-threatening. Hey, I got a little piece of advice for you, Prom King.

34
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Next time you're around someone who says cute, flip a table. Just flip a table. See if they keep calling you cute.

35
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Was that adorable? Was that so so cute? And then just make love to them right there.

36
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They will not fight.

37
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Flip the table back over. And if they do fight, just make them yours.

38
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They won't do you. They're your property.

39
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So Adam has a problem. Adam wrote to us from Gmail. He says, my friend doesn't seem to fully grasp the point of the Would You Rather game.

40
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He poses questions such as, would you rather be able to leap over tall buildings or have the ability to hear babies crying anywhere?

41
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:54,000
OK, let me just take a tea right here. A big tea sack right here and say, that's a terrible power. Anywhere a newborn is distressed.

42
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you know what your days would be like? Just constantly from dusk till dawn, wake up to slumber.

43
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Not ever sleep. Sound of millions of babies crying.

44
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Keep reading the question because I like the second one better.

45
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Or would you rather be on fire or not be on fire?

46
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want to read this guy. How can I teach him the proper way to play or is he a lost cause?

47
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Adam, I think, man, I think you got to jettison that one into the sun.

48
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah, maybe he's just not allowed to play that game anymore. Maybe not that game.

49
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Maybe another one. Maybe he's really good at checkers. Be able to breathe underwater or have Lyme disease.

50
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Would you rather win the lottery or be raped by a gorilla?

51
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Would you rather find a crisp, clean one hundred dollar bill or watch an elderly loved one be pushed on a flight of stairs?

52
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It is up to you. The choice, my friend, is yours. One for the ages, a puzzler for ages.

53
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Would you rather have a credit card that you never had to pay back?

54
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
OK, sounds good so far. Or no teeth or no teeth.

55
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, can I have both or just just the one one or the other or the other?

56
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I guess I could get those those middle teeth like the guy from James Bond.

57
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There you go. I can't I can't decide. I can't decide.

58
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a toughie. This this one comes from Socrates via Gmail.

59
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He says, So I was planning on getting a tattoo on my shoulder, but I'm starting to notice that everyone has one there.

60
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I have this thing about trying to be unique. So could you tell me another spot I could get inked?

61
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I have one on my right elbow if that matters.

62
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Your sack. Travis says sack. Travis has a good sack.

63
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But Travis Travis is Travis has attacked. I was going to make a joke.

64
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
None of us have tattoos on our shoulders, but you've got no I have a tattoo on my shoulder blade.

65
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't have one on like my actual shoulder. I have one on my scapula.

66
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thanks, Bones. But not on my actual like shoulder.

67
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you just thank your bones? No, I think the show the show bones.

68
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, you're not going to turn another Mamba Bam. You're not going to turn another Mamba into a Bones fan cast.

69
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's fair. Borey honest circle jerk. I don't know.

70
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He's so dreamy. But I actually have four right now. Justin, you got two. Griffin, you got one.

71
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mm hmm. As far as placement goes, dude, everyone's got tattoos everywhere.

72
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You want to be original. Don't get one. Yeah, you're not going to come up with a place like, well, what's original inside the lip.

73
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, everyone's got that behind your ear. Everyone's got that back your neck. Everyone's got that.

74
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Go eyelid. Get with that. That girl in Indiana Jones. Oh, yeah.

75
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Has that written on our eyelids. Do that. I don't think that's I don't think that's a tattoo, though.

76
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Culturally. Oh, shit. It's not a tattoo, Griffin. It seemed like kind of a she had a crush on her teacher.

77
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And so she wrote it. Oh, is that fine? You know, I thought you had to start listening to the band tattoo.

78
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, I always wanted to get a a tattoo of tattoo from Fantasy Island.

79
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And yeah, lifting up his shirt and he would have a tattoo of the band tattoo.

80
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So there you go. Get that. Get that. Well, I'll give you one hundred dollars.

81
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's I'll give you one hundred dollars. I think we could probably get you a guest spot on the show if you if you get a tattoo tattoo tattoo.

82
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have I've had several people ask about guest spots doing a guest spot on the show, and I don't think they understand the premise of the show.

83
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
My brother, my brother and me and Dave Coulier.

84
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My brother, my brother and me and the cast of Hairspray.

85
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I know. Well, just just three of us actually. It's kind of a thing that we do.

86
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's the deal. Also, what this show needs more of is over talk.

87
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think I think we could all use for a little bit more. Everyone talking at once.

88
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This next question comes from Evan versus Gmail.

89
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You guys remember when Evan fought Gmail, that one thought was totally awesome.

90
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Evan says, I, like many, belong to a group of friends. One of the friends in this group found a guy and started dating him.

91
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They're currently living together. No one else in the group likes this guy, but now he's always around wherever whenever she is.

92
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And he doesn't have any other friends either. So we're expected to spend his birthday with him.

93
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The group has asked me specifically to not be mean to him because she is the other friend's boyfriend and we don't want to push her out of the group.

94
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Evan didn't actually ask a question here. Evan just told us that neat little anecdote.

95
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's a great story, Evan. Yeah, I like the part about the birthday.

96
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Do you remember that one scene where he doesn't have any other friends and they're expected to spend his birthday with him?

97
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah, that's pretty good. Evan, Evan, you didn't ask for advice, but let me give you some.

98
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Just be cool. Just be cool, dog. Just be cool, man.

99
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Everyone at some point, I think, has to deal with this, right? Yeah, it'll shake out eventually, though.

100
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Like that seems to be the way. I mean, either he'll realize he's not welcome and peel off or, you know, you guys will get to know him.

101
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But that's a tough... It could be that your group of friends is super tight-knit, right?

102
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And maybe it's not that this guy sucks. It's that you're not willing to let new people in.

103
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Or maybe he's super shy, which just adds to the situation. So I think you should maybe give the guy, you know, a second chance.

104
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Maybe try and get to know him. He's not so bad.

105
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Now, here's the thing. Counterpoint to that. If he's a real douche, like if he's just not interesting, that's one thing.

106
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But if he, like, is being a jerk and, you know, is mean to this friend and you guys, like, specifically actually don't like him, that's another thing.

107
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And that's worthy of you being mean right back. Don't you take his guff.

108
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, no. I'm behind you, Evan. Don't set it off. Don't set it off because that's going to be on you.

109
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's on you, then. And that's my fault. I'm sorry, guys.

110
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yeah, well, you don't have to live with the repercussions. It's okay, T-Bag. You just got a little...

111
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
T-Sack, sorry. T-Sack, you just got a little aggravated. T-Sack out.

112
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We have a strict anti-insta-hating policy, NBNBAM, and I would appreciate it if you'd respect that.

113
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Respect. Open question from Yahoo Answers user DeepThinkingWhatTheFuckGirl.

114
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:50,000
She says, Pol, would you sleep with a Navi if you could? Or Navi, sorry. Navi, one of the blue-skinned peeps from Avatar.

115
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Man, that's tough because who could... I mean, I'm assuming you would be in the world of the Avatar. Who could sleep with all that fucking glowing shit and natural beauty?

116
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Wouldn't you just want to get up and scamper? I wouldn't want to close my eyes.

117
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who could close their eyes? I wouldn't blink. I would just drain... There's a glowing mosquito and it's three feet long. This is so much better than doing it.

118
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Way better than doing it. Why would you waste your time?

119
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's a Navi? A Navi is like the big blue people. The big blue people with the hair.

120
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You didn't see Avatar?

121
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, I didn't see Avatar.

122
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Congratulations. Oh, cool. I'm on the podcast with the two guys left on planet Earth who didn't see Avatar.

123
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I mean, it's not a good movie, so I mean, good on you.

124
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Do you want to know why I didn't see it?

125
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Tell me.

126
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because of shit like this, one of the answers was from a guy named Warriors Pride whose avatar is an avatar or a Navi.

127
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, God. He says, Yes, I would sleep with myself. I sleep with a mirror.

128
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can sleep with me if you want, but my tail does things involuntarily like go towards areas that make humans uncomfortable.

129
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's a Navi thing.

130
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Wait, let's get that last line again.

131
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
My tail does things involuntarily like go towards areas that make humans uncomfortable.

132
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a Navi thing.

133
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a Navi thing. You wouldn't understand.

134
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You wouldn't get it. A Navi understand the science of walnut pleasures.

135
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You wouldn't understand. Get that tail off my walnut.

136
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's the most awkward thing, because I truly believe that that gentleman believes he's answering that question legitimately.

137
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know, he's got like a giant bucket of blue paint and every morning he wakes up and just...

138
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Griffin, your judgment has bothered me. It's a Navi thing, man.

139
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
How could you get it? You couldn't get it?

140
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The reason I didn't see the movie isn't because I'm afraid I'd encounter people like this.

141
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What if I became one?

142
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What if you did?

143
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You mean what if you got to live on a beautiful, beautiful forest planet and got to just fucking swing from trees all day?

144
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Right, but the planet is in my mind because I actually live in butt shit Ohio.

145
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But it would be in my mind. I would be dancing.

146
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I would be, you know, tripping the light fantastic on planet giant blue aliens.

147
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hey, Griffin, did the next line of that answer was it?

148
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, sorry, I got to go. My attractive wife and kids just walked in the room.

149
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is that the next thing?

150
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's actually exactly. Yeah, that's how it ended.

151
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
So here's a question from FormSpring.

152
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's anonymous, as most FormSpring questions are.

153
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What is the best way to approach people who are almost your acquaintances, but not quite?

154
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Like you've talked to them a couple of times, but you barely know their names.

155
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Sadly, most of our relationships with people are like that. OK, good one.

156
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I actually have a trick that I use.

157
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Stand near them until they get upset.

158
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Stand near them, creep your way in.

159
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No, work as a team. Get someone like a good friend or a girlfriend or a boyfriend or whatever.

160
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
And tell that person ahead of time, listen, if I don't introduce you, it's because I've forgotten this person's name.

161
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And introduce yourself like I am being a bad friend, boyfriend, girlfriend to you.

162
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like, well, I'm Susan. What was your name?

163
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And it's like, oh, yeah, sorry.

164
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then you can learn their name again.

165
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't think he's asking or she is asking how how to remember people's names.

166
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think he's just saying he barely knows their names.

167
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He needs to take it to the next step.

168
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I like the idea of a friendship wingman, though.

169
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, it works out really well.

170
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You know what I'm saying?

171
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Like a guy can be like, you can have a conversation with somebody near somebody that you don't know.

172
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But you're friends with your friendship wingman.

173
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And you can talk about something that you know that person's interested in.

174
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And then suddenly the line becomes a triangle.

175
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You know what I'm saying? A friendship triangle.

176
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Find out something that they're interested in.

177
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like you said that you barely know their names.

178
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And that is a huge first step.

179
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you address somebody by their name.

180
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Dale Carnegie says that everyone's favorite sound in the English language is the sound of their own name.

181
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
As a stone fact.

182
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Learn their name. Use it a lot.

183
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
They're going to warm up to you pretty quickly.

184
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And then find out something they're interested in and ask them about it.

185
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you don't know what they're interested in, use the environment that you're in.

186
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If you are at a party, at a show, at a concert, reference what is going on around you.

187
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ask if they're having a good time.

188
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Jeffrey, how did you get to this concert, Jeffrey?

189
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What would you say, Jeffrey?

190
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Jeffrey, what's your favorite Dave Matthews song, Jeffrey?

191
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Jeffrey, how do you enjoy being the butler for the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Jeffrey?

192
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I love Jeffrey Matthews Band.

193
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What did I do, Jeffrey?

194
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I just put that in, Jeffrey.

195
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Jeffrey, I didn't mean to say that, Jeffrey.

196
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then your best friends.

197
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And then your best friends. Just like that.

198
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Say their name a lot and then the first time you meet them say,

199
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hey, nice to meet you, Jeffrey. You want to go to a wine tasting with me, Jeffrey?

200
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Jeffrey, let's look at houses.

201
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Jeffrey, it'll be like that movie Sideways, Jeffrey.

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Jeffrey, let's go to look at open houses, Jeffrey.

203
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I bought us matching sweaters, Jeffrey.

204
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Jeffrey, let's wear these matching sweaters, Jeffrey.

205
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's go for a wine tasting in the country.

206
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Jeffrey, hug me, Jeffrey.

207
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Come to my villa for a weekend, Jeffrey.

208
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Your villa?

209
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No, they rolled the double L's.

210
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come on, Jeffrey.

211
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
My Jeffrey and I recently discovered the website Chatroulette.

212
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Now she's on it for several hours a day.

213
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm worried due to the high percentage of disgusting things and weird people on it.

214
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Is this warranted?

215
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yep, she's looking at dicks.

216
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay, not your dick though, Jeffrey.

217
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Some strange dicks on the internet.

218
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Jeffrey, she's looking at dicks. I'm sorry.

219
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know if you use Chatroulette. It's literally half dick.

220
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can come up with whatever you want.

221
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, that dude's playing the guitar.

222
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh, there's a dick.

223
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Where did that dick come from?

224
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,000
The reason you get on Chatroulette is either to show your prong to strangers

225
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,000
or if you're in a large group of people and you've all had a few drinks

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
and so you're just scanning the internet on Chatroulette

227
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
hoping that you'll see a dick so you can all laugh at it.

228
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You're like, how crazy is this dick?

229
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I didn't want to see that.

230
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Check out that dick. What the fuck?

231
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's so good that we all saw that dick together.

232
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Jeffrey, get over here and look at this dick, Jeffrey.

233
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think the bigger problem is that it's because of anomalies like herself

234
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
that there are guys showing off their wangs on Chatroulette.

235
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Every one out of 20, there's that one girl who's like, ah, dicks.

236
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Also, dude, I want to point out, if your girlfriend's on Chatroulette

237
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
several hours a day, there's some reevaluating needs to go on there

238
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
because that's hours, dude. Hours.

239
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Baby dinners? I made dinner tonight.

240
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm on Chatroulette. Back off.

241
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm looking at waiters.

242
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This red cabbage took me two hours to prepare and season correctly.

243
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This guy's been seasoning his sausage for three minutes now.

244
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Maybe we're late for grandpa Pa's funeral.

245
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm on Chatroulette.

246
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Bang. Bang.

247
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Here's one from Yahoo Answers.

248
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't want any answers from us on it because it's kind of a creepy question,

249
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
but I think the answers are better than the question itself.

250
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The question is, do you know any good songs to have sex to?

251
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Kind of creepy, right?

252
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Here's some of the responses.

253
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's get it on, Marvin Gaye. Sure.

254
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Doin' It by LL Cool J.

255
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay. A little on the nose for me.

256
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
A Thousand Years by Sting.

257
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Not familiar with the track, but if it's by Sting, then...

258
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I bet it's a long...

259
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's a thousand years.

260
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Beat It by Michael Jackson.

261
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

262
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Eminem, Superman.

263
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Well... Okay.

264
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah, why not?

265
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's a little more circumspect.

266
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Nelly, Hot in Here.

267
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Well, okay, now the train's gone off the tracks.

268
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's some weird bedroom activities, if you're listening to Hot in Here.

269
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That song's way too... It's got it too heavy a beat.

270
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
50 Cent, In the Club.

271
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Well... Maybe late till you get home.

272
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.

273
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Anything by Kid Rock, Nickelback, and Aerosmith.

274
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Slow by Jamie Foxx.

275
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Well, okay.

276
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The problem with that is...

277
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Nothin' on the Radio, Gettin' You Home. Why don't we just dance?

278
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I don't know what that means.

279
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is it a lyric?

280
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Ahh...

281
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Why Don't We Get Drunk and Screwed by Jimmy Buffett? Good one.

282
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
No...

283
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
H on our Puffin' Stuff is Yahoo! Entertainment's name.

284
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Son of a Sailor, that's a great one.

285
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Cheeseburger in Paradise?

286
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes.

287
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Anything off Boats.

288
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
His seminal 1981 album, Boats.

289
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm actually...

290
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You gotta pick one song. It's gotta be Amazing Grace, right?

291
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Gotta be Amazing Grace.

292
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But only the first two verses.

293
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We've got an anonymous question from a Form Spring user.

294
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm a software developer at a local semiconductor company.

295
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
The pay and benefits are awesome, but the job isn't challenging.

296
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Should I look for a more interesting job or stay and keep making a lot of money but be really bored?

297
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What are you shitting me?

298
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Where's that money, dawg?

299
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Dude, the pay and benefits are awesome.

300
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Get that money.

301
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Get that money and then you can spend that.

302
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Do you want challenge? Do a Sudoku.

303
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
What's wrong with you?

304
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Have you seen the way the economy is now?

305
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Just keep that money and get it.

306
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Get that money till you're rich.

307
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Yeah, dude.

308
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't make that green.

309
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Do it with one hand tied behind your back.

310
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Also, I just want to throw out right here.

311
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You work with stuff called semiconductors.

312
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's awesome.

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Maybe pay attention. It sounds dangerous.

314
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Swap the answer to gravity field for an EMP pulse generator.

315
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
If I flip the wrong switch, I destroy reality.

316
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
No problem.

317
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Pretty boring.

318
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
We're just trying to recreate the power of a star on Earth.

319
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
We're just trying to find the God element.

320
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's not challenging.

321
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Pass me that Sudoku, Jeffrey.

322
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Did you read today's Dilbert?

323
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh, man.

324
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
God, in this machine, this tube, this supercollider.

325
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
But this Dilbert's really good.

326
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think...

327
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Supercollider or semiconductor?

328
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
A semiconductor is a common part used in a supercollider.

329
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's what shoots the two things that collide into each other.

330
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I took one semester of...

331
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Well, it was geography.

332
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It was my integrated science class.

333
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But you minored in semiconductor, right?

334
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That is true.

335
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
No, sociology. They sound similar.

336
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
That was it. My bad.

337
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But they are not.

338
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
What is the best way to get past the friend zone with a lady friend?

339
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Can't be done.

340
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Gotta move in faster. Not at all.

341
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Once you're in the friend zone, you don't ever get out.

342
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Unless...

343
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Unless...

344
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
You're in the friend zone because they're dating one of your friends.

345
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Mmm.

346
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I'm not condoning that kind of activity.

347
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Unless...

348
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Unless you are.

349
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Unless you feel that call.

350
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
You feel that call of chemistry.

351
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
She'd be better with you than him.

352
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Yeah, he's always in there listening to Jamie Foxx songs.

353
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Are they trying to knock boots?

354
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
You'd play Do It It by LL Cool J, something proper.

355
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Something smooth like Amazing Grace.

356
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You know, it's funny to me. We keep getting questions like,

357
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
how do I move out of the friend zone?

358
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
How do I know when someone actually wants a relationship with me?

359
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
You know the question is, my brother and me doesn't get a lot.

360
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Like, I'm in a relationship with several women.

361
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
How do I terminate one of them and just get some more friends?

362
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I just have women calling me every day, and I am sick of it.

363
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
But my answer to all of these questions is, for some reason,

364
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I don't think there's a secret code.

365
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
And there's body language to look for.

366
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And there's certain combinations of words to look for.

367
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Just ask them.

368
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Just grow a pair and be like, hey, listen, I dig you.

369
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What is this?

370
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
And then don't let that change your friendship.

371
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Or if it does, then you need to make the decision which is more important.

372
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I think this is such a modern thought.

373
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I think you should just, like Travis said, just caveman it up.

374
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Give me date. Be good.

375
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Let's do this.

376
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Because they want it too.

377
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Nobody wants to be friends with a person.

378
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
And I understand the fear that comes from, like, I don't want to push this.

379
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I get it, but here's the thing.

380
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And this is kind of a different way of looking at it.

381
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Maybe it'll help you.

382
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
If you're thinking this way, you're not in the friend zone.

383
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Okay? She is. You're not.

384
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You're not in the friend zone.

385
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
And the reason that you're, like, if you're friends with somebody,

386
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
a lot of times, being friends with somebody of the opposite sex,

387
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
and I know everybody's done this, so they can't act like they can't, they don't,

388
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
but I've been friends with somebody of the opposite sex

389
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
who I think maybe kind of digs me because it makes me feel good about myself.

390
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Everyone's done it.

391
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Please don't think I'm a bad person.

392
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Everybody does it.

393
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And I've been on the receiving end of that too.

394
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If that's not working out for you,

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
if that connection isn't getting it done for you,

396
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,000
you need to just pony up because, like, at this point,

397
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
the point you're at now psychologically,

398
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
you can't worry about losing the friendship because psychologically,

399
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
you already have because you're out of the friend zone.

400
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You are past the friend zone. You're not there anymore.

401
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And the thing is, don't fool yourself into thinking they don't know that you dig them.

402
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Right.

403
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
People are very smart and pick up on stuff like that every day.

404
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They know that you do.

405
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You know, maybe you touch their shoulder a little bit too long

406
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
or you've been complimenting them more than you have in the past,

407
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
but people pick up on that dude.

408
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
So she probably knows that,

409
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and her failure to reciprocate back tells you you're not gonna move out of that.

410
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Or just ask, if it doesn't pan out, bail.

411
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I mean, bail on, not bail on the friendship, bail on worrying about it as a relationship.

412
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Or you will ruin the friendship.

413
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Yeah. Let me call back to an answer we frequently give out to queries like this,

414
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
which is, just get more attractive.

415
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Just be more attractive.

416
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Maybe go do some pull-ups.

417
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Maybe do some pull-ups, work your core.

418
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Just work that core, blast it.

419
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Blast your core out, pump up on some peck juice,

420
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
and then I'm guessing it's gonna be so much easier to get past the friend zone.

421
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's gonna be a lot easier.

422
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's gonna be hard for her to stay in the friend zone when she's in the bone zone.

423
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Am I right, Nellis?

424
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
My man Matt, he writes to us from Gmail.

425
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
He says he's currently looking for a new job.

426
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
What are some excuses he could use to leave his current job early to go on interviews?

427
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If he goes to any more doctor's appointments,

428
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
they're going to think something seriously is wrong with me.

429
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You're all at just appointments.

430
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Yeah.

431
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That's a kind of doctor.

432
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Okay, that's true.

433
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He's panning appointments.

434
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's alright, T-Sach.

435
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
He just got a little really aggressive.

436
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh man, that's a good question.

437
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,000
How many interviews are you going on that are panned out that this is a problem?

438
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You may just want to stick with that job.

439
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Maybe just keep that job.

440
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Maybe you are not suited for other jobs.

441
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let's give him some serious real help because we're three creative types.

442
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We can come up.

443
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm working on something in my mind.

444
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I haven't fully developed it, but it involves psychic powers.

445
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Maybe say you have psychic powers and you sense that there's going to be a horrible catastrophe,

446
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,000
but really sell it so that everyone else actually thinks you could get the whole office to leave.

447
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Then when you come in the next morning, be like, it wasn't today.

448
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
It wasn't yesterday, but it's definitely coming soon.

449
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I feel it in my bones.

450
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
It may be time for lupus.

451
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Maybe time for lupus.

452
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
I don't like to break glass in case of emergency on lupus too often, but maybe time to fake lupus.

453
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He says that, he means that very, very literally because Justin has a vial of lupus that he keeps nearby

454
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
in case he needs to be sick for a long, long time.

455
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I will give you this caution, Matt.

456
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
If any of those businesses or places that you're going to interview for call your current employer for a reference

457
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
or anything like that, you're effed, dude.

458
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yeah.

459
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
House of cards just comes tumbling down.

460
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Yeah.

461
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Watch out for that.

462
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
How would you describe Matt as a worker?

463
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, he was a great worker, but his productivity slowed down pretty significantly when he got that lupus.

464
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What?

465
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
When he got that what?

466
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
What did he say?

468
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The lupus that he has.

469
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
That he definitely, definitely has that no one would lie about.

470
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
He definitely had that lupus.

471
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I saw his wheelchair.

472
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
He's messed up with the lupus.

473
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The doctor's for sure of it.

474
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I definitely have breast cancer.

475
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
They're curing that every day.

476
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Yeah, so maybe don't lie.

477
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Wesley.

478
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
He says, recently my wife and I wanted another dog.

479
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I wanted to adopt an older dog like we had before, but she wanted a puppy, so we got a puppy.

480
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Well, there it is, right?

481
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Now she complains about the work involved with the puppy and complains about the puppy peeing in the house.

482
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Is it appropriate to say, I told you so, or should I remain quiet when she complains?

483
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Oh, dude, that fixes nothing.

484
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Yeah, don't.

485
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Don't play the I told you so game, man.

486
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It fixes nothing.

487
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
They know.

488
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Trust me.

489
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't play that.

490
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, don't do it.

491
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I can't give you a strong enough recommendation.

492
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Don't do that.

493
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I can give you some real world puppy advice.

494
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Travis, professional dog trainer.

495
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You've wandered right, right into his right.

496
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
The question between an older dog and a puppy, there are benefits to both.

497
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The benefit of getting a puppy versus an older dog is it is easier to train on a puppy the way that you want it to be where older dogs,

498
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
any behavior problems or more ingrained and harder to train out.

499
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
And it won't die as quickly.

500
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Older dogs usually come more docile and with less house training problems.

501
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
But a puppy is going to grow out of that in like four months.

502
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It's not going to be a problem anymore.

503
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And now you have this puppy that you can train to be the kind of dog you want fresh, easier.

504
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You know, I'm just full of vitality and life.

505
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You know, my problem with old dogs is not Martin Lawrence.

506
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I really thought his character was underdeveloped.

507
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
No, that's wild hogs, you liar.

508
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
What you're thinking of the wrong old hogs.

509
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Wait, wild hogs.

510
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
What is it?

511
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I did. I choked.

512
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You're right.

513
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Old dogs is a.

514
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Old dogs is Robin Williams.

515
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Robin Williams and so Scientologist named his son.

516
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He named his son after an airplane.

517
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
By extension, it did not have Martin Lawrence.

518
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Yes.

519
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
No, that's true.

520
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
What Justin said was completely accurate.

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
OK.

522
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Also, I'm sorry for making fun of Jethro Volta.

523
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
He's passed and that was that was beneath me.

524
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,000
That's true.

525
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So Andrew from Gmail asks.

526
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
You're going to read questions?

527
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
And now he.

528
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Yeah, I know. It's weird, right?

529
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What are some ways to help build motivation for things like studying and working on personal projects?

530
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I didn't like that.

531
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
I wish you would do that in the future.

532
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Damn it.

533
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
I wish you would leave it to me and Justin.

534
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I just I got caught up in the moment.

535
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Right, right.

536
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I get it.

537
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I get how it happens.

538
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
It's just immediately uncomfortable.

539
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That was my bad.

540
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Listen, that's all on TSAC.

541
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's how TSAC does, though.

542
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That's how I roll.

543
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You know what, Andrew?

544
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Go take a shower.

545
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Oh, yeah.

546
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Go take a shower.

547
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I've been I've been making myself shower.

548
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm actually 13 minutes past two for my shower.

549
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I've been doing my noon shower and like I'll work and I'll write a bit in the morning and then like I'll feel my energy start to start to be sapped from me by some unseen force and I'll just go hop in the shower and then I get it's like the second cup of coffee.

550
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
You know what I'm saying?

551
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah.

552
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, also coffee.

553
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Lots and lots of coffee.

554
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
That helps.

555
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
But mostly just showers because showers are great because they also keep you clean.

556
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I also like to operate in a clean environment.

557
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That being said, I usually don't get a lot of stuff done.

558
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Bullshit, sir.

559
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
That's why I don't get anything done.

560
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
People are like, why didn't you get anything done?

561
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Because I didn't clean my room.

562
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I didn't get anything done because there's a four month old bowl of salsa sitting right next to my computer mouse.

563
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's sitting right there.

564
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Are you talking about me, sir, or are you talking about yourself?

565
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, we don't want to have this fight, do we?

566
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah, we're not doing this, guys.

567
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Kyle writes in, he says, I have a problem with taking girls, talking to girls, taking girls.

568
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
He has a problem with making them his.

569
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Making them mine.

570
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I have a problem with talking to girls that I'm interested in.

571
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I keep putting in jars and I don't know what to do about it.

572
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I have a problem with talking to girls that I'm interested in.

573
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I can never gather up enough courage to ask them out, which leads me to worry about it and develop anxiety attacks.

574
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I don't have a problem with talking to ladies in committed relationships or females that I'm not interested in.

575
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I'll help me out, please.

576
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Kyle, dude, you're psyching yourself out.

577
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You know that thing you hear where it's like once you get married, you know, that's when girls all find you attractive?

578
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's not being married.

579
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's not giving a shit.

580
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah, it's that confidence.

581
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I say you start dating girls you're not interested in.

582
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Okay.

583
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
If you have no problem with talking to them, go with that.

584
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Yeah, that's a great idea.

585
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That's a great life plan.

586
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Nothing bad could come of that.

587
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Yeah.

588
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That explains so much, Travis.

589
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Sorry, tea sack.

590
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Tea sack.

591
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That's tea sack.

592
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
That's not Travis.

593
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Let's separate.

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Kyle, as far as that goes, Justin's right.

595
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You're psyching yourself out.

596
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You're just getting yourself down, dude, and just talk to them like you're not interested in them.

597
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Go take a shower and then just caveman it up.

598
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I'm telling you.

599
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm telling you.

600
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's not a joke.

601
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If I'm at a bar and I'm too nervous to talk to a girl, I just flip the caveman switch.

602
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It's like, hey, you look nice.

603
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You buy a drink.

604
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
We dance now.

605
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
We dance now to the flamenco music.

606
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Okay.

607
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
First off, maybe you're not going to flamenco bars.

608
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That's the place to go to meet ladies.

609
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Oh, my God.

610
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
You would not believe how successful I've been strip mining at flamenco bars for ladies.

611
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Kyle, you have to tell yourself this is a mental block.

612
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The problem with this is solely on you.

613
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,000
If you start thinking to yourself, you know how it's easier for you to talk to girls in a committed relationship, right?

614
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Start telling yourself in your head that you are in a committed relationship, that no matter what you do,

615
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
you don't want to meet a girl to go out with.

616
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
You want to meet a girl to just say hi, just to talk to a girl at a bar.

617
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Because I know that thing.

618
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
When you're single, you turn to like the Terminator, right?

619
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
You got the hood, and every girl you look at is like, you know, isn't into me.

620
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I don't like her coat.

621
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
You know, you're analyzing every girl, and you just got to let that go.

622
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
It's a mental block.

623
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Let it go.

624
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Just go talk to her.

625
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
She's not always going to be wearing that coat.

626
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
She might get a new coat.

627
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
She might get a new coat.

628
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Just pretend.

629
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
A real nice seersucker.

630
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Tell yourself.

631
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Seersucker?

632
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Seersucker?

633
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
What?

634
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah, seersucker.

635
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Tell yourself you're in a committed relationship.

636
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Pretend that you're in a committed relationship, and just go for it.

637
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Because what you're trying to do is get someone who doesn't know you at all to accept you

638
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
in a few minutes.

639
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
And that's not going to get you anywhere.

640
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Just go talk to people to be talking to them.

641
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And if that doesn't help, prostitution.

642
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
A lot of law enforcement turns a blind eye these days.

643
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Hugh Grant's doing it.

644
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
He's down.

645
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What's up?

646
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Not a good enough for you?

647
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
A Hugh Grant.

648
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That was a big shot.

649
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
What?

650
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, isn't there anybody more relevant?

651
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Hasn't Charlie Sheen probably been busted for that?

652
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Yeah.

653
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I think he's done that pretty recently.

654
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Jordan from Gmail.

655
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
When is the right time to move out?

656
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
He's 20 years old now.

657
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm going to assume it's a he.

658
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
21 on the Monday this podcast comes out.

659
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Happy birthday.

660
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Happy birthday, Jordan.

661
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
You did it, Jordan.

662
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yeah.

663
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Boost it up, son.

664
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Have one on me.

665
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Boost it up.

666
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Did you say boost it up?

667
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Send that receipt to Griffin.

668
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
He will reimburse you with a perpetual check.

669
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,000
And attending college with a commute of one hour total a day to school.

670
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
That sounds miserable.

671
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
That's terrible.

672
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah.

673
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's awful, dude.

674
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Lastest podcast time, though.

675
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Loyal customer.

676
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I hope to be done with school soon, but hope to be taking a follow-up online course that

677
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
will last around 18 months.

678
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
If you can lay out some sort of timetable on when it's appropriate to depart the nest,

679
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'd be much obliged.

680
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't have much money right now, but I do live in Canada where hugs are currency.

681
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Thanks in advance, Jordan.

682
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Jordan, you're 20 years old now.

683
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm going to say the timetable is two years ago.

684
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,480
I'm not sure how you can make that happen, but if you can find some sort of...

685
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
I will say this, Jordan.

686
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,340
When living at home stops your life from developing, it's time to move out.

687
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,200
So two years ago.

688
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I do want to...

689
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay.

690
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:48,200
If you're someone who lives at home to this age to 20, maybe 21, perhaps 22, make sure

691
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:54,980
you have some money together because if you can stay there and get together a nest egg,

692
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:00,080
go do that and get together enough money that you're not going to be like dying or starving

693
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
to death.

694
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:07,120
But I know it's intimidating if you haven't done all the stuff.

695
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,560
If you haven't signed the lease and looked for the apartment and done all that garbage,

696
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:19,620
but it's really look around at you, look around at the stupid, awful people that you meet

697
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,140
every day who you still love because that's what makes the world go round.

698
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,400
But they're stupid and terrible.

699
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,760
Remember that they have done all this stuff that you are intimidated by, assuming that

700
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,760
you're intimidated by it.

701
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
And that's kind of what it is because it's not that hard.

702
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,280
Just make sure you have a steady income and specifically, though, doing the things like

703
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,640
setting up your gas and crap like that.

704
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,600
It's really not, not complicated.

705
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,940
And the nice thing is once you start doing it, it's really empowering.

706
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,780
It really does feel good to be like, I set up that electric account and it really is

707
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,400
makes you feel like an adult, a great feeling.

708
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,460
Just get out there and start trying it.

709
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,080
Also it might help if you ask friends if anybody needed a roomie to kind of ease in that way.

710
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:08,880
Who's already handling all this stuff or brothers, brothers.

711
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,360
But as far as the timetable goes, don't rush yourself because you don't want to do it when

712
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,880
you're not ready and you're not prepared and you don't have the money.

713
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,960
But you know, there's no reason to wait.

714
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,040
You're not really doing anything.

715
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
Take the leap.

716
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,040
Hey, did you ask?

717
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
Did you ask Jeffrey if you needed a roommate?

718
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,960
Jeffrey Jeffrey Jeffrey.

719
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,960
We should move in together.

720
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,360
Jeffrey, we've just met Jeffrey, but it's a one bedroom apartment, but it's awfully

721
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:34,960
spacious Jeffrey, Jeffrey, how do you feel about bunk beds, Jeffrey?

722
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,440
I've got a California king bed.

723
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,480
I promise we won't touch Jeffrey.

724
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,600
Jeffrey, will you hold me during the thunderstorms, Jeffrey, it's hailing, Jeffrey, the black

725
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,400
clouds are rolling in Jeffrey, Jeffrey, let us buy a puppy together.

726
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,400
Jeffrey Jeffrey.

727
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
We'll name him Jeffrey.

728
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,400
Jeffrey.

729
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,800
Let's go shopping at the local market.

730
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:03,200
Jeffrey to draw Jeffrey.

731
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,480
So I've got my final question loaded up on Yahoo! and it's been about 40 minutes.

732
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,320
So let's so let's tell how nice people can can get ahold of us.

733
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,880
Can I just say can we just say thank you to everybody?

734
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Thank you.

735
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,880
We've had 10,000 downloads this week, 10k downloads this week.

736
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,880
The show's blowing up.

737
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,440
Everybody loves it.

738
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
Do me a favor.

739
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,240
Listen, I'm just I'm just saying nonsense.

740
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,920
Not everybody loves it, though, because a lot of people aren't listening.

741
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,120
If you can believe that they're missing out on this.

742
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,880
How many people are on the planet right now?

743
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,880
Too many.

744
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,880
Don't keep your eyes.

745
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,720
Don't keep your eyes under a bushel.

746
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,060
Just you know what you can do?

747
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,360
You can burn it on a CD.

748
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:43,360
It's a short show.

749
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:48,460
You can burn maybe two episodes on a CD disk, have a little listening party, whatever.

750
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,460
This is great.

751
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:52,740
And then you can talk about your favorite parts and you can give each other advice.

752
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,320
That's what I want to I want to start up like I want us to start like a pay it forward style

753
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,920
like right social movement where we change like a cult, like cult cult, but do please

754
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:04,920
tell a friend.

755
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,440
Tell somebody just just right now don't think about it.

756
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440

757
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,940
Say, hey, I think you'd like this because anybody would know what if you're a fan and

767
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,960
temple you need to make you laugh.

768
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,120
What do you think the image for this episode is going to be?

769
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
I don't know.

770
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
It's going to be hard.

771
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:49,800
I think it's going to be it's going to be Jeffrey based Jeffrey centric.

You will never know me.

796
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:48,600
I was lying in bed and my mom turned out the light it was about 10 p.m. and as the light

797
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,520
was turned out I thought I heard someone speak and say oh about 30 minutes later my belly

798
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,520
felt warm.

799
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,240
I looked under the duvet and saw a little light coming from my belly button on closer

800
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,640
inspection I thought I saw something fly out and leave my duvet I pushed my belly button

801
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,980
and a bit of smoke came out.

802
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,280
What the fuck just happened.

803
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:33,360
